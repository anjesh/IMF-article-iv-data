I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After years of economic stagnation and periodic economic crises, the
government of President Nicanor Duarte Frutos took office in August 2003 and
embarked on an ambitious program of economic reforms. The staff agreed on a set of
policies to be supported by a Fund arrangement in October 2003, and the Board approved a
15-month Stand-By Arrangement on December 15, 2003. Performance under the program
thus far has been satisfactory in most areas. The first program review was concluded on
April 12, 2004. For the second review, 9 of 11 end-March quantitative performance criteria
were observed, including all monetary and fiscal deficit targets (Table 1). Missed PCs
included the wage bill ceiling and one missed target on arrears. The Fiscal Adjustment Law
(PC for end-May) was approved in a weakened version on June 25; the authorities have
committed to a set of compensatory measures to compensate for the reduced revenue yield of
the law.
2.
At the time of the last Article IV consultation on March 10, 2003, Directors
recommended the adoption of a comprehensive program of fiscal and structural
reforms in order to set Paraguay on a path of sustainable growth. They suggested that
the strategy should center on restoring fiscal sustainability, improving the efficiency of the
public sector, strengthening the banking sector, and improving governance and fighting
corruption. Specifically, they urged the authorities to adopt a comprehensive and balanced
fiscal package, including measures to increase tax revenues as well as appropriate spending
restraint, and efforts to correct financial problems in certain public enterprisers. Directors
also emphasized the need to reform the public employees’ pension plan. Directors noted that
monetary policy had responded pragmatically to the difficulties faced in 2002, but they urged
the authorities to strengthen the operational framework of monetary policy, to establish a
clear nominal anchor and increase the central bank’s operational independence. Directors
encouraged the authorities to monitor the situation of banks closely and to take a proactive
stance in response to any difficulties. In particular, Directors expressed concern about the
precarious financial situation of the National Development Bank (BNF). They urged the
authorities to implement without further delay a comprehensive restructuring and reform of
the bank, along the lines of the program designed last year with the support of the IDB.
II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The Paraguayan economy is only beginning to emerge from a long period of
slow growth. Over the two decades to 2002, per capita income fell by an average of
0.6 percent per year (Tables 2 and 3). This stagnation reflected weak macroeconomic
management and a series of structural problems, which impeded growth and left the country
more vulnerable to the effects of economic shocks. The main structural problems include:
•
Political instability. During the 1990s, the political system was rocked by a coup
attempt, the assassination of a vice-president, the resignation of a president, and a subsequent

-5-

period of government by an interim President, González Macchi, who was not popularly
elected.
•
Serious governance problems. Corruption, inefficiency, poor guarantees of property
rights, and lack of transparency have afflicted both the public and private sectors. Paraguay
has consistently ranked among the worst in the world in surveys of perception of corruption
(See Box 1).
•
A weak banking system plagued by a series of crises. Bank closures affected the
financial sector in several rounds from 1995 to 2003, reducing the total number of banks
from 35 to 14.
•
Inefficient public enterprises in key sectors. Government firms are a strong
presence in the water, electricity, transport, telecommunications, petroleum, cement, and
banking sectors. Many are poorly run and their performance has depressed growth in the rest
of the economy.
•
Low and falling productivity. Poor human capital formation, inefficient public
services, and governance problems have contributed to the deterioration.
•
High poverty and unemployment with limited social protection. Income
inequality is high, and nearly half the population lives on less than US$2 per day. Social
spending per capita is one-fourth of the Latin American average.
4.
A sharp recession in 2002 was followed by a tentative recovery in 2003. The
regional crisis, problems with drought and foot-and-mouth disease in agriculture, and a
banking crisis, all contributed to a drop of 2.3 percent in GDP in 2002 (Tables 2 and 3).
There was a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and inflation accelerated,
reaching 20 percent in early 2003. A bumper harvest produced positive GDP growth of an
estimated 2.6 percent in 2003. The easing of the regional crisis and the clear victory of
Nicanor Duarte Frutos in the April 2003 presidential elections provided an increased
perception of economic and political stability later in the year. Banking system deposits
recovered, the exchange rate appreciated against the dollar, and inflation eased to 9 percent at
year-end. The nonagricultural economy remained stagnant, however.
5.
In 2004, the economy has stabilized but growth remains modest (Figures 1 and
2). A late season drought depressed output of soy, the largest export crop, reducing expected
agricultural output growth to near zero. Nonagricultural output is recovering, producing a
forecast GDP growth for 2004 slightly above 2 percent. The guaraní has strengthened by
4 percent against the dollar so far in 2004, despite strong Central Bank purchases of foreign
exchange. The strong guaraní contributed to a sharp fall in inflation. Year-on-year inflation
through June was 5.5 percent, with inflation for the year as a whole expected at 4–5 percent.
6.
The political environment for reform has improved, but important challenges
remain. President Duarte Frutos has demonstrated an ability to advance important political

-6-

and economic reforms, despite not having a majority in the Senate.1 He has appointed
reform-minded people to key positions in the government and retains a high degree of
support in public opinion polls. However, the government’s support in Congress is fragile,
with opposition parties often inclined to oppose government initiatives for political reasons,
and increasing resistance from special interests whose privileges are affected by reform
measures. There is also pressure from within the president’s own Colorado party from
factions, which have traditionally benefited from patronage and rent-seeking behaviors.
Reform efforts must also confront long-standing and pervasive governance problems that
seriously affect the efficiency of the public sector and generally act to undermine change (see
Box 1).
7.
The fiscal situation has improved markedly since the new government took
office in August 2003. The consolidated balance of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS)
moved from a deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to balance in 2003 (Table 4). The
primary balance improved from a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2002 to a surplus of
2.4 percent in 2003. The main features of the improvement in 2003 were:
•
Expenditures were tightly controlled throughout the year in the central
government. Current spending in the central government fell from 15 percent of GDP to
13½ percent of GDP (Table 5). A wage freeze for public sector employees and pensioners
was the biggest factor, but control of goods and services spending and lower interest rates on
public debt also contributed. Capital spending fell slightly in nominal terms in 2003, in part
as the result of financing constraints on investment projects.
•
Tax collections increased sharply beginning in August 2003 due to changes in tax
and customs administrations. In the period August–December, tax collection increased by
over 40 percent on 2002, compared to an increase of only 14½ percent during the first seven
months of the year. For the year as a whole, tax revenues rose from 9 percent of GDP to
10 percent.
•
The outturn of public enterprises improved. The operating surplus of the enterprises
rose from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2003, due mainly to the effect
of an appreciating exchange rate on dollar costs in key enterprises. Results are expected to
improve further as the guaraní remains strong and management changes have been made in
some of the more problematic firms (Table 6).
8.
For 2004, the public finances are expected to improve further. The central
government will run a slight surplus. The early approval of the Public Pension Reform Law
1

Among the most important economic reforms implemented by the Duarte Frutos government so far are:
passage of a bank resolution law, a reform of the public sector pension system, the passage of the Fiscal
Adjustment law, full implementation of the public procurement law, and the approval of a new customs code.

-7-

(the caja fiscal) is expected to generate savings on the order of ½ percent of GDP in transfer
payments. Continued low international interest rates and the normalization for external
payments arrears will cause interest payments to fall slightly compared to 2003. Most
importantly, the continued strong performance of revenue collections in the first half of the
year suggests that tax revenues as a share of GDP will reach a historical high of near
12 percent of GDP. For the consolidated public sector, the surplus is expected to be around
1.5 percent of GDP, due to further improvements in the outturn of the public enterprises, as
well as an improvement in the social security institute (IPS).
9.
The authorities have made significant progress in clearing substantial public
sector payments arrears (Tables 7 and 8). From a stock of over US$250 million
(4½ percent of GDP) at end-2002, arrears were reduced to US$185 million in 2003
(3 percent of GDP) and have fallen further to US$128 million by April 2004. Arrears to the
World Bank and IDB were cleared in late 2003. The government obtained a short-term loan
from the Central Bank in early 2004 to clear arrears to Paris Club countries ahead of the
schedule contemplated in the program.2 Of remaining external arrears, the largest
components are those of the state-owned oil firm Petropar with its fuel suppliers.
10.
Domestic arrears have been lowered to a level comfortably below the end-March
program target, and stricter conditions for ministries to stay within budget allocations
should help maintain this margin. In November 2003, an agreement was reached with
holders of domestic bonds in default since December 2002 to exchange those bonds for new
ones with extended maturities and a slight NPV reduction. A Law passed in December
determined that the government would honor interest payments after December 26 according
to the new terms and dates. There have been delays in completing the technical exchange
itself, leading to the accumulation of interest arrears on the new bonds.3 However, all old
bonds that have been submitted by June 15 will be exchanged into new bonds (about
80 percent of the eligible amount), and all overdue interest on these new bonds will be paid
(prior action for the review).

2

There are several disputed claims remaining, which the government is making good faith efforts to resolve,
including US$40 million in disputed arrears from a contract with customs verification companies SGS and
Bivac, US$16½ million in dispute with the Belgian Office du Ducroire for the construction of an ammunitions
factory in the 1980s, and a debt of the electricity company ANDE with the German KFW for which legal
authorization to pay is being sought from Congress.

3

The protracted verification process led to delayed interest payments both on old and new bonds, and raised
some technical definitional issues on domestic floating debt. Consequently, the staff opted to widen the
definition of the floating debt for the purposes of the program, going forward beyond the authorities’ internal
definition. Had the broader definition been applied retroactively to the end-March PC on domestic arrears, the
target would have still been met.

-8-

11.
After climbing to near 50 percent of GDP in 2002 and 2003, the public sector
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to drop sharply to 43 percent in 2004. The drop is due to
the expected fiscal surplus, plus a rise in U.S. dollar GDP (due to economic growth and
currency appreciation against the dollar). About 90 percent of the debt is external, half of
which is owed to international financial institutions and one-quarter to Taiwan, Province of
China. Debt service remains relatively low (external debt service was 4.5 percent of GDP in
2003), because Paraguayan debt is mostly long term and at concessional interest rates.
12.
Monetary policy has been geared toward a flexible exchange rate regime since
the de facto currency peg was abandoned in 2001 (Figure 3). Nevertheless, the Central
Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has maintained a strong presence in the foreign exchange market,
accumulating and selling reserves to resist sharp movements in the guaraní. The BCP has
limited the growth of the domestic money supply mainly through sales of the bank’s Letras
de Regulación Monetaria (LRMs), the stock of which has grown sharply over the past 3
years, from G/. 300 billion at end-2001 to around G/. 1.6 trillion in mid-2004 (Tables 9 and
10). Interest rates on LRMs have declined from their peak of 33 percent in August 2002,
reaching 9½ percent by April 2004. However, the real interest rate has actually risen on
LRMs since mid-2003, as inflation has fallen more rapidly than the interest rate. Base money
growth accelerated sharply in 2003, as the economy began to remonetize after the banking
crises. Base money rose by 58 percent in 2003, but the growth rate has since fallen to below
25 percent, but base money as a share of GDP remains reasonable by historical standards.
The appreciation of the guaraní in 2003 also contributed to a greater willingness of agents to
hold local currency, and as a result, some de-dollarization occurred (from 69 percent of
deposits at end-2002 to 64 percent in mid-2004).
13.
The financial system has improved, but weaknesses persist (Figure 4). In 2003,
deposits largely recovered from the sharp drop in the 2002 banking crisis, and they have
continued to rise so far this year. Credit to the private sector, in contrast, has continued to
fall, down by 4 percent in May 2004. Higher deposits and falling credit has left banks in a
highly liquid position. Much of this excess liquidity have been deposited in the Central Bank,
contributing to the decline in the growth rate of base money. Nonperforming loan (NPL)
ratios have begun to decline, although—at 13 percent for private banks—they remain high
while provisioning requirements are still low (Table 11). Profitability of the banking system
remains low, with several banks continuing to produce losses. Several banks have also closed
or reduced significantly their operations in Paraguay over the past two years. Other risks
include problems in some small finance companies (financieras)4 and potential difficulties in
the unregulated and largely unmeasured cooperative sector (which may constitute 20 percent
of the financial system). (Box 2).

4

The Superintendency of Banks closed two small financieras so far this year.

-9-

14.
The risks in the National Development Bank (BNF) have eased somewhat due
to a recapitalization in 2003 and new management, but concerns of its long-term
viability remain. The bank—with 8 percent of system assets—has continued to suffer from
high administrative costs and a large stock of NPLs (58 percent of total loans). To implement
a permanent solution for the BNF, the government submitted to Congress a public bank
reform law expected to be approved by end-October 2004 (a PC under the SBA). The plan,
prepared with the assistance of the IDB, contemplates consolidation of the BNF with other
(small) public banks, and restructuring it to become a second-tier investment bank.
15.
Exports boomed in 2003 and are expected to increase further in 2004
(Table 12). The good soy harvest and a rebound in the regional economy contributed to the
increase in 2003. For 2004, the volume of soy exports are expected to decline due to the
drought, but this is expected to be offset by continued buoyancy in international soy prices.
Other agricultural product exports are expected to increase. Imports rose in 2003, although
by less than exports, generating a second year of current account surplus.5 For 2004, the
current account is expected to be in slight surplus. The capital account is also expected to be
in surplus, generating a large increase in international reserves for the year.
16.
During 2003, the guaraní appreciated by 13 percent against the dollar. The
general decline of the dollar in the world left the appreciation of the guaraní in real effective
terms at 9.5 percent. In the first half of 2004, the currency appreciated somewhat further,
despite central bank intervention. However, after the depreciation experienced by the
economy in 2001 and 2002, the guaraní does not appear overappreciated in real terms when
the fundamentals of the economy are taken into account (see Box 2, Figure 2).
17.
Despite some uneven progress, Paraguay will not meet important Millennium
Development Goals unless decisive action is promptly taken (Box 3, Table 13). Progress
has been particularly slow on the goals of eradicating extreme poverty, reducing child
mortality and improving maternal health.6 The goal of achieving environmental sustainability
is also unlikely to be met, with the country lagging behind on the provision of sanitation,
especially in rural areas. Conversely, important advances have been made toward the goals of
achieving universal primary education and gender equality and in combating major diseases.

5

It should be noted that unregistered trade represents about one-third of total trade, so balance of payments
statistics cannot give a precise indication of external sector trends.

6

In spite of slow progress on these fronts, both the World Bank and the UNDP still assess that the target of
halving hunger is still within reach.

- 10 -

III. OUTLOOK AND VULNERABILITIES
18.
Paraguay’s economic outlook has improved markedly. The new government
has applied responsible fiscal and monetary policies, resulting in a sharp improvement in the
public finances and the progressive normalization of payments arrears. Inflation has fallen
from over 20 percent to around 3–5 percent, and the exchange rate has appreciated modestly.
While climatic conditions will adversely affect agricultural GDP growth in 2004, the
underlying growth of the nonagricultural economy has improved. The initiation of a process
of comprehensive structural reform bodes well for growth prospects over the medium term.
The regional economic environment has also improved, with favorable conditions in
Argentina and Brazil likely to contribute to Paraguayan growth rather than detract from it, as
occurred in 2002.
19.
Despite major improvements, vulnerabilities remain in the macroeconomic
outlook. In particular:
•

Further problems in the region could affect trade, worker remittances from Argentina,
and capital flows. A sharp rise in world interest rates might also place pressure on the
exchange rate.

•

Though the banking system is more liquid, high dollarization (over 60 percent of
lending) will expose banks to credit risk in the event of a sharp depreciation.
Persistent credit stagnation could also hamper medium-term growth prospects The
system is also vulnerable to continued high NPL ratios, and to the persistent weakness
of the BNF.

•

Policy slippages by the authorities in fiscal or monetary policies could undo the
stability achieved over the past year, leading to renewed problems with arrears,
inflation, and depreciation.

•

Sensitivity analysis (Appendix I) of the medium-term outlook shows that low fiscal
primary surpluses and exchange rate depreciation could have adverse effects on debt
sustainability, while the scenario is less sensitive to variations in the interest rate.

20.
The medium-term outlook depends crucially on continued prudent macro
policies and further structural reforms to boost medium-term growth to a rate
consistent with higher per capita income growth. Appendix I and Table 14 present two
scenarios. The main points are:
•

The baseline scenario assumes continued prudent macroeconomic policies, but does
not assume deeper structural reforms in the medium term (Tables 15–17). Under this
scenario, growth reaches around 3–3½ percent, and inflation remains in the 4–
6 percent range. The fiscal adjustment already undertaken assures fiscal
sustainability, with the public accounts remaining near balance and the debt-to-GDP
ratio declining to around 25 percent of GDP by 2010. Growth of 3–3½ percent, while

- 11 -

better than that of the last two decades, will allow for only limited growth in per
capita income, suggesting that higher growth rates should be targeted.
•

Under the adjustment scenario, we assume that, in addition to prudent
macroeconomic policies, far-reaching structural reforms are undertaken. These would
include inter alia: privatization or capitalization of the public enterprises, social
security system reforms, legal reforms to further reduce corruption and informality,
education and health programs to improve the quality of human capital, and increased
infrastructure investment. Under this scenario, growth would increase to around
4½ percent in the medium term, producing a larger increase in per capita income and
a significant reduction in poverty.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

21.
Discussions with the authorities were focused on reviewing performance
under the SBA, assessing fiscal and monetary policies, the advances in the
government’s structural reform agenda, and prospects for boosting economic growth.
The fiscal outturn, the reduction in inflation and increased central bank international reserves
have exceeded program expectations. Important structural reforms have been approved in the
face of significant opposition. However, the authorities expressed concern that economic
growth was insufficient to generate an increase in per capita income, and worried about the
adverse effect continued low growth might have on sustaining political support for the
reform process.
A. Fiscal Policy
22.
Tax revenue has risen by 42 percent in the first five months of 2004, well
ahead of program projections. With nominal GDP growing on the order of 7 percent, and
taxes largely unchanged,7 the vast bulk of the increase is due to improved collection
efficiency. Revenue from trade taxes is up by 46 percent, while VAT has increased by
42 percent, and corporate income tax revenue rose by 40 percent. Fuel tax revenues have
risen by only 29 percent, as some excise tax revenues collected by the state oil firm Petropar
have not been transferred to the government due to its financial difficulties (see ¶23). Nontax
revenue has grown less than tax revenue. Social security contributions from public
employees have increased sharply with the implementation of the reform of the caja fiscal,
but royalties from the Itaipú hydroelectric consortium were somewhat lower due to a 2004
payment that was advanced into 2003, and the effect of currency appreciation, which lowered
the guaraní value of this dollar-denominated income.

7

There was a small increase in the fuel tax rate in January 2004.

- 12 -

23.
The authorities noted that central government current expenditures in the
first five months of 2004 were roughly as agreed in the SBA, but political pressure is
building for increases. Wages and salaries are slightly above program (leading to nonobservance of the end-March PC), as the result of a wage increase granted by Congress for
the security services. Interest expenditures, in contrast, are below program, due to continued
low interest rates and early clearance of payments arrears. Capital spending has been above
program in the first half of 2004, and the authorities indicated their intention to boost it
further via a supplementary budget appropriation. The staff agreed that additional capital
spending would be appropriate as long as the cost is covered by revenue overperformance,
but cautioned that such spending be done efficiently, preferably by focusing it exclusively on
projects financed by multilateral institutions. The staff also urged the authorities to resist
political pressure to boost current spending in an attempt to artificially boost 2004 economic
growth.
24.
Performance in the rest of the public sector has also exceeded the program
projections, but there are problems in some public enterprises. Social security revenues
are above forecasts due to the stronger economy, while expenditures remain under control.
The financial performance of most public enterprises is also above forecasts. The continued
strength of the guaraní has aided firms whose costs are largely in dollars (the electricity,
water, and oil companies). However, significant cash-flow problems exist in the oil company
Petropar and in the water company ESSAP, impairing their ability to service their debts and
pay down arrears. Both Petropar and cement company INC accrued new external arrears in
2004 (leading to nonobservance of the continuous PC on no new external arrears); however,
INC’s accrual was due to a technical problem with its congressionally-approved budget
rather than to cash flow problems at the company. Petropar has also been adversely affected
by higher world oil prices. The authorities noted that they have taken steps to address these
difficulties. Management was changed in both Petropar and INC in February 2004, working
under an inter-ministerial supervision committee. Plans are advancing for a deeper
restructuring of the two institutions (with advice from the World Bank on Petropar). Diesel
prices were raised by 8 percent in April, ahead of the July date for a price adjustment agreed
in the program.8 This increase fully compensated for cost increases in Petropar at April world
oil prices, though the staff cautioned that it may fall short of what is needed to allow the firm
to eliminate payments arrears to suppliers and to the tax authorities. Moreover, continued
high world oil prices may require further measures later in the year. The government agreed
to assume some multilateral and bilateral debt service payments for water company ESSAP,

8

Under the program, fuel and utilities prices must be adjusted semi-annually at least to compensate fully for the
effects of changes in input prices and exchange rate variations on costs. As the exchange rate appreciation
reduced dollar costs for electricity and water, no price adjustment was required.

to assure timely payment of external obligations. The staff urged the authorities to move
quickly on developing a comprehensive strategy for reforming the public enterprises.9
25.
On June 25, Congress approved the Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal
Adjustment Law, a performance criterion under the SBA, and a crucial piece of legislation
for assuring the continuity of responsible fiscal policy. While certain aspects of the law are
weaker than originally envisaged in the version sent to the Congress, it still constitutes a
major improvement in the tax code. The potential revenue yield of the law (if all tax were
placed at their legal maxima) has been reduced from 2½ percent of GDP to 1½ percent of
GDP, but the actual expected yield (based on the authorities’ intended tax rates) will be near
original estimates.10 The law eliminates most exemptions to the corporate income tax while
reducing the rate, broadens the base of the VAT, institutes a new personal income tax (to be
phased in over time), and institutes a new agricultural income tax to replace the previous
IMAGRO tax. It also adjusts some excise tax rates, and strengthens legal authority for tax
administration. The details of the law, as well as calculations of its yield, are found in Box 4
and Table 16.
26.
The authorities agreed to a series of compensatory measures to further boost
revenues and strengthen tax administration in areas where the Fiscal Adjustment Law
was modified. On tax administration, the government will reprogram budget allocations and
is using an IDB technical assistance loan to increase funding for the tax authorities in 2004
(prior action) and will submit to Congress a sharply higher budget request for 2005 to
compensate for the loss of the 3.5 percent earmarking contemplating in the original draft law.
The Undersecretariat for Taxation has launched a strategic plan, which will increase
computerization, restructure the organization, and boost training for staff. Additional
revenues will be raised from an increase in excise taxes on tobacco and cigarettes to their
legal maxima. Further gains in revenue from tax administration will be realized by the full
application of a cross-checking system for large taxpayers and an acceleration of
enforcement actions. The government is prepared to use its legal authority to begin the
reduction in corporate income tax in 2006 (rather than 2005) while starting the reduction in
exemptions immediately. Together, these measures should boost annual revenue in 2005–06
by over ½ percent of GDP. Finally, the government is committed to preparing legislation to
address remaining weaknesses in the Fiscal Adjustment Law for submission to Congress in
2005.

9

Presentation of a plan is a SB for end-December under the program.

10

The authorities originally hoped to apply rates to yield 1.5 percent of GDP. Under the final version, they
expect 1.3 percent of GDP. While the original draft law envisaged higher maximum rates on most excise taxes
and on a financial transactions tax than the final version, the authorities had never planned to move all rates to
those levels.

- 14 -

27.
The authorities have made great strides in normalizing relations with creditors
and paying off arrears, but continued efforts are needed (Tables 7–8). By early April, the
government had cleared nearly all bilateral arrears, well ahead of the schedule contemplated
in the program. This allowed them to overperform on the end-March program ceiling on
official external arrears and also allowed them to meet the ceiling on total arrears despite a
sharp increase in Petropar arrears to suppliers. Nevertheless, small arrears needed to be
cleared with certain official creditors (e.g. Banque Worms). Their clearance is a prior action
for the review. The authorities are making efforts to resolve disputed arrears with Belgium
and Germany (KFW). The staff noted that the enhanced monitoring procedures set up by the
authorities to improve debt payments were bearing fruit, but additional efforts were needed.
Regarding the domestic bond exchange, interest due under the terms of the offer on the bonds
not yet submitted for exchange will be held in escrow in the Central Bank. The program
ceiling on domestic debt for end-March was observed with a margin.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
28.
The staff noted that monetary policy management has improved in 2003–04. As
of August 2003, the new government stopped using the threat of moving government
deposits as a tool to manipulate the exchange rate independently of the Central Bank. The
Ministry of Finance also signed a memorandum of understanding granting the Central Bank
greater operational autonomy. The Central bank authorities have taken advantage of upward
pressures on the guaraní to accumulate reserves well in excess of the original program
targets. Reserves are now expected to be near US$1.1 billion at end-2004, compared to
US$850 million in the original program. The appreciation of the guaraní also helped bring
inflation below original projections. The authorities have used open market operations to
sterilize the additional reserves accumulation, overperforming on the NDA program target by
a similar margin and leaving the growth rate of currency issue in line with the program. Text
Table A summarizes key monetary policy variables. Notwithstanding these positive
developments, the staff noted that the Central Bank appears to continue to pursue multiple
policy objectives—exchange rate, inflation, and quantitative monetary aggregates—shifting
from one to another in an ad hoc way that may cause problems in future monetary policy
management. Staff also observed that, despite falling interest rates on CB monetary notes, the
quasi-fiscal costs of continued sterilized purchases of foreign exchange could become an
issue.

1/ Effective reserve rate is the average of actual reserves required over total deposits.

29.
Interest rates have fallen over the past year, but have risen in real terms. The
average rate on LRMs in April was 9½ percent—higher in real terms than in mid-2003.
Given low inflation and the large stock of excess reserves deposited at the Central Bank at
zero interest, the staff suggested that there may be scope for an additional decline in rates.
The authorities agreed, but noted that they wished to preserve relatively long maturities for
LRMs even at the cost of higher interest rates, as a way of insulating monetary policy against
sharp movements in excess banking sector deposits in the central bank.
30.
The staff urged the authorities to continue preparations for inflation targeting
and to allow for a freely floating exchange rate. The additional accumulation of Central
Bank reserves experienced in recent months is a welcome cushion against future economic
shocks in this open, highly dollarized economy. However, there are limits to the BCP’s
ability to continue to accumulate reserves (while sterilizing the impact on the money supply)
without putting pressure on other program objectives. In particular, in the staff’s view the
guaraní should be allowed to appreciate if capital inflows continue or depreciate should
capital flows reverse. The authorities acknowledged the advantages the flexible exchange
rate regime had given Paraguay since the peg was abandoned in 2001, and they reaffirmed
their commitment to inflation targeting, but they argued that greater involvement in
dampening exchange rate fluctuations is needed in order to stabilize prices and economic
activity.
31.
The Central Bank is preparing to overhaul its structure in order to operate more
efficiently and effectively. The restructuring plan will build on advice from an MFD mission
early in 2004, as well as advice from private consultants. The plan will outline the strategy
for moving to inflation targeting in the medium-term. The reform is expected to reduce the
overall size of the bank, while increasing staff resources dedicated to economic studies and
banking supervision. The staff agreed with this strategy, but noted that eventually new
legislation to give the Central Bank greater formal independence would be in order. The
Central Bank completed its annual external audit and is reporting its results in both Paraguay
and international accounting standards (SB).

- 16 -

C. Financial Sector
32.
The recent improvement in the banking system must be continued if financial
sector stability is to be sustained. The Bank superintendency has made progress in applying
new supervisory requirements (Resolución 8) and implementation of the new bank resolution
law has begun, with the deposit guarantee fund scheduled to begin operating soon. The
superintendency has also initiated work on applying a requirement for international risk
classifications for banks (a SB for end-December). Some progress has been made in
improving management and containing losses in the BNF, but more in-depth restructuring is
needed. In this context, the staff observed that approval of the new public banking law (now
a PC for end-October 2004) will be crucial. The authorities agreed, but noted that there will
be strong political opposition, particularly from interest groups favored by the current,
inefficient public banks. The staff also stressed the importance of extending regulatory
supervision to the large and growing cooperative sector to forestall any financial instability
coming from that sector (a PC for January 2005). The authorities noted that the cooperative
institute, INCOOP, is legally obliged to begin supervision, but lacks an appropriate
regulatory framework and supervisory skills. Efforts to remedy these lacunae are underway,
but legal changes to grant regulatory and supervisory responsibility to the Central Bank are
also being contemplated. Comprehensive banking system legislation is envisaged for late
2004 under the SBA and is supported by a forthcoming World Bank FSAL. The authorities
have welcomed plans to undertake an FSAP.
D. Other Structural Reforms
33.
Customs reform. A new Customs code (now an SB for end-July) was approved by
Congress on June 30, 2004. The code grants operational and financial autonomy to customs
and greatly expand its powers of investigation and enforcement. The authorities are also
receiving technical assistance from the IDB, the French government, and from an FAD
resident advisor to implement the new law and a reform agenda that includes modernizing
customs procedures and operations, improving control over goods and revenue collection,
and addressing key human resource issues.
34.
Social security reform. The authorities reported that new management installed in
recent months in the IPS has begun to attack the deep problems in that institution. An
external audit is underway, and procedures for handling the IPS’s financial assets are being
reformed. Nevertheless, the authorities recognized that comprehensive social security reform
will be needed, and they are committed to tackling the problem over the medium-term.
35.
Civil service reform. The government has begun to develop a reform plan for the
civil service. A census of employees has been conducted to detect phantom workers and
those collecting double salaries. The Ministry of Finance is serving as a pilot Ministry for
future restructuring, with support from the World Bank.
36.
Governance. The authorities indicated progress has been made on a number of
measures to improve transparency and governance in Paraguay. The passage of the Fiscal

- 17 -

Adjustment Law, with its elimination of tax loopholes and strengthened tax administration,
will reduce corruption in the tax system. The approval to the new customs code should
reduce corruption associated with international trade and smuggling. In addition, the
following efforts are underway to improve transparency:
•

Independent audits of numerous public entities are underway. Most are should be
completed by end-September (as originally envisaged) although some may require
until year-end.

•

The procurement reform approved by Congress in 2002 is fully functioning for all
public sector agencies. Purchases must be made through a public web-based bidding
process. Some entities are already reporting significant savings in procurement costs.

•

Data publication of all public sector operations has already improved notably,
although further progress is needed, particularly in Petropar.
E. Other Issues

37.
Trade policy. Paraguay’s economy remains relatively open and the authorities
reaffirmed their continued commitment to free international trade.11 In March, all of
Paraguay’s temporary import surcharges on imports from Mercosur partners expired, which
had been imposed in mid-2001 to compensate for extraordinary measures adopted by other
Mercosur partners. In December 2003, Mercosur approved several “asymmetry” decisions to
give Paraguay special treatment within the trading bloc, including an extension of the
deadline to harmonize tariffs with the Common External Tariff to 2010,12 an extension of the
exemptions for Paraguay’s duty-free zones until 2014, beneficial “rules of origin” treatment
for Paraguay’s imports of intermediate goods used in exports, and the establishment of
structural funds to channel assistance to less developed regions. The government is making
progress in preparations to implement the decisions, which have still to be ratified by each
Mercosur member. Paraguay’s exchange system is free of restrictions.
38.
Poverty and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The staff observed that
achieving the MDGs will require far-reaching actions. The new government has sought to
protect social spending in executing the 2004 budget, with execution of social spending
during the first few months of 2004 reaching about 90 percent compared to 60 percent for
other spending. However, achieving the MDGs will require substantial investment in

11

Paraguay’s trade regime is considered moderately restrictive under the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness
and its exchange system is free of restrictions.

12

These exemptions cover three areas: (i) 549 goods chosen by the Paraguayan government, (ii) capital goods,
computers and telecommunications; and (iii) intermediate goods.

- 18 -

addition to what is currently spent on social policies.13 This, in turn, will require strong
political and social consensus—not always available in the past—on key areas, which
include creating a comprehensive social safety net, expanding coverage of basic social
services and social security, and investing in infrastructure (especially in rural areas).
Rationalizing the long-term social strategy will also be critical to advance toward the MDGs.
With the assistance of multilateral institutions, the government has been developing a
National Poverty Reduction Strategy, but little progress has been made in implementing it.
39.
Statistical issues. The staff considers data provision by the authorities as adequate for
surveillance purposes, although important deficiencies remain. The national accounts are
based on an outdated conceptual framework and use an outdated base year (1982) for
constant prices.14 Quarterly national accounts are not produced until after each year has
concluded, rather than on an ongoing basis. The timeliness and the quality of the fiscal data
need to improve, in particular for the rest of the public sector and the social security institute,
though substantial improvement have been made in 2004. There are problems in the
classification and the Paraguayan GFS is not fully consistent with the methodology of the
IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal
data reported by the monetary and fiscal authorities. On the external side, the data on private
capital outflows are weak, and additional efforts need to be made in capturing unregistered
trade.
F. Program Issues
40.
Nine of eleven end-March quantitative PCs were observed (Table 1). The wage
bill ceiling was not observed by a small margin. The ceiling on external sector arrears and the
sub-target on bilateral arrears were observed, as was the ceiling on domestic floating debt
and the ceilings on new indebtedness. However, the continuous PC on no new external
arrears was missed when cement company INC accumulated new arrears, and Petropar’s
arrears to suppliers increased (although there were no new Central Government arrears).
These have since been cleared (prior action). A supplementary budget for INC will be
approved to ensure that no further arrears are accrued. The increased in diesel tariffs will
enable Petropar to reduce arrears. The authorities will also submit to Congress a bill to
approve payment of the ANDE debts to KFW (prior action). The authorities have requested
waivers on the two missed quantitative PCs. In addition, the authorities are requesting a
waiver for the Fiscal Adjustment Law, which was approved beyond the end-May PC
deadline, and without all of the components originally contemplated. The July 1 performance
criterion on adjustment of utility prices was met (see discussion in ¶23 above).

13

The UNDP estimates that the average annual additional investment between 2004 and 2015 that would be
needed to meet the MDGs amounts to US$160 million—about 2.4 percent of GDP in 2004.

14

Efforts are underway to convert to a base of 1994.

- 19 -

41.
New quantitative performance criteria are proposed (see the SMEFP and TMU).
New PCs are proposed for the NDA and NIR targets for end-August and end-December.15
PCs on arrears, and debt were also agreed for end-August and end-December consistent with
the original program.16 For the fiscal targets, PCs on the consolidated public sector balances
were set for end-August and end-December consistent with those of the original program.17
For the central government target, an end-August PC was agreed in line with the original
program, but the end-December PC will be agreed on at the time of the third review. In the
meantime, the existing indicative targets for end-June, end-September, and end-December
will remain. It is proposed that the wage bill ceiling for end-August be relaxed by G/.40
billion and by G/.80 billion for end-December to allow for the additional security service
wages and for a small salary increase granted teachers to resolve a strike in June. In addition,
several changes have been made to definitions in the TMU (see footnotes 15–17)
42.
Some structural conditionality will be rephased. It is proposed that the PC on
approval of the public banking law be moved from end-July to end-October, to take into
account legislative delays. The SB on approval of the new Customs code, in contrast, was
already completed. The PC on audits for some public entities will be moved to endDecember, while it would remain at end-October for the remainder.
43.
It is proposed that the third review be delayed, and be conducted on the basis of endAugust PCs, rather than the intended end-June PCs as originally envisaged. The fourth and
fifth reviews of the program would be combined and are expected to be evaluated on the
basis of end-December PCs with access rephased accordingly (see Table 17).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Paraguay’s economy has made strong progress over the past 12 months. After
the sharp recession and banking crisis suffered in 2002, growth returned in 2003 due to a
good agricultural year. In 2003, while the agricultural economy has weakened for climatic
reasons, the nonagricultural economy has begun to recover. Inflation, which reached
20 percent in early 2003, has fallen to 5.5 percent and will likely fall to the 4–5 percent range
for the remainder of 2004. Vulnerability to future external shocks has been reduced
significantly, as the authorities have moved to shore up international reserves, clear external
payments difficulties, and begun important fiscal and structural reforms.
15

An adjuster was introduced on the NIR and NDA targets to account fully for the possible disbursements of
the financial sector loans from the World Bank and IDB for US$40 million in 2004.

16

The definition of the domestic arrears target has been expanded and clarified in the revised TMU, as a result
of discussions with the authorities on the status of disputed claims and the domestic bond swap. The definition
of the continuous PC on no new external arrears has been modified to exclude arrears of Petropar to external
suppliers because of monitoring constraints.

17

A minor revision to the definition of the registry float was also made to enhance monitorability.

- 20 -

45.
The fiscal outlook has improved markedly and it will be important to further
institutionalize this progress. The progress achieved by the authorities in raising the
efficiency of tax and customs collections under the new government has been outstanding.
Tax revenues for 2004 will likely exceed 12 percent of GDP, compared with only 9 percent
of GDP in 2002, with very little of that jump coming from new taxes. It is crucial, however,
that the authorities take definitive action to institutionalize these gains by restructuring the
tax and customs authorities. They require higher and more secure sources of financing, and
as well as new staff, training, procedures, and increased computerization. If this is not done,
the gains obtained over the past year could easily slip once the current heads of these units
leave.
46.
The authorities have maintained tight control of expenditures in 2003 and 2004,
but continued vigilance is needed. Political pressure for spending increases is mounting in
the face of improved revenue performance and weak economic growth. While the staff
believes that there is room for some increase in capital and social spending, it cautions that
the fundamental restrictions on growth in Paraguay are structural rather than demand-side, so
increased spending to stoke demand would likely endanger fiscal stability with very little
sustainable increase in growth. Over the medium-term, the authorities should follow up on
their success in reducing expenditures on public pensions (through the Public Pension Law)
by undertaking a full-fledged public expenditure reform, including civil service reform.
47.
To help secure fiscal sustainability, the government obtained approval of the
Fiscal Adjustment Law. While legislation in its final version is weaker than that sent to
Congress, it still raises important new revenue, significantly broadens the tax base for VAT
and the income tax, and strengths tax administration. The law, together with the
compensatory measures accepted by the authorities, should provide a sound basis for
balanced budgets in the medium-term, and may well provide sufficient resources for a muchneeded increase in capital investment and social spending.
48.
Progress has been made in eliminating domestic and external payments arrears.
The only official external arrears outstanding are on disputed claims, and resolution of these
issues is advancing. Monitoring of obligations has improved notably in recent months, and
the latest arrears accrual was due more to atypical circumstances than to financial or cash
management difficulties. Nonetheless, the authorities still face challenges in this area, as
evidenced by the need for waivers on some arrears targets in both reviews of the program
thus far. Further action is needed to assure that remaining arrears will be completely
eliminated. The benefits of normalized payments, in terms of lower country risk, lower
interest rates, and increased investment, will only be obtained if the authorities persevere in
improving debt monitoring and cash flow and resolve disputed arrears.
49.
While the overall financial picture in public enterprises has improved, acute
problems persist in key companies. Petropar and ESSAP have been of particular concern
due to cash flow problems that may affect the fiscal and/or arrears targets. Looking beyond
these immediate difficulties, the government should embark on a program to permit private
investment and management of the public enterprises. Only sharply higher investment and

- 21 -

private sector incentives can convert these firms into a source of economic growth, rather
than a drag on the economy.
50.
Monetary policy management has improved, inflation has fallen and
international reserves have increased, but ambiguity of objectives still persists. While
publicly committed to moving to inflation targeting, and observing quantitative monetary
targets under the Fund program, the authorities appear reluctant to completely abandon (at
least notional) exchange rate targeting. While these objectives have not clashed over the past
year, at some point, they may conflict, and the authorities must have a clear monetary policy
strategy established well beforehand. The staff urges the authorities to reduce the level of
their intervention in the foreign exchange market to give freer play to exchange rate. The
staff also believes that, given the strong reserves, low inflation, and fairly weak economic
growth, there may be scope for a more rapid reduction in interest rates.
51.
Banking system risks have eased in 2003 and early 2004, but public banking
reform remains crucial to ease systemic risks. The authorities have made satisfactory
progress in implementing reforms approved in late 2003. Future challenges include the
approval of comprehensive banking legislation, the extension of a supervisory regime to
cooperatives, and requiring international risk classifications from all banks.
52.
A range of additional structural reforms is needed to create the conditions for
sustained growth and to reduce poverty. The staff urges the authorities to prepare a second
round of reforms on which to work once the SBA is concluded. Only deeper, microeconomic
reforms, complementing the macroeconomic reforms underway, can raise the growth rate of
potential output to a rate consistent with the reduction of poverty. Further efforts to address
corruption will be required, including reforms of the judicial system and a restructuring of
the public sector to increase its professionalism, reduce its size and scope and increase
transparency. Programs to boost human capital will also play an important role in increasing
growth by boosting labor productivity. The restructuring of public banks will also help
increase the resources from external donors for needed development projects.
53.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintaining an open exchange
and trade system, and encourages them to seek resolution of trade disputes within existing
dispute settlement arrangements.
54.
Staff recommends granting the requested waivers for nonobservance and completion
of the second review under the Stand-By Arrangement. It is expected that the next Article IV
consultation with Paraguay will be held on a 24-month cycle.

- 22 -

Box 1. Corruption and Governance Issues
Paraguay has long-standing problems with corruption and contraband. The 2003 Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index ranks Paraguay 129th out of 133 countries, and it persistently ranks
low on other well-known governance indicators. Corruption has had a negative indirect effect on sustainable
growth in Paraguay by making policies less effective and creating disincentives for productive investment.
The current government has made it a priority to attack corruption at the highest levels. Since taking
office, it has replaced the top levels of government with individuals renowned for their integrity and
professionalism and independent of the traditional Colorado party apparatus. Changes in the leadership of the
institutions with the most serious governance problems, among them the Customs and Tax administrations, and
the Social Security Institute (IPS) have had an almost immediate impact, due to steps such as closing collection,
auditing units, and placing suspect officials on leave. Specifically:
• Tax and tariff revenues have increased almost 40 percent since August 2003, despite the fact that in-depth
restructuring of the Tax Authority and Customs Administration is just beginning.
• Revenue from social security contributions, in particular from employers, has increased by almost
30 percent in recent months, solely as a result of better enforcement.
Other areas of government are also improving:
• The Ministry of Finance has set up a pilot project with support from the World Bank to become the
‘Ministry of Excellence,’ to revamp procedures with a view to improve the accountability of officials,
efficiency and transparency of the public service.
• The implementation of the new Procurement Law, which requires government-purchasing bids above
US$60,000 to be made on the internet, has already reduced costs substantially: the Ministry of Health
estimates it has saved about 40 percent in health-related purchases since its inception. Cases of phantom
contractors are also being tracked down more frequently.
• The replacement of majority Supreme Court justices is a first step toward judicial reform, a large
contributor to governance problems.
Initiatives to increase transparency and the participation of civil society are growing. An inter-agency
commission comprised of an equal number of government and civil society representatives (now known as the
National Integrity Council (CISNI)) was formed in 2000 to promote the adoption of reform in government
entities. It had an important role in shepherding through the approval of the Procurement Law and continues to
raise public awareness of the institutional opportunities for corruption. Moreover, a public-private committee
chaired by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which includes the NGO Transparency Paraguay, has been
formed to advise on the contracting procedures and restructuring plans of Petropar and INC.

- 23 -

Box 2: Estimating the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
Staff estimated that the guaraní was undervalued in real terms at the end of 2003, although the range of
the estimated misalignment is relatively large across empirical models, between 3 to 15, possibly as a
consequence of the small size of our sample. Cointegration techniques were used to estimate the long-run
equilibrium real exchange rate—defined as the value where the real exchange rage would converge in the
absence of new shocks—as a function of several economic fundamentals such as the terms of trade, Brazil’s and
Argentina’s real exchange rates, the current account balance, the fiscal balance, net foreign assets, trade
openness and relative real GDP per capita. The misalignment in the real exchange rate implied by estimating the
long-run equilibrium equation is plotted in the Figure together with the regression residuals.

The statistical procedure used to compute the long-run values of fundamentals tends to overestimate the
range for the end-2003 misalignment. In particular, this procedure neglects the fiscal consolidation started in
2003. If the fiscal balance for 2003 is regarded as more indicative of the future trend in government finances
than the recent experience (as it seems likely), then the misalignment of the real exchange rate would be smaller
(around 10 percent). Conversely, other factors could, in the near future, raise the long-run value of the real
exchange rate and its undervaluation. In the short run, the most important factor is the potential real
undervaluation of the Argentine peso, whose recovery would raise the long-term equilibrium value of the
guaraní. Similarly, persistently high commodity prices and sustained growth in Paraguay would raise the longterm real value of the guaraní and its real underappreciation.

- 24 -

Box 3: Millennium Development Goals
Paraguay will not meet important Millennium Development Goals (MDG) unless decisive action is promptly
taken (Table):
• The MDG of eradicating extreme poverty is unlikely to be reached. According to the last available estimate,
extreme poverty increased between 1990 and 2001 and preliminary estimates suggest that it may have further
increased since 2001. Poverty and inequality are especially severe in rural areas, compounded by high
inequality in income and land distribution. Although child malnutrition has increased recently, the target of
halving hunger still appears feasible.
•

Slow progress has been made in reducing child mortality and improving maternal health, jeopardizing these
two MDGs. Furthermore, because of substantial under-reporting child and maternal mortality are likely to be
greatly under-estimated.

•

The MDG of achieving environmental sustainability is unlikely to be met. Forest area has shrunk
considerably over the last two decades as a result of expanding cultivated area. Considerable progress has been
made in providing access to drinking water, except in rural areas, where access remains extremely low.
Paraguay appears to be off-track on the target of providing sanitation facilities, especially in rural areas, where
sanitation facilities are almost nonexistent.

Advances have been made towards some MDGs but will require continued efforts for their consolidation:
•

The MDG of achieving universal primary education is within reach. Future efforts need to focus on
improving education quality and school infrastructure, raising secondary enrollment (which remains low), and
reducing child labor (still common in rural areas).

•

Progress has been made towards the MDG of achieving gender equality, especially in education (both in
terms of enrollment and literacy rates). However, far less equality exists in the economic and political
spheres—and in education as well in rural areas.

•

Although basic health coverage remains low, the MDG of combating AIDS/HIV and other major diseases
seems attainable. The incidence of HIV/AIDS is low, but likely to be greatly underestimated. Malaria has
decreased since 1980, in spite of an epidemic in 1997-99. The incidence of tuberculosis has also fallen since
1990 but still varies across different geographic areas and socio-economic groups.

Developing institutions to invest efficiently on social policies and achieving political consensus on key
priorities will be critical for sustainable progress towards the MDGs. Budget execution of social spending has
been high compared to other areas in 2004, but major efforts in rationalizing social spending and political
consensus on raising investment on social policies and infrastructure are needed. The government has been
developing a comprehensive National Poverty Reduction Strategy (with assistance from multilateral institutions).
To move forward in its implementation, efforts will have to focus on developing procedures and indicators to
monitor the efficiency of social spending.

Box 4: The Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal Adjustment Law
After repeated efforts over several years, Paraguay’s Congress finally approved a Fiscal Adjustment Law
in late June. The law achieves many of its proposed objectives, including a substantial broadening of the VAT
and corporate income taxes, the extension of a more effective tax regime to large producers, the elimination of
large exemptions contained in 42 separate laws, and the introduction of a new personal income tax. However,
the earmarking of 3.5 percent of tax revenues to the tax authorities to improve tax administration, contemplated
in the version submitted to Congress, was eliminated. The main features of the law, whose impact on revenues
is shown in Table 16, are as follows:
•

The law lowers the rate for the profit tax from 30 percent to 20 percent during its first year of application
and to 10 percent starting from the second year. The law also eliminates most exemptions, most
importantly the 5-year tax holiday on first-time investment. Compared to the original draft, the law
reinstates exemptions on education, savings corporations, cooperatives, and interest and capital gains on
bonds issued in the stock exchange and on public bonded debt. The also law introduces a new tax on small
businesses (Renta del Pequeño contribuyente) at the uniform tax rate of 10 percent over net income. With
respect to the latter tax, the law represents a major improvement over the previous regime, which was
considered a serious channel of tax evasion for large companies.

•

The law introduces a vehicles tax (patente fiscal), but is limited to luxury vehicles and only applies for two
years, rendering a negligible expected net yield. The Law also substantially narrows the financial
transactions tax and limits its application to 3 years.

•

The law broadens the value-added tax by eliminating exemptions under special regimes, introducing the
VAT on services, rentals, transport and on previously exempt goods (including basic foods and petroleum
products); the tax rate is kept at 10 percent except for some foods and pharmaceuticals, which have a
temporarily lower rate.

•

The law overhauls the existing agricultural land tax (IMAGRO) by distinguishing between large
landholders—taxed on their net actual income—and medium-sized landholders—taxed on a presumptive
income using productivity coefficients defined in the law. It is expected that, owing to the low values of the
productivity coefficients, the tax on medium-size landholdings will not generate significant revenues.
Unlike previous versions of the law, the executive loses the discretion to change the productivity
parameters of the tax rate, considered a drawback. The richest landholders will continue to contribute to the
majority of the revenue from this tax.

•

The law introduces a new personal income tax. The tax, scheduled to take in effect in 2006, will initially
apply only to incomes above ten minimum salaries at a 10 percent rate (less than 5 percent of households)
and will be gradually extended (at the lower rate of 8 percent) to all individuals earning more than three
minimum wages. The tax allows full deductibility of all personal expenditures supported by VAT receipts,
which will likely increase the costs of administering the tax.

•

The law sets new maximum rates on excise taxes of some goods (some rates are raised and others
lowered), and introduces some consumer goods subject to excise taxes at rates of between 1 and 5 percent.

The Law introduces various tax administration reforms, which would improve the accountability of the tax
officials and the responsibility of taxpayers. The articles on tax administration are designed to complement the
incentives within the Law to present VAT receipts and improve documentation. Nonetheless, unless sufficient
additional funds are provided to the tax authorities to enable them to implement the law, they would be unable
to do so in their current shape. Moreover, the law falls short of granting more financial and operational
autonomy to the tax authority, which would be desirable in the long run.

Target

Sources: Ministry of Finance; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Public sector pending obligations more than 1 day overdue, except for last 4 columns (see footnote 2).
2/ The program considers as arrears: (i) all payments past due over 30 days; (ii) nondisputed arrears; (iii) domestic arrears which exclude 'normal' floating debt (equal to G250 billion,
or US$40 million).
3/ Based on preliminary data. The $15 million central government external arrears refer to disputed arrears with Belgium and South Africa, so would be excluded from program targets.
4/ For the purposes of the target on domestic floating debt in March, interest on new bonds not yet processed and verified are not part of domestic debt as of March 31, 2004.
5/ Includes about US$14 million in disputed arrears, except for the last four column (see footnote 2).
6/ Paid by the BCP, the guarantor, under the program.

APPENDIX I

MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
1.
This appendix examines Paraguay’s medium-term outlook and updates the public
debt sustainability analysis (see IMF Country Report No. 04/66). Two medium-term
scenarios are presented: (i) a baseline scenario based on the implementation of policies under
the Stand-By Arrangement; and (ii) a higher growth scenario in which a broader range of
structural reforms is implemented over the medium term beyond the end of the SBA.
A. Baseline Scenario
2.
The baseline scenario assumes that policies agreed under the Stand-By
Arrangement continue to be implemented over the medium term. Key policies include
(i) fiscal adjustment, (ii) price stabilization via the adoption of a floating exchange rate and
targeting monetary aggregates; and (iii) structural reforms to strengthen the banking and
fiscal sectors, and enhance governance.
3.
Contingent on these policies, projections of Paraguay’s medium-term
macroeconomic performance would have the following key features (Table 14):
•

Growth rates over the medium-term average 3.4 percent over the period, somewhat
higher than the average growth rates in the 1990s and 1980s.

•

Inflation rates remain stable at around 5.0 percent on average, as the REER stabilizes
in response to improved productivity growth.

•

The level of public debt falls to 28.0 percent of GDP by 2010.

•

The current account deficit widens to 1.4 percent of GDP by 2010, despite continued
export growth, as investment levels gradually pick up over the medium term.

•

International reserves are assumed to increase to broadly keep reserves constant as a
fraction of imports, as wider current account deficits are expected to be financed by
increased capital inflows.
B. Higher-Growth Scenario
4.
Higher medium-term growth will require further structural reforms to be
implemented in addition to the policies in the baseline scenario. The broad objectives of
such reforms should be to boost investment levels and, perhaps more importantly, enhance

- 52 -

APPENDIX I

the efficiency of investment in order to bring about significant improvements in total
factor productivity (TFP).1
5.
A thorough analysis of the reforms needed to boost total factor productivity and
growth is beyond the scope of this appendix. However, such reforms would most likely
include measures in the following areas: (i) privatization or capitalization of public
enterprises, which would increase the efficiency of basic services and attract significant
new investment; (ii) an overhaul of the social security system to provide a source of
investment funds; (iii) further improvements in governance and the regulatory
environment for private sector investment, including legal system reforms; (iv) increased
investment in human capital to improve labor productivity (via education and health
programs); (v) bringing informal activities into the formal sector; (vi) increased investment
in infrastructure; and (vi) measures to support growth and diversification of exports, such
as further trade liberalization agreements.
6.
Successful implementation of policies in these areas could result in a scenario
where growth rates reach 4.5 percent in the medium term. As these higher growth rates
would result from increases in efficiency and productive capacity, they would be
consistent with continued price stability as in the baseline scenario.2 Higher growth would
increase fiscal revenues. It is assumed these are not spent, resulting in slightly better fiscal
balances. This contributes to a larger fall in debt levels than in the baseline, as does the
higher GDP growth. The current account deficit would be only modestly larger, and
import demand is assumed to increase only slightly (since this scenario is driven by mainly
improved TFP) and are offset by higher export growth and higher government saving. The
higher current account deficit is more than offset by increased capital flows, resulting in
roughly the same level of reserves (in months of imports).
C. Public Debt Sustainability
7.
The profile of public sector debt has changed little since last year. A sustainability
analysis and sensitivity tests were run for the baseline scenario using the most recent data,

1

A recent study of growth in Latin America found that Paraguay’s poor growth performance in the 1980s and
1990s was in large part due to negative contribution of TFP to growth. The study also found that most Latin
American economies had negative TFP contributions to growth in the 1980s. However, following the
implementation of structural reforms in the 1990s, TFP contributions for most of these economies turned
positive, with Paraguay one of the exceptions. See Loayza, Fajnzylber, and Calderon, “Economic Growth in
Latin America and the Caribbean,” mimeo (June 2002).

2

If productivity growth were to outstrip that of its main trading partners in this scenario, a steady appreciation
of the real exchange rate could also result due to the Balassa-Samuelson effect. If this occurred, the projections
for inflation and the debt-to-GDP ratio would likely be even more favorable.

- 53 -

APPENDIX I

which showed the conclusions of the last sustainability exercise remain valid.3 The main
conclusions are (see Table 19).4
•

Public sector debt remains sustainable under alternative assumptions regarding GDP
growth, interest rates, and the debt stock (stress tests 1, 2, 3, and 7).

•

However, public debt remains sensitive to assumptions on the primary balance,
pointing to the importance of the targeted fiscal adjustment under the program. For
example, assuming Paraguay’s primary deficit reverts to the historical average of 1.6
percent of GDP after the program (from 2005 on) results in a steady increase in the
public debt level to 50.6 percent of GDP by 2008.5

•

Given that the debt stock is predominantly in foreign currency, its sustainability is
also highly dependent on the exchange rate. Test 6 shows that a strong depreciation
would sharply increase the stock of debt, though this shock alone would not lead to
unsustainable debt dynamics.

3

Public sector debt accounts for 85 percent of external debt. Hence external debt dynamics are largely driven
by the dynamics of public sector debt. Over the medium term, some increase in private sector external debt is
projected to finance the widening of the private sector savings-investment balance. As a result, total external
debt is projected to fall to about 35.4 percent of GDP by 2010 from 51.6 percent in 2003.
4

The scenario was subjected to stress tests, in line with the methodology contained in Assessing Sustainability
(www.imf.org).

5

In stress test 1, the sustainability of the debt is due to the assumption of the historical average for real interest
rates, which is sharply negative due to past bouts of inflation.

APPENDIX III

FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
June 21, 2004
A new Paraguay Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved on December 16, 2003,
covering the period from mid-FY04 to FY07. The Bank’s strategy as outlined in the new
CAS aims to restore confidence in the economy and lay the basis for sustainable growth and
poverty reduction. To this end, the CAS supports (i) the fiscal and financial reforms the
Administration has to send to Congress; (ii) improved governance and transparency in public
administration; (iii) sustained growth, particularly in the rural areas where poverty is
concentrated and deepest; and (iv) social inclusion, to improve the coverage and efficiency of
basic social services to help Paraguay meet the millennium development goals. The proposed
base case lending program for the CAS periods is for US$325 million, of which US$80
million, or about 25 percent, are envisaged for two adjustment operations. One of them, the
Economic Recovery Loan in the amount of $30 million was approved on December 16, 2003
together with the CAS, and has been fully disbursed.
A comprehensive Policy Notes document was completed in May 2003 and discussed with the
new Administration in June 2003. In FY04 the Bank also prepared a Social Protection Study
and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), which is expected to be
completed by end June 2004. In addition, sector work on health is underway, and a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) will be prepared in FY05.
Five World Bank-financed projects are presently under implementation, for a total value of
$144.8 million, of which $68.2 million are undisbursed as of June 21, 2004. These projects
include: Fourth Rural Water Supply, Natural Resource Management, Maternal Health and
Child Development, Pilot Community Development, and the Secondary Education Reform,
which is awaiting effectiveness. There is also an active program of grants that are currently
being implemented.
A Financial Sector Adjustment Loan and Technical Assistance Loan are at an advanced stage
of preparation. A technical assistance loan to assist in the restructuring of the Ministry of
Finance and help it become a Ministry of Excellence is also under preparation for FY05
delivery. Preparation is also underway for a new Health Project and a Sustainable Rural
Investment Project, which are also planned for FY05 delivery.

APPENDIX IV

PARAGUAY—RELATIONS WITH THE IDB1
Portfolio
1.

There is close collaboration between the IDB and the IMF, as the IDB had operations
contingent on the approval of an agreement with Paraguay, which had been included in
the IMF’s assessments of the situation. Furthermore, there is close coordination between
the IDB and the World Bank in specific issues regarding public banking reform.

2.

The operations of IDB, Paraguay’s main creditor, have been affected in the past by fiscal
constraints and political instability with regard to decisions concerning new loans. As a
direct consequence, Paraguay entered in default in 2002 and again in 2003, loans had to
be postponed, loan disbursements were slow, and the net cash flow to the country was
negative for the third consecutive year.

3.

During 2003 IDB approved three loans: for Cadastre Registry, for US$9.0 million, for
Initial and Preschool Education, for US$23.4 million and an Emergency Loan for Social
Expenditure Protection, for US$30 million. In addition, 3 loans to support the preparation
and initial execution of new operations were approved: Costal Development in Asunción,
for US$1.5 million, Initial and Preschool Education, for US$0.9 million and Social
Investment Program, for US$1.2 million.

4.

On April 30, 2004 the active portfolio of loans amounts to US$657.3 million, of which
43.4 percent have been disbursed. As for Technical Cooperation, the approved total
amounts to US$20.0 million, of which 48.5 percent have been disbursed.

Operations Program
5.

In the second half of 2004 we expect approval of a policy-based loan of US$50 million
for a public financial sector reform, cofinanced with the World Bank. Its conditionality is
being closely coordinated with the IMF.

6.

Other investment loans with approval expected in 2004 include:

TC loan for the Public Bank Reform, for US$4 million.
Strengthening of the Judiciary System II, for US$10 million

The Bank’s new country strategy with Paraguay is expected to be approved during the
third quarter of 2004.

APPENDIX V

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 7, 2004)
A. Real Sector
National accounts have a number of shortcomings, including the use of an outdated
conceptual framework and an outdated base year for constant prices (1982). The data are,
however, currently being made compatible with international standards (1993 SNA) with the
assistance of an expert financed by the IDB. This entails a fuller coverage of industries, an
input-output matrix, and an expansion of data sources for the compilation of the 1994 new
benchmark and base year. Quarterly information recently became available for 1997–2001.
Both the consumer and producer price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis. The
CPI has a base period of 1992, and the PPI of December 1995. A change in the base period
and basket of the CPI is scheduled to take place after the results of a new household income
and expenditure survey covering the period 2001–02 become available. The coverage and
quality of employment and unemployment statistics have improved their coverage and
quality significantly since a regular household survey was introduced in 1998. However,
frequencies remain at the annual level, and the publication lag is close to one year. Wage
indices are updated twice a year.
Paraguay became a GDDS participant in 2001 with the publication of its metadata on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
B. Public Finances
Reliable monthly data are available on a timely basis for the central government, where much
improvement has been made over the past years. The asset position of the social security
system is available on a daily basis. However, shortcomings in the classification and
recording remain and the Paraguayan GFS is not fully consistent with the methodology of the
IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986). For instance, nontax
revenues include social security contributions. Additionally, public enterprises and the social
security system have been following somewhat different classifications of revenues and
expenditures than the central government. A law (Ley 1535) that was passed in 2000, should
allow closer integration, as it sets uniform standards and creates a database for the entire
public sector. Data on medium- and long-term external debt are reliable and available on a
monthly basis. Internal debt data are available on request, but need to be more fully
integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies remain in the registration of shortterm supplier and commercial credit of the public sector. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in
the fiscal data reported by the monetary and fiscal authorities. On November 2003, the
Ministry of Finance issued a decree requiring all decentralized entities and public enterprises
to provide updated monthly financial data to the Ministry of Finance, as well as the balance
sheet. Other measures are being taken to make reporting more transparent. Under the SBA,
all public enterprises and the IPS are required to undergo a complete financial audit by an
internationally-recognized auditor.

- 60 -

APPENDIX V

Annual data covering only budgetary central government through 2001 have been published
in the 2002 GFS Yearbook. However, since 1994 no financing and outstanding debt data, and
no breakdowns for expenditure by function data have been provided for publication in the
GFSY. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for publication in IFS. The resumption of
reporting quarterly and monthly data for the IFS is highly recommended. Data on local
governments and public enterprises are deficient and not reported regularly.
C. Money and Banking
Money and banking statistics are broadly reliable as a result of the adoption in 1995 of a new
accounting plan for commercial banks and finance companies. Following the work on
methodologies initiated in the 2000 STA mission, Paraguay completed the establishment of a
unified compilation and reporting system for the whole range of monetary data. This new
system intends to harmonize monetary data for use of the CBP, for reporting to STA for
publication in IFS, and for operational and monitoring purposes. A revision of the
classification criteria has led also to a marked reduction in the discrepancies of interbank
positions. A recent STA money and banking statistics mission recommended that
(i) institutional cover-age of the depository corporations survey be expanded to include
financial investment funds and financial cooperatives; (ii) the compilation unit be given online access to the database maintained by the Superintendency of Banks; and
(iii) methodological notes be disseminated, including an explanation of improvements and
reasons for breaks in the series.
The Superintendency of Banks publishes a detailed and informative report on the soundness
of the financial system.
D. External Sector
Quarterly and annual data on balance of payments and the international investment position
(IIP statistics are available from 2001 onwards on the central bank website, and reported to
STA. Annual IIP data have been compiled and disseminated for the period 1995–2003. The
classification of the balance of payments and of the IIP follows the recommendations of the
Balance of Payments Manual (5th edition). Technical assistance by STA has led to
improvements in the quality of the data on capital flows, especially in the coverage on
foreign direct investment, and in the recording of external debt transactions in the balance of
payments and in the IIP. The central bank now produces a highly informative bulletin on
balance of payments statistics. Special studies by the central bank have improved the
estimation methods for remittances of Paraguayans abroad and unregistered trade
transactions, but serious deficiencies remain.
Deficiencies remain in the area of private capital outflows, which are difficult to register due
to Paraguay’s liberal capital account. Major recommendations of the multisector statistics
mission include the need to: (i) introduce quarterly surveys for recording services, transfers,
and financial transactions of the nonfinancial private sector; (ii) apply quality control

- 61 -

APPENDIX V

procedures for surveys; (iii) revise and improve the statistical techniques to take into account
unrecorded merchandise trade and smuggling; (iv) improve the compilation procedures of
several services and financial transactions; and (v) institute a system of coordination with
other official agencies, and within the CBP, to promote intersectoral data consistency.
Sizable negative errors and omissions over the last few years can be attributed mostly to
unregistered outflows of portfolio capital and the lack of coordination between customs, the
central bank, and Ministry of Finance in the compilation of basic trade data.

ATTACHMENT I

Asunción, July 16, 2004

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The attached Supplement to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
describes the economic program and objectives of the Government of Paraguay for the
remainder of 2004. Except as modified by the Supplement, we remain fully committed to
achieving the objectives of the program outlined in the original Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies, dated December 5, 2003.
2.
A key goal of the program is to set the stage for medium-term fiscal consolidation.
To this end, Congress approved in June 2004 the Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal
Adjustment Law, a performance criterion for end-May 2004 under the Stand-By
Arrangement. We are committed to implementing necessary measures to compensate for
elements of the law weakened by the Congress. On this basis, we request a waiver for the
approval of the law, which was approved beyond the end-May performance criterion
deadline, and without all of the components originally contemplated.
3.
Nine of the eleven quantitative performance criteria under the Stand-By Arrangement
were met for end-March 2004. Three applicable structural performance criteria, related to
application of international accounting standards and annual external audits of the central
bank, the full application of the public procurement law, and fuel price adjustment, were
observed.
4.
The continuous performance criterion for no new external arrears was not observed,
due to new arrears accumulated by cement company INC, but they have since been cleared.
New procedures to avoid arrears set up earlier in the year were effective in eliminating new
arrears of the central government, and these procedure will be extended to other public
entities to avoid future problems there. The ceiling on the central government wage bill was
also missed by a small margin, but there were savings in other areas of current expenditure.
On this basis, we request waivers for the missed continuous performance criterion on no new
external arrears and for the missed wage bill ceiling.
5.
We request that the third review be delayed and be based on end-August targets,
rather than end-June, with the fourth and fifth reviews combined and evaluated based on endDecember targets, and that access under the arrangement be rephased accordingly. We have

- 64 -

ATTACHMENT I

agreed on remaining targets for August 2004 and December 2004. All December 2004
targets are performance criteria except for the targets on the central government overall
balance, which is an indicative target; the performance criterion will be set at the time of the
third review. We request that the performance criterion on the approval of the Public
Banking Reform Law be modified from end July to end-October because of legislative
delays. In contrast, we request that the structural benchmark on the approval of the new
Customs Code be end-July 2004. We are making good progress on the audits of public
enterprises (ANDE, ESSAP, and COPACO). However, for some public enterprises and the
Social Security Institute (IPS), the audits will take longer than originally envisaged. We
therefore request a modification of the end-September performance criteria on the audits of
Petropar, INC, Conatel, ANNP, Dinac, and the Social Security Institute to postpone the
completion of the audits to end-December.
We hope to maintain a close policy dialogue with the Fund and stand ready to take additional
measures, as necessary, to achieve the objectives of the program.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Angel Gabriel González Cáceres
President
Central Bank of Paraguay

/s/
Dionisio Borda
Minister of Finance

ATTACHMENT II

SUPPLEMENT TO THE MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
A. Introduction and Recent Developments
1.
Progress has been made in implementing the economic program that has been
supported by a Stand-By Arrangement from the IMF since December 2003 (Tables 1
and 2). This supplementary memorandum of economic and financial policies (SMEFP)
describes recent developments and outlines plans for the remainder of 2004. Except as
modified in this memorandum, the objectives, policies, targets, and commitments of the
economic program remain as described in the original MEFP dated December 5, 2003.
2.
A late season drought in some regions has tempered the growth outlook for
2004. GDP rose by an estimated 2½ percent in 2003, as a strong agricultural harvest—
particularly in soy—compensated for weak domestic demand during the first half of the
year. For this year, the nonagricultural economy is expected to accelerate its growth from
0 percent to near 3 percent, but the drought will leave agricultural output flat. Revenue
from agricultural exports will remain strong, however, due to high commodity prices.
3.
Inflation has dropped sharply and the guaraní has strengthened. Strong export
earnings, a weaker dollar internationally, and a reversal of capital outflows has produced a
rise in the guaraní against the dollar of 4 percent since end-December 2003. The Central
Bank has intervened actively to moderate the appreciation, contributing to a rise in
international reserves of US$90 million to US$1,073 million as of June 17. Banking
system deposits have also continued to rise strongly, up over 7 percent so far this year.
Annual CPI inflation has dropped from 9.3 percent in December to 5.5 percent in June.
Seasonal factors will produce a slight recovery of inflation to 4–5 percent—still well
below our earlier objective of 8 percent. With inflation under control and GDP growth
subdued, the balance of risks to the macroeconomic outlook has shifted toward the
downside.
B. Fiscal Policy
4.
Fiscal policy is in line with the program. The end-March performance criteria on
the central government and consolidated public sector balances were met. Expenditures in
the first quarter were broadly as anticipated, though there was a small deviation from the
program ceiling on the wage bill. Transfer payments were slightly below program due to
savings from the early implementation of the public sector Pension Reform Law. Tax
collections have been above projections and are expected to improve further as excise tax
arrears from the state-owned oil company, Petropar, are cleared. Once the Administrative
Reorganization and Fiscal Adjustment Law is implemented, tax revenues should increase
further. Together, the improvements in tax efficiency (with some help from the early
effects of the Fiscal Adjustment Law) will produce a substantial cushion for this year’s
target for the fiscal outturn. Part of this cushion will be used to boost capital spending in
key areas (particularly in development projects financed by multilateral organizations). In
order to maintain tight control on public spending, the Ministry of Finance is consolidating

- 66 -

ATTACHMENT II

all supplementary budget requests into one bill, with strict limits on its overall size. The
government will keep the Fund informed on the content of the supplementary budget
request, and the increase in capital spending will be closely monitored to assure that the
fiscal objectives are maintained.
5.
The Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal Adjustment Law has been
approved by Congress. The June 25, 2004 approval was slightly delayed beyond the
May 31, 2004 performance criterion date. The version approved differs in several
respects from the version originally sent to Congress: (i) The corporate income tax is
lowered to 20 percent in the first year, rather than to 10 percent; (ii) The vehicles tax
(patente fiscal) is limited to two years and only levied on luxury vehicles; (iii) The
financial transactions tax is eliminated after three years; (iv) The VAT is not extended to
agriculture and education; (v) A new agricultural income tax was introduced on medium
and large farms; (vi) The profits tax is not extended to cooperatives and narrowed for
educational institutions; (vii) Certain severe penalties for cross-controls on tax payments
were eased; and (viii) The earmarking of 3.5 percent of tax revenues to the tax authorities
was eliminated. Together, these measures would reduce the eventual maximum yield of
the law from over 2½ percent of GDP to less than 1½ percent of GDP. The government
never intended to apply the law at maximum rates, so the actual expected yield has fallen
only slightly, from 1.5 percent of GDP to 1.3 percent of GDP. Due to the phase-in of the
new personal income tax and the staged elimination of tax loopholes, the short-term yield
of the law is also reduced significantly, from 1½ percent of GDP to ½ percent of GDP.
However, the law retains many of its main features, including a substantial broadening of
the VAT and corporate income taxes, introduction of a new personal income tax, and the
extension of a more effective tax regime to large farmers. Final passage of the law was a
prior action for the review.
6.
To compensate for weakened features of the Fiscal Adjustment Law, the
government will implement a series of compensatory measures to further boost
revenue and strengthen tax administration. On tax administration, the government will
reprogram budget allocations and use support from an IDB technical assistance loan to
increase funding for the tax authorities in 2004 (prior action for the review) and submit to
Congress a sharply higher budget request for 2005 to compensate for the loss of the
3.5 percent earmarking. The Undersecretariat for Taxation has presented a strategic plan
which will, among other objectives, increase computerization, restructure the organization,
and boost training for staff (prior action for the review). Additional revenues will be raised
from an increase in excise taxes on tobacco and cigarettes to their legal maximum. Further
gains in revenue from tax administration will be realized by the full application of a crosschecking system for large taxpayers and an acceleration of legal enforcement actions. The
government is prepared to use its legal authority to begin the reduction in certain taxes in
2006 (rather than 2005) while starting the reduction in exemptions immediately. Together,
these revenue measures should boost annual revenue in 2005–06 by over ½ percent of
GDP. A temporary tax on windfall soybean export revenue was introduced earlier in 2004
to compensate for delays in the law, and will be lifted with implementation of the law.

- 67 -

ATTACHMENT II

Finally, the government will prepare legislation to address the remaining weaknesses in
the Fiscal Adjustment Law for submission to Congress in 2005.
7.
The outturn in public enterprises has been better than expected. The
appreciation of the guaraní has played an important role in this improvement, as several
firms have a large dollar cost component in their activities. A high-level control committee
set up by the government to monitor public enterprise operations has helped instill greater
financial discipline. New management in the cement firm, INC, has also contributed.
Diesel fuel prices were raised by 8 percent in April, ahead of the July date for a price
adjustment agreed in the program. This increase will fully compensate for cost increases in
Petropar at current world oil prices, but it may fall short of what is needed to allow the
firm to eliminate payments arrears to suppliers and to the tax authorities. Moreover,
continued high world oil prices may require further measures later in the year.
8.
Performance criteria for the fiscal balance will be set for end-August consistent
with the original fiscal objective as follows: central government balance G/.430 billion and
consolidated government balance G/. 500 billion. The wage bill ceiling will be modified
slightly from its original path to accommodate a wage increase for security services
already granted by Congress and permit a small increase in the wage bill for teachers. The
end-August wage bill ceiling would be G/. 1791 billion. For end-December, the
consolidated public sector balance PC is G/.130 billion and the wage bill ceiling PC is G/.
2980 billion. The indicative fiscal targets of the program remain unchanged for end-June,
end-September, and end-December, with performance criteria for end-December for the
central government balance to be set at the time of the third review.
9.
The government has worked to reduce payments arrears ahead of the
schedule contemplated in the program. The PCs on overall external arrears, official
bilateral arrears, and the short-term contracting of debt were all met, as was the one on
domestic floating debt. By end-March arrears to Paris Club creditors have been cleared,
with the exception of a few cases where technical problems existed. However, the
continuous performance criterion on no new accumulation of arrears was not met due to
new arrears by the public enterprises INC and Petropar. The remaining stock of arrears of
INC and Petropar have been cleared and those of the government to bilateral creditors will
be cleared shortly.1 Clearance of new bilateral arrears by the cement company INC is a
prior action for the review. Petropar arrears to suppliers have also been reduced
substantially. The government is committed to accelerating discussions to resolve disputed
claims. In particular, a law will be submitted to Congress (prior actions for the review) to
begin the process of regularizing disputed arrears on a loan to the public electricity
company, ANDE. Principal and regular interest arrears to Banque Worms have been

1

This excludes a small amount of arrears to a South African creditor that cannot be located.

- 68 -

ATTACHMENT II

cleared and the authorities have initiated negotiations with the French government on
penalty interest due. The government is committed to regularizing penalty interest arrears
as a prior action for the review. Domestic arrears have also been reduced, though there
have been difficulties in fully identifying outstanding arrears and in completing the
restructuring of domestic bonds agreed in November 2003. All bonds presented for
restructuring by June 15 will be exchanged and interest arrears on all exchanged bonds
will be cleared as a prior action for the review. The government has established an escrow
account in the Central Bank where funds are deposited for bond not yet presented for
exchange.
10.
The debt and arrears indicative targets for end-December will be converted into
performance criteria, while end-August targets will be set consistent with the original
indicative targets, except for the PC on official bilateral arrears, which will be set at zero
for the end-August date.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
11.
Performance criteria for end-March have been met with wide margins. The
growth rate of currency issue was somewhat higher than programmed, but by end-May, it
had dropped below programmed levels. Sharply higher international reserves were
absorbed by a combination of increased Central Bank notes (letras) and by excess reserves
deposited by the banking system in the Central Bank. Interest rates on letras have fallen,
but remain high in real terms.
12.
New performance criteria will be set for end-August and end-December. The
reserves target will be adjusted upwards to lock-in the gains in reserves already achieved
and further net inflows expected for the remainder of the year, while permitting modest
Central Bank sales of foreign exchange should there be a sharp turnaround in capital
flows. The new net domestic assets (NDA) performance criteria will also be set allowing
for growth in currency issue slightly higher than in the original program to take into
account the increased demand for money. The new performance criteria are specified in
the following table:

For end-December, an adjustor will be incorporated into the target to adjust reserves
upwards (and NDA downwards) if additional multilateral program disbursements are
received. In the event of a major negative external shock, the targets could be reconsidered
at the time of the third review.
D. Structural Policies
13.
Progress on the structural reform agenda has been good. In the area of public
sector reforms, the new Customs Code was approved by Congress on June 30, 2004. The
Public Procurement Law is now being applied at all levels of government, improving the
efficiency and transparency of the contracting process, but additional training is needed for
users of the system. The Central Bank is on track to complete its external audit by endJune, and will report its results in both Paraguay and international accounting standards.
The BCP is also developing a restructuring plan (with technical assistance from the Fund)
and the new plan will be approved by end-July, with implementation to begin immediately
thereafter. Reform efforts continue in tax administration, with technical assistance from
the Fund and IDB, and financing from the IDB. Key public sector institutions are
undertaking external audits. While most should be completed by end-September, a few
may require until end-2004.
14.
Financial sector reforms are advancing. In the coming months, banks are
required to submit their adjustment plans to meet the tighter provisioning requirements of
the new Resolutions 8 approved last November. The deposit guarantee fund established in
the Bank Resolution Law will also begin to operate before the end of the year.
Comprehensive banking sector legislation is also being prepared for submission to
Congress shortly. The Public Banking Law to reform the National Development Bank
(BNF) and other public lending institutions is currently in Congress, and approval is
expected by end-October. The supervisory body for cooperatives, INCOOP, has begun to
develop mechanisms for financial supervision and control of cooperatives, slated to begin
in 2005.

PARAGUAY—TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This memorandum presents definitions of the quantitative targets specified in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, and updates the original Technical
Memorandum of Understanding approved on December 15, 20031. Remaining targets are set
for August 2004 and December 2004. All December 2004 targets are performance criteria
except for the targets on the central government overall balance, which will be set at the time
of the third review.

For monitoring purposes, net international reserves (NIR) of the BCP are defined as the U.S.
dollar value of gross foreign assets in foreign currencies minus gross liabilities in foreign
currencies. Data will be provided by the BCP to the Fund with a lag of not more than five
days past the test date.
Gross foreign assets are defined consistent with SDDS and include all foreign currencydenominated claims of BCP, including monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, the reserve
position in the IMF, and foreign currency in the form of cash, deposits abroad, and
Paraguay’s net cash balance within the Latin America Trade Clearing System (ALADI).
Excluded from gross foreign assets are participations in international financial institutions
(including Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), IDB, IBRD, Asociación Internacional de
Fomento, and Banco de Desarrollo del Caribe), the holdings of nonconvertible currencies,
and holdings of precious metals other than gold. Gross foreign liabilities are all foreign

Compared to the original version, this revision: (i) adds and adjustor to the NDA and NIR targets; (ii) takes the
registry float of the public sector balance to be zero given the difficulty of monitoring such a number; (iii)
updates the list of external disputed arrears; and (iv) expands and changes the definition of the domestic floating
debt target of the central government.

converted into U.S. dollars at the market exchange rates of the respective currencies as of
September 30, 2003.
NIR targets will be adjusted upward (downward) for any increase (decrease) in reserve
requirement deposits (encaje) associated with foreign currency deposits in commercial
banks, compared to the following levels: August 31, 2004: US$269 million; and December
31, 2004: US$269 million.

Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BCP are defined as the difference between currency issue
(provided by the BCP) and the net international reserves (NIR) of the BCP, both measured on
the basis of end-of-period data. Data will be provided to the Fund by the BCP with a lag of
not more than five days past the test date.
For the purpose of NDA calculation, NIR will be converted into guaraníes at an accounting
exchange rate of G 6,280/US$. The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted upward (downward) by
the equivalent in guaraníes of the downward (upward) adjustments made to the floor on the
NIR of the BCP as described above.

For the purposes of the program, the overall balance of the central administration (CA) is
measured as the sum of the CA’s: (i) net external financing; (ii) the change in net credit to the
central government from the banking system, excluding government bonds; (iii) the change
in the stock of government bonds; and (iv) net financing from all other sources to the
government, including by the private sector, asset sales; (v) the change in domestic floating
debt (deuda flotante) as defined below; and(vi) a registry float. Items denominated in foreign
currency will be converted into guaraníes at the average exchange rate for each month.
Net external financing is defined as central government’s foreign borrowing, including bonds
issued abroad, less amortization payments (including debt prepayments) of foreign debt. Net
credit from the financial system is defined as the change in net credit to government, as
reported in the monetary accounts of the BCP, excluding government bonds. The change in
the stock of government bonds will be defined net of valuation changes as reported by the
Ministry of Finance. Net change in arrears is defined as net increase in arrears between the
beginning and the end of the period. Domestic floating debt is defined as the difference
between accrued expenditure (gastos obligados) and payments transferred (gastos
transferidos). The registry float is defined as all net payments executed by the Treasury of
the CA and payments units but not yet cashed or registered in the accounts of the financial
system. External arrears are as reported by the Ministry of Finance’s SIGADE system. Data
will be provided to the Fund by the Ministry of Finance with a lag of not more than three
weeks past the test date.

Paraguay (BCP).
The public sector’s overall balance is measured as the sum of: (i) net external financing; (ii)
the change in net domestic credit to public sector from the financial system, excluding
government bonds; (iii) the change in the stock of government bonds; (iv) financing of the
quasi-fiscal balance of the BCP; and (v) other net financing of the nonfinancial public sector
by the private sector, including net increase in the stock of floating debt, external arrears, and
asset sales. Items denominated in foreign currency will be converted into guaraníes at the
average exchange rate for each month.
Net external financing of the public sector is defined as all external disbursements less
amortizations paid of the entities of the public sector as defined above, including any debt of
the financial public sector guaranteed by the Republic of Paraguay or the BCP. The change in
net credit is defined as the net flow of gross domestic credit (excluding treasury bonds) plus
use of deposits by the nonfinancial public sector (excluding the BCP) in the domestic
financial system. The change in the stock of government bonds is defined as the net change
in public bonded debt held by the financial system (excluding the BCP) and the private
sector. It is measured net of valuation changes. Domestic floating debt of the public sector is
defined as the difference between accrued expenditure (gastos obligados) and payments
transferred (gastos transferidos) with the private sector. It will be measured as the central
government floating debt net of debts with the rest of the public sector as defined herein.
External debt arrears are defined as principal and interest not paid by the due date of debt
guaranteed by the Republic of Paraguay or the BCP as reported by the Ministry of Finance’s
SIGADE plus the net change in arrears to foreign suppliers of the consolidated public sector.
The financing of the quasi-fiscal balance of the BCP is measured as the negative of all
administrative and financial revenues minus costs (including costs of monetary policy and
interest on BCP external debt), and net capital transfers to other financial institutions, as
reported by the BCP. Data will be provided to the Fund by the Ministry of Finance with a lag

The nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) is defined as the consolidated public sector (as
defined above) excluding the Central Bank of Paraguay. The limit applies to the contracting
or guaranteeing by the NFPS of net new nonconcessional external debt with an original
maturity of more than one year, including commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not been received.3 For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a
grant element of at least 35 percent on the basis of currency-specific discount rates based on
the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRR).4 Excluded from the limits are credits
extended by the IMF and balance of payments support loans extended by multilateral and
bilateral creditors. Data will be provided by the Ministry of Finance to the Fund with a lag of
not more than 30 days from the test date.
The concessionality of loans in currency baskets will be assessed on the basis of U.S. dollar
interest rate tables. For loans with interest rates based on the internal policy of the creditors,
the relevant interest rate to define concessionality will be the interest rate for each creditor at
the time of the commitment. Loans or portions of loans extended in the context of a debt
rescheduling or a debt reduction operation will be excluded from the ceiling.

The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000 (Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85).

4

The grant element is calculated as the difference between the net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal
value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt (i.e., Grant = (Nominal Value – NPV) /
Nominal Value). The NPV of debt is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service
due on this debt. For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year average CIRR will be used to
calculate the NPV of debt. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be
used. For the purposes of the program, the CIRRs published by the OECD in November 2003 will be used.

Performance Criterion on Short-Term External Debt of the Nonfinancial Public
Sector
As a continuous performance criterion, the NFPS will neither contract nor guarantee
any short-term external debt during the program period. Short-term debt is defined as
debt with a contractual maturity of one year or less. Excluded are normal import-related
credits, reserve liabilities of the BCP, forward contracts, swaps, and other futures market
contracts. The public enterprises will provide the necessary information to the Ministry of
Finance, which will provide the data to the Fund, with a lag of not more than 30 days from
the test date.
8.

Performance Criteria on External Payments Arrears of the Public Sector

The NFPS, excluding PETROPAR, will accumulate no new external arrears during the
program period. It will maintain zero arrears with the World Bank and IDB
throughout the program period. In addition, existing arrears will be reduced according to
the following performance criterion:

The stock of external arrears of the NFPS, will be calculated based on the schedule of
external payments obligations reported by SIGADE. The arrears of PETROPAR will be
included in the stock targets shown in the table. Data on external arrears will be reconciled
with the relevant creditors, and any necessary adjustments will be incorporated in these
targets as they occur. For the purposes of this performance criterion, an arrear will be defined
as a payment which has not been made within 30 days after falling due. In addition, the
public enterprises will report to the Ministry of Finance and the BCP arrears on any external
debt that is not recorded under SIGADE. The same 30-day grace period will be applied to all
external payments of public enterprises, except where explicit agreements exist with creditors
on an extended grace period (as the case for some of PETROPAR’s external providers). The
Ministry of Finance will provide the final data on the stock of public sector external arrears
to the Fund, with a lag of not more than 30 days from the test date.
In addition, the government is engaged in good faith efforts to resolve overdue claims in
dispute, and will attempt to negotiate and resolve these as soon as possible. For the purposes
of the program, debt service due by ANDE to Germany’s KFW (known as loan numbers
9736 and 9737), yet to be legalized by Congress, will be considered claims in dispute. In the
meantime, the government will make every effort to speed up their approval in Congress and

- 79 -

transact the payment. Arrears to the South African agency D. B. Pty limited for almost
$22,000 will not be included in the above target unless the appropriate creditor is located.
The government will continue searching for the creditor.

Performance Criterion on Central Government Floating Debt

During the program period, floating debt will be reduced according to the schedule below.
The Ministry of Finance will provide the data to the Fund, with a lag of not more than three
weeks from the test date.

Floating debt is defined as the difference between ‘gasto obligado’ and ‘gasto transferido’ of
the central administration. Gasto obligado is as defined in Article 22 of Law No. 1535
(Financial Administration Law). The commitment to make expenditure (gasto obligado), for
the purposes of the program, will originate at the point at which the relevant unit of the line
ministry or public entity of the central administration receives the claim or bill, provided the
expenditure in question has a budget appropiation or has been authorized by the Treasury.
Disputed bills (where there may be questions of legality or amounts) will not be included
until the dispute has been resolved.
Gasto transferido is defined as the full payment of the commitment (where the payment
process is outlined in Article 37 of Law No. 1535). For the purposes of the program, the
payment is assumed to be made at the point that the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance
makes the order to transfer the funds to the payee’s bank account.
For the case of domestic bonds, any amount placed in a special escrow account available for
use by the BCP (or the payment agent) for transferring to bondholders will be considered a
‘gasto transferido.’ If owners of old bonds eligible for an exchange according to the terms of
Law No. 2336 on public debt restructuring have not voluntarily submitted the bonds for
exchange, the amount of principal and interest payments due but not paid under the new
terms is considered a ‘gasto obligado.’ The amount of principal and interest payments due
but not paid under the old terms is not considered a ‘gasto obligado.’ The difference between
what is due to bondholders implied by the new terms, and the amount in the escrow account
will be considered part of floating debt.
The Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance will provide the data to the Fund,
including an explanation of the amounts and status of any disputed floating debt, as well as
the amounts in the escrow account for domestic bonded debt. This information will be
provided no more than 3 weeks after the test date.

D. Reporting
Monitoring the program requires accurate and timely data. All information on performance
criteria, indicative targets, and balance of payments support loans will be reported to Fund
staff within the timeframes prescribed above. Debt stocks and associated flows broken down
by both creditor and debtor types and maturity will be provided on a quarterly basis.
The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for gathering data on a monthly basis from all
the institutions that comprise the consolidated public sector, including the incorporated
enterprises (Sociedades Anónimas) COPACO and ESSAP. It will compile this information
according to the standard format of the Ministry of Finance’s monthly financial situation
report (Situación Financiera). The data will be supplied to the Fund and published on the
Ministry of Finance’s external website within 30 days of each test date. In addition, specific
public sector institutions (IPS, ANDE, COPACO, ESSAP, Petropar, INC and Conatel,
ANNP, Dinac) will be required to provide to the Fund and publish on the internet monthly
cash flow statements and the full external audit reports of their accounts beginning no later
than June 30, 2004.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 30, 2004
Since issuance of the staff report, the following additional information on recent
developments has become available. This information does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
•

As of Friday, July 23 (one week before the Board meeting), five of seven prior
actions were completed for the second review of Paraguay’s SBA. Another prior
action (regularization of arrears to Banque Worms) was completed on July 27.
Progress on the remaining prior action (completion of the domestic bond exchange) is
well advanced, but will not be completed by July 30. The status of the remaining
prior actions is as follows:
¾ A strategic plan to reform the Undersecretariat for taxation was presented on
July 13, 2004.
¾ On July 23, 2004 the Minister of Finance communicated that budget funds have
been reallocated to increase funding to the tax administration in 2004.
¾ The government reached an agreement with the French government on the
regularization of its past due interest arrears to Banque Worms, paying the first
installment on July 27, 2004.
¾ On July 23, 2004 the government submitted to Congress a draft law to regularize
disputed arrears on a loan to the electricity company ANDE.
¾ Regarding the completion of the domestic bond exchange, as of July 23, 2004 the
authorities had cleared all interest arrears. They have completed the exchange
process for a total of US$76.1 million corresponding to bonds owned by the
financial sector and some individual bondholders. Logistical bottlenecks in
printing and authenticating the new bonds leave the exchange pending for some of
the 2,900 individual bondholders for a remaining total of US$11.5 million still
outstanding.

•

The authorities have informed staff that completion of the exchange for all domestic
bonds presented by June 15 has not been observed, and have indicated their intention
to complete the process by August 9, 2004. Notwithstanding the nonimplementation
of this prior action, staff recommends the completion of the second review by the
Executive Board based on the fact that the delay in implementation arose because the
preparation and liquidation of the bonds, despite the authorities’ efforts, took longer
than originally expected, and that since the finalization of the process will only
require the actual printing, authenticating, and distributing of the new bonds, the
exchange is expected to be completed soon.

-2•

Data have become available on performance for three of the end-June indicative
targets, all of which were observed. NIR was US$1,085 million compared to an
adjusted target of US$843 million; NDA was G/.-4,857 billion, well below the
G/. 3,129 billion ceiling; and the central government floating debt was G/. 105
million, compared to the target ceiling of G/. 320 billion.

•

On July 26, 2004 the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s raised its sovereign
credit rating for Paraguay to B- for long-term foreign currency debt and C for
short-term foreign currency debt from selective default. The upgrade in credit
rating was motivated by the improved macroeconomic and fiscal outlook, as well as
by the near completion of the domestic debt exchange.

•

Tax revenues in June were 57 percent higher than a year earlier, and have
grown 37 percent in the first 21 days of July. Since August 2003, cumulative tax
collections are up 43 percent over the same period in the previous years.

•

The domestic floating debt at end-June was at G/. 105 billion, compared to the
PC of G/. 297 billion proposed for end-August. Arrears of Petropar to suppliers, the
only remaining external arrears, were reduced to US$4 million at end-June.

•

The exchange rate has remained stable, closing at 5,910 guaraníes per dollar on
July 23, 2004. The exchange rate has remained around this level since end-May.

•

Net international reserves have increased to US$1,102 million on July 23, 2004
from US$983 million at end-December 2003. Part of the increase reflects the
central bank’s interventions amounting to US$10 million in foreign exchange in July.

On the basis of the significant progress toward achieving the program objectives and

the staff recommends proceeding with the review as scheduled.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Paraguay
On July 30, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Paraguay.1
Background
The Paraguayan economy is beginning to emerge from a long period of slow growth.
The regional crisis, problems with drought and foot-and-mouth disease in agriculture, and a
banking crisis, all contributed to a drop of 2.3 percent in GDP in 2002. There was a sharp
depreciation of the exchange rate in 2002 and inflation accelerated, reaching 20 percent in early
2003. A bumper harvest produced positive GDP growth of an estimated 2.6 percent in 2003.
Banking system deposits recovered, the exchange rate appreciated against the dollar, and
inflation eased to 9 percent at year-end.
In 2004, the economy has stabilized but growth remains modest. A late season drought
depressed output of soy, the largest export crop, reducing expected agricultural output growth
to near zero, but nonagricultural output is recovering. The guaraní has strengthened by
4 percent against the dollar so far in 2004. The strong guaraní contributed to a sharp fall in
inflation. Year-on-year inflation through June was 5.5 percent, with inflation for the year as a
whole expected at around 4–5 percent.
The fiscal situation has improved markedly since the new government took office in August
2003. The consolidated balance of the nonfinancial public sector moved from a deficit of
3.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to balance in 2003. The primary balance improved from a deficit of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the July 30, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-21.3 percent of GDP in 2002 to a surplus of 2.4 percent in 2003. The government has made
significant progress in clearing substantial public sector payments arrears.
Monetary policy has been geared toward a flexible exchange rate regime since the de facto
currency peg was abandoned in 2001. Official reserves rose by US$342 million—to
US$983 million—during 2003. Base money growth accelerated sharply in 2003, as the
economy began to remonetize after the banking crises. Interest rates on Central Bank bills have
declined from their peak of 33 percent in August 2002, reaching 13 percent by December 2003.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors praised Paraguay’s strong economic performance over the past year, with growth
rebounding and a sharp decline in inflation. The vulnerability of the economy has been reduced
and the country’s credit rating improved, as the authorities increased international reserves,
resolved external payments difficulties, and embarked on courageous fiscal and structural
reforms. In particular, Directors welcomed the approval of the Administrative Reorganization
and Fiscal Adjustment Law and the Customs Code, and the government’s strong determination
to improve governance. They commended the authorities for the remarkable progress in raising
the efficiency of tax and customs collections.
Directors agreed that important challenges nevertheless remain. They encouraged the
authorities to continue to work for the timely passage of the Public Bank Reform Law, to
institutionalize the progress achieved on fiscal sustainability, and to further deepen the reform
effort in areas that are critical to raising Paraguay’s growth performance.
Directors considered that the Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal Adjustment Law, along
with the additional measures announced by the authorities, provides a sound basis for balanced
budgets in the medium term by raising new revenue, broadening the value-added tax (VAT) and
income tax base, eliminating exemptions, and strengthening tax administration. Full
implementation of these measures will also help generate resources for a much-needed
increase in capital investment and social spending. Directors commended the authorities for
raising the efficiency of tax and customs collections, as evidenced by the strong increase in
revenue so far in 2004—with no increase in tax rates. They urged the authorities to
institutionalize these gains by restructuring the tax and customs authorities, and ensuring that
they have the resources needed to carry out fully their responsibilities as defined in the new law.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ tight control of current expenditures and urged continued
prudence, in particular on wage increases. They also stressed that new capital investment and
social spending should be of high quality and well prioritized. Directors encouraged the
authorities to remain firm on resisting pressures for increased spending to stimulate demand, as
this would likely endanger fiscal stability without supporting sustainable increases in growth.
Looking ahead, the authorities should undertake a full-fledged public expenditure reform,
including civil service reform, which will be critical to ensuring long-term sustainability.

-3Directors welcomed the progress in eliminating domestic and external payments arrears, while
urging the authorities to further improve debt monitoring and cash flow procedures, and to
resolve disputed arrears. Directors also welcomed the improvement in the outlook for public
enterprises, but noted that cash flow problems in some of them underscore the need for
continued restructuring. They encouraged the authorities to permit private investment and
management of the public enterprises, and take further measures to improve their governance
and transparency, including through timely completion of the audits of public entities.
Directors welcomed the improvement in the management of monetary policy, as reflected in the
marked decline in inflation and the increase in international reserves. They encouraged the
authorities to continue with preparations for inflation targeting while noting that the ground must
be well-prepared before a move in that direction. In this context, they urged the authorities to
clarify their monetary policy objectives by limiting their interventions in the foreign exchange
market and giving freer play to market forces in determining the exchange rate. They also
encouraged legislation to strengthen the formal independence of the central bank as well as
further development of market-based instruments to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy.
Directors noted that banking system risks have eased, although the level of nonperforming
loans remains high. They stressed that public banking reform, including passage by congress of
the Public Bank Reform Law, remains crucial to further strengthen the system. The authorities
also need to work toward approval of comprehensive banking legislation, extension of a
supervisory regime to cooperatives, and mandatory introduction of international risk
classifications for all banks. Directors supported the authorities’ request for an FSAP.
They commended the authorities’ AML/CFT efforts, and looked forward to the timely enactment
of legislation in this area.
Directors observed that a deepening of the reform effort will be needed to raise Paraguay’s
growth potential and make faster progress, with international support, toward the Millennium
Development Goals. Building on recent commendable progress in strengthening governance,
further efforts are needed to address corruption, reform the judicial system, and restructure the
public sector to increase its professionalism and transparency, and reduce its size and scope.
Programs to promote human capital development will also play an important role in increasing
productivity and growth. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintaining an
open exchange and trade system, and encouraged them to undertake additional actions to
capture unregistered trade.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Paraguay Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the second
review under a SDR 50 million (about US$72.9 million) 15-month Stand-By Arrangement for
Paraguay (see Press Release No. 03/218), which the authorities are treating as precautionary.
In completing the second review, the Executive Board agreed to the authorities’ request for
waivers of the nonobservance of March 2004 quantitative performance criterion on the ceiling of
the wage bill, a May 2004 structural performance criterion on the approval by Congress of the
Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal Adjustment Law, and a waiver of the continuous
performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of new external payments arrears.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Paraguay’s economic performance,
Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Paraguay’s economic performance has improved substantially over the past year. Growth
rebounded in 2003 due to strength in the agricultural sector, and in 2004 the nonagricultural
economy has begun to recover, while inflation has fallen below this year’s target. External
vulnerability has been reduced significantly as a result of the higher-than-expected accumulation
of international reserves, a resolution of the external payments difficulties, and the initiation of
important fiscal and structural reforms.
“The Paraguayan authorities have shown their continued strong commitment to follow through
on the reform agenda supported by the current Stand-By Arrangement, as evidenced by the
recent passage of the Administrative Reorganization and Fiscal Adjustment Law and the
Customs Code. This legislation provides a sound basis for fiscal consolidation in the medium
term, and will help generate resources for essential capital investment in high-quality projects
and increased social spending.
“The authorities have achieved remarkable progress in raising the efficiency of tax and customs
collections. They plan to institutionalize these gains by restructuring the tax and customs
authorities. Current expenditures have been tightly controlled, and it will be important to
continue to resist pressures for increases and maintain prudent wage policies. Steps have been
taken to improve the performance of the public enterprises, including the completion of external

-2-

audits of the main firms, but further efforts are required. Over the medium term, greater private
participation in the investment and management of the public enterprises should be permitted.
“Improved monetary policy management has resulted in lower inflation and higher reserves, and
the authorities are encouraged to continue to strengthen their monetary policy strategy with a
view to moving to formal inflation targeting. Passage of the Public Bank Reform Law will be a
key objective for the authorities in the period ahead as part of their efforts to further strengthen
the banking system. Other important goals will be the approval of comprehensive banking
legislation, the extension of a supervisory regime to cooperatives, and mandatory introduction of
international risk classifications in all banks.
“Continued structural reform and human capital development—along with support from the
international community—will be needed to raise GDP growth, reduce poverty, and enable
Paraguay to move towards the Millennium Development Goals. The authorities are to be
commended for making an impressive start on these endeavors, and have shown strong
leadership and commitment in implementing difficult reforms, including in the governance
area,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Guillermo Le Fort, Executive Director for Paraguay and
Dimas R. Ayala, Advisor to Executive Director
July 30, 2004

Key points
•

The implementation of the ambitious reform program addressing the long-term
weaknesses and placing the country in a path of sustainable growth is on track.

•

Paraguay has made significant progress towards achieving long-term fiscal
sustainability and clearing arrears on public debt. Standard and Poor’s raised the
country’s long-term foreign currency credit rating from “SD” to “B-”.

•

The authorities are fully committed to continue with the implementation of sound and
prudent policies, as well as to persist advancing with the reform agenda. The
enhancement of the institutions’ capacity and improvement in governance and
transparency are key priorities for the Government.

1.
On behalf of the Paraguayan authorities, we would like to express our appreciation to
the staff for the very useful policy discussions and valuable recommendations during this
Article IV Consultation and Program Review. As the staff clearly highlights, the ambitious
reform program of the new government supported by the SBA, remains on track and is
reaching its main objectives to reduce the long-term weaknesses and place the country in a
path of sustainable growth. It is important to mention that the authorities are strongly
committed to pursue the adjustments and reforms outlined in the program, even against the
resistance of powerful vested interests. The high degree of public credibility commanded by
the government, and especially its economic team, has been key to attain the necessary
support for crucial reforms. The approval of the Bank Resolution Law and the reform of the
public sector pension system late last year, and the fiscal adjustment law, and the new
customs code this year highlight the government’s effective ownership of the program.
2.
The outstanding implementation of the economic program, the improvements in the
regional and global conditions, a better political environment, and a good harvest in the
agricultural sector were the main factors that contributed to the economic recovery in 2003.
Real GDP grew by 2.6 percent, after years of stagnation, and inflation fell to 9.3 percent from
14.6 percent in 2002. The continuing authorities’ efforts in implementing sound
macroeconomic policies and reforms are ensuring a good economic performance again in
2004. Despite the adverse weather conditions that severely affected the soy harvest, the
main crop export, GDP growth is projected to be around 2 percent in 2004, within an
environment of low inflation, fiscal balance, and a continued improvement in the external
position.
3.
Almost all end-March quantitative performance criteria were observed. The ceiling
on the central government wage bill was missed by a very small margin (Gs. 18MMM above

-2the program target of Gs. 650MMM) as a result of a decision by Parliament to increase
wages for security services; however, there were compensatory savings in other areas of
current expenditure. Unfortunately, new debt arrears, that were promptly cleared afterwards,
accumulated in the cement company INC and the continuous performance criterion was not
observed. The authorities have intensified their efforts to avoid future deviations by
enhancing monitoring procedures for debt service and extending its coverage to all the public
entities.
4.
The Government obtained the necessary political support for the approval of the very
ambitious fiscal reform law. The passing of the Fiscal Law that includes the widening of the
VAT base, the elimination of exemptions, and the introduction of the personal income tax, is
a significant step forward towards the formalization of the economy, the reduction of
corruption and tax evasion, and the elimination of distortions. Moreover, our authorities are
already implementing compensatory measures for the proposed actions that were not
included in the law finally passed by Congress. Other structural performance criteria, such as
the application of international accounting standards and annual external audits of the central
bank, the full application of the public procurement law, and fuel price adjustment, were also
observed. The new Customs code, originally programmed to be approved by Congress on
August 31, 2004 was passed on June 30, 2004. In addition, all, but one, of the prior actions
for this review were met, again showing the authorities’ strong efforts and determination to
implement the Fund supported economic strategy. The exchange of all domestic bonds
presented by June 15, 2004 is well advanced, but has not yet been fully completed due to
logistical reasons (bonds exist in physical form), and the authorities expect the process to be
completed in a few days.
5.
The elimination of all the arrears is also a central objective of the program and an
important reason for the authorities’ efforts to achieving long-term fiscal sustainability. In
this vein, strong progress has been observed, while bilateral arrears were cleared well in
advance of the program’s timetable. On the other hand, the authorities are actively
maintaining negotiations to resolve any disputed debts with external creditors. Regarding the
restructuring of domestic bonds, the government has cleared all the interest arrears for the
bonds presented by June 15, and the remaining interest on bonds not yet presented for
exchange are deposited in escrow account in the Central Bank. Almost 90 percent of the old
bonds already submitted were exchanged for the new ones or are available for the owners.
The remaining bonds are in the process of being produced, which entails complicated
logistics that takes several days, including the signing of each individual bond by the
Minister of Finance, but once completed they will be immediately exchanged. Progress in
this regard has been crucial to get Paraguayan long-term foreign currency debt raised from
SD (Selective Default) to “B-” (Outlook stable). Standard and Poor’s upgraded the rating
following the explanation that “the actual exchange bonds is currently taking place and
formally cures this government’s default”, which was the cause of the downgrading on
February, 2003.
6.
Paraguay has made substantial progress towards achieving a sustainable fiscal
position. A combination of measures such as excise tax increases on diesel fuel, improved
tax and custom administration, tough spending control, and actions aimed to reduce tax

-3evasion and combat corruption in the public and private sector, along with the upturn in the
economy have contributed to increase revenues and obtain the envisaged reduction of the
central government deficit to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2003. Improvement in public enterprises
management, timely adjustments of prices for utilities and fuels, as well as the positive effect
of the appreciation of the local currency on their financing costs allowed to obtain an
operating surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP in public enterprises in 2003, which enabled the
consolidated public sector overall balance.
7.
The permanent effort in strengthening tax and custom administration has been the
main factor for the strong performance in revenues collections again this year.
Implementation of the public pension system reform law approved early this year will
generate net fiscal savings for about ½ percent of GDP, this as well as the recent approval of
the Fiscal Adjustment Law are crucial to place the country in a path of long-term fiscal
sustainability, while giving space for the increased allocation of needed capital spending and
social investment. The public sector debt to GDP ratio is projected to fall to 43 percent in
2004 from around 50 percent of GDP in 2003.
8.
The prudent monetary policy is reflected in the low inflation and the higher than
expected accumulation of international reserves obtained so far. Helped by a further
appreciation of the guarani in 2004, due to favorable terms of trade, the weakening of the
U.S. dollar in international markets, and the reversal of capital outflows, inflation reached
only 1.9 percent during the first six months of 2004, annual inflation fell to 5.5 percent, on
track for the year-end program target of 8 percent. The authorities have considered
appropriate to intervene actively in the foreign market to moderate the appreciation of the
guarani. This action enabled the Central Bank to increase the level of international reserves
to 1.102 million at July 23, 2004, well above the original program target for end-2004.
9.
Given the reduction of inflation and the existing macroeconomic conditions, the
Central Bank has lowered interest rates on short-term instruments, and plans to continue
moving in that direction to the extent that inflationary pressures permit it. This allows to
reduce the Bank’s own financing costs while encouraging commercial banks to increase their
lending to the private sector. Liquidity is already significant in the banking system and the
authorities are also considering incentives to develop longer-term deposit instruments in
financial institutions.
10.
The authorities intend to continue pursuing their efforts to strengthen the financial
system, including the largest financial cooperatives through enhanced supervision and
regulations. In this regard, they have requested a FSAP that should contribute significantly
in assessing existing vulnerabilities. Their recommendations will be very important, and our
authorities would like to consider them in the banking system legislation that they are
preparing. Despite some progress observed in the management and the financial conditions
of the Public National Development Bank (BNF), our authorities consider imperative the
restructuring of the institution to enhance its efficiency and to reduce the fiscal burden it
represents. They are strongly committed to obtain approval of the public banking law by
end-October 2004.

-411.
Advancing steadily with the structural reform agenda remains a priority. The
authorities are aware that improving the capacity of the institutions and developing a clear
and transparent regulatory framework is deemed crucial for laying the basis for sustained
growth. At this respect, the authorities agree with the staff that corruption has been an
important burden on growth weakening the business environment. Since the new
administration took office, strong actions and measures to increase transparency and reduce
corruption have been taken. The staff clearly points out the significant advances in that
direction, including the appointment in key positions of competent officials knowing for their
integrity, professionalism, and independency. Their participation has been crucial for the
substantial improvements in tax and tariff revenues recently observed.
12.
Likewise, the recently approved Customs Code will be a key element to improve the
efficiency of an institution characterized in the past by corruption and mismanagement.
Significant steps have also been taken to improve both the legal framework and its
enforcement to combat illegal activities. The new procurement system law is implemented in
all public sector agencies, and good progress on the independent audits of public enterprises
can be observed. In addition, the credibility on the judicial system has improved since the
renewal of the Supreme Court early this year.
13.
It is important to emphasize that the measures and reforms being implemented by the
Government are not easy tasks. Many of those actions have affected powerful vested
interests, thus, tough and complex negotiations were and are needed to implement them. The
public and political support obtained so far, will be difficult to maintain in case there is no
sufficient progress in terms of growth, employment and poverty reduction. To this end, and
taking advantage of the revenue over performance, the authorities are developing welltargeted projects to increase capital and social spending. Better employment opportunities,
growth prospects, and social indicators are important objectives that the program should also
deliver. The authorities consider the support of the international community is crucial in this
process and request continued cooperation and support in order to achieve the country’s
economic objectives.
