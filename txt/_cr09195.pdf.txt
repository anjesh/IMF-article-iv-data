IRELAND
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Ireland
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
May 20, 2009

Executive Summary
Given its serious internal imbalances, Ireland was especially vulnerable to the recent
global shocks. Overextension in construction and financial intermediation, along with loss of
international competitiveness, has meant that the impact will be sizeable. Cumulatively, GDP
is projected to contract by 13½ percent through 2010, the largest among advanced economies.
Thereafter, as the present dislocations gradually correct themselves, only a modestly-paced
recovery is foreseen. The incipient decline in wages will need to be sustained to help redress
Ireland’s cost disadvantage.
Rapid progress on bank restructuring is critical to reestablishing a healthy financial
sector. With banks facing liquidity pressures and sizeable losses, the authorities have taken
important steps to stabilize the financial system—through the blanket guarantee to depositors
and creditors and the recapitalization of banks. ECB credit lines have provided valuable
liquidity. The proposed National Asset Management Agency is potentially the right
mechanism to separate the good from the bad assets. Its success requires a comprehensive
and realistic assessment of impaired assets. The authorities’ efforts to press ahead with
supportive regulatory and supervisory measures will help manage the current stress and lower
the risk of future crises.
Fiscal consolidation has begun—and requires a sustained effort. The authorities’ sense of
urgency is welcome. Such, however, has been the collapse of revenues that the 2009 deficit
could reach 12 percent of GDP. The authorities recognize that the execution of their
ambitious consolidation plan will require a continuing commitment to address sensitive
expenditures, including the public wage bill and the scope of social welfare programs. The
consolidation will be more credible the more tightly it is tied to monitorable goals.

I. THE CONTEXT1
1.
Ireland’s ongoing painful adjustment reflects the unwinding of critical internal
imbalances. Since the start of the decade, and especially from 2005 to 2007, easy credit
fostered a property bubble, bank exposures to property lending soared while reliance on
wholesale funding intensified, and international competitiveness was compromised as wages
climbed rapidly. On all these dimensions, Ireland had become remarkably vulnerable
(Figure 1). Yet, dazzling growth and buoyant public revenues prompted tax reductions and
expansion of public expenditures that have proved unsustainable. Various commentators and
the IMF in its Article IV consultations did warn that the seemingly-unstoppable growth
masked serious imbalances, including the fragility of public finances.
2.
As the global turmoil has unfolded, Ireland has benefited from the safety
provided by its membership in the eurozone. This has allowed it to avoid the currency
pressures that typically accompany financial crises. Moreover, access to ECB financing has
been an important source of liquidity for the banking sector. However, since the possibility of
adjusting through the depreciation of its own exchange rate is not available, further wage
reductions will be required to restore competitiveness and growth prospects.
3.
The Irish authorities have moved with resolve to counter the severe economic and
financial shocks—that resolve will need to be sustained. Recognizing the vulnerabilities
that rendered the economy particularly susceptible to the unprecedented events since the onset
of the global financial crisis, the authorities have acted to contain the damage. At the same
time, they have introduced initiatives to repair the financial and fiscal systems. To bear fruit,
these efforts will require determined execution over several years. Robust policy instruments
that allow the flexibility to deal with surprises and the self-discipline of transparent
benchmarks will help stay the course.
4.

The priorities are clear:

•

Decisive efforts to restore healthy functionality of the financial sector are essential to
prevent festering problems and an anemic economy.

•

To be sustained, fiscal consolidation measures should be underpinned by a structure of
rules and accountability within which politically-sensitive trade-offs can be made.

5.
A continued search for pragmatic policy initiatives will be needed in the face of
acute policy dilemmas. Financial support to banks is necessary but adds to the fiscal burden.
Reducing fiscal deficits is needed to maintain credibility with markets but deepens the
economic contraction. Expenditure reduction, as distinct from raising taxes, is the superior
approach to fiscal consolidation but, unless carefully managed and prioritized, risks hurting the
most vulnerable.

II. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
6.
The economic contraction started in early 2008 and then rapidly accelerated.
GDP grew at a brisk 6 percent in 2007. However growth began to slow with a deceleration in
housing construction in early 2008, even while parts of the eurozone, notably Germany, were
still in the last phases of the previous up cycle. As elsewhere, the pace of contraction
accelerated following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September. Recent data on housing
starts, retail sales, and the Purchasing Manager’s Index project further deceleration in 2009.

A. The Near-Term Dynamics
7.
From 2008 through 2010, the Irish economy is projected to contract by about
13½ percent. Following a decline in GDP of 2¼ percent in 2008, staff projects that GDP will
shrink by 8½ percent in 2009 and by a

an equal decline in net exports since imports are also falling rapidly. However, the smaller
volume of exports will add to unemployment, which is expected to exceed 12 percent by end2009 and reach 15½ percent in 2010. Some discouraged workers are simply leaving the labor
force. These employment trends, along with the anticipated additional decline in nominal
wages and the high degree of uncertainty, are expected to pull consumption down sharply.

8.
The authorities agree that the risks remain significant. The risks arise from the
continuing interaction of slowing growth, financial sector stress, and the state of public
finances, with each threatening to pull the other down. If the distress in the financial sector is
larger than currently estimated, this damaging reinforcement could accelerate. Ireland also
remains susceptible to disruptions from further external shocks.
9.
Ireland faces risks from global deleveraging. Continued financial stress in the
United States and the United Kingdom could result in large losses for Irish banks that are
exposed to the U.S. and the U.K. financial markets. Also, the deleveraging following global
losses of international banks could imply sizeable capital outflows from Ireland by foreign
banks with subsidiaries or branches re-focusing credit provision in their home markets. Given
Ireland’s relatively small size in the global context, Irish banks’ deleveraging is not likely to
generate noteworthy international impulses unless the banks’ medium-tern losses were much
larger than currently anticipated.

7
10.
The bleak short-term outlook and the projection of only a modest pace of
medium-term recovery follow from two considerations. First, Irish output was more than
7 percent above potential in mid-2007 (Box 1). This large gap had emerged due to a burst of
activity in the construction and financial intermediation sectors, starting in 2005. Correcting
this output gap (“bubble”) implies a substantial short-term adjustment. Second, staff analysis
shows that after strong growth between 1987 and 2001, which earned Ireland the moniker of
the “Celtic Tiger,” potential growth had steadily eroded. From a high of 6 percent a year at its
peak, potential growth was down to just under 3 percent a year when the crisis hit. Moreover,
the correction of distortions induced by the nexus of property and financial developments will
further pull down potential growth in the immediate future before it rises back to the
2 percent range by the close of the projection period in 2014. The authorities estimate
potential growth at about 2½ percent, and see more of a bounce-back potential in 2011 and
2012. They agreed, however, that these differences do not alter the policy priorities.

11.
Inflation is falling. With the increasing output gap between 2005 and 2007, Irish
inflation rose significantly above the
eurozone rate. In 2008, the output gap

inflation to decline further by a ¼ percent,
while the authorities project a small increase in prices.

12.
Falling inflation brings benefits and risks. In the recent past, Ireland’s relatively
high inflation kept real interest rates low, fuelling the exuberance. Now, Irish prices appear
set to decline faster than in the rest of the eurozone. This will help competitiveness, but
comes with its own risks. As yet, deflation—or a persistent and large decrease in the price
level—is not a threat. However, the projected fall in prices will imply higher real interest
rates than in the eurozone, which will dampen the next economic cycle. Given the priority to
budget consolidation, a fiscal offset to the dampening will not be feasible, and a credible
consolidation would need to lay the basis for a return to healthy expansion.

8

Box 1. Decomposing Irish Growth
Standard techniques, such as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, tend to miss the phenomenon of
“overheating” or “bubbles,” treating them as part of the trend rather than unsustainable deviations. Staff
analysis has relied, therefore, on a more direct identification of the output gap. Kalman filtering allows
the decomposition of trends in GDP into the output gap, which is identified by a set of economicallyplausible correlates, and the underlying potential output growth.

The HP filter concludes that potential growth rate increased steadily from 1971. The high estimate of
potential growth leads also to the conclusion that output was at potential in 2007-08, missing the entire
overheating phase. As such, in the HP estimates, the loss in potential due, for example, to adverse FDI
trends is masked by the rise of the property-finance nexus, which must now substantially contract. In
contrast, by staff’s estimates, potential GDP growth fell from an annual average rate of 6 percent
between 1987 and 2001 to just under 4 percent in the years since then. Within this more recent period,
the analysis points to a steady decline, ending in 2008 with the potential growth rate below 3 percent
and output significantly above potential.

B. Competitiveness
13.
Irish competitiveness and potential growth have been generally well-matched.
The 1986-2001 period of the “miracle” was characterized by improving competitiveness and
rising potential growth (Figure 2). Wage moderation, given Ireland’s highly-open economy,
supported the miracle.2 Then, as unit labor costs rose, potential output growth steadily
declined. Wages rose rapidly despite the traditional flexibility and openness to immigrants. A
key factor in this wage rise was generous increases in public wages. In this context, the recent
tendency of wages to decline, if sustained, will help regain competitiveness.
14.
International market shares have fallen sharply. Following several years of
increase, Ireland’s international market shares have declined with the rise in unit labor costs
and fall in potential growth. This decline is evident since 2002 for all of Ireland’s major
market destinations. Irish

sterling against the euro is
having an adverse impact on Irish exports not just to the U.K. market but also in third
markets.
15.
Similarly, Ireland has lost market share in the global and eurozone flows of FDI.
FDI inflows into the eurozone have tended to fall as a share of world FDI flows (Figure 3).
However, Irish FDI shares have fallen faster. In recent years, Ireland has become the most
expensive location in the eurozone, with the possible exception of Luxembourg (Figure 4).
The transformation from a location for low-cost manufacturing to a center for high valueadded production and services is ongoing. However, research shows that FDI flows to a
country are highly influenced by recent momentum—increased global competition for FDI
implies that task for Ireland is increasingly harder.

An application of the CGER methodology shows Ireland faces a significant
competitive disadvantage. The actual real exchange rate is presently about 20 percent above
its long-term average. In contrast, factors such as productivity gain have only modestly raised
the equilibrium exchange rate, which is about 5 percent above its long-term average, leaving
a 15 percent gap. Entry into the eurozone at a favorable exchange rate allowed some years of
competitive strength.

market shares. The
other two CGER-type measures show somewhat smaller gaps. These depend sensitively on
estimates of the “underlying” current account balance, calculated to be about 4½ percent of
GDP (as it was in 2008) and the elasticity of adjustment to the real effective exchange rate.
17.
While the authorities concurred that there had been a significant loss in
competitiveness, they had a more optimistic prognosis. In particular, they viewed recent
nominal wage cuts as a reflection of Irish labor market flexibility, creating the potential to
recover competitiveness. The authorities also pointed to the relative resilience of Irish
chemical and pharmaceutical exports in recent quarters. Staff pointed out that adjustments to
various degrees were also occurring in other countries but agreed that, if sustained, the recent
wage and price trends would improve Irish competitiveness. As such, the current account
deficit in 2014 is projected at 1½ percent of GDP, significantly lower than the present
“underlying” deficit, though higher than near balance expected in the short term because of
severe demand compression. Staff recommended that competition policy and the mandate of
the Competition Authority be used to support the process of price and wage adjustment.3
III. MANAGING FINANCIAL SECTOR STRESS
18.
Domestic vulnerabilities have interacted rapidly with the global financial crisis.
Domestic vulnerabilities are revealed in the sharp decline in the stock prices of Irish banks
relative to the overall stock index, the pronounced degree of this fall differentiating Ireland
from other eurozone banks (Figure 1). Three key features of the financial system have been
central to the strains they are facing.

The OECD concludes that more is needed, for example, to boost competition in network industries and
sheltered service sectors (OECD Economic Surveys: Ireland, volume 2008/5).

In the past, profitability was maintained through large lending volumes. But since
domestic deposit growth did not keep up with the lending targets, reliance on
wholesale funding increased, reflected in the rise of the loan-to-deposit ratio. With the
recent downturn, market funding pressures have been compounded by lack of growth
in deposits.

•

The government’s guarantee to depositors and creditors and the capital injections
have helped banks obtain market funding, and access to ECB facilities has been an
important stabilizing factor.

The authorities’ extensive and ongoing support has been vital to maintain
financial stability.
•

On September 30, 2008, following the failure of Lehman Brothers, the government
provided a blanket guarantee to the depositors and creditors of six domestic banks.4
The guarantee, covering over 200 percent of Irish GDP, is much larger than in other
countries.

•

Anglo Irish Bank was nationalized in January 2009. And, on February 11, 2009, the
authorities announced the injection of €7.0 billion into the two largest banks—Bank
of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank—totaling 4 percent of GDP. The scale of the capital
injections is, thus far, in line with similar efforts elsewhere.

•

Finally, the authorities’ decision, announced in the April supplementary budget, to
establish the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), marks a significant step
in beginning the process of bank restructuring.
A. Bank Restructuring

20.
Estimates of losses being faced by banks vary but are likely to be sizeable. On a
gross basis, staff’s review of available estimates and methodologies suggests that the losses
faced by banks through the end of 2010 could be about €35 billion, or about 20 percent of
GDP. The authorities did not formally produce any estimate for aggregate bank losses. They
have focused on the needed restructuring of property-development loans, which they rightly
view as at the heart of stress faced by banks. Staff noted that losses are likely to extend
beyond the property-development sector as the economy weakens and the design of NAMA
should incorporate that possibility.
21.
As the authorities recognize, translating NAMA from concept to reality is
pivotal to the orderly restructuring of the financial sector and limiting long-term
damage to the economy. NAMA is to purchase property-development assets with a book
value of between €80 and €90 billion from banks that are supported by the government’s
guarantee. (The total assets of the guaranteed banks are €440 billion.) Since the assets are to
be purchased at less than their book value, the resulting losses will require the authorities to
inject more capital into some banks. If well managed, the distressed assets acquired by
NAMA could, over time, produce a recovery value to compensate for the initial fiscal
outlays. NAMA’s success will also be the precondition for a safe exit from the guarantee to
creditors and depositors, which recent experience shows can be a long-drawn process unless

22.
A key aspect of NAMA’s success will be the prices at which the assets are
purchased. This will determine the extent to which banks’ losses are transferred to the
taxpayer. Since price determination is a major challenge, risk-sharing structures could be
usefully explored. For example, if sold at a price that is clearly lower than the expected
eventual recovery value, bank shareholders could be given a share in the upside. Similarly,
the government could be given an opportunity to participate in the upside of the residual
healthy bank. The authorities noted that they remained open to a number of refinements,
including such upfront risk-sharing structures. Also, while there has been some public
discussion of a bank-specific ex post “claw back” provision, the authorities are considering
an industry-wide levy to recoup any losses suffered by NAMA.

23.
With the economic uncertainties that lie ahead, staff emphasized two strategic
implications for the design and operation of NAMA. If the banks are not fully relieved of
their impaired assets—are not “cleaned up”—their return to normal functioning will be
delayed. As such, a full scoping out of the likely distress is needed and a flexible legislative
authorization and operational approach should permit NAMA to deal with further
deterioration in bank balance sheets. For these reasons, staff advised that the authorities not
restrict the focus of NAMA on property-development loans. Other asset classes could
deteriorate as the economy continues to contract and unemployment rises. The sharp ongoing
rise in troubled loans is a warning that this possibility needs to be seriously considered.

19
24.
The authorities took note of these considerations for their further deliberations
on setting up NAMA. They agreed that piecemeal efforts could keep banks dependent on
official support and unable to resume normal functioning. The Japanese experience is
particularly cautionary. The authorities saw merit in staff’s suggestion that NAMAimplementing legislation should encompass a broader range of loan types.5
25.
Staff noted that nationalization could become necessary but should be seen as
complementary to NAMA. Where the size of its impaired assets renders a bank critically
undercapitalized or insolvent, the only real option may be temporary nationalization. Recent
Fund advice in this regard is: “Insolvent institutions (with insufficient cash flows) should be
closed, merged, or temporarily placed in public ownership until private sector solutions can
be developed ... there have been numerous instances (for example, Japan, Sweden and the
United States), where a period of public ownership has been used to cleanse balance sheets
and pave the way to sales back to the private sector.”6 Having taken control of the bank, the
shareholders would be fully diluted in the interest of protecting the taxpayer and thus
preserving the political legitimacy of the initiative. The bad assets would still be carved out,
but the thorny issue of purchase price would be less important, and the period of price
discovery longer, since the transactions are between two government-owned entities. The
management of the full range of bad assets would proceed under the NAMA structure.
Nationalization could also be used to effect needed mergers in the absence of more far
reaching resolution techniques.
26.
The authorities prefer that banks stay partly in private ownership to provide
continued market pricing of their underlying assets. They disagreed with the staff’s view
that pricing of bad assets would be any easier under nationalization. They were also
concerned that nationalization may generate negative sentiment with implications for the
operational integrity of the banks. Staff emphasized nationalization would need to be
accompanied by a clear commitment to operate the banks in a transparent manner on a
commercial basis. In particular, nationalized banks should be subject to the same capital
requirements and supervisory oversight as non-nationalized banks. And, a clear exit strategy
to return the banks to private operation would be needed.

5

To staff’s query regarding the acquisition by NAMA of “good” property-development assets, the authorities
responded that markets needed to be reassured that this asset class was fully dealt with.

B. Supporting Measures
27.
Accompanying these immediate crisis management tasks are several supportive
crisis prevention measures. These fall into two broad categories: (a) a framework for bank
resolution; and (b) enhancements to supervision. Guided by evolving global and European
Union norms, the authorities are engaged in tailoring these to domestic circumstances.
28.
A broader tool kit should allow for more speedy and less disruptive resolution of
banks. When faced with an insolvent bank, Irish authorities can place the bank in a courtsupervised insolvency proceeding. To avoid the disruption that this entails for the customers
of the bank and to preserve confidence in the system, special legislation was passed allowing
the authorities to nationalize Anglo Irish Bank.7 The authorities were open to exploring the
merits of a special bank resolution regime. Such a regime would recognize the unique role
played by banks in the economy and give the authorities the power to quickly transfer assets
and deposits to another institution (a purchase-and-assumption transaction) or to establish a
bridge bank (a new limited life bank into which the old bank is transferred to facilitate its
sale). The experience with Northern Rock prompted the U.K. to adopt a special resolution
regime to add flexibility in dealing with insolvent banks. The enhanced deposit protection
under the European Union guidelines would also strengthen the safety net.
29.
The authorities are undertaking several supervisory and regulatory initiatives.
First, they reported substantial additions of staff enabling them to intensify bank-by-bank
surveillance for systemic risks. In this regard, they noted that since January 1, 2003, the
concept of a distinct International Financial Services Center no longer exists. Second, they
had already moved in establishing a macro-prudential supervisory process that blends
considerations of systemic stability with managing the stress in individual financial
institutions, in line with the de Larosière report.8 The authorities agreed that success of this
initiative would require further investment in the development of early warning systems and
identification of systemic risks, along with necessary precautionary actions. Finally, further
safeguards are needed to limit the risks of related-party lending by banks. The authorities are
implementing a requirement for the disclosure of related-party exposures. Safeguards should
lower the applicable limits, specify non-favorable terms for the transactions, and require strict
approval procedures.

7

If needed, the government will compensate the shareholders following a valuation assessment.

IV. ACHIEVING FISCAL CREDIBILITY
30.
Well before the crisis hit, public finances had developed serious structural
weaknesses. The facts are well known. In the boom years, personal income tax rates were
lowered and expenditure grew rapidly (at about the highest pace among OECD economies).
Buoyant property-related revenues (stamp duties, VAT, and capital-related taxes) masked the
growing structural deficit, which reached 12½ percent of GDP in 2008 (Box 3). To the
authorities’ credit, some revenues were set aside in the National Pensions Reserve Fund
(NPRF). The NPRF is being used for bank recapitalization needs. This, however, has diluted
its primary role as a cushion for long-term obligations related to the aging population, to
which it would need to return.

31.
Regaining credible control over public finances will require a steady hand over
several years. With the large looming deficits, the task of consolidation presents formidable
challenges. The needed consolidation comes at a moment when the economy is undergoing
substantial contraction and prices are likely to fall for a number of quarters. The
consolidation will help the recovery only if it generates confidence that a fundamentallystrong reorientation of government priorities is under way. If not done right, the downturn
could worsen. This, in turn, will require a substantial effort to scale back the scope of
government activities and to improve the efficiency of government services. The tax base
must be broadened, while limiting the impact on unit labor costs.

22
Box 3. Ireland’s Structural Deficit
In the economic upswing, asset-based taxes came to be regarded as a stable source of revenues.
However, these have proven to be largely temporary. In 2007, when the headline budget was in
balance, the staff’s estimate is that adjusting for the large positive output gap and the effect of the asset
price bubble, the structural deficit was about 8¾ percent of GDP. An expansionary budget in 2008
widened the structural deficit to 12½ percent of GDP. Following the April 2009 supplementary
budget, the structural deficit remains at about 11 percent of GDP in 2009. It is from this base that the
challenges ahead must be addressed.

A. The Consolidation Objectives and Debt Dynamics
32.
The authorities have embarked on a substantial consolidation plan. Following the
sharp deceleration of growth and revenues, the fiscal deficit threatened to reach 15 percent of
GDP, which compares with Ireland’s record 17½ percent of GDP in 1978. In a series of steps,
the authorities have taken significant consolidation measures: revenue measures of about
1 percent of GDP—with the bulk coming from a levy on personal incomes—were announced

23
with the original 2009 budget in October 2008; expenditure savings of a further 1 percent of
GDP, centered on reducing the public service wage bill through a pension levy for public
sector workers were announced in February 2009; and, finally, a supplementary budget was
unveiled on April 7 (Text Table 2). Based on these measures, the authorities project deficits
of 10¾ percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, with a goal of reaching below 3 percent of GDP by
2013. Because of weaker growth projections and also continued lowering of the price level in
2010, staff projects deficits of 11¾ percent of GDP in 2009 and 12¾ percent in 2010.

The basic approach and elements of the plan are appropriate.

Measures thus far focus
more on tax increases,
particularly on the middleand upper-income earners.
In the context of the severe

while also protecting the

begins a necessary process
of returning tax rates to

In the following years, the goal is to rely more on expenditure, particularly on current
expenditure cuts, in line with the empirical evidence on their importance of sustaining
consolidations and even providing some expansionary benefits.

34.
Staff’s baseline implies stronger expenditure consolidation than that currently
projected by the authorities to reach their goals. Starting from a higher projected deficit in
2009 and using a more pessimistic forecast for revenues, staff’s baseline deficit in 2013
would be 4 percent of GDP versus the authorities target of 2½ percent of GDP in that year. A
further plausible consolidation in 2014 would bring the deficit below the authorities’ target to
1½ percent of GDP. In sum, over 2009-14, staff’s baseline would imply that primary
expenditures are brought down by 9½ percent of GDP while revenue measures of about
3¾ percent of GDP would offset further declines in property-related taxes and raise overall
revenues by about 2½ percent of GDP.
35.
Public debt would stabilize at relatively high levels. Excluding the costs likely to
be incurred for supporting the financial system, staff’s consolidation path would stabilize the
public debt at over 80 percent of GDP by 2014, only somewhat higher than that of the
authorities’ target of 77 percent of GDP by 2013. Reducing the deficit to zero and, especially,
reducing debt to below the Maastricht ceiling of 60 percent of GDP would require much
deeper measures than currently envisaged (Figure 5 and Appendix I). The debt to be incurred
to support the financial sector remains uncertain. If the losses suffered by banks are about
20 percent of GDP, as estimated by staff, then bank recapitalization needs could be around
12-15 percent of GDP. Gross public debt could rise by about that much. The authorities and
staff agreed assets would be acquired against this debt and the approach to consolidation
would remain largely the same.
36.
Financing needs are substantial in the near term. Financing needs for the fiscal
deficit and public debt rollover are projected at about €25 billion for 2009 and €22 billion for
2010. Having issued bonds to the tune of about €12 billion since the start of the year, the
authorities currently have about €25 billion in cash balances plus about €15 billion in liquid
assets in the NPRF. The authorities have used some part of the NPRF resources towards the
recapitalization of banks. In addition, through their guarantee, the authorities will also
support the rollover of banks short-term debt.

B. Consolidation Strategies
37.
The international evidence is clear: fiscal adjustment should focus on
expenditure cuts. While there

and especially to broaden the

38.
Social welfare expenditures must better target the vulnerable. The authorities
recognize that it will be necessary to articulate a strategy that moves away from universalism
in social welfare to one that relies more on targeting and incentives. In this regard, means
testing or taxation of child benefits is under discussion. Consideration could also be given to
earned income tax credits as a way of supporting lower income families, as also to the
indexing of benefits to more appropriate price baskets. Also, a more nuanced minimum wage
structure that allows, for example, for age-related differentials could help competitiveness
and also reduce social transfers.
39.
Despite the recent reduction further cuts in the public service wage bill are likely
to be inevitable. Public sector remuneration now lies above private sector levels in most
areas. In 2006, the Economic and Social Research Institute concludes, the public sector pay
premium was above 20 percent. International comparisons also suggest that public sector
wages in Ireland are higher than in other advanced economies. The authorities noted that an
effective wage reduction of 7.5 percent was undertaken earlier this year by the application of
the pension levy, and a wage freeze is in effect through 2010, but agreed with staff that
consolidation on the scale needed is unlikely to be accomplished without a further lowering
of the public wage bill.

A review of public service employment is needed. Between 2000 and 2008, while
total employment grew at an annual rate of 3 percent, public administration and defense
employment grew at

provision and its cost effectiveness is called for. More generally, greater efforts to obtain
value for money are going to be important.

41.
On the tax side, broadening the base is the key challenge. As noted by the OECD,
Ireland has steadily increased tax relief on mortgage interest payments while having virtually
no property taxation. In combination, these have generated strong incentives for home
ownership and encouraged the housing boom. The authorities noted that the recent budget
took steps toward limiting tax relief on mortgage interest and signaled the likely introduction
of property taxation. While long overdue, significant administrative challenges arise in the
implementation of property taxation. In this regard, staff suggested that Ireland has scope for
raising social security contributions, even recognizing that this would raise the tax wedge.
Staff concurred with the authorities that given the already high VAT rates, there were limits
to raising revenues through indirect taxes.
42.
To stay on course, the proposed consolidation will require robust institutional
support. The work of the Commission on Taxation and the Special Group of Public Service
Numbers and Expenditure Programs will be important. In this regard, a fiscal rule can create
the basis of a public commitment to fiscal prudence. This would be valuable for navigating
the ongoing politically-sensitive consolidation and maintaining long-term fiscal policy
stability. In the context of the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact, a statutory
commitment to a medium-term objective of close to structural balance would be appropriate.
This would need to be supported by a medium-term expenditure framework that outlines a
detailed time path of expenditure reductions. Transparency and mechanisms to ensure the
review of these objectives would limit the risk that they are diluted. While the authorities
were supportive of such a rules-based framework, they were less sure of how quickly it could
be implemented.

28
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The Irish economy is in the midst of an unprecedented economic correction. The
stress exceeds that being faced currently by any other advanced economy and matches
episodes of the most severe economic distress in post-World War II history. Banks face
extensive losses and double-digit fiscal deficits over the next three years will imply a run up
in public debt. The short-term dislocations come on top of a sharp decline in potential
growth, implying a modest pace of recovery.
44.
The risks remain significant. Market sentiment has improved and Irish sovereign
spreads have come down from their highs. The reduction in public sector wages has been
accompanied by a decline in private wages, which if sustained would help competitiveness in
the medium term. But the recent research is clear. Financial crises generate deeper and more
prolonged downturns, and more so if the crisis is globally synchronized. In a weakened Irish
economy, adverse global economic and financial events would be disruptive.
45.
On the two fronts that matter most, the authorities have moved in the right
direction. Most recently, the proposed establishment of NAMA offers the prospect of
extracting distressed assets from the banks, a precondition for their return to healthy
functionality. They have also laid out a multi-year plan to contain the fiscal deficit.
46.
But the task ahead is formidable and determined execution of these initiatives
will be needed. The challenge is severe because unwinding the large macroeconomic
imbalances entails difficult policy trade-offs, which, in turn, are associated with considerable
political sensitivities. Communicating clear objectives, allowing for contingencies, and
creating benchmarks for transparent assessment will help maintain political legitimacy.
47.
With regard to NAMA, risk-sharing structures should be considered to address
the well-known pricing problem. The pricing of distressed assets is complex and can slow
down the transfer of assets from the troubled bank. Risk-sharing can potentially create better
incentives for managing the bad assets. And they also guard against the risk that the taxpayer
does not bear a disproportionate burden of the costs cleaning up the banks.
48.
It is particularly important to incorporate flexibility in NAMA’s design. While an
early focus on removing property-development loans from the financial system may be
appropriate, the economic downturn will cause impairment of other asset classes as the latest
trends are already indicating. The option of relieving banks of those additional assets within a
year or so will continue the process of “cleaning” up the banks. Absent that option, banks
may remain hobbled.
49.
Where a bank has been rendered economically insolvent, the only real option
would be its temporary nationalization. In that case, NAMA would continue to act in its
capacity as an agency managing bad assets. An advantage would be that prices at which these

29
assets are transferred would become less of an issue. Nationalization could also be used as a
step towards mergers and, hence, sectoral restructuring. But it would be necessary to ensure
that the banks are operated transparently, with commercial objectives, and that they receive
the same regulatory and supervisory treatment as private banks. Finally, a clear exit strategy
to return the banks to private operation would be needed.
50.
Accompanying these immediate crisis management tasks are several supportive
crisis prevention measures. These can and should be guided by evolving European Union
guidelines. However, inevitably, they will need to be tailored to domestic circumstances.
•

A broader tool kit would allow for more speedy resolution of banks. This would be
supported by the authorities’ ongoing enhancements of the deposit protection
program.

•

The supervisory challenges include intensification of surveillance for systemic risks
beyond the six guaranteed banks, further safeguards against related-party lending, and
continued development of a macro-prudential regulatory and supervisory process.

51.
The authorities have laid out an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan.While the
initial reliance on increases in personal income tax rates was appropriate to minimize the
contractionary effect of the consolidation, a greater focus on reductions in current
expenditure will be needed in the coming years.
52.
Steps should be taken to sustain the execution of the planned fiscal
consolidation. The following principles could be used as a guide:
•

More targeting of the vulnerable (as proposed for child benefits) and greater reliance
on incentives for efficient use of public resources.

•

Further ratcheting down of the public pay structure and employment levels.

•

Broadening the tax base.

•

A fiscal rule, backed by a medium-term expenditure plan that details the intended
measures over the full horizon.

53.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. IRELAND: SUSTAINABILITY EXERCISE
Fiscal Sustainability
1.
General government gross debt is set to rise sharply over the medium term as a result
of the deterioration of the fiscal position. Under the baseline scenario, gross debt rises from
43 percent of GDP in 2008 to 82 percent of GDP by 2014 as the primary balance is projected
to remain in deficit through 2013 and GDP growth is expected to be below the average real
interest rate throughout this period.
2.
The sustainability of the fiscal position over the next five years is assessed under
alternative scenarios regarding key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions, as well as several
bound tests (Table A1 and Figure A1). The analysis shows that significant policy changes are
required to entrench fiscal sustainability. The worst outcome—a rise in the debt ratio to
114 percent in 2014—is achieved under the assumption of a constant primary balance.
External Sustainability
3.
With a net external position (excluding direct investment) in balance in 2007, external
debt sustainability does not seem to be an issue (Table A2). The net external position
including direct investment is in a moderate deficit given the strong FDI inflows into Ireland
over the past decade. The relatively rapid decline in the net external position in recent years
has been dominated by factors other than the current account deficit, such as revaluations.
The large gross assets and liabilities in portfolio and other investments reflect the activities of
the International Financial Services Center.
4.
The composition of the external position implies a large negative net income flow in
the current account. The large stock of inward foreign direct investment, which reflects the
substantial presence of multinationals, earns a high rate of return (about 21 percent on
average during 2000-07).

3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Article IV Consultations:

A staff team comprising Mr. Mody (head), Mr. Kanda, Ms. Athanasapolou (all EUR),
Messrs. Seelig and Darbar (both MCM), and Ms. Luedersen (LEG) visited Dublin on
April 20-May 1, 2009, to conduct the 2009 Article IV consultation discussions. Mr. Horgan,
Mr. O’Sullivan, and Mr. McGoldrick, from the Executive Director’s office, joined the
discussions.
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on September 14, 2007 (IMF Country Report
No. 07/325). Article IV consultations with Ireland are on the standard 12-month cycle.
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions

Ireland’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.

3
Ireland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144 (52/51).

Annex II. Ireland: Statistical Issues
1.
Ireland is subject to the statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards
of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB). It has also subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
2.
The consumer price index is published monthly. The weights were updated in 2006,
and are to be updated every five years. Quarterly national accounts are currently published
within three months of its reference period. Real sector data are sometimes published with a
lag of three to six months, but some non-SDDS series even one and a half years later (e.g.,
household disposable income). Employment, earnings, unit wage costs, and national income
and expenditure data are usually available with a three-month lag. Ireland does not have an
overall earnings index or comprehensive sectoral balance sheet data.
3.
While the authorities publish Exchequer returns on a monthly and quarterly basis,
only annual data on the general government balance are currently available. Data for 1997 are
the latest data submitted and published in the GFS Yearbook, while the latest central
government data submitted for inclusion in the IFS were for the second quarter of 2003.
4.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and
are based on statistical surveys combined with administrative data. These data are closely
integrated with the compilation of national accounts and are in line with the Balance of
Payments Manual, 5th edition (BPM5), although the historical data covers only years starting
from 1998. Furthermore, some discrepancies remain between exports and imports data from
the national accounts and the balance of payments.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV
Consultation with Ireland
On June 15, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Ireland.1
Background
Following years as a star performer, Ireland is undergoing a painful adjustment as critical internal
imbalances unwind. Since the start of the decade, and especially from 2005 to 2007, easy credit
fostered a property bubble, bank exposures to property lending soared while reliance on wholesale
funding intensified, wages rose rapidly, and international competitiveness was compromised.
GDP grew in 2007 at a brisk 6 percent. However growth began to slow early in 2008 with a
deceleration in housing construction, even while parts of the eurozone, notably Germany, were still
in the last phases of the previous up cycle. As elsewhere, the pace of contraction accelerated
following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September. Recent data point to further deceleration in
2009.
The banking system is under considerable stress as asset quality—especially that related to property
development—has deteriorated and the global financial crisis has tightened access to wholesale
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

funding. Irish bank stock prices have fallen sharply relative to the overall stock index, more so than
in other eurozone countries. Extensive support by the government has been vital to maintaining
financial stability.
Strong growth and buoyant public revenues prompted tax reductions and expansion in public
expenditures that have proved unsustainable. Following a decade of close-to-balance-or-surplus
fiscal positions, the general government deficit was 7 percent of GDP in 2008 as property-related
revenues collapsed. The structural deficit is estimated to have reached 12½ percent of GDP in 2008.
Gross public debt reached 43 percent of GDP. The authorities have taken a series of consolidation
measures, and laid out a multi-year plan to restore the fiscal position to health.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Ireland has been hit particularly hard by the global economic and
financial crisis, reflecting significant vulnerabilities built up during the boom years, amplified by
the openness of the economy to global shocks. Critical macroeconomic imbalances emerged as
credit supply accommodated an unsustainable rise in property prices; banks’ exposure to property
lending soared while their reliance on wholesale funding intensified; and, as wages climbed rapidly,
international competitiveness declined.
Directors agreed that the priorities are to restore the health of the financial sector, ensure the
sustainability of the public finances, and enhance external competitiveness and the growth potential
over the medium term. They commended the scale and speed of the authorities’ response so far,
while noting that these efforts will need to be sustained over an extended period of time. Pragmatic
and flexible responses as well as careful contingency planning will be required given the complex
policy dilemmas to be confronted and the prospect of only modest recovery ahead.
Directors welcomed the actions taken to safeguard financial stability, backed by ready access to
European Central Bank financing. Noting that banking system losses are likely to be sizeable in the
near term, Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to restructure the financial sector, including
the decision to establish the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). Directors underscored
the importance of adequate design and timely implementation of NAMA. They advised the
authorities to consider risk-sharing structures to help deal with the problems with pricing distressed
assets. In addition, NAMA should be given the legal and operational flexibility to address all classes
of distressed bank assets. A number of Directors considered that, for bank restructuring, other
options including a greater equity interest by the government should not be ruled out.
Directors welcomed recent plans to strengthen the supervisory framework, noting that the proposed
macro-prudential supervisory framework will blend considerations of systemic stability with
managing the stress in individual financial institutions. Directors recommended intensified bank-bybank surveillance beyond the banks currently under deposit guarantee, and stronger safeguards
against related-party exposures. They also called for rigorous assessments of banks’ overall capital
adequacy, and for strengthened home-host supervisory cooperation. Directors considered that a

3

special resolution regime for financial institutions would facilitate a speedy and less disruptive
resolution of distressed banks.
Directors welcomed the fiscal measures already taken, including significant and politically difficult
cuts in public sector wages, and the authorities’ ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation plans.
The emergence of a large structural fiscal deficit—following the reassessment of the underlying
balance—the rising public debt, and the fiscal burden from financial support to banks will require a
sustained adjustment effort over several years. Directors stressed that the composition of
consolidation efforts would be important in laying the foundation for a return to robust growth.
They generally concurred that the focus should be on expenditure reduction, possibly including a
further reduction of the public sector wage bill. A few Directors, while recognizing that fiscal
consolidation is an imperative, cautioned that consolidation should not undermine efforts to arrest
the economic downturn.
Directors considered that, over time, the sustainability of the planned fiscal consolidation would
benefit from an effective institutional framework, including an appropriate fiscal rule and a
medium-term expenditure plan that details the intended measures over the full planning horizon.
They also underscored the importance of better targeting benefits for the vulnerable, broadening the
tax base without hampering the restoration of external competitiveness, and further pension reform.
A few Directors expressed concern about the use of resources of the National Pension Reserve Fund
for bank recapitalizing purposes.
Directors stressed that economic growth will hinge on continued restoration of Ireland’s
international competitiveness and a reorientation of the economy toward high-productivity
activities. They noted that, with no scope for nominal exchange rate adjustment, Ireland’s relatively
flexible product and labor markets will be an invaluable asset. They welcomed in this regard the
authorities’ commitment to the restoration of wage cost competitiveness—acknowledging the
progress already underway—and their plans on infrastructure and R&D investment. A few
Directors cautioned, however, that falling nominal wages could impair domestic demand and
accelerate deflation.
