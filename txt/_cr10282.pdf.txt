TUNISIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Tunisia
Approved by Patricia Alonso-Gamo and Dominique Desruelle
August 4, 2010

Tunisia weathered the global crisis well. Tunisia entered the crisis with strong fundamentals
due in large part to past prudent policies. The authorities’ timely and adequate policy response
contributed to mitigate the impact of lower external demand in 2009. Since mid-2009, Tunisia’s
growth has accelerated, but this was accompanied by a significant widening of the current
account deficit and a decline in reserves, which remain relatively high. Tunisia remains highly
dependent on European partners, and their recovery is projected to be modest and subject to
significant downside risks. Tunisia will need more dynamic sources of growth to make a
significant dent in unemployment, which remains high, especially among the youth.
Focus of the consultation. Discussions centered on policies needed to accompany the recovery
in an uncertain international environment, and to support the emergence of new sources of
growth in the medium term.
Key policy issues. Staff viewed the fiscal stance in 2010 as striking the right balance between
supporting growth and preserving the significant gains achieved in bringing public debt down.
Tunisia still has some fiscal space available to cushion a deterioration in external demand in the
event that downside risks in its main partners materialize. Monetary and exchange rate policies
should be geared toward avoiding the build-up of inflationary pressures and ensuring that the
recent weakening of the external balance does not persist. Medium-term prospects will hinge
on the authorities’ reform agenda to further strengthen and develop the financial sector,
continue liberalizing external transactions, enhance the business climate and competitiveness,
and support economic diversification. This agenda should be underpinned by a gradual fiscal
consolidation to maintain investors’ confidence and the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy,
and by modernizing the monetary policy operational framework toward an inflation targeting
regime.
Exchange rate regime. The exchange rate regime is classified as stabilized management.
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 and maintains an exchange
system that is essentially free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions (informational annex).
Mission. A staff team comprising Mr. Toujas-Bernaté (head), Ms. Bhattacharya, and
Messrs. Florea, Gijon and De Bock (all MCD) conducted the discussions in Tunis during
June 2-15, 2010. Mr. Rouai (OED) also participated in the discussions. Staff and the authorities
held additional discussions on July 14, 2010.

I. BACKGROUND: TUNISIA’S RESILIENCE TO THE CRISIS
1.
Over the last two decades, Tunisia has carried out a wide ranging reform
program based on improving the competitiveness of the economy, enhancing the
business environment and increasing trade openness.

again in the aftermath of the global crisis. The
unemployment rate remains relatively high, in particular among educated youth.
2.

Tunisia weathered the international crisis relatively well.

Real GDP growth slowed down moderately in 2009 to 3.1 percent. After declining to
1.8 percent (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2009, growth has accelerated and reached 4.5 percent
(y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2010, following a strong recovery in demand for manufacturing
exports (mostly mechanical and electric industries, and textiles). This increase was partially
offset by a decline in production in the energy and agriculture sectors. Domestic demand was
sustained by buoyant consumption fueled by rising per capita income.

Inflation edged up slightly but remains moderate. Overall CPI inflation (period average) was
3.7 percent in 2009 and rose to 4.5 percent in May 2010 (5.0 percent y-o-y), due to rising food

4
prices. Nonfood CPI inflation hovered around 3 percent, reflecting an appropriate monetary
policy stance, with moderate increases in other sectors (housing, transport and services).
The financial sector’s performance remained strong despite the international financial
crisis. Banks do not rely on external financing and have benefited from a healthy growth in
deposits (13 percent in 2009). Moreover, they had little exposure to the export sectors most
affected by the crisis which are primarily offshore financed. The financial soundness indicators
continued to improve. In this context, credit growth has remained solid and stable, in contrast
to other countries in the region. The Tunis stock exchange index also experienced exceptional
growth, reflecting strong earnings of listed companies—most notably banks—as well as
abundant liquidity in an economy with relatively limited alternatives for financial investment.
Despite recent increases, market capitalization of 21 percent of GDP at end-2009 remains small
relative to other stock exchanges in the region and the impact of a potential correction in stock
prices would likely be limited.

3.

Tunisia’s proactive policy response limited the impact of the crisis.

The government implemented a fiscal stimulus in response to the crisis. The stimulus
entailed accelerating the implementation of public investment projects and providing direct
support to exporting firms affected by the crisis. As a result, while current transfers and
subsidies declined, total expenditure and net lending rose by 1 percent of GDP in 2009.1 At the
same time, receipts from direct and import taxes, as well as nontax revenues declined,
contributing to a decline in total revenues of 1 percent of GDP. Consequently, the overall fiscal
deficit (excluding grants and privatization receipts) rose by 2.0 percentage points of GDP to
3.0 percent of GDP, and was financed almost entirely from domestic sources (external
budgetary grants remained stable at 0.3 percent of GDP). Despite the widening fiscal deficit, the
public debt ratio continued to fall in 2009 from 43.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 42.8 percent of
GDP in 2009.
1

Ratios to GDP are based on new national accounts series, according to which nominal GDP is about
10 percent higher than previous calculations (Appendix 5).

5
The Central Bank of Tunisia (Banque Centrale de la Tunisie, BCT) kept interest rates
lower than pre-crisis levels while sterilizing the abundant liquidity. The BCT lowered the
required reserves ratio in end-2008 and reduced its key policy rate by 75 basis points in
February 2009. Since then, it has maintained its key policy rate constant and increased its
money-market operations to absorb the excess liquidity in the banking system. As liquidity was
still abundant and credit growth was edging up in early 2010, the BCT increased the reserve
requirement ratio twice—from 7.5 percent to 10 percent on March 1st, 2010, then to
12.5 percent on May 1st, 2010. These actions, combined with a decline in foreign exchange
reserves, have significantly reduced excess liquidity in the banking system.

Past Consultations
In recent consultations, the authorities and the staff have agreed on the broad policy
priorities. In line with staff’s advice during the 2009 Article IV Consultation, which was
concluded on a lapse of time basis, the authorities loosened fiscal policy in 2009, mostly
through accelerating the implementation of public investment projects while containing
current spending, including subsidies. The authorities remain committed to a mediumterm fiscal policy consistent with a steady decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. The BCT
also reacted cautiously to the global financial crisis in easing monetary policy in the first
half of 2009, and since then has been proactive in absorbing excess liquidity in the
banking system to contain inflationary pressures. Continued efforts to strengthen the
banking sector led to a gradual improvement in financial sector indicators, and some
progress, albeit still slow, was achieved to modernize the monetary policy framework and
instruments.

deteriorated significantly, financed in part by a 5 percent increase in FDI in dinar terms. Gross

II. SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK AND POLICIES: SUPPORTING THE RECOVERY IN AN
UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
5.
While the global recovery has been stronger than expected so far, growth in
Tunisia’s main partners is expected to be modest and subject to significant downside
risks.
The EU is by far Tunisia’s largest partner,

concerns over sovereign risk, and a more
severe impact than currently expected of the planned fiscal consolidation on a still weak
domestic demand. On the positive side, the recent depreciation of the euro could boost global
exports from the euro area, with feedback effects on Tunisian export sectors such as electrical
and mechanical industries.
6.
Tunisia’s growth could reach 3.8 percent in 2010 if global growth recovers as
expected.
Tunisia’s financial sector was not affected by the recent financial stress in the euro area
(Appendix 1). The gradual rebound in overall real GDP observed in Tunisia since mid-2009 is
expected to continue, supported by a recovery in industrial activity and investment. Following a
strong growth in imports of capital and intermediate goods during the first two quarters of
2010, the resumption of (re-)exports is expected to become stronger in the second part of the
year. Furthermore, unlike other countries in the region, Tunisia’s revenues from tourism and
remittances from Tunisians abroad have remained broadly stable. On the negative side,
performance of the agriculture sector will likely be weaker in 2010. Furthermore, in light of
developments in the first part of this year, the current account deficit is expected to widen
substantially in 2010 (to 4½ percent of GDP), while many emerging economies are expected to
reduce their current account deficits in 2010 and 2011.
7.
Facing a modest and uncertain recovery in its main partners, Tunisia’s policies
should aim at continuing to support growth while standing ready to adapt to changes in
the international environment.
Having successfully mitigated the impact of the global crisis on growth and unemployment in
2009, macroeconomic policies should continue to be geared, in the short term, toward

8
supporting the gradual economic recovery. Thanks to prudent macroeconomic management in
the past, Tunisia still has some leeway to deal with potential external risks, in particular with
respect to fiscal policy. At the same time, the authorities should remain vigilant about risks of
potential inflationary pressures and growing external imbalances.

expenditure would remain stable as a ratio to
GDP. In particular, subsidies will stay at their lower 2009 level, despite an increase in
international commodity prices. This reflects continued implementation of the domestic
petroleum products prices adjustment mechanism introduced in early 2009. As in 2009, the
central government deficit is expected to be entirely financed through domestic sources, while
new loans from official creditors would cover the repayment of external debt. General
government debt is projected to increase slightly by about ½ percentage points to 43.1 percent
of GDP, mostly on account of the valuation effect on external debt of a projected appreciation of
the dollar and the yen against the dinar.
9.
Some fiscal space remains available to address the risks associated with the
fragile recovery.
The public debt ratio has fallen significantly over the past decade and is now slightly below the
average for comparable emerging markets. In the event that downside risks materialize and
cause a deterioration in economic activity and budget revenue, the staff saw scope for a small
additional widening of the fiscal deficit of up to ½ percent of GDP in 2010. This could allow
accommodating additional job creating programs and higher social spending to cushion the
impact of slower growth on the most vulnerable groups in the population. Moreover, based on
the revenue performance in the first four months of 2010, and other things being equal,
revenue for the whole year could be stronger than currently projected, which could provide
further room for maneuver if needed.

9
Authorities’ views
10.
Fiscal prudence remains an overarching priority for the authorities, who also see
the need for maintaining a supportive fiscal policy in 2010 in the current international
environment. Efforts in the last decade to bring down the public debt ratio significantly should
not be jeopardized by a too lax fiscal policy. The authorities are committed to firmly control
current expenditure, including subsidies, to make as much room as possible for public investment,
which they see as most effective for supporting current and future growth. They agreed that the
weak prospects for Tunisia’s main partners do not warrant a premature withdrawal of the fiscal
stimulus. Nevertheless, with a gradual recovery under way, several support measures adopted in
2009 for sectors most affected by the crisis were suspended in 2010 for lack of use.
11.
The authorities remain vigilant and stand ready to make the necessary fiscal
policy adjustments should the global environment worsen. They emphasized their quick
response to mitigate the impact of the global crisis in end-2008 and 2009. They underlined that a
Ministerial Monitoring Committee was established in May 2010 to monitor international
developments closely and evaluate possible changes in macroeconomic policies in response to
adverse shocks. With this in mind, the 2010 budget has built in additional flexibility with a total
amount of unallocated expenditure equivalent to 1½ percent of GDP that could be used if needed
in the second half of 2010 (only half of that amount is projected to be used).
Monetary and exchange rate policies
12.
The BCT will need to pursue its efforts to avoid the build-up of inflationary
pressures and ensure that the recent weakening in the external balance does not
persist.
Following the recent increases in the reserve requirement ratios, BCT’s market interventions
for absorbing banks’ liquidity were substantially reduced. Nevertheless, in the context of low
real interest rates, accelerating credit growth, and exceptional increases in the stock market
index, the BCT should maintain a close watch to ward off the risks of emergence of inflationary
pressures, real estate and stock market bubbles, or excessive credit growth. While no further
policy change seems warranted now, the BCT should stand ready to use all monetary policy
instruments at its disposal, including interest rates, in case of a significant rise in core inflation,
further acceleration in credit growth, or a sustained further fall in reserves. A further deepening
of the money market would help enhance monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the BCT will
need to continue coordinating closely with the Treasury, which is expected to increase bond
issuances in the second part of the year.
13.
The exchange rate policy should continue to be guided by the medium-term
objective of a freely-floating exchange rate.
BCT’s interventions have been relatively small in 2009 and early 2010, and occurred in both
directions, with the primary objective of providing adequate liquidity in the foreign exchange
market. Staff noted the importance of maintaining neutral and minimal interventions and
closely monitoring developments in official reserves. The exchange rate policy resulted in a

10
relatively stable real effective exchange rate, which remains broadly in line with fundamentals
(Appendix 2).
Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities remain vigilant, seeking to contain any build up of inflationary
pressure, and continue to improve the conduct of monetary policy operations. The
authorities highlighted the balance they had to strike between not undermining domestic
demand and absorbing the abundant liquidity. This led to the recent policy mix of keeping
interest rates constant while increasing the reserves requirements ratio. At the same time,
liquidity management as well as tools for money market interventions improved. In particular,
the introduction in early 2009 of new facilities for deposits and borrowing by banks allowed for
increased flexibility of the money market rate. The authorities aim at further deepening the
money market to enhance monetary policy transmission and the effectiveness of changes in the
policy interest rate.
15.
The authorities will maintain the exchange rate policy stance to smooth
fluctuations of and provide adequate liquidity to the foreign exchange market, consistent
with a real effective exchange rate in line with its fundamentals. The conduct of exchange
rate policy was recently complicated by the high volatility between the main international
currencies. The authorities see the recent decline in reserves, which they are monitoring very
closely, as partly reflecting seasonal factors and a usual trade pattern during recoveries, which
should stabilize in the second part of the year so that reserves could remain at a comfortable
level. They remain committed to preserve the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy and
maintain external sustainability.

11

III. MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES AND REFORMS: DEVELOPING NEW SOURCES OF
GROWTH AS TRADITIONAL MARKETS WOULD BE LESS BUOYANT
Medium-term outlook
16.
Medium-term growth in Tunisia's traditional partners is expected to be
moderate (1 ½ to 2 percent) and to be a less robust source of external demand for
Tunisia.
According to the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), import demand from the euro area in
the coming years could be half of its pre-crisis level. In this challenging environment, Tunisia’s
growth could increase gradually and reach an average of about 5 percent over 2010–14,
provided that policies and reforms planned by the authorities aimed at enhancing Tunisia’s
competitiveness, developing new markets and supporting new sources of growth in sectors
with high added value, could bear fruit quickly.

The highly uncertain international environment poses risks to these projections.

Downside risks to global growth have risen significantly. Beyond the near-term risk of
escalating financial stress and contagion in Europe, growth prospects in Tunisia’s main partners
could suffer if fiscal consolidation needed to address the concerns about sovereign risks turns
out to be more severe than currently projected. In turn, a weaker domestic demand in European
partners could reduce the demand for Tunisian exports. Moreover, lower incomes and a rise in
unemployment among European partners could lead to decreased tourism revenues and
remittances from Tunisians abroad.
Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities are well aware of the challenges posed by the post-crisis
international environment, and will implement the needed policies to achieve their
ambitious growth objectives. Given the Tunisian economy’s size and its ability to exploit
buoyant niches, the authorities are convinced that dynamic sources of growth can be tapped
despite a weaker global environment in the main partners. Building on past successes, new

12
reforms are being launched, with the support of international development institutions, to
facilitate innovation, development of a knowledge-based economy, and a better match between
supply of and demand for skilled labor. Specific action plans are targeting the development of
services sectors, including in the financial area. All these reforms will be supported by sustained
public investment to continue to upgrade infrastructures. On this basis, the authorities foresee
Tunisia’s growth to increase gradually over the medium term up to 6½ percent by 2015, which
will help reduce unemployment.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation and fiscal reforms
19.
As the economy picks up, the need for fiscal stimulus will wane, and fiscal
adjustment should resume with the 2011 budget.
Although Tunisia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio has been declining rapidly in recent years, it still
remains higher than in other emerging market economies outside the MENA region with similar
sovereign credit ratings. Continuing with fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt from
43 percent of GDP— its current level— to below 40 percent by 2015 will be important for
ensuring sufficient fiscal space to mitigate the impact of possible future shocks to external
demand. To that end, the authorities should aim at lowering the central government deficit
(excluding grants and privatization proceeds) gradually to close to 2.0 percent of GDP by 2015.
This would need to be complemented with early repayment of external debt using remaining
privatization receipts, as done in the last few years. In the case where growth would not reach
the projected levels over the medium term, a more ambitious fiscal consolidation path would be
required to achieve the same public debt reduction objective.
20.
An important component of fiscal consolidation over the medium term should be
the streamlining of food and fuel subsidies.
Following the implementation of a petroleum
product prices adjustment mechanism in early
2009, budget expenditure related to subsidized
prices for a few staple food products (wheat and
oil), petroleum products, and transport became
less subject to shocks to international commodity
prices. Nevertheless, further reforms could be
explored to improve the targeting of subsidies
and transfers towards the most vulnerable
groups of the population.

21.
Key to containing expenditure pressures over the medium term is a reform of
the social security system.
In the absence of reforms, demographic developments would result in a deterioration of the
social security’s financial position. Adjustments in key parameters such as the retirement age
and contribution rates will be needed to ensure that the pension system is financially

13
sustainable over the next twenty years and can meet its financial obligations without general
tax increases or transfers from the central government budget.
22.

The tax regime could become more business-friendly.

International comparisons with other emerging market economies show that the tax burden on
businesses is relatively high in Tunisia, and that there is scope to increase the yield from taxes
on consumption. Thus, a reduction in profit tax rates offset by an increase in the standard VAT
rate and an expansion of the tax base through the elimination of exemptions could benefit
growth. Staff welcomed the authorities plan to continue with reform of customs duties to bring
them more in line with international standards, by further reducing the levels and number of
rates.

23.
Fiscal consolidation efforts will be supported by various structural reform
measures to strengthen public finance management.
These measures include adopting program budgeting in stages, and implementing international
accounting standards for the presentation of the budget, the fiscal accounts and the mediumterm expenditure framework. The authorities also intend to set up a “Caisse des Dépôts” to
better leverage savings deposited with the Treasury for supporting public investment, and
envisage setting up a specialized agency in the Treasury to manage public debt and minimize
the cost of public borrowing.
Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities are resolutely committed to reverting to medium-term fiscal
consolidation as growth firms up. To reduce the overall deficit by about 0.2 percent of GDP per
year from 2011 onwards, they intend to impose a nominal cap on total subsidies, ensure a wage
bill growth lower than nominal GDP, and lower the public debt interest burden via active debt
management. They have started preparing a pension reform, to buttress the financial
sustainability of the pension system, and plan to present a new pension law to Parliament around

14
end-2010. These reforms will allow the public debt-to-GDP ratio to decline below 40 percent by
2015.
25.
Fiscal reforms will constitute an important component of the authorities’ growth
strategy. They are preparing an overall tax reform, which should be ready in the coming months,
to make the tax structure more businesses-friendly. The envisaged reforms to strengthen public
financial management will improve the efficiency of public spending, while protecting the public
investment effort.
Enhancing the monetary policy framework in the context of capital account liberalization
26.
The authorities plan to achieve the convertibility of the dinar and capital account
liberalization by 2014.
These are important reforms which, while increasing potential risks of financial spillovers from
abroad, would enhance Tunisia’s growth potential. Staff supported the gradual approach
envisaged by the authorities. First, key prior conditions will need to be met, including a
strengthening of the banking system and further deepening of the foreign exchange market. In a
second stage, restrictions on capital account transactions could be lifted, while maintaining a
number of safeguards to avoid potentially destabilizing capital movements. It will be necessary
to move forward on several fronts very soon in order to facilitate the emergence of market
instruments to allow banks and companies to adapt to the new environment.
27.
In this context, modernization of the monetary policy framework should proceed
toward the medium-term objective of eventually adopting an inflation-targeting regime.
The BCT’s efforts are currently focused on deepening the understanding of monetary policy
transmission mechanisms under an inflation-targeting regime, as well as building the required
information systems and the necessary analytical capacity about other operational aspects. In
this regard, several twinning projects with European central banks are under way. Staff noted
that this could be complemented by improving BCT’s communication tools, such as publishing
periodic monetary policy and financial system stability reports, to align market’s expectations.
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities’ commitment to liberalize the capital account, achieve the
convertibility of the dinar, and modernize the monetary policy framework has been firmly
anchored. Preparatory work has been accelerated to adapt policy tools and further deepen the
money and foreign exchange markets. The BCT will continue to build the needed capacity with
the assistance of other institutions, including possibly the Fund.
Further strengthening the financial system
29.

Financial sector indicators continued to improve in 2009.

In 2009, the NPL ratio decreased further to 13.2 percent and loans’ provisioning has been
brought to an average of 58 percent. The improvement in the NPL ratio reflects tighter risk

15
assessment by both regulators and banks, as well as more effective actions on the NPL portfolio,
in the context of sustained credit growth. Large differences in situations from one bank to
another persist, though. Despite the remarkable progress achieved since 2003, with an
11 percentage point decline in the NPL ratio, sustained efforts to further reduce NPLs will be
needed, as they still remain relatively high. The authorities should also continue to monitor
closely the credit quality for each bank and by sector in order to ensure that the robust credit
growth does not generate new NPLs in the near future.

1/ International comparisons of NPL ratios should be interpreted with caution since methods may vary from one
country to another. In the case of Tunisia, international standards for classification of NPLs are strictly observed. The
ratio is calculated in percent of gross assets (including some off balance sheet items).

30.
Further strengthening the financial system is a key objective of the presidential
program over 2010–14.
The program is articulated around four major components: consolidation of the fundamentals,
enhancing banks’ role in the economy, restructuring the public banking system, and promoting
the presence of Tunisian banks abroad (Appendix 3). This program includes in particular an
increase in the minimum capital requirements for banks to 100 million dinars and the
reduction of the NPLs ratio below 7 percent by 2014. The authorities have also decided to
implement the Basel II framework, beginning with the standardized approach, as well as
creating a deposits insurance scheme financed by the banks. Staff considered that more
systematic stress-testing and a forward looking approach to risk assessment would be highly
beneficial.

16
Authorities’ views
31.
Modernizing and strengthening the financial sector is a key pillar of the
authorities’ strategy to achieve higher growth. Preparation for implementation of the
presidential program in this area is under way. Already, redefined banking supervision and
financial stability departments in the BCT will ensure more efficient surveillance of credit
institutions. In particular, individualized approaches are being implemented for achieving the
NPLs reduction objective by 2014.
Continued opening of the economy and diversification efforts
32.
Despite the economic crisis, Tunisia still considers trade liberalization and
openness the key policy drivers to achieve sustained high growth.
The objective of the authorities is to expand trade and reduce Tunisia’s economic dependency
on the European Union. In this context, Tunisia has signed a preferential trade agreement with
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and is currently negotiating free
trade agreements with the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CAEMC), as
well as with certain countries in Africa and in the MENA region. Bilateral negotiations with the
European Union are under way to extend the Association agreement to services, agricultural
products and processed food. Tunisia is also actively involved in the Maghreb integration
process. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue with these initiatives to boost trade and
tap new sources of growth, in parallel with the above-mentioned reform of customs duties.
33.
The medium-term reform program aims at further improving the business
climate.
Improvements in customs procedures have reduced custom clearance time and will advance
further with the new customs code adopted in 2009. Two new programs to improve business
climate and competitiveness have been financed by the World Bank, the African Development
Bank, and the European Commission, and should increase Tunisia’s attractiveness for FDI.
34.
Tunisia’s economic diversification strategy relies on the development of high
value-added services, making a better use of the skilled labor force.
To develop these sectors, the authorities have initiated a reform of the university system to
train more students in science and technology. The reform of the educational system is part of a
broader plan to develop high value-added services in the areas of information technologies,
health, logistics and business services. This effort will be supported by a World Bank program
to strengthen the competitiveness of Tunisian companies in the service sector. The authorities
are backing this modernization process with an infrastructure development program, which
will facilitate the entry of new foreign investment.

17

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Tunisia weathered the global crisis well, but faces a modest recovery outlook in
its main partners, subject to significant downside risks.
Tunisia entered the global crisis with strong fundamentals thanks to sound policies and reforms
implemented over the years. The authorities’ timely and adequate policy response contributed
to mitigate the impact of lower external demand in 2009. On the back of a recovery of exports
and strong domestic demand, Tunisia’s growth has accelerated through the first quarter of
2010, but this was accompanied by a significant widening of the current account deficit and a
decline in reserves. Tunisia remains highly dependent on its main European partners, and their
recovery is projected to be modest and subject to significant downside risks. Tunisia will need
more dynamic sources of growth to make a significant dent in unemployment, which remains
high, especially among the youth.
36.
Fiscal policy in 2010 strikes the right balance between supporting growth and
preserving the significant gains achieved in the last decade in bringing public debt
down.
The recovery under way should not be undermined by an early withdrawal of the fiscal
stimulus package. The still available fiscal space could be used to cushion a deterioration in
external demand in the event that downside risks materialize. Staff welcomes the continued
vigilance of the authorities in that regard. At the same time, current expenditure should
continue to be firmly controlled to make as much room as possible for efficient public
investment to support current and future growth.
37.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should be geared toward avoiding the
build-up of inflationary pressures and ensuring that the recent weakening of the
external balance does not persist.
The authorities should sustain their efforts to sterilize the abundant liquidity and ward off
excessive credit growth with all policy instruments at their disposal. In particular, they should
stand ready to tighten the policy stance in case of a significant rise in core inflation, further
acceleration in credit growth, or a sustained further fall in reserves. Continued deepening of the
financial markets will be important for enhancing monetary policy transmission. The exchange
rate continues to be broadly aligned with fundamentals. Exchange rate policy should continue
to be guided by the medium-term objective of a freely-floating exchange rate, while ensuring
that the level of reserves remains comfortable.
38.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ resolute commitment to revert to medium-term
fiscal consolidation as growth firms up, to further reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio.
This will help to maintain investors’ confidence and the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy in
the future. Key pillars should include complementing the oil price adjustment mechanism with
better targeting of transfers and subsidies to the most needy; adjusting the parameters of the
pension system to make it financially sustainable over the medium to long term; and

18
implementing further improvements in public finance management. The tax structure could
also be made more conducive to private investment and growth.
39.
The authorities’ medium-term objectives to implement inflation targeting,
convertibility of the dinar and liberalization of the capital account will enhance
Tunisia’s growth potential.
Staff supports the gradual approach envisaged by the authorities, while stressing that it will be
necessary to make resolute progress on several fronts soon to encourage the emergence of the
market tools needed to enable economic agents to adapt to the future environment.
40.

The progress achieved in strengthening the financial system should be sustained.

Financial sector indicators continued to improve in 2009, but the NPL ratio remains relatively
high. Reducing this ratio by almost half by 2014 as planned by the authorities will require
pursuing resolute efforts by supervisory authorities and banks. More forward-looking risk
assessment procedures—particularly in the context of the adoption of Basel II standards, more
systematic stress-testing, and developing new indicators for identifying potential risks would
be highly beneficial. Staff welcomes the planned implementation of the financial sector
component of the 2010–14 presidential program, which will underpin further strengthening of
the financial sector.
41.

Staff welcomes the new impetus to structural reforms to achieve higher growth.

Plans to further enhance business climate and competitiveness, including through continued
liberalization and openness, to develop high value-added services, to make better use of the
unemployed skilled labor force, and to diversify export markets, are key in developing new
sources of growth. Staff encourages the authorities to implement the underpinning reforms
with the same steadfastness and pragmatism demonstrated in the recent past.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix 1: Spillovers from the Debt Crisis in Europe into Tunisia
Limited financial impact in the short term, thanks to sound macroeconomic policies and
limited financial links with international markets
The debt crisis in Europe has had a very limited impact on Tunisia so far. Financial markets’
reaction appears relatively muted when compared to the European countries. Moreover,
recognizing the strong track record of prudent macroeconomic policies, Standard & Poor's
confirmed in April 2010 its BBB long-term foreign credit rating for Tunisia, with stable outlook.
The banking system has limited links with international markets and its activities are funded in
large part by domestic deposits (80 percent of banks’ resources).
If the European debt crisis was to worsen, indistinctive risk aversion could affect Tunisia
sovereign spreads, similar to what happened in 2009 during the global financial crisis.
In this event, with a public debt

In the medium term, a slowdown in Europe will affect Tunisia through real channels
Tunisia’s exposure to Europe through the real channels is significant. France is the most
important partner, with 29 percent of exports, 25 percent of tourism receipts, and 48 percent of
remittances. Among the countries from the vulnerable Southern Europe group, the most
important export destination is Italy (21 percent of exports).
At this juncture, the potential dampening effect on growth of recent financial stress is highly
uncertain. The latest WEO update (July 2010) assumes a modest negative effect on growth in
the euro area, which is projected to grow at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 1.3 percent in 2011.
However, the downside risks to global growth, in particular in Europe, have risen sharply.
These risks entail a possible escalation of financial stress and contagion, prompted by rising
concern over sovereign risk. In addition, growth prospects in advanced economies could suffer
if more severe than expected fiscal consolidation stifles still weak domestic demand.

28

Given the above mentioned channels, Tunisia’s economic growth will be affected if growth in
Europe was to become weaker than currently projected. This was already the case in 2009,
when Tunisian exports dropped by nearly 25 percent (in nominal terms) in response to the
European slowdown (the Euro area real GDP contracted by 4.1 percent in 2009). Empirical
estimates, based on vector auto regressive models, suggest that one percentage point change in
European Union real GDP could lead to a 0.6 percentage point change in Tunisia real GDP.

A country-specific long-run cointegration relationship was also estimated for the reduced form
Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate (EREER). Under this specification, the EREER is
determined by the terms of trade (ToT), trade openness (open), and the evolution of output per
worker in Tunisia (tunprod) and in the partner countries (partprod) (t-stats between
parentheses):

ln( EREER)  11.72  0.56ln(ToT )  1.03ln(open)  0.97ln(tunprod )  2.05ln( partprod ).
(11.57)

(6.42)

(3.60)

(11.64)

The results suggest that the REER has remained broadly in line with fundamentals. In the past
decade, increased productivity gains vis-à-vis trading partners have been more than balanced
out by negative terms of trade shocks and increased openness. Calculating the EREER using the
medium-run WEO projections for the explanatory variables implies a small overvaluation of
3 percent, suggesting that the REER is still is broadly in line with fundamentals.

Appendix 3: Financial Sector Reform Program
"Tunisia - Banking services hub and a regional financial market"
An important component of the presidential program for the next five years aims at
transforming Tunisia into a banking services hub and a regional financial market. In this
context, the authorities are committed to continue their efforts to further strengthen the
financial soundness of the banking sector, to promote the consolidation of the banking
institutions and to improve the quality of financial services in order to reach a level consistent
with international standards.
On June 11, 2010, a ministerial council adopted the following program of measures:
Consolidation of financial fundamentals of the banking sector:
-

Increasing the minimum capital of banks to 100 million dinars by the end of 2014.

-

Lowering the NPL ratio to less than 7 percent by 2014, through a more efficient
collection and a dynamic management of the NPLs portfolio.

Increasing banks’ presence in the economy and enhancing banking services:
-

Meet the target of one bank branch for every 7,000 inhabitants by establishing 400 new
branches.

-

Improve the quality of banking services and build stronger relations between banks and
their customers by stepping up the use of new communication technologies.

-

Develop remote services, including mobile phone banking.

Restructuring of the public banking sector:
-

Creation of a public banking hub "Tunisia Holding." The mission of the hub consists of
devising strategies and monitoring the activities of the affiliated public banks.

-

Creation of a financial institution specialized in financing small- and medium-sized
enterprises (Al Moubadara). This financial institution will be entrusted to manage
government equity holdings in the Bank for Financing Small- and Medium-sized
Enterprises (BFPME), and the Tunisian Guarantee Company (SOTUGAR), as well as in
regional investment companies, while safeguarding the financial and legal autonomy of
these entities. The aim of creating this institution is to provide a one-stop-shop offering
a complete range of services, including financing, equity holdings, and guarantees, as
well as providing financing in the form of leasing and short-term loans for working
capital.

Strengthening the presence of Tunisian banks abroad and promoting Tunisia as a
regional financial center:
-

Convert the Union of Tunisian Banks into a new banking institution "Tunisian ForeignBank," through a restructuring and extension of its branch network in Europe. In a first

31
stage, the authorities will proceed to a consolidation of the ownership into three major
banks, including the BCT. In a second stage, the BCT will sell its participation to a
strategic investor.
-

Consolidate the presence of Tunisian banking institutions in the Maghreb area and in
Africa.

-

Attract internationally reputable banking institutions by promoting Tunisia’s modern
regulatory framework and available logistical resources.

32

Appendix 4: External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
A. Public Debt2
With unchanged policies, Tunisia’s gross public debt to GDP ratio is projected to decline
slowly, from 43 percent in 2009 to below 40 percent by 2015. This assumes a primary
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP over the period 2010–15, with the average nominal interest rate on
public debt declining from 4.9 percent to 3.8 percent over the same period. The public debt
profile is in line with the government’s objective to reduce the ratio to GDP to below 40 percent
over the medium term.
At the same time, the government is intending to undertake major fiscal reforms over the
medium term, but this is not likely to result in a noticeably different path for the public
debt-to-GDP ratio. In particular, the authorities are proceeding with a major reform of the tax
system, while maintaining strict controls over public spending, as outlined in the main text of
the staff report. As a result the central government deficit (excluding grants and privatization
receipts) is projected to decline from 3.0 percent of GDP in 2009 to just over 2.0 percent of GDP
by 2015. Moreover, the authorities intend to submit a draft law to the Parliament in the coming
months that will guarantee the financial viability of pension schemes by changing their main
parameters.
If key assumptions are held over the next five years at their historical averages, the general
government primary deficit would be on average slightly lower than the implied primary deficit
underlying the government’s current fiscal strategy. This mainly reflects conservative revenue
projections in the context of the government’s intended tax reform measures. Thus, under the
scenario with the key variables at their historical averages, the decline in public debt would be
somewhat more rapid and reach just over 38 percent of GDP by 2015.
The debt outlook is moderately vulnerable to adverse shocks.
Standard bound tests reveal the following (Figure 1):


As almost 60 percent of public debt is denominated in foreign currency, a 30 percent
real exchange rate depreciation would increase the public debt-to-GDP ratio by around
9½ percentage points of GDP relative to the baseline in 2015.



With a contingent liabilities shock, the debt path would also increase throughout the
projection period, raising the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio by around 9 percentage
points of GDP above the baseline scenario.

Public debt includes the debt of the central government and the debt held by the social security funds
but excludes the debt of public enterprises.
2

33


A one-half standard deviation shock to real GDP growth over the projection period will
add just over 4 percentage points to the public debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the baseline
projection by 2015.



Smaller shocks—including individual one-half standard deviation shocks to interest
rates and to the primary balance, and a combined one-fourth standard deviation
shock— would all result in a public debt-to-GDP ratio of under 42 percent by the end of
the projection period.

B. External Debt
External debt sustainability risks have been reduced substantially in recent years and
appear contained in the period ahead.


External debt declined sharply from over 60 percent of GDP in 2004 to around
48 percent of GDP in 2009.



Under the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to decline further to around
38 percent of GDP by 2015.

The composition and relatively moderate size of Tunisia’s external debt makes it
relatively resilient to most types of adverse external shocks, with the exception of a
significant nominal exchange rate depreciation.


The external debt ratio remains below 42 percent of GDP by the end of the projection
period under all alternative scenarios and each of the bound tests, with the exception of
the exchange rate shock scenario (Figure 2). For example, a persistent adverse shock to
the current account would only raise the projected path of external debt to 41 percent
of GDP by 2015.



However, the external debt profile is highly vulnerable to exchange rate shocks. The
simulation results suggest that a 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate in
2011 relative to the baseline scenario would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio to
above 50 percent by 2015.

Appendix 5: Tunisia’s New National Accounts
In early 2010, the Tunisian authorities adopted a new national accounts system for the
period 1997–2008 to comply with the 1993 United Nations national accounts system.
The main goal is to improve the national accounts methodology to reflect better income levels
and economic developments. The new system has revalued current price figures of the main
macroeconomic aggregates (i.e., GDP, fixed gross capital formation, consumption, investment,
savings, etc.). The total effect of the introduction of new system has been an increase of around
10 percent in nominal GDP figures each year.
Constant price aggregates are now calculated based on last year’s prices.
This allows better reflecting the evolving structure of the economy in calculating overall real
GDP growth. On the other hand, when one calculates GDP series with a fixed base year using the
chained growth rates, sector components series do not add up to the total real GDP series.
Some selected macroeconomic aggregates are now as follows:

The main methodological changes include:
i.

Financial intermediation services are split between institutional sectors to make a
better assessment of the actual consumption of these services;

ii.

the consumption of fixed capital by public administrations was increased due a new
method to calculate the gross operating surplus;

39
iii.

military expenses in goods which could have civil use are now included in gross fixed
capital formation and are not considered as intermediate consumption anymore;

iv.

expenditure for research, and mining and petroleum prospection, previously considered
as intermediate consumption are now included in gross fixed capital formation; and

v.

the production coverage was broadened to include activities such as certain rentals,
domestic services and the production of certain non-profit organizations.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 effective
January 6, 1993, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on executing
payments and transfers on current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains
(a) a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended
prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of

Annex II. Financial Relations with the World Bank
(As of June 8, 2010)

Country Partnership Strategy
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Tunisia was discussed at the Board in
December 2009. The strategy is aligned in timing and substance with the National Development
Plan (NDP) update, and reflects the selectivity of the client because the Tunisian Government has
been very clear where it wants the Bank to provide support and where it does not. The experience in
Tunisia is that the Government only requests IBRD financing when it has carefully weighed the pros
and cons of all alternatives and where it assesses that the Bank can add most value. The three
strategic pillars of the CPS are: (i) Growth, Competitiveness and Employment; (ii) Sustainable
Development and Climate Change: and (iii) Improving the Quality of Service Delivery.

Lending Volumes
The IBRD lending program for FY10 is well advanced with three projects scheduled for Board
approval before the end of the fiscal year for a combined amount of about $146 million. All is
on track for delivery of the 3 FY10 projects—Employment DPL ($50 million), Community Based
Integrated Rural Development ($36 million) and the Northern Tunis Waste Water project
($60 million). Beyond FY10, specific amounts for projects are not yet known with precision but the
volume of the IBRD envelope for FY11 is expected to be around $500 million, half of which would
be delivered through development policy lending. For years beyond FY11, the Government has not
asked for a specific annual lending amount as they continue to monitor their overall macro situation
and assess the NDP implementation.

On-Going Portfolio
The portfolio has continually remained large with 17 projects and grants under implementation,
yearly disbursements averaging $123 million and total commitments of $836 million. The portfolio
performance is satisfactory with no long-term problem projects, good pro-activity and realism
indicators, and an average disbursement ratio for FY05–09 of 21.4 percent, close to the Bank’s
average. However, there are some operational factors that dog the Bank’s program and which are,
for the most part, linked with procurement weaknesses. The cumbersome procurement procedures
lead to slow disbursements and repeated extension of projects. The Bank’s team and the authorities
are working on addressing these procurement issues through intensive technical assistance.

Annex III. Tunisia: Statistical Issues
(as of July 15, 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real Sector Statistics: The authorities have recently published a revised national accounts series covering the
period 1997–2009 based on SNA 1993 (instead of, as before, SNA 1968), and applying a chained-index
approach to estimating real GDP growth. The authorities are working on publishing a quarterly GDP series
consistent with these revisions. These improvements are welcome, and should provide a better indication of
economic activity developments and trends in Tunisia. Surveillance would benefit from the collection and
dissemination of higher frequency data on employment, unemployment, and wages. Tunisia utilizes a
periodicity and timeliness flexibility option for the labor market data category under the SDDS. Currently,
annual employment and unemployment data are disseminated with a timeline of seven months.

External sector statistics: Are generally adequate for surveillance, although greater detail on the financial
account would be desirable.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) June 20, 2001.

A data ROSC was published on the IMF website on
August 9, 2006.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Tunisia
On August 27, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Tunisia.1
Background
Tunisia entered the global crisis with strong fundamentals thanks to sound policies and
reforms implemented over the years. The authorities’ timely and adequate policy
response contributed to mitigate the impact of lower external demand in 2009.
Moreover, the financial sector was not affected by the global financial crisis, as banks
continued to rely on steady domestic resources. As a result, real GDP growth exceeded
3 percent in 2009. With solid exports of services and remittances as well as lower
imports, the current account deficit declined and external reserves increased to the
equivalent of 6 months of imports of goods and services by end-2009. Inflation remained
moderate at 3.7 percent on average.
Economic growth has gathered momentum since mid-2009, on the back of the recovery
in exports and solid domestic demand. At the same time, with even stronger import
growth, the current account deficit widened significantly and external reserves declined

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
during the first part of 2010, while remaining at a comfortable level. For the year as a
whole, as the recovery in Tunisia’s main partners is expected to be modest, Tunisia’s
real GDP growth is projected to reach 3.8 percent, supported by a rebound in industrial
activity and investment, while agricultural performance will likely be weaker than last
year. Inflation edged up slightly at 5.0 percent (y-o-y) in May 2010, due to rising food
prices, but non-food price increases have remained very moderate at around 3 percent.
Risks to the outlook are related to the significant downside risks to growth in Tunisia’s
European partners, entailing a possible escalation of financial stress and contagion and
a more severe impact than currently expected of the planned fiscal consolidation on a
still weak domestic demand. The strength of the recovery in Europe will determine to a
large extent the pace of Tunisian exports growth, tourism receipts and remittances. On
the positive side, the recent depreciation of the euro could boost exports of the euro
area, and could benefit Tunisian exports in sectors such as electrical and mechanical
industries. The medium-term outlook is subject to similar risks, with Tunisia’s traditional
partners expected to be a less buoyant source of external demand than prior to the
crisis.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Tunisia weathered the global crisis well, largely reflecting
its sound macroeconomic management and structural reforms over the last decade, and
timely policy responses since the onset of the crisis. Nonetheless, Directors observed
that risks to the outlook remain on the downside given the economy’s high dependence
on trade with Europe. Amid continued uncertainties for the external environment, they
emphasized the need to maintain macroeconomic policies that support the recovery and
to intensify structural reforms that would enhance competitiveness, diversify exports,
and promote job creation.
Directors agreed that the fiscal stance in 2010 strikes the right balance between
supporting growth and preserving the significant gains achieved in reducing the level of
public debt. They welcomed the commitment to resume fiscal consolidation, starting with
the 2011 budget, and to further bring down the public debt. This will help maintain
investors’ confidence and retain sufficient fiscal space to mitigate the impact of possible
future shocks. To that end, Directors stressed the importance of following through with
plans to expand the tax base, reform the social security system, and contain public
spending on wages and food and fuel subsidies, while maintaining public investment on
infrastructure.
Noting that credit to the economy continues to grow strongly, Directors concurred that
monetary and exchange rate policies should be geared toward avoiding a build-up of
inflationary pressures and ensuring that the recent weakening of the external balance
does not persist. They considered that the authorities’ medium-term objectives to move
to inflation targeting, full convertibility of the dinar, and an open capital account could

3
help the economy to adapt better to changes in the external environment. At the same
time, Directors stressed that significant preparatory measures are still needed,
particularly continued strengthening of the banking system, further deepening of the
foreign exchange market, and improving the effectiveness of monetary policy
transmission. While noting the progress achieved in strengthening the financial system,
Directors encouraged the authorities to move forward with plans for further
improvements, including measures that would lead to a continued reduction in the level
of non-performing loans and strengthen financial sector supervision.
Directors stressed that continued structural reforms remain critical to boost growth,
enhance competitiveness and address the problem of persistent high unemployment,
particularly among the young. They welcomed the envisaged measures to increase
productivity by improving the business environment, reforming labor market policy,
increasing capital investment, and modernizing and strengthening the financial sector.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Tunisia
and Sadok Rouai, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
August 27, 2010
1.
We thank staff for a well-written and innovative report. We would also like to
convey to Management and the Executive Board our Tunisian authorities’ appreciation
for the high quality relationship with the Fund. Since staff has adequately covered recent
developments and medium-term challenges and reforms, and faithfully reflected the
authorities’ view, we will focus our statement on the strategy put into action by Tunisia
to deal with the fall out of the global crisis.
2.
Tunisia weathered the global crisis relatively well (Staff Report ¶2). The country
entered the crisis with strong fundamentals following sustained implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies and broad structural reforms. By end–2007, both the budget and the
current account deficits declined to about 2½ percent of GDP, external debt fell under
50 percent of GDP, and gross international reserves reached the equivalent of five months of
imports. 2007 was also the final year of the phasing in of the Association Agreement with the
European Union (EU).
3.
As a small, open, export-oriented economy, Tunisia remains vulnerable to
external shocks, but it has also gained experience in crisis-prevention. While recent gains
in macroeconomic and financial stability have strengthened the economy’s resiliency, the
authorities remain vigilant in their macroeconomic management and ready to implement
preventive measures.
4.
Soon after the early signs of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007, a crisisprevention unit was set up in the central bank in late 2007. After the financial crisis
became global, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, with spillover to
the real sector in advanced economies, a National Commission, chaired by the Prime
Minister, was created in September 2008 with the objective of closely monitoring global
economic and financial developments, assessing their potential spillover to the Tunisian
economy, and designing a comprehensive crisis-prevention strategy. This strategy focused on
the following:


Safeguarding foreign reserves including through the initiation of an active asset
management policy of official reserves held by the central bank and a comprehensive
audit of the reserves held by banks.



Relying mainly on long-term lending from Multilateral Development Banks, in
particular the World Bank, and refraining from accessing international capital
markets in 2008, 2009, and 2010; and encouraging local companies to rely on the
domestic forex market for the coverage of their needs in foreign currency.

2


Closely monitoring developments in the stock market and promoting the creation
of two funds by public banks to stabilize prices, if needed, and ensure market stability
and confidence.



Adopting in December 2008 a number of temporary measures to support local
exporters affected by the crisis, including through partial and temporary exemptions
from social security contributions, as well as limited fiscal incentives and credit
guaranties.



Loosening monetary policy, benefiting from declining inflation, through a reduction
in reserves requirement from 10 percent to 7.5 percent at end–2008, followed by a
75 percentage point reduction in the key policy rate in February 2009. At the same
time, two new facilities for deposits and borrowing by banks were established in
order to improve banks’ liquidity management.

5.
The authorities maintained close contacts with Fund management and staff.
These contacts were particularly helpful in designing an appropriate fiscal stimulus to
counter the depressed external environment. In this connection, a staff visit in March
2009 was focused on the assessment of the impact on Tunisia of the global crisis. The candid
discussions with staff were helpful to the authorities in reaching their decision to implement,
in mid–2009, a fiscal stimulus package of 1.4 percent of GDP aimed, in particular, at
increasing public investment expenditure and expanding direct support to the export sector.
6.
In April 2009, the issue of Tunisia’s access to the newly created FCL was also
discussed by staff and the authorities. The authorities welcomed the new facility and
agreed that it could contribute to safeguarding market confidence in the policies and
prospects of eligible countries. Nonetheless, they expressed concern about its short duration,
which covered only 12 months. Given the above, and because of the absence of any pressing
need to borrow on international capital markets, as well as Tunisia’s limited exposure to
international financial markets, the authorities felt confident that the potential impact of the
crisis would be manageable in 2009 because of the high degree of crisis preparedness and the
country’s relatively comfortable reserves position. However, at that time, the authorities were
concerned with the growing spillover of the crisis to Europe and felt that, because of
Tunisia’s strong linkages with the EU (Staff Report – Appendix 1), the country could be
affected by a slowdown in external demand.
7.
In the event, Tunisia’s proactive policy response limited the impact of the crisis
(Staff Report ¶¶2, 3). For 2010, real GDP growth is projected to increase by 3.8 percent,
benefiting from a strong recovery in demand for manufacturing exports. The budget includes
an amount of unallocated expenditure equivalent to 1½ of GDP that could be used, if needed,
to provide further support to the economy, with the budget deficit projected to remain at
3.0 percent of GDP. While the current account deficit is projected to grow to 4½ of GDP, the
authorities emphasize that a large part of the increase is due to higher investment, one-off
imports of transport equipment, and to a pick-up in re-export activity, and is largely covered
by FDI.

Going forward, the authorities remain vigilant. After the inception of the
sovereign debt crisis, a Ministerial Monitoring Committee was established in May 2010 to
assess any risk of contagion and make the necessary policy adjustments. The authorities are
cognizant that the post-crisis international environment will add to the challenges facing
Tunisia as an emerging market economy. However, they are comforted by the recent
inclusion of Tunisia in the Fund’s Financial Transaction Plan. They are confident that the
2010–2014 Development Plan, recently approved by Parliament, will reinforce the
fundamentals of the Tunisian economy. The Development Plan targets important reforms, in
particular in the financial sector (Staff Report – Appendix 3), and in the pension and tax
systems, while aiming at further diversification of the economy and liberalization of the
capital account and the services sector.
