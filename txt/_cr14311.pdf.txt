STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 15, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic performance has improved over the last year. The recovery is taking
hold, although domestic activity remains weak, in part constrained by weak banks and
inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Inflation has declined, the current account
remains in large surplus, and international reserves have increased. The authorities place
a priority on preserving macroeconomic stability, tackling banking sector vulnerabilities,
and reforming SOEs, though implementation has been gradual in some key areas.
Outlook and risks. Growth is projected to recover gradually over the coming years, with
the current account returning to a deficit and inflation contained. On current policies,
public debt is projected to reach 60 percent of GDP. Risks include weaker trading partner
growth, geopolitical tensions, slow structural reforms, and delayed fiscal consolidation.
Early conclusion to key trade negotiations would be growth-positive.
Fiscal policy. Deficits have been sizable and rising public debt requires attention. A
medium-term growth-friendly consolidation is recommended, based on enhancing
revenue and rationalizing unproductive expenditures while preserving crucial social and
capital spending. This would ensure public debt sustainability with space to address
contingent liabilities from banking sector and SOE restructuring.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. The current monetary policy stance is
appropriate. Greater exchange rate flexibility would help buffer external shocks, facilitate
improved reserve adequacy, and help lay the groundwork for shifting toward using
inflation as a nominal anchor over the medium term.
Banking sector reform. Several policy measures have been taken recently, but the
overall gradual approach will likely continue constraining credit growth and keep the
system susceptible to shocks and significant asset deterioration. A more expeditious
recognition of nonperforming loans, bank restructuring and orderly resolution would
support robust credit creation and macro-financial stability.
State-owned enterprise reform. Progress is being made. Implementing restructuring
plans and accelerating equitization would help ensure more efficient resource allocation,
strengthen banks, and deliver higher future growth. Reform should also focus on
strengthening corporate governance and ensuring a level playing field.

Economic performance has improved over the last year, with the challenge now to
mitigate vulnerabilities. Growth is improving gradually, underpinned by robust exports and foreign
direct investment (FDI) while domestic activity remains subdued. Inflation has declined to mid-single

which are restraining activity. Public and publicly
guaranteed debt has risen to a level that requires attention.
2.
The authorities place a high priority on securing macroeconomic stability and
strengthening fundamentals. The government’s socio-economic development plan (through 2020)
targets average growth of 6½–7 percent with single-digit inflation. It prioritizes macroeconomic
stability, tackling banking sector vulnerabilities, and reforming SOEs and public investment.
Accelerating and deepening the agenda, creating fiscal space to address potential contingent
liabilities from reforms while safeguarding critical social and investment spending, would mitigate
risks and facilitate achievement of the development goals. Moving gradually toward using inflation
as a nominal anchor with greater exchange rate flexibility would provide a monetary policy
framework more conducive to maintaining stability and buffering external shocks.
3.
Policies are broadly in line with past Fund advice, although along a more cautious
timeline. The authorities have made progress on many priorities outlined in the last Article IV
consultation. Banking system reforms have been initiated, including individual bank restructuring
plans, and a scheme to transfer nonperforming loans (NPLs) to an asset management company.
However, full implementation of prudential regulations to bring asset classification and provisioning
closer to international standards has been delayed, with concurrent slow progress in NPL resolution
and bank recapitalization. SOE restructuring has moved forward with plans for equitization,
enhanced transparency, and improvements in the legal framework, although implementation has
been slow. Fiscal consolidation has not materialized.

Box 1. Vietnam: Poverty Reduction, Inclusive Growth, and Remaining Challenges1
Vietnam has made remarkable progress improving living
conditions and reducing poverty. It employs two
approaches to measure poverty. The first uses a “basic
needs” poverty line adjusted for inflation, adopted in the
early 1990s with assistance from the World Bank and
updated in 2010. By this measure, the national poverty
rate declined from 58 percent in 1993 to around
17 percent in 2012. A second approach, initially based on
rice equivalents and revised in 2005 to use basic needs,
but adjusted for inflation only every five years, shows
poverty fell from around 28 percent in the early 1990s to
around 9½ percent by 2012—the official rate.

While growth has been pro-poor under both measures,
success has brought some additional challenges. Inequality has risen slightly compared to the 1990s, spurred by
changing patterns of employment away from agriculture, and from low-skill to higher-skill work. The Gini
coefficient was 0.39 in 2012, comparable to that of other middle-income countries in the region. The remaining
poor depend heavily on subsistence agriculture and live in remote upland rural regions, isolated from main
markets. Poverty has also taken an increasingly ethnic dimension, as the income gap between ethnic minorities and
the Kinh majority has grown. Many incomes remain close to the poverty level, and are susceptible to falling back
into poverty as a result of macroeconomic shocks. The quality of, and access to, public services and social
assistance vary between rich and poor households.
Based on these findings and cross-country experience, a number of policies could reinforce poverty reduction and
support inclusive growth:

 Ensuring macroeconomic stability and reducing vulnerabilities, and structural reforms to support robust,
sustainable growth.

 Supporting productivity growth in rural areas through improved connectivity, strengthening skills, improving the
investment climate, expanding access
to basic services, better targeting
agricultural and social support, and
fostering the occupational and
geographic mobility of labor.
Improving access of the poor to
higher-quality education and health
services, particularly in rural areas
and by minority ethnic groups, would
help address inequality of
opportunities.

MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
4.
Growth is improving gradually and inflation has declined. Real GDP expanded by about
5½ percent in 2013, underpinned by robust exports and FDI. Domestic activity remained subdued
despite supportive countercyclical policies, reflecting in part headwinds from a weakened banking
sector and slow progress in SOE reform. A negative output gap is estimated to have emerged
(Box 2), and headline and core inflation have fallen, to 5 and 3½ percent, respectively, in mid-2014.
The unemployment rate remains low, but underemployment exists, particularly in rural areas, and
economy-wide wage growth was flat.
5.
Fiscal policy eased. The 2013 fiscal deficit is estimated at 5½ percent of GDP (GFS 2001),
compared to 4¼ percent implied by the budget.1 Tax revenues fell short of the plan by about
1½ percentage points of GDP, mainly due to sluggish economic growth, tariff reductions, and new
exemptions, while nontax revenues significantly outperformed in part due to increased dividend receipts
from SOEs. Current spending was close to budget while capital expenditure was higher than planned.
6.
Monetary conditions remain accommodative. With inflation on a downward trajectory
and growth below potential, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) reduced policy rates by 50 basis points
in early 2014. Overnight interbank rates have been well below policy rates due to ample liquidity
and the domestic government bond benchmark yield curve has declined. Sovereign spreads
narrowed by about 100 basis points early this year, but gave back some of those gains following
regional geopolitical tensions in May. The official exchange rate was depreciated by one percent in
mid-June.
7.
The current account remains in significant surplus and international reserves
increased. Robust growth in exports, tourism, and private remittances led to a current account
surplus of 5½ percent of GDP in 2013. The financial account saw large net inflows of FDI and loans.
However, in mid-2013 these were balanced by large capital outflows associated with the unwinding
of gold deposits at commercial banks and following the announcement of U.S. Federal Reserve
tapering. As a result, the overall balance of payments saw only a small surplus in 2013. With
continued robust exports, gross international reserves rose in early 2014, to above US$36 billion, 2½
months of prospective imports of goods and services.
8.
Bank credit to the private sector has been sluggish and profitability has weakened.
Despite accommodative monetary conditions and strong deposit growth, private sector credit
growth was 2¼ percent (s.a., ytd) in March 2014, reflecting weak demand and ongoing adjustment
due to weakened balance sheets. The system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen to below

GFS 2001 presentation is different from the authorities’ presentation, mainly reflecting the inclusion of off-budget
capital expenditure and the exclusion of principal repayments above the line.

Box 2. Vietnam: Productivity, Technical Efficiency, and Potential GDP
Total factor productivity (TFP) calculations using data
from the national accounts show that the contribution of
TFP to growth in Vietnam has declined in the last
decade. Capital’s contribution increased, but by less than
TFPs’ decline, and consequently growth slowed.

Real GDP growth and TFP -National Accounts

Production function frontier analysis confirms this
finding.1 A production function frontier represents the
optimal output that can be achieved given a set of
inputs. The basic stochastic production frontier can be
characterized in the Cobb-Douglas form with a
“composed error term” as follows:

it represents the gap between the frontier, which is the
optimal output, and the actual output achieved, which
is usually below the frontier given productive
inefficiencies in the economy.

90 percent from a peak of around 105 percent in 2011, helped partly by sales of NPLs to the Vietnam
Asset Management Company (VAMC). The official NPL ratio rose to 4.2 percent and capital adequacy is
reported above the 9 percent regulatory minimum, but stricter loan classification and provisioning, and
adjustments to account for multiple gearing and connected lending would likely cause both to show a
significantly weaker situation. NPLs and sluggish credit growth resulted in weaker profitability, with the
system-wide ROA and ROE in 2013 at 0.5 and 5.6 percent, respectively. Prices of real estate, a significant
source of banks’ loan collateral, have yet to turn around after falling by about 50 percent from their peak.
9.
Growth is projected to continue its gradual recovery with subdued inflation. Staff’s
baseline scenario assumes the authorities will maintain an expansionary policy stance to offset
headwinds from slow banking and SOE reform implementation. For 2014, real GDP growth is
projected at 5½ percent, inflation around 5¼ percent, the current account in surplus, and reserves
around 2½ months of prospective goods and services imports. Over the medium term, growth is
projected around 6 percent, reflecting a cyclical recovery of the domestic economy, with inflation
remaining in single digits. A rebound in imports would return the current account to a deficit. The
current fiscal stance would result in the accumulation of public sector debt to around 60 percent of
GDP, slightly below the authorities’ legal limit of 65 percent.
10.
Under this scenario, domestic risks are tilted to the downside. Slow progress in banking
reform raises the economy’s vulnerability to adverse shocks and heightened distress, the realization
of which could result in negative macro-financial feedback, significantly undermining growth and
adding to public-sector liabilities. Delays in fiscal consolidation would reduce fiscal space that may
ultimately be required for banking and SOE reforms, and could pressure interest rates, crowd out
growth-enhancing spending, erode public confidence, and ultimately undermine debt sustainability.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize

The economy is also vulnerable to spillovers from external shocks. In the short-term,
surges in global financial market volatility, higher global interest rates, or protracted regional
geopolitical tensions could undermine confidence, and reduce international reserves absent greater
exchange rate flexibility. In the medium-term, a high degree of openness and reliance on FDI make
the economy vulnerable to slower growth in major trading partners. In particular, China is an

The authorities broadly concurred with the near-term macroeconomic outlook. To
mitigate external risks they have reassured investors following recent geopolitical events, and
reinforced the importance of structural reforms, trade diversification, and on-shoring of supply
chains through TPP and other FTAs. They noted that the current account surplus, capital flows
management, and the relatively small holdings of domestic assets by nonresidents limited the impact
of global financial volatility on domestic markets. On domestic risks, they emphasized work was

underway on bank and SOE restructuring, with progress in line with their plans, and they viewed the
risk of systemic distress as small. They considered the level of public debt as manageable, but
recognized the risks of a further increase, and were looking to tighten fiscal policy gradually going
forward.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the near-term macroeconomic stance to entrench stability; measures to
underpin a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and address rising public debt; strengthening the
monetary policy framework and moving toward greater exchange rate flexibility; broadening the
banking sector reform agenda; and advancing SOE reforms.

A. Fiscal Policy

Efforts have been made to broaden the revenue base, but buoyancy has declined.
Improved administration measures include reducing tax evasion and arrears, disclosing incidents of
tax fraud, and streamlining VAT refund procedures while introducing thresholds. Profitable SOEs
have been required to pay dividends in 2013–14. Vietnam compares favorably in the region in terms
of tax revenue productivity but the base has eroded, reflecting in part exemptions and incentives. At
the same time, the VAT rate was halved for certain housing projects and a further corporate income
tax rate reduction, to 20 percent in 2016, is planned.

Room exists to adjust the composition of expenditure. Spending on education is
commendably higher than in comparator low-income and emerging-market countries. However,
expenditure on public employee compensation is significantly higher as a share of GDP. Capital
spending has historically been in line with other low-income countries, but a decline is budgeted this
year. Maintaining high-quality investment spending would improve the stock of public capital in a

Public debt is projected to increase to around 55 percent of GDP in 2014, substantially
higher than just a few years ago, requiring increased attention (Box 3, and debt sustainability
analysis). Maintaining the current policy trajectory would lead to higher debt even with continued
expenditure restraint—including on investment, which undermines long-run growth potential—and
temporary revenue measures such as SOE dividend payments. The effectiveness of the current
expansionary stance is undermined by the economy’s structural constraints, it takes up fiscal space
raising vulnerability to shocks, and risks crowding out lending to the private sector. Moreover,
international experience indicates that public debt could rise substantially were systemic banking sector
distress to materialize. SOE restructuring may also ultimately require public funds.

Box 3. Vietnam: What is an Appropriate Medium-Term Public Debt Target?
Public debt in Vietnam has increased considerably in recent
years. In contrast, other low income economies have generally
reduced public debt ratios. Public and publicly-guaranteed
debt almost doubled since 2000, and at around 55 percent of
GDP in 2014, is higher than average in the region and among
low-income economies.

The rise has resulted from an easy fiscal stance, reflecting

accompanied higher current expenditure over this period,

Cross-country experience suggests that Vietnam’s public
debt is rapidly approaching an unsafe level. Three
econometric models are estimated to determine thresholds
beyond which debt distress could materialize. Probit and
signal models are estimated using cross-country data and
the results are applied using data for Vietnam, while a debt
intolerance model estimates the relation between public
debt and investment ratings for Vietnam.1 To calculate a
safe debt threshold, a buffer for potential contingent
liabilities is subtracted from the estimated debt distress
thresholds—the value of the buffer is the average debt
increase that has materialized in international experiences
of systemic banking distress.2 The results suggest a safe
debt level ranging from 40 to 45 percent of GDP for
Vietnam.

Staff recommended a fiscal consolidation that protects social spending and investment
and makes space for potential restructuring costs. A growth-friendly consolidation that returns
the debt ratio over the medium term closer to 45 percent of GDP, around the level that existed a few
years ago, is achievable. The aim would be to support robust inclusive growth and poverty reduction,
and mitigate risks. The adjustment would provide space for potential bank and SOE restructuring
costs, higher capital spending, and maintaining critical social expenditures.

Reversing the decline in the revenue to GDP ratio is a priority. Staff recommended
broadening the tax base by eliminating exemptions, reducing incentives, introducing a property tax,
and including pensions under personal income tax. Forgoing the planned reduction in the corporate
income tax rate would contribute around ⅓ percentage points of GDP in revenue, and making
permanent the requirement for SOEs to pay dividends to the budget would also contribute
importantly. Strengthening administration could return revenue productivity to past higher levels
and result in significant revenue gains.
19.
Staff proposed expenditure reforms along three dimensions: ensuring the sustainability
of social spending and targeted measures to address inequality and growth inclusiveness;
safeguarding well-targeted capital expenditure to support growth potential; and rationalizing the
public wage bill in a sustainable way by replacing the across-the-board wage and hiring freezes with
deeper, efficiency-enhancing civil-service reforms.
20.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s baseline fiscal assessment. They aim to
broaden the tax base and strengthen administration, but noted a property tax and personal income
tax on pensions would be difficult to enact. Consideration is being given to raising excises, while
income tax rate reductions are needed to support growth and competitiveness, and should result in
higher revenues. Social spending will be protected with priority given to poverty reduction,
agriculture and rural areas; the law on public investment has been revised to enhance efficiency and
prioritization; and greater use of public-private partnerships is under consideration. The authorities
concurred with the objective of containing the public sector wage bill, highlighting the importance of
addressing redundant employees, and plan to undertake a public expenditure review with World
Bank assistance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21.
The authorities are fully aware of public debt risks. They expect the debt-GDP ratio to peak
around 2016 and decline afterward with a gradual consolidation, and emphasized that the
government’s ceiling of 65 percent of GDP would not be breached. This would allow sufficient space
for countercyclical policies. They noted that downside risks could exist if adverse external shocks
materialized, or if SOE performance deteriorates, but they reiterated that public funds would not be
used for banking sector restructuring.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
22.
Maintaining a supportive monetary stance is appropriate as long as inflation pressures
remain absent. Evidence of an excess supply gap exists, growth is below potential, core inflation has
declined, and wage pressures are benign. As well, the transmission of easier monetary conditions to
credit growth appears to have been dampened in recent years (Box 4). At this juncture, easy
monetary conditions do not pose a risk to financial stability. Real estate prices remain subdued and
equity market price/earnings ratios are around 15 percent. Indeed, supportive liquidity conditions are
currently facilitating banking system adjustment. If significant capital outflows were to occur, greater
exchange rate flexibility should be the first line of defense, and consideration might also be given to
raising domestic interest rates.
23.
Moving gradually toward using inflation as a nominal anchor would provide a better
framework for monetary policy. Currently there exist multiple targets and instruments, including
broad money, bank credit, and various interest rates. A daily US$/VND exchange rate target is
announced, with a band of ±1 percent. Maintaining a supportive stance and the exchange rate peg
will be challenging in the near term if global interest rates rise. In the medium term, the economy will
increasingly face asymmetric shocks and would benefit from an independent monetary policy. To
start, the band for exchange rate fluctuation could be gradually widened, reforms initiated to
promote a deep and liquid foreign exchange market and establish an interest rate instrument while
reducing reliance on quantitative targets, liquidity forecasting and management improved, and
monetary policy communications increasingly geared toward price stability.
24.
Greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb external shocks and facilitate
reserves accumulation. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated by about 2 percent
compared to a year ago. However, the results of CGER-type analysis and broader trends in the
balance of payments suggest there is no convincing evidence of misalignment. Notwithstanding,
further strengthening international reserve adequacy would improve resilience (Box 5).
25.
The SBV viewed inflation control as a top priority since early 2011 to achieve a more
stable macroeconomic environment conducive for structural reforms. Supportive monetary
conditions remained appropriate in the near term, given low inflation and weak demand, as well as
the dampened transmission mechanism that reflected economic restructuring, financial weaknesses,
and low demand for credit. Despite the recent strong increase in reserves, the authorities considered
further accumulation as desirable, to bring them more in line with adequacy metrics.

Box 4. Vietnam: The Effects of Monetary Policy on Bank Lending
Monetary policy generally affects the supply of bank credit through two channels. The first is direct and
common across banks. The second may vary according to the financial position of each bank—the bank
lending channel—whereby stronger banks are less reliant on central bank funding than weaker banks and
therefore less responsive to changes in policy.1 This box investigates the extent to which credit supply depends
on policy rates in Vietnam, and if this relationship varies with banks’ financial characteristics.
A model is estimated on a panel of balance sheet data for state-owned and other commercial banks over
2000–2013, using an Arellano-Bond GMM specification with fixed effects. To isolate the bank lending channel,
the model introduces an interaction term between the policy interest rate and observed financial heterogeneity
across banks. It controls for loan demand determinants, such as past loan growth, GDP growth, and the cyclical
effects on banks’ profitability, size, liquidity, capital, and borrowers’ risk (loan loss provision); as well as
unobserved heterogeneity, e.g., business models and risk propensity. Allowing for the possibility that monetary
policy may affect credit decisions differently after the financial disruption in 2011, a time dummy interacting
with relevant lagged explanatory variables is included. For bank i in period t, loan growth (Li,t) is specified as
follows:2

Key findings: First, changes in monetary policy have an inverse direct impact on private credit growth that is
common across banks.3
Second, the bank lending channel emerges after 2011.
Credit supply by the banking system as a whole reacts
less to policy rate changes compared to the earlier
period, when the impact of policy did not vary with
banks’ financial positions. This channel has dampened
the transmission mechanism.
Third, banks’ health is an overwhelming factor
determining credit supply. A weakening of banks
lowers credit growth, ceteris paribus, while
strengthening banks’ capital and liquidity would have a
vigorous positive impact on credit growth.

Box 5. Vietnam: External Sector Assessment
CGER-type analysis based on the macro-balance and external
sustainability approaches suggests the real exchange rate is
moderately undervalued, requiring a 5–8 percent real effective
appreciation to close the gap between the underlying and
estimated current account norm, ceteris paribus. In contrast,
after a sharp real appreciation in 2012–13 (reflecting high
relative consumer price inflation), the equilibrium real
exchange rate approach points to substantial overvaluation,
with a real effective depreciation of about 16 percent needed
to restore equilibrium. These results are well within the margin
of error, which can be large.
Broader trends also suggest there is no convincing evidence
of misalignment. The external balance of the FDI-intensive
export-oriented sector remains in significant surplus, with the
recent overall current account improvement largely reflecting
a correction in the domestic economy, and thus cyclical
weakness. Wages remain competitive, and foreign direct
investment inflows remain robust. These considerations are
tempered by the level of reserves (see below) and the risk of
the exchange rate becoming overvalued if large public
contingent liabilities are realized during bank restructuring.
Capital and financial account flows have been dominated by
foreign direct investment and relatively smaller portfolio flows
into the country’s two stock markets. Despite the lack of large
and internationally integrated capital markets, other financial
flows have been quite volatile, as demonstrated by the large
outflows recorded in the balance of payments in the second
quarter of 2013 and large negative errors and omissions.

Although they increased recently, measured against several
metrics Vietnam’s international reserves are lower than before
the global financial crisis, and below regional comparator
countries. In early-2014, reserves made up about 2½ months
of prospective imports of goods and services, well below the
8 months average of regional emerging market countries, and
below the minimum level desirable for countries with a fixed
exchange rate, according to the Fund’s reserve adequacy
metric.
Staff’s overall assessment is that the external position would
benefit from further strengthening. The relatively strong
current account position is the result of productivity gains in
the FDI-dominated export sector, a well diversified export
base and markets, and the weak cyclical position of the
domestic economy. As domestic demand recovers in the
baseline scenario, the external position will likely deteriorate
owing to high import elasticity. An accelerated pace of
structural reforms beyond staff’s baseline are needed to
improve productivity, particularly in the domestic sector, and
increase investment efficiency to bolster external
sustainability. Fiscal consolidation, a more flexible exchange
rate and higher reserves would also reduce vulnerabilities.

26.
The SBV broadly agreed with recommendations to enhance the monetary policy
framework. The authorities explained that they had increasingly implemented monetary policy
through short-term interbank interest rates, and were beginning to view money and credit targets as
indicative. Liquidity forecasting had improved, and progress had been made in communicating the
rationale for policy action to help guide market expectations. They noted that a stronger banking
system and increased confidence in the currency would be needed to facilitate a smooth transition
from the exchange rate to inflation as a nominal anchor over the medium term.

C. Banking Sector Reform
27.
The implementation of several recent policy measures will help improve the functioning
of the banking sector. Liquidity has improved thanks to accommodative monetary conditions and
FDI and remittance inflows. Most banks have been asked to submit restructuring plans to the SBV. A
new risk management regulation based on Basle II is being drafted and an adoption roadmap has
been developed, which will be piloted in ten banks.2 The VAMC has begun purchasing NPLs from
commercial banks and is planning liquidation, restructuring, and outright sales to unwind them. Its
capital will be increased. A revised bankruptcy law has been adopted and related legislation is under
review to provide smoother enterprise restructuring and debt resolution. The limit on banks’ single
foreign owner was increased slightly under an unchanged overall foreign ownership cap of
30 percent.3 A new Monetary and Financial Stability Department was created in the SBV, and the SBV
has issued an action plan for the banking sector to supplement existing strategies.
28.
Improved liquidity has given the banking system much needed breathing space, but a
number of key problems remain. Asset quality remains under pressure from weak domestic activity
and recent years’ sharp decline in real estate prices, and profitability is low. Full implementation of
tighter loan classification has been postponed, to 2015, allowing loan rescheduling and new lending to
delinquent customers without reclassification, and some merged institutions are granted time to comply
with key prudential norms. Banks have five years to provision against NPLs sold to the VAMC in
exchange for bonds that are nonmarketable, pay no interest, and are not government guaranteed.
Significant legal hurdles for the transfer of loan titles and collateral impede NPL resolution. The
macroprudential framework requires refinement. Administrative levers including sector-specific lending
directives and interest rate limits remain.
29.
To be successful, reforms must address the root causes of the problem and be bold.
Weak balance sheets, regulatory forbearance, connected lending and cross ownership (including
between banks and SOEs), weak risk management, and the presence of special interest groups will
result in credit being channeled to unprofitable and unproductive businesses and may become a
drain on public resources both in the form of foregone earnings and potential recapitalization costs.
International experience shows that a resumption of robust economic growth is unlikely as long as
banks remain undercapitalized and the monetary policy transmission mechanism is impaired.
2

The piloted banks are expected to implement the Basel II basic indicator approach and standardized approach by 2015
and 2018, respectively, while the remaining joint stock banks will have to comply with the basic indicator approach by 2018.

Higher shares of foreign capital are allowed upon the Prime Minister’s approval.

30.
Staff recommended using breathing space created by improved liquidity conditions to
adopt a more comprehensive and sequenced reform agenda (Box 6). Core pillars include: a more
expeditious recognition of NPLs, supported by bank diagnostic assessments and legal and SOE
reforms; restructuring and recapitalization of viable banks; and orderly exit of insolvent institutions,
supported if necessary by a stronger safety net. A revamped VAMC, with ability to buy and sell
impaired loans at market value as is currently under consideration, could play a significant role. The
crisis management framework and supervision should be strengthened, and the use of administrative
measures gradually eliminated.
31.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s recommendations, but argued for a
more gradual pace. More time was needed to match banks’ capacity to absorb losses generated by
stricter regulatory standards, and to support the economic recovery. In their view, the root causes of
banking sector weakness were clearly identified, forbearance had been tightened, banks were
required to report NPLs to the SBV under stricter norms, and financial weaknesses were not systemic.
The constraints imposed by the existing legal system and connected lending that complicate NPL
resolution, and the decision not to use public funds for recapitalization, were well understood. The
authorities acknowledged the recommendation that a comprehensive reform package, including
solutions to tackle the constraints of budgetary resources and legal reforms, is needed to accelerate
banking reform and NPL resolution. They emphasized that progress had been made in this process.

D. SOE Reform
32.
SOE reform is progressing. Restructuring plans have been developed, and efforts are
focused on amendments to the legal framework, divestment from noncore areas, and equitization.
To improve the legal framework, the government has issued new regulations to enhance SOEs’
financial reporting and transparency, improve internal controls by defining different government
agency responsibilities, and improve corporate governance. To facilitate equitization, enterprises can
now sell assets below book value with the approval of the government, and several have had IPOs.
33.
While improvements to the legal framework are welcome, implementation remains a
challenge, in part due to capacity constraints. Approved restructuring plans have been made
public, but implementation progress is uneven, particularly among some SOEs’ subsidiaries.
Oversight of SOEs by government agencies is fragmented, and the focus on partial equitization risks
diverting attention away from operational reforms to enhance efficiency. Public disclosure of SOEs’
financial condition should be enhanced with timely publication based on international accounting
practices.
34.
Restructuring could be enhanced by several measures. A high-level steering committee to
oversee the reform agenda, facilitate coordination among ministries, and monitor implementation
would expedite progress. Expanding the scope of divestment beyond noncore areas would improve
efficiency and level the playing field for the private sector, particularly if it were accompanied by
external management expertise. Capacity at various ministries could be enhanced, and restructuring
costs estimated to quantify fiscal implications.

Box 6. Vietnam: Bank Reform and Contingency Planning
Key pillars of a comprehensive reform include:


Assessing banks’ recapitalization needs. Prioritize systemically important banks and undertake
diagnostic assessments: (i) on the basis of audits conducted by internationally reputed firms;
(ii) under strict application of prudential norms; and (iii) accounting for connected lending, multiple
gearing, and loan-financed equity injections.



Revising classification criteria to guide resolution options. Based on the diagnostic assessments,
modify banks’ classification as: (i) healthy; (ii) undercapitalized but viable; or (iii) insolvent and
nonviable. Identify systemically important institutions to determine resolution options.



Recapitalizing, restructuring and resolving. Foreign strategic partnerships have provided welcome
capital and management expertise for a number of banks, and the increase in single foreign
ownership limit is welcome, although unlikely to provide significant new capital. Recapitalization of
SOCBs immediately after the diagnostic assessments, along with elimination of forbearance and
implementation of restructuring plans, would support confidence in the system and mitigate moral
hazard. Undercapitalized but viable credit institutions should submit time-bound plans to raise
capital to the regulatory minimum. Non-viable and insolvent institutions should be resolved in an
orderly manner, supported by a legal framework for purchase and assumption transactions.



Strengthening the VAMC. To contribute to effective NPL resolution, the VAMC will likely need more
capital, in the form of equity rather than bonds, and an enabling legal framework to facilitate the
transfer of loans and collateral. It should also be granted legal and operational independence and
transparent governance, given incentives for rapid disposal of assets, and operate with a clearly
defined sunset clause.



Developing additional options to deal with NPLs. Other resolution options designed for different
types of NPLs—which pose different legal challenges—include: (i) a court-led track for large and
complex economic groups; (ii) a bank-led track, facilitated through legislation establishing a “prepackaged” plan covering negotiation and approval mechanisms; and (iii) a special administrative
restructuring track for selected SOEs financed exclusively by SOCBs. NPL resolution should be
carried out in coordination with restructuring programs for the indebted SOEs.



Tightening supervision to ensure sound lending practices going forward. Risk mitigation would
require the immediate elimination of measures allowing lending to defaulted borrowers.
Regulatory forbearance should be phased out as soon as feasible, while reform towards risk-based
supervision continues over the medium term.



Revamping the architecture and procedures for crisis management, including: (i) a senior policy
group (SPG) for decision making comprising the SBV Governor, Minister of Finance and relevant
deputies; (ii) a technical secretariat to provide daily reports and analysis to the SPG; (iii) preparation
of templates for notifications and instructions to banks; and (iv) a communications strategy.



Strengthening financial safety nets during the reform process. Extraordinary liquidity provision and
extended coverage of deposit insurance (DI) may be necessary during the reform process, but the
conditions under which they are provided and the funding of the DI should be identified ex-ante
and in a fiscally transparent manner.

35.
The authorities emphasized their efforts to develop the legal framework, and to
improve the management and supervision of SOEs. They agreed that the current ownership
structure of SOEs is fragmented. Equitization efforts are constrained by weak economic conditions,
and budgetary resources are not available to fund SOE restructuring. The authorities hoped to make
significant progress by end-2015. They also explained they are currently drafting a law to make
dividend payments from profitable SOEs permanent.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Vietnam has made significant progress with macroeconomic stabilization and
important steps in banking and SOE reform. Growth is recovering and inflation has been reduced
to mid-single digits, substantially lower than a few years ago. The current account remains in surplus
and gross international reserves have risen in recent years. Banking system liquidity has improved,
and steps toward bank restructuring—albeit gradual—are underway. The VAMC continues to
purchase NPLs and is planning resolution. SOE reform has also moved forward with restructuring
plans, amendments to the legal framework and equitization.
37.
Nevertheless, economic growth remains below potential and important risks exist.
Growth continues to be constrained by weak banks and inefficient SOEs. Public debt is rising and
approaching a level that reduces fiscal space for critical expenditures and potential costs of banking
and SOE reforms. The gradual pace of banking reform leaves the system vulnerable to adverse
shocks and negative macro-financial feedback, which could undermine growth and add significantly
to public sector debt. The economy is also vulnerable to spillovers from external shocks including
surges in global financial volatility, slower trading partner growth and regional geopolitical tensions.
38.
Fiscal consolidation that creates space for critical expenditures and possible contingent
liabilities would reduce risk and support growth. A medium-term plan to return public debt to
around 45 percent of GDP should be implemented in a growth-friendly manner, and would provide
space for potential bank and SOE restructuring costs. Raising revenue would allow consolidation to
take place while safeguarding social spending and well-targeted capital expenditure to support
growth and inclusiveness. This is achievable with a strategy to broaden the base, improve
administration, forego further corporate income tax rate reductions, and institutionalize SOE
dividend payments to the budget. There is also space to rationalize public expenditure, including
broader civil service reforms that raise efficiency and address the large public wage bill. Reforms to
increase public investment efficiency are welcome.
39.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate and the monetary policy framework
should gradually shift from the exchange rate to inflation as the nominal anchor. With output
below estimated potential, supportive monetary conditions are appropriate as long as inflation
pressures remain muted. The recent increase in international reserves is welcome, and greater
exchange rate flexibility would help buffer shocks and facilitate higher reserve adequacy. Preparing
the groundwork for moving toward inflation as a nominal anchor will be crucial for a successful
transition. Initial steps could be taken to promote a deep and liquid foreign exchange market, initiate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

reforms to establish an interest rate instrument, improve liquidity forecasting and management, and
gear policy communications toward price stability.
40.
A comprehensive approach to banking sector restructuring is critical to reduce macrofinancial risks and for sustainable robust economic growth. The current gradual approach charts
a risky path forward. Not addressing weaknesses forcefully, and instead relying on de facto
forbearance and liquidity will deprive economic growth of a key engine—new credit to profitable
enterprises—and makes the system susceptible to adverse shocks and asset deterioration against
which banks would not be adequately provisioned. This is compounded by a high risk of contagion
brought about by cross-ownership among banks, and between banks and enterprises, with the
potential for adverse feedback loops.
41.
A more expeditious recognition of losses on NPLs, restructuring of viable banks, and
an orderly exit of insolvent institutions is recommended. Prioritized diagnostic assessments of
banks under application of stricter prudential norms would focus restructuring efforts and provide
estimates of recapitalization costs. Recapitalization, including greater foreign participation and using
public funds under strict conditions for systemically important institutions, elimination of
forbearance, and continued strengthening of supervision would improve confidence, credit flows and
the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and allocation of resources. Legal reforms to facilitate
NPL resolution—beyond the revision to the bankruptcy law—are also needed. Plans to strengthen
the VAMC with equity capital and the ability to buy and sell NPLs at market value are welcome.
Additional options to deal with NPLs, such as bank- and court-led and administrative tracks, should
also be considered. Finally, a stronger crisis management framework should be pursued.
42.
Accelerating SOE reform will reduce risks and support growth by improving the
allocation of resources. While the authorities have made progress, further efforts are needed to
accelerate implementation and improve coordination of the reform agenda, which is fragmented
over different agencies and ministries. It will be important that efforts go beyond partial equitization
and focus on strengthening corporate governance and ensuring a level playing field.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

and the International Development Association in
consultation with the Asian Development Bank

Based on the LIC Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), Vietnam is at low risk of external
debt distress.1 Although public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt and total
public debt are below vulnerability thresholds and benchmarks under the baseline
scenario, overall debt is becoming a concern due to an increase in domestic debt and
prospects for loose fiscal policy going forward. Public debt indicators are significantly
higher than in the previous DSA, and are projected to worsen in the medium-term before
beginning to decline. Specifically, the PPG debt ratio is expected to rise to around
60 percent of GDP in 2017 before falling to around 48 percent of GDP at the end of the
projection period. The ratio of debt service to revenue is also projected to rise throughout
most of the projection period as the level of concessionality of Vietnam’s debt is projected
to decline. A scenario that keeps the primary fiscal deficit fixed at its 2013 level would
result in unsustainable debt dynamics. An alternative scenario that simulates banking
sector distress could also bring the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio above the
benchmark for public debt for most of the projection period.2

Vietnam’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment, averaged 3.8 over the past three years, placing it as a “strong performer.” The relevant indicative
thresholds for this category are 50 percent for the present value (PV) of the debt-to-GDP ratio, 200 percent for
the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio, 300 percent for the PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio, 25 percent for the
debt service-to-exports ratio, and 200 percent for the debt-service-to-revenue-ratio. These thresholds are
applicable to public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt.

This DSA was prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staff, in consultation with the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB). The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Vietnamese authorities and donor
partners. Data beyond end-2013 are staff estimates and projections.

A. Background
1.
Vietnam’s debt has been rising rapidly in recent years. This has mainly been due to
increases in the PPG domestic debt, while external debt has been relatively stable. At end-2013, the
total external debt (including private sector debt) amounted to 38.5 percent of GDP, while the public
and PPG external debt amounted to 26.5 percent of GDP. The domestic PPG debt amounted to
25 percent in 2013, leading the total PPG debt (domestic and external) to 51.6 percent of GDP. The
recent increase in domestic debt is mainly related to domestic fiscal financing requirements in 2012–
13, which were significantly higher than projected during the last DSA.
2.
This DSA covers the public and publicly guaranteed external debt and the domestic
debt of the general public sector, including the central government, local governments and stateowned enterprises (SOEs). On the external side, 11 percent of GDP is owed to multilateral creditors,
9½ percent of GDP to bilateral creditors, and 1 percent of GDP to commercial creditors. An additional
5 percent of GDP is publicly guaranteed debt of SOEs, largely commercial. Private external debt is
estimated at 5.6 percent of GDP. The level of concessionality of PPG external debt has a grant
element estimated at about 12 percent.
3.
On the domestic side, about 13 percentage points of GDP of domestic debt consists of
marketable and nonmarketable securities (bonds) and about 6 percentage points consists of loans
and advances from the private sector financial institutions. An additional 6 percentage points consists
of domestic publicly guaranteed debt of the SOEs. Domestic debt is in local currency and the
effective nominal interest rate has remained at around 5 percent between 2010 and 2013. The
government issues bonds in the domestic market, with an average term at 3.8 years in 2013, and a
coupon ranging from 7.5 to 9 percent. These are mostly held by banks, with a small proportion
(about 7 percent of the outstanding stock) held by nonresidents.

B. Underlying Assumptions
4.

2

The assumptions for this DSA differ from the previous DSA in a number of areas (Box 1):


Slightly higher near-term growth. The previous DSA had real GDP growth rising to
5½ percent through 2020, and stable thereafter. This DSA assumes real GDP growth
rising gradually to 6 percent through 2020 in line with potential, and then declining in
the long term to 5½ percent as the demographic dividend abates and the economy
matures.



Lower inflation. This is in line with the lower inflation outcome for 2013 and projections
for a continued negative output gap in the medium-term, closing only gradually.



Higher net borrowing by the government. The previous DSA assumed a fiscal
consolidation starting in 2013. This DSA assumes that net borrowing by the
government continues at a high level in line with a loose fiscal policy through 2017

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

that brings the debt ratio to 60 percent of GDP, before beginning a gradual
consolidation thereafter.


The authorities’ financing strategy going forward relies increasingly on domestic debt, as
they have emphasized the need to develop the domestic debt market. In addition, as
the concessionality of external debt is reduced in line with Vietnam’s graduation from
low-income status in 2017, the advantage of accessing external debt will diminish.

C. External DSA
5.
Under the baseline scenario, the ratio of the PV of PPG external debt to GDP is
projected to decline in the long-term, and to remain well below the relevant thresholds
(Figure 1). In addition, the ratio of the PV of PPG external debt to exports and to revenue also
declines gradually during the projection period and remains well below the relevant thresholds. The
debt-service to revenue ratio is projected to rise in the medium-term before declining gradually,
largely because the grace period for recent borrowing is ending and revenue growth is projected to
slow down. If remittances are included in the denominator of the debt indicator calculations these
results continue to hold.
6.
Alternative scenarios suggest that the PV of PPG external debt is most sensitive to a
one-time depreciation of the exchange rate, but even under these scenarios the debt would
remain well below thresholds. Under an historical scenario stress test (not shown in the charts), which
projects debt ratios based on real GDP growth, the GDP deflator, the non-interest current account
and new FDI flows set at their 10-year historical average, the ratios of the present value of debt to
GDP, exports and revenue would all become negative over the long-term. This reflects the historical
non-interest current account surplus, the high level of FDI inflows and the high grant element of
Vietnam’s external debt in the last 10 years.

D. Public DSA
7.
Public debt remains below the thresholds for distress in the baseline, but without a
gradual consolidation the risk of debt distress could rise rapidly (Figure 2). Public sector debt is
projected to increase in nominal terms, reaching around 60 percent of GDP by 2017. As noted above,
the assumptions underlying this scenario are that a gradual consolidation takes place such that the
debt ratio begins to decline after reaching this level from 2020 forwards. The ratio of the PV of debt
to GDP also rises before beginning a gradual decline. However, at all times it is below the benchmark
of 74 percent of GDP.
8.
Alternative scenarios highlight the growing vulnerability to debt distress. The scenario
that keeps the primary balance at its 2013 level (a deficit of 4 percent of GDP) would result in the PV
of debt to GDP becoming unsustainable and rising throughout the projection period. Under the
alternative scenario that includes a one-time nominal depreciation of the exchange rate by
30 percent in the first year of the projection period (the most extreme shock), the ratio of the PV of
debt to GDP rises to about 10 percentage points below the benchmark in 2016–18 before beginning

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

to decline thereafter. These scenarios illustrate the increased risk that the current profile of debt and
fiscal policy imply for public debt.
9.
Under a customized scenario that simulates banking sector distress, the public debt
would breach the benchmark. The scenario assumes an additional 15 percent of GDP in liabilities
absorbed by the government over the first two years of the projection period, with GDP growth
falling to 3 percent in both years before returning to its baseline path. Additional debt is assumed to
be domestic and on similar terms to the current domestic debt (five years maturity and 7 percent
coupon). Under this scenario the PV of debt to GDP would hit the benchmark of 74 percent around
2019 and remain above the benchmark for most of the projection period. The PV of debt to revenue
ratio would rise to over 350 percent, and the debt service to revenue ratio would rise to over
70 percent in the long-term. These ratios would be higher if financing conditions were less favorable.

E. Conclusion
10.
Debt indicators remain below thresholds for distress, but are moving toward
increasing risk. Current indicators place Vietnam at low risk of debt distress. For external debt,
Vietnam’s current account surpluses and foreign direct investment flows help keep the risk of debt
distress well below benchmark levels. However, for the total public debt, the fixed primary balance
stress test indicates that maintaining primary deficits at their current level going forward would result
in an increase of the ratio of PV of debt to GDP to unsustainable levels. As well, domestic interest
rates and/or private external debt could increase as public financing pressures build. A worst case
scenario stress test for the public debt (a one-time nominal depreciation of 30 percent in the first
year of the projection period) would bring the PV of debt to GDP ratio to within 10 percent of the
threshold level for debt distress in 2016–18. A bank distress scenario that adds 15 percent of GDP to
the public debt in two years would bring the public debt above the threshold for most of the
projection period. This highlights the increasing vulnerability of Vietnam’s current debt path,
particularly to a large debt shock.
11.
The authorities broadly agree with the DSA. They agree that the risk of external debt
distress remains very low, but the profile of public debt has worsened relative to last year. The
authorities see the recent public debt increase as necessary to finance ongoing public investment
projects, but recognize that it is reaching levels that warrant increased attention. Nevertheless, they
pointed out that the debt ratio remains well below the 65 percent of GDP limit that has been
imposed by the National Assembly. Should debt continue to rise as in the baseline, the authorities
stated that they would begin a consolidation. They recognize the risks surrounding the strategy to
address banking and SOE reforms, but continued to emphasize that budgetary resources would not
be used to recapitalize banks or restructure SOE debt.

Box 1. Vietnam: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario, 2014–34
Real GDP growth is projected at 5.6 percent in 2014, and rising gradually to 6 percent in 2018–
2020. After 2020 growth is projected to decline gradually to 5½ percent as the demographic
dividend dissipates and the economy matures.
Inflation is projected to decline gradually from its level of 6 percent in 2013 to 4½ percent in the
medium- and long-term. This is related to a negative output gap, and in the long run an assumed
implicit policy objective of maintaining inflation around mid-single digits.
The current account is expected to remain in surplus in the near-term due to strong export
growth related to foreign direct investment and demand from major trading partners, while
imports remain subdued in line with domestic economic activity. In the medium-term the current
account is expected to deteriorate as the economy recovers, and reach the deficit “norm” of
4½ percent in the long term, mostly financed by continued FDI flows.
The capital and financial account surplus which moved into a small deficit in 2013 is projected
to continue to be negative in 2014 as international interest rates rise. In the medium-term the
capital and financial account is expected to stabilize at a surplus of around 3½ percent of GDP
related to FDI inflows and a gradual expansion and opening of the domestic capital market.
Reserve coverage is expected to remain at around 2½ months of imports in 2014, but to rise to
about 3½ months of imports by 2016 and stabilize at this level thereafter.
The effective average interest rate on foreign borrowing is expected to be about 2 percent in
2014 reflecting the concessionality of borrowing in the short-term, but to rise to about
3½ percent in the long run. Interest rates on external borrowing are expected to rise only
gradually as the average maturity of the current external debt is long (over 12 years) and most
loans (over 90 percent) are at fixed interest rates.
Net borrowing by government is projected to be high in 2014, and continue at a high though
declining level through 2017, to bring the debt ratio to around 60 percent of GDP. It is expected
to decline in the long run, to bring the overall debt ratio to around 48 percent of GDP by 2034.
The primary deficit is expected to be around 5 percent of GDP in 2014 and to decline gradually to
around 2 percent of GDP in 2019. Maturing international bonds are assumed to be rolled over.
Contingent liabilities or exceptional financing are not assumed in the baseline scenario.

Exchange Arrangement
The exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized.” The de jure arrangement is managed
floating. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) announced a 1 percent devaluation of the dong (VND) on
June 18, 2014 and maintained the trading band at ±1 percent.
Vietnam maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, except for those exchange restrictions imposed for security
reasons of which Vietnam has notified the IMF pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51), 8/14/52.

Article IV Consultations
Vietnam is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was held in Hanoi during
April 8–25, 2013, and was concluded by the Executive Board on June 24, 2013 (Public Information
Notice No. 13/304).
Technical Assistance
In recent years, Vietnam has received extensive technical assistance (TA) in the areas of tax policy
and administration, public financial management, statistics (government finance, external sector,
price, and national accounts), financial soundness indicators, stress testing the banking sector, and
monetary operations and liquidity management. From December 2008 to January 2012, a resident
advisor assisted the authorities in improving banking supervision. The IMF-World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program was undertaken during 2012–13.

RELATIONS AND COLLABORATION WITH THE WORLD
BANK GROUP1
(As of June 18, 2014)
Partnership in Vietnam's Development Strategy
The World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Vietnam was presented to the Board of
Directors in December 2011. The CPS is aligned with Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development
Strategy (SEDS) 2011–15 and sets out the World Bank’s planned support for Vietnam between FY12
and FY16. The CPS program supports investments and policies organized into a strategic framework
of three pillars and three cross-cutting themes. The pillars are: (i) strengthening Vietnam's
competitiveness in the regional and global economy, (ii) increasing the sustainability of its
development, and (iii) broadening access to opportunity. Key cross-cutting themes are:
(i) strengthening governance; (ii) supporting gender equity; and (iii) improving resilience in the face
of external economic shocks, natural hazards, and the impact of climate change. 1
An underlying theme in the CPS is the importance of building on the country's strong track record
of growth and poverty reduction to partner with Vietnam in its effort to achieve success as a middleincome country (MIC). The CPS program supports reforms for Vietnam’s multiple transitions,
notably, from an agrarian economy toward one that is more urban and industrialized; from a focus
on quantity toward a greater focus on quality of production and service provision; and from a factor
driven to an efficiency driven economy.
World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group uses a broad range of instruments including development policy loans,
program for results (PforR) and investment operations, and analytical and advisory activities; the
IFC’s equity, loan, and technical assistance (TA) participations and the Mekong Private Sector
Development Facility (MPDF); Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) activities; and
donor partnerships and ODA coordination.
Scale of the World Bank Group program: The WB Portfolio is large, with a significant IDA16
Allocation amounting to US$4.37 billion. The program has grown and diversified over the past
several years. As of June 9, 2014, the portfolio consisted of 50 IDA/IBRD operations and six standalone Global Environment Facility (GEF), Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), and large Recipient Executed
Trust Funds (RETF) projects, with the total net commitments of US$9.7 billion. Vietnam became an
IDA/IBRD blend country in FY10. So far, IBRD resources of US$1.9 billion have been used to finance
two DPO series, an expressway, a transmission and distribution project, and a hydro-power project.

International Finance Corporation (IFC) commitments totaled US$2,597 million over the five-year
period of FY11–FY13, including mobilization through its asset management business and
commercial banks, and commitments for FY14 is expected to surpass US$1 billion.
Lending program: The World Bank has a diverse lending program supporting infrastructure, rural
development, human resources, and improvement in economic and financial sector management.
Support to infrastructure includes energy supply and distribution, rural and national road
development, water and wastewater treatment, irrigation systems rehabilitation, and natural
resources management. For rural water and sanitation, the first PforR operation was approved in
support of Vietnam’s National Targeted Program in FY13. A second PforR was approved by the
Board for National Urban Program in early June this year. The program also supports development
of health systems to ensure increased access to quality health services and education quality
improvements. Key elements of economic management support include a multi-year development
policy loan linked to reforms on economic management and competitiveness, tax system reform,
and development and modernization of public financial management and financial systems.
Knowledge program: The World Bank supports the government’s efforts to strengthen institutional
capacity through its extensive knowledge program of analytical and advisory services. While
financing is still an important part of the partnership between the Vietnamese government and the
World Bank, Vietnam’s new status as a MIC highlights the important role the Bank can and does play
in generating knowledge and sharing global experiences and best practice. The annual Vietnam
Development Reports (VDRs) summarize the accumulated knowledge in a specific policy area of
Vietnam’s reform agenda. Recent VDRs have focused on thematic areas such as skills development,
Vietnam’s transition to a market economy, natural resource management, and modern institutions.
The 2015 VDR will focus on long-term growth and competitiveness.
Other reports during this period have included a Fiscal Transparency Review, a Poverty Assessment,
a report on Trade Facilitation, Value Creation, and Competitiveness, and an Urbanization Review.
Forthcoming reports cover the topics of Fiscal Decentralization, Public Expenditure Review, and
Conflict of Interest. In addition, the World Bank continues to provide technical assistance in areas
such as governance, social protection, renewable energy, climate change adaptation, financial sector
reform, and public financial management reform.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Vietnam
Specific Areas: Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004, the two institutions have closely
collaborated on monitoring the macroeconomic situation, and in discussions of PRSC triggers and
benchmarks in the policy areas that used to be covered by the PRGF agreement. The IMF has
provided assessment letters in support of PRSC and EMCC operations. In the area of public financial
management, the World Bank recently closed an investment credit to support the introduction of a
modern Treasury and Budget Management Information System, and a large multi-donor trust fund
to provide technical advice for public financial management reform. It also has an investment loan
for Tax Administration Modernization. The World Bank is preparing a Programmatic Public Finance

Review (PPFR), and collaborates closely on this with the IMF. There is close cooperation between the
IMF’s Regional PFM Advisor and the Bank team in Hanoi.
In recent years, joint work has been carried out to support the establishment of a modern central
bank, with the IMF providing TA on monetary policy and operations, and both the World Bank and
IMF providing TA on banking supervision. The World Bank has also set up investment credits to
support development of an integrated system of advanced business processes and modern
information technology at the SBV (including for the Deposit Insurance Agency and Credit
Information Center) to improve its capacity to make more informed and timely policy decisions. The
IMF and World Bank conducted Vietnam’s first joint Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
during 2012–13. Since 2005, the World Bank and the IMF have jointly prepared an annual Debt
Sustainability Assessment. The Asian Development Bank has joined since 2009. Training to the
authorities on debt management is ongoing. There has been close coordination with the Fiscal
Affairs Department on tax policy and administration issues, including the recent amendments to the
Laws on Corporate Income Tax and Value Added Tax. The IMF and the World Bank also collaborate
in the development and timely dissemination of reliable economic and financial statistics. The IMF
focuses on improving balance of payments, national accounts, price, and government finance
statistics, while the World Bank provides assistance on issues related to the production of highquality household and enterprise surveys and facilitate the implementation of National Gender
Indicators System. The two institutions consult during Article IV consultations in order to share
information and help coordinate policies.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 2014)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working in partnership with the Government of
Vietnam—a 1966 founding member of ADB—since the resumption of operations in 1993.
ADB’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2012–2015 is fully aligned with the Socio-Economic
Development Plan (SEDP), 2011–2015, and supports issues arising from Vietnam’s recent transition
to a middle-income country. The CPS focuses ADB assistance to Vietnam through three pillars of
inclusive growth, enhancing economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. To maximize
ADB’s development impacts, ADB prioritizes six sectors: (i) agriculture and natural resources;
(ii) education; (iii) energy; (iv) finance; (v) transport; and (vi) water supply, and other municipal
infrastructure and services. Public sector management is crosscutting and mainstreamed in terms of
sector operations through reform and policy-oriented support.
ADB is supporting the
implementation of structural
reforms that increase
competitiveness and assist
Vietnam in transitioning to a
middle-income country. ADB
is engaged in policy dialogue
on financial sector and stateowned enterprise (SOE)
reforms. To facilitate faster
development of infrastructure,
ADB is assisting the
government to develop a pilot
scheme to promote public–
private partnerships.

From October 1993 until December 31, 2013, ADB has provided 133 sovereign loans totaling
US$12.5 billion, 280 technical assistance grant projects amounting to US$258.3 million and 31 grant
projects totaling US$305 million to Vietnam (Tables 2–4).
As a catalyst for private investments, ADB also provides direct financial assistance to nonsovereign
public sector and private sector projects in the form of direct loans, equity investments, guarantees,
B loans, and trade finance. Since its inception to end-2013, ADB has approved a total of
US$280 million in non-sovereign financing for Vietnam, all of which was for seven private sector
projects. Total outstanding balances and commitments of ADB’s private sector transactions in the
country as of December 31, 2013 totaled about US$169.7 million, representing 4.6 percent of ADB’s
total nonsovereign portfolio.
ADB’s Trade Finance Program (TFP) fills market gaps in trade finance by providing guarantees and
loans through over 200 partner banks in support of trade. The TFP has supported US$16 billion in
trade involving almost 6,500 small and medium-sized enterprises. In Vietnam, the TFP works with
nine banks and has supported over US$4.7 billion in trade between 3,200 transactions by almost
2,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises. In addition to filling market gaps, the TFP’s objective is
to mobilize private sector capital/ involvement in developing Asia. In Vietnam, over 69 percent of
the US$3.6 billion in trade supported through the TFP was co-financed by the private sector.
Vietnam also receives substantial support under the Greater Mekong Sub-region initiatives,
involving Cambodia, China, Lao P.D.R., Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.
As part of its regular operations, ADB coordinates closely with Vietnam’s development partners to
improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of its lending and non lending programs. ADB also
works closely with civil society organizations and the private sector in Vietnam to mobilize financial
resources and expertise from other partners. ADB is an active member of the Aid Effectiveness
Forum and the Six Banks Initiative—comprising ADB, Agence Française de Développement (AFD),
KfW, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Export Import Bank of Korea, and the World Bank.
Co-financing operations enable ADB’s financing partners, governments or their agencies,
multilateral financing institutions, and commercial organizations, to participate in the financing of
ADB projects. The additional funds are provided in the form of official loans and grants, and
commercial financing, such as B loans, risk transfer arrangements, parallel loans, and co-financing
for transactions under ADB’s TFP. As of December 31, 2013, cumulative direct value-added official
co-financing for Vietnam amounted to US$3.65 billion for 46 investment projects and
US$95.6 million for 76 co-financing technical assistance projects.
The ADB and IMF staffs coordinate through ad hoc information exchange information on policy
matters.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 6, 2014)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: financial sector, national accounts, government finance, and external sector
statistics.
National accounts: The General Statistics Office (GSO) provides quarterly (cumulative) and annual
data on GDP by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure (both in current and
constant prices), and monthly and annual data on external trade, industrial output, retail sales, and
prices. The GSO recently rebased the national accounts to 2010 as the base year from 1994. While
the national accounts methodologies are broadly consistent with the SNA93, the data collection
practices and coordination between data collection agencies could be strengthened. A recent
National Accounts technical assistance mission made the following recommendations: (i) adoption
of labor input methods to improve the coverage of the nonobserved economy, (ii) estimation of
capital stock, consumption of fixed capital and change in inventories, (iii) allocation of financial
intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM), (iv) expansion of production and asset
boundaries according to 1993/2008 SNA, (v) use of the supply-use framework to ensure consistency
between production and expenditure GDP data, and (vi) the use of double deflation methods for
constant price estimates.
Prices statistics: The CPI methodology is largely in line with international standards. However, there
is only a notional inclusion of owner-occupied and rental housing. Also, there is a need to adopt a
geometric mean of price relatives at the lower level of aggregation, instead of the upward biased
arithmetic mean. Trade price indices are also compiled, but not used in the national accounts. The
GSO has developed a work program with assistance of Fund TA to improve the accuracy of the
consumer, producer and trade price indices, and is working toward the development of construction
and services price indices.
Government finance statistics: Government operations data reflect the consolidated operations of
the state budget, which cover all four levels of government (central, provincial, district, and
commune). However, data exclude quasi fiscal activities of the central bank (and state-owned
enterprises (SOEs)), and extra-budgetary funds, among which are the Social Security Fund,
Enterprise Restructuring Fund, Development Assistance Fund, Export Support Fund, local
development funds, and the Sinking Fund (for repayment of on-lent funds), for which data are not
compiled/disseminated on a regular basis. Compilation is on a cash basis for final annual data, but
varies for provisional data depending on their source. As a result, government financing data, in

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

particular domestic bank financing, cannot be reconciled as reported in the fiscal and monetary
accounts. The World Bank and the IMF have recommended improving the coverage of fiscal data
and aligning definitions with the GFSM 2001. Vietnam tentatively confirmed participation in the
three-year GFS technical assistance (TA) project for Asia and Pacific Island countries, funded by the
Japanese government. Participation in this project, launched recently by STA, could enhance further
the quality of fiscal data.
Monetary statistics: The IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) has encouraged the State Bank of
Vietnam (SBV) to develop a reporting scheme for a comprehensive break-down of banks’ credit to
the economy by borrowing sectors and subsectors. In addition, STA has recommended that: (a) a list
of SOEs that have been privatized and, therefore, should be classified as private enterprises should
be distributed to banks in order to guide their data reporting on enterprises; (b) funds for onlending should be reclassified out of banks’ “unclassified liabilities” to “other deposits.”
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics rely on limited source data, resulting in
gaps in several areas of the external accounts (current, capital, and financial). The authorities are
working on improving data on tourism revenue (travel) and workers’ remittances, supported by IMF’s
STA TA. STA technical assistance missions have made the following observations and
recommendations: (i) the available resources are not sufficient to ensure effective implementation of
an International Transaction Reporting System; (ii) further improvements are still needed in the
treatment of goods for processing in line with BPM6, improvement of remittances estimates, and
further study on unrecorded trade in gold; (iii) to establish a uniform concept of direct investment
(DI) in the national legislation and develop a reliable data source on DI stocks (at present DI data are
based on regulatory approvals) given that it is an important component of the International
Investment Position; (iv) address significant errors and omissions in the balance of payments, which
could be related to underestimation of DI flows and estimates of changes in household holdings of
foreign exchange in cash; (v) international reserves transactions need to be distinguished from
valuation changes; (vi) dissemination of external sector statistics, in line with internationally accepted
practices.
Financial sector statistics: The availability of data on the financial sector is very limited, and the
quality of data requires substantial improvement, even on key financial soundness indicators.

Data Standards and Quality
Vietnam is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since September 2003. In
conjunction with the authorities, staff from STA have developed a roadmap for Vietnam’s eventual
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
No data ROSC are available.

Reporting to STA
Currently, no government finance statistics (GFS) are reported for publication in the IMF’s
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GSY) or International Financial Statistics (IFS). Annual GFS
data through 2004, excluding extra-budgetary funds and social security funds, based on the 1986
GFS format, have been reported for publication in the GFSY. No sub-annual fiscal data have been
reported for publication in IFS since 2001.

Statement by Mr. Abdul Ghaffour, Alternate Executive Director and
Ms. Nguyen, Advisor to the Executive Director
On Vietnam Staff Report for the 2014 Article IV Consultation
1.

Our authorities highly appreciate the candid and constructive discussions on macroeconomic
developments and policy issues in Vietnam during the 2014 Article IV Consultation of the IMF
mission led by Mr. John Nelmes. Our authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment and main
policy recommendations. Achievements of containing inflation, preserving macro stability, and
accelerating SOEs and banking sector reforms, whilst ensuring sustainable economic growth and
social security of Vietnam have been well acknowledged by the Staff. The useful advice
rendered during the Article IV Consultation should be reflected upon and considered in the
authorities’ development plan. In this statement, we will elaborate our view on some key areas.

Economic Developments
2.

Despite challenging global environment and domestic difficulties, with great efforts of
Vietnam government, the economy continues to gain commendable achievements in
macroeconomic stabilization and inflation containment, with accelerating GDP growth.
These positive developments have contributed to record high international reserves of more than
USD36 billion as at the end of May 2014, equivalent to around 12 weeks of prospective imports
of goods and services, and expected to be built up further.

Monetary, exchange rate and credit policies
3.

Exchange rate policy is flexibly managed in line with other monetary instruments in order
to stabilize the market. Given low inflation for the first five months of 2014 and stable
exchange rates for a long time, the SBV proactively depreciated the VND by 100 bps on June 19,
2014 to promote economic activities. The market quickly restores its stability and the VND has
been appreciated recently that facilitates the SBV to continue to buy USD from the market to
increase its international reserves.

4.

Liquidity in the banking system is ample that facilitates banking sector reforms. It appears
that banks would like to provide credit to customers while also focus on improving credit quality
and safety in banking system operations. In addition, although credit growth is low due to weak
domestic demand as well as difficulties in the economy, credit policy has been conducted in a
flexible manner including lending in foreign currency and channeling credit to prioritized
sectors.

Fiscal Policy
5.

The authorities view fiscal consolidation as a crucial element to ensure fiscal sustainability
in the long run and commit towards fiscal consolidation. The recent difficult external and
domestic conditions have had adverse impacts on businesses, especially domestic enterprises. To
provide some breathing space for businesses, the Government allowed reductions, deferrals, and
exemptions in certain types of taxes and revenue that will foster economic development and
increase budget revenue in the long run. In addition, budget expenditure will continue to be
tightened. To ease pressure on budget spending and enhance public service efficiency, the

2
Government plans to reduce the size of public service staff in the next few years and delays the
planned roadmap of public salary increase. We share the Staff recommendation that fiscal
consolidation should protect social spending and investment and makes space for potential NPL
resolutions and banks recapitalization.
6.

Public investment reform has always been an important agenda of the authorities. The
revised Public Investment Law was adopted by the National Assembly in 2014 to enhance the
efficiency of public investment activities, and greater use of public-private partnership.

Financial Sector Reform
7.

The Government and the SBV have proposed comprehensive and synchronous measures to
solve the root cause of the system’s weaknesses. As a result, the credit institution (CI)
restructuring has gained significant progresses and the financial condition of the banking system
has made improvements. We share the IMF’s recommendation that there needs to be a
comprehensive reform package to promote the banking reform process and NPL resolution,
especially to allocate state budget for those activites and accelerate legal reform.

8.

While we find the IMF’s recommendation to push ahead with further banking sector
reform and NPL resolution are plausible, significant progresses have been made regarding
banking governance and supervision as well as legal framework for banking sector in
Vietnam. The risk-based supervision has been improved following the SBV’s Action plan for
the implementation of 2011-2015 Banking Restructuring Plan. In addition, all banks are required
to submit their operational and financial restructuring plans for approval of the SBV.

9.

NPL resolution has also achieved positive outcomes given the constraints of budgetary
resources and legal reforms. The VAMC initially appears to be effective in curbing and
resolving NPLs. A large portion of NPLs has been removed from the system. To accommodate
the VAMC’s enlarged operations, its chartered capital will be tripled by end-2014.

10.

Legal framework on loan classification and provisioning has been improved. Circular 02
was effective from June 1, 2014. However, due to the slow pace of recovery of the Vietnamese
economy, we believe that the full implementation of Circular 02 would have great impacts on the
banking system, especially on restricting credit expansion and accessibility. Therefore, to
support the economic activities, the authorities issued Circular 09 that amend and supplement
some articles of Circular 02 by allowing loan rescheduling without reclassification from 20
March 2014 to 31 March 2015 subject to very rigorous conditions, such as: (i) loan rescheduling
can only be undertaken once during the term of the loan; (ii) customers have to provide a feasible
repayment plan in line with the purpose of the borrowing in the credit contract, production and
business conditions, satisfying prudential ratios and limitation requirements; (iii) CIs have to
issue internal regulations to strictly control and supervise the loans and periodically report to the
SBV; and (iv) CIs have to maintain loan classification based on consolidated results from the
Credit Information Center.

SOE Reforms
11.

Although facing many challenges, we see that the authorities have made great efforts in
supporting SOE restructuring, and believe significant reform progresses can be achieved

3
by end-2015. Restructuring plans have been developed, and efforts are focused on amendments
to the legal framework by issuing new regulations to enhance SOEs’ financial reporting and
transparency, improve internal controls and corporate governance, and support SOEs in
equitization and divesting from non-core businesses, such as Resolution No. 15/NQ-CP, Land
Law 2013 and Bankruptcy Law 2014. That would facilitate to remove constraints on bankruptcy
proceedings, help VAMC timely handle debts and mortgaged assets, and contribute to speeding
up NPL resolution.
Concluding Remarks
While Vietnam will continue to implement its reform agenda to take full advantage of the country’s
growth prospects within the growing Asian region, they are mindful of considerable challenges ahead
and realize that sustainable results would take time to materialize. We share the full commitment and
determination of the authorities towards undertaking necessary restructuring measures and policies to
help improve the investment climate and sustain economic growth, while providing buffers against
external and domestic shocks. These efforts need to be supplemented by support from multilateral
institutions and other countries.
