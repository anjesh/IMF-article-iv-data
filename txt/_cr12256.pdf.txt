STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. Nicaragua’s performance on the growth and fiscal fronts in 2011 was better than
anticipated in the last review of the ECF-supported program. President Ortega was reelected in November. Municipal elections are scheduled for November 2012.
Near-term prospects and risks. Output growth is projected to moderate in 2012 as the
global economy remains weak. Oil price increases are significant risks to the near-term
outlook given Nicaragua’s large oil import bill. Tax revenue collections are expected to
remain strong but expenditure pressures are building up. Key fiscal risks for 2012 are higher
electricity subsidies and other increases in current expenditures, including the absorption of
the wage bonus (granted since 2010) into the wage bill.
Medium-term challenges and staff recommendations. Under current policies, economic
growth may stabilize at about 4 percent, which would not result in large reductions in
poverty. Attaining a much higher growth rate, sustained by large increases in productivity, is
Nicaragua’s overarching challenge. Reducing fiscal and external vulnerabilities is another
significant challenge. Reforming the social security system, establishing a sustainable
financial framework for the electricity sector, improving business conditions, and continuing
the momentum in tax reforms would be critical to overcome these challenges. A growthenhancing fiscal consolidation path (anchored on controlling current expenditure and
broadening the tax base), a higher international reserves buffer, and a steady strategy to
lower the dependence on oil imports are key staff recommendations.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Informality in Nicaragua’s Labor Market
Labor market informality is quite high in
Nicaragua but follows a pattern observed in
all Latin America. One definition of an informal
worker is someone who does not contribute to
the social security system. Data from the 2010
Permanent Household Survey show that
informal workers in Nicaragua are prevalent (i)
in smaller firms or in firms without formal book
keeping; (ii) among the self-employed; and (iii)
in rural areas (Figure 6). Informal labor
arrangements also are more prevalent among
women and younger workers. While these
patterns are present in other Latin American
countries, in Nicaragua informal employment
accounts for more than 70 percent of urban
employment—much higher than the 54 percent
average in the Latin American region (Perry et
al, 2010).1
Low income per capita is likely a key reason
for the high proportion of informal workers
in Nicaragua. Academic work has typified
informality as either a “barrier” or a “choice” for
workers. According to the “barrier”
interpretation, informal workers are excluded
from government benefits and the modern
economy, either as a result of labor market
segmentation or burdensome regulations (de
Soto, 2000).2 According to the “choice”

hypothesis, workers choose to exit or not enter into
formal arrangements following a cost-benefit
analysis about the quality of government services
and benefits, and the extent of institutional
enforcement (Perry et al, 2010). Because an informal
worker costs less to a firm, employers accept
informality when the chances of detection are low.
Both factors seem to be present in Nicaragua, as
enforcement capacity is relatively weak, and the
quality of government benefits is low. The high
incidence of informality in Nicaragua is also
consistent with its standing as the second-poorest
country in the Western Hemisphere.
Large levels of informality result in low
productivity and create policy challenges. For
instance, informality can be a barrier to firm growth,
as employers try to avoid detection, thus preventing
the full realization of economies of scale. Moreover,
informality creates dual labor markets and a less
equitable society. As in other places, reducing
informality in Nicaragua should be a long-term goal
and would require, inter alia, revamping the benefits
of belonging to the formal workforce, reducing
costs of doing business (including by simplifying the
tax system), facilitating compliance and
strengthening enforcement, enhancing government
effectiveness and legitimacy, enforcing property
rights, and improving the quality of education .

NICARAGUA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Benefits of a New Tax Reform
Recent reforms have improved the efficiency and
equity of the tax system, and raised revenues. In
November 2009, the Nicaraguan government sent to
Congress a project of tax reform aiming at reducing
exemptions and modernizing the tax system (through
the introduction of a dual income tax system and
rules to deal with transfer pricing and thin
capitalization). The portion of the project that was
approved, included the elimination of exemptions to
excises, the broadening of the income tax base, and
the introduction of a 1 percent minimum income tax
on gross income. The reform was expected to
increase tax revenues by over 1 percent of GDP.
However, its greatest virtue was to improve the
efficiency and equity of the tax system by eliminating
exemptions without increasing tax rates.
Despite this progress, the Nicaraguan tax system
continues to be plagued by a large number of
loopholes, particularly in value-added (VAT) and
corporate income (CIT) taxes. The continued granting
of exemptions and tax preferences has narrowed both
tax bases. Tax expenditures (which measure in a point
in time how much revenue would be collected if all
exemptions, benefits, and loopholes were eliminated)
were estimated at 7.6 percent of GDP in 2010—one of
the highest in Latin America.
The authorities are considering a new tax reform.
The reform would aim at streamlining exemptions,

simplifying the tax system, and protecting the CIT
base. The authorities plan to consult with different
stakeholders before sending a proposal to Congress.
The key components of this new reform would
yield important revenue gains. Tax revenues could
increase by about 0.4 percent of GDP if exemptions of
VAT on goods and services are reduced (including
domestic airline tickets—which are taxed in most
countries in the region—the consumption of potable
water over a threshold, clothing, meat, fruits, and
other foodstuff). Transfers through the direct tax
system could alleviate the impact on the poor from
ending some of these exemptions.
Additional measures could include (i) ending the
differential tax treatment of interest income for
companies; (ii) increasing withholding rates on
payments to nonresidents; (iii) raising the personal
income tax minimum exemption; (iv) introducing rules
to address transfer pricing and thin capitalization; and
(v) gradually lowering sectoral tax incentives.
Authorities also could start taxing dividends from
companies operating in free trade zones and
exempted activities (as it is done in other countries of
the region) to allow revenue-neutral reductions in
current CIT rates. The tax system could also be
simplified by replacing the very complex scheme for
small businesses and reducing the number of goods
and services subject to excises.

share of maquila exports in the U.S. market has
risen significantly—largely a result of the sector’s
dynamism.
Despite these competitiveness gains, Nicaragua
has continued to post large current account
deficits. In large part, those deficits are the result of
the country’s extreme dependency on oil imports.
Over the medium term, the projected increase in

Real exchange rate movements are highly

Estimation of a simple cointegrating relationship
between the two variables suggests that the real

Under the staff’s baseline assumptions for oil
prices and official assistance flows, Nicaragua's
real exchange rate seems broadly in line with
fundamentals (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2).
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests an
overvaluation of about 3 percent, while the external
sustainability approach suggests that a depreciation
of about 5 percent would be needed to stabilize the
net foreign asset position of the country at its
current, relatively high, negative level. These
estimates need to be treated with caution as the
staff’s baseline projects substantial structural
changes beyond the time horizon considered in the
standard CGER methodology.

alternative sources of energy is expected to reduce
oil imports and gradually lower the external current
account deficit. Until these improvements in energy
generation materialize, dependence on external
financing poses a risk to Nicaragua’s balance of
payments. The high degree of dollarization of
Nicaragua’s banking system is an additional risk.

Staff noted that Nicaragua’s

pockets of vulnerability had to be
addressed. Nicaraguan banks have large
liquidity buffers and—according to recent
stress tests conducted jointly with Fund
staff—hold sufficient capital to withstand
unexpected declines in loan quality.
However, deposits linked to Venezuela’s
assistance programs are increasingly large
and potentially volatile. The authorities
noted that these dollar deposits are

the second half of 2012. Also, the
authorities are discussing with key

would be in charge of preventing and

debate on the subject, but advised the

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms
at the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in
NPV terms at the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.
Definitions:
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to floating completion
point triggers including predefined key policy reforms.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for
the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief
to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at
the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.
IX. Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangements:
In December 1995, the Monetary Board of the central bank approved the unification of the
exchange rate system effective January 1, 1996. With the unification of the exchange rate, all
previous exchange restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and
multiple currency practices were eliminated. The central bank buys/sells any amount of foreign
currency from/to financial institutions at the official exchange rate, and implements a crawling peg
system. Since December 2004, the monthly crawl has been set at an annual rate of 5 percent. As of
June 11, 2012, the exchange rate in the official market was C$23.4814 per U.S. dollar. Nicaragua
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XI. Article IV Consultation:
The previous consultation was completed by the Executive Board on July 9, 2010 (PIN No. 10/83).
The last Fund-supported program review (Seventh Review under the ECF Arrangement and
Financing Assurances Review) was concluded on October 21, 2011.
XII. FSAP Participation:
An FSAP update was completed in October 2009, and the Financial System Stability Assessment
report for Nicaragua was issued on April 28, 2010.

IDB Loan Commitments and Disbursements
As of April 30 2012, there were 31 projects in the IDB’s current sovereign loan portfolio with a total
commitment of US$699.6 million, and an undisbursed balance of US$328.65 million. Basic
infrastructure (roads and energy) accounts for almost half the portfolio. Nicaragua is one of four IDB
borrowing member countries to receive highly-concessional loans from the Fund for Special
Operations (FSO). Nicaragua receives a lending blend of 50 percent from the FSO and 50 percent
from the Ordinary Capital. The annual sovereign lending envelop depends on the availability of FSO
funding as well as an allocation formula that encompasses policy performance, project performance,
per capita income and population. The allocation for Nicaragua was US$80.2 million per annum in
2007 and 2008. In early 2009, the overall FSO funding for the four low-income countries was
increased as a counter-cyclical response to the global economic crisis, and Nicaragua’s allocation
increased to US$162.0 million for 2009 and US$170.2 million for 2010. For 2011, the FSO allocation
increased to US$171.2 million.
Technical Assistance
As of April 30 2012, there were 27 non-reimbursable technical cooperations (for the public sector) in
execution with an approved commitment of US$13.0 million and an available balance of US$8.5
million. The Multilateral Investment Fund has: (i) 17 non-reimbursable technical cooperations
(including regional operations) in execution with an available balance of US$7.5 millions; and (ii) 7
loans in execution from the Social Entrepreneurship Program with an approved commitment of
US$2.3 million and an available balance of US$1.1 million.
Recent Agreements
The current country strategy with Nicaragua was approved by the Board in February 2009. A new
country strategy for the period 2012-2017 is expected to be approved in late 2012.

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 30, 2012)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are government financing statistics and monetary statistics.
National accounts:
National accounts are compiled in accordance with the United Nations System of National
Accounts 1993 (SNA93). GDP estimates with 1994 as the base year are available up to the fourth
quarter of 2011.
STA provided technical assistance in quarterly national accounts to the Central Bank of Nicaragua
in June 2005 and January 2008. Quarterly GDP series at current and at constant prices with 1994
as the base year were published in October 2008. The Central Bank of Nicaragua is currently in
the process of changing the base year of the national accounts to 2006 in accordance with the
methodology of the System of National Accounts 2008. The Regional national accounts Statistics
Advisor visited Managua during January 24–28, 2011 to prepare a work plan on TA and training
needs on national accounts statistics as well as to provide TA in quarterly national accounts
(QNA). The first TA mission on QNA was conducted during August 29-September 2, 2011. The
second TA mission dealt with the quarterly flow of funds table and was conducted during
October 2–14, 2011. The third mission dealt with the quarterly flow of funds table and the
quarterly financial accounts by institutional sector and was conducted during November 28–
December 9, 2011. Production accounts, supply and use table, and the majority of accounts for
other institutional sectors have been compiled with 2006 as the base year. Preliminary estimates
for the period 2006-2008 are expected to be released during the third quarter.
Price statistics:
The consumer price index (CPI), with expenditure weights derived from a (1998/99) household
expenditure survey, was introduced in 2001. The CPI covers Managua and eight other cities and
is published monthly. Expenditures (weights) and prices in rural areas are excluded. The base year
of the CPI was updated from 1994 to 1999, reflecting the improvement in the varieties of basket,
the number of respondents reporting prices, and the number of prices collected per month. The
CPI is calculated on the geometric average and imputations for missing prices are made.
However, the base, basket, and weights of the CPI need updating.
The producer price index (PPI) (July 2006=100) covers a sample of small and medium-size
establishments, as well as goods for processing establishments in the tax-free zones (i.e., “la
maquila”). Compilation of a PPI began in 1999, and its public release started in May 2004.
Historical data are available from 1992. STA provided technical assistance for improving the PPI
in January 2006, September 2007, December 2008, and September 2010. The September 2010

mission helped authorities develop a work plan for expanding the coverage to the service sector.
Government finance statistics (GFS): The fiscal ROSC mission in 2002 and the data ROSC
mission in 2005 both found serious weaknesses in fiscal data. In general, government finance
statistics are not fully aligned with international standards. The transactional coverage of GFS is
still partial in comparison with the GFSM 2001 requirements. Coverage and sectorization issues
can be partially explained by the Public Administration Law, which excludes the judicial and
legislative branches from the data coverage of the central administration. The fiscal data also
present large discrepancies between the overall balance compiled by the Ministry of Finance and
Public Credit (MHCP) and the financing data compiled by the BCN. Therefore, stronger
collaboration is needed between the MHCP and the BCN to derive more accurate and timely
estimates of external and domestic financing of the nonfinancial public sector. A 2004 GFS
mission recommended that the envisaged Integrated System of Financial Management be made
to support the compilation of GFS data and gradual migration to the GFSM 2001. These
recommendations were reiterated by the FAD/STA mission in June 2006. An STA mission
conducted in February 2010 found that the authorities are making significant progress in
implementing the GFSM 2001 methodology. An STA mission conducted in April-May 2011
recommended the creation of a department in charge of public fiscal statistics (Dirección de
Estadísticas de Finanzas Publicas) and requested the reporting of quarterly data for the IFS for
the Central Government. In the medium term is expected also the quarterly reporting of the
consolidated public sector accounts.
The MHCP disseminates government finance statistics (GFS) covering only the central
administration, and compiles annual GFS for the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) for internal use
and for reporting to the Western Hemisphere Department. The BCN reports budgetary central
government data, albeit with considerable delay, for publication in the International Financial
Statistics. In 2006 the MHCP reported GFS data for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary finance statistics: Monetary statistics are, in general, consistent with the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM), 2000. In April 2008, STA provided technical assistance to
help harmonize monetary and financial statistics in the Central American region. A standardized
report form (SRFs) for credit cooperatives and insurance companies was compiled based on their
accounting records for December 2007. In January 2012, STA provided technical assistance under
the second phase of the Regional Project on Harmonization of Monetary and Financial Statistics.
The mission developed a work plan to compile surveys for the other financial corporations
following the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Monetary
and Financial Statistics Compilation Guide. The mission encouraged the authorities of the central
bank to start the compilation of monthly data for insurance companies and recommended the
compilation of the monetary and financial statistics for credit and savings cooperatives. The
mission prepared an action plan aimed at improving the collection, compilation, and
dissemination of monetary data.
In December 2011 and May 2012, MCM provided technical assistance to implement stress
testing on the banking system. The mission team explained to Central Bank and Superintendency
of Banks and Other Financial Institutions (SIBOIF) the process with particular emphasis on hands-

on training.

External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics broadly follow the concepts and
definitions set out in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), within the limits
set by the availability of information sources.
Resident institutional units are defined in conformity with BPM5’s concepts of economic territory,
residency, and center of economic interest. However, coverage of the private sector is
incomplete, in both the current and financial accounts. There are major coverage weaknesses in
areas such as services, compensation of border employees, and financial transactions. In February
2007, a STA mission found that the downsizing of staff at the BCN and additional workload
unrelated to compiling external sector statistics, have resulted in limited progress in
implementing previous STA recommendations.
STA provided technical assistance for improving the balance of payments and the international
investment position in April 2009 and April 2010. A one-week CAPTAC TA mission on
international investment position statistics also visited Managua in March 2010.
In October 2010 and November 2011 CAPTAC provided technical assistance for improving the
compilation of services statistics in the goods and services account of the balance of payments.
The External Sector Area (ESA) of the Central Bank of Nicaragua has been using a mix of
administrative records and quarterly/annual business surveys to compile services statistics. The
ESA faced difficulties while implementing some recommendations regarding services statistics
made by previous TA missions. In particular, the ESA was unable to access disaggregated data on
insurance services from the Superintendency of Banks and Other Financial Institutions (SIBOIF).
Coverage and compilation issues regarding services statistics within the framework of the
adoption of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6) guidelines were addressed. The mission reviewed several questionnaires,
particularly those related to foreign direct investment and free trade zones. The authorities have
made progress in the implementation of the recommendations regarding services statistics of
previous TA. Nonetheless, they need to coordinate with the SIBOIF the implementation of
insurance’s accounts catalog, and improve the access of the Central Bank to SIBOIF’s database.
In December 2011, CAPTAC provided assistance on Export, Import and Producer Price Statistics.
As part of the national accounts project, the Central Bank of Nicaragua has been developing a
system of Integrated Indices of Prices, Value, and Volume for Imports and Exports. Preliminary
unit value indices have been developed, nonetheless, some of these unit value indices have been
determined to have strange behavior.
Data dissemination: Nicaragua has participated in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since February 2005. Data ROSC was published in December 2005.
In April 2012, a STA mission assessed Nicaragua’s data compilation and dissemination practices

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

against the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) requirements for coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness, and provided the authorities with recommendations to meet all SDDS
requirements. Nicaragua meets the SDDS requirements for coverage for all compiled and
disseminated SDDS data categories except for general government operations; balance of
payments; and the international investment position. After the implementation of
recommendations, Nicaragua could subscribe to the SDDS by end-2013.

Macroeconomic developments in Nicaragua have been broadly positive since 2010. Real gross
domestic product (GDP) grew on average 4.6 percent during 2010-11, underpinned by robust
consumption and investment. Inflationary pressures abated somewhat to 8 percent by end-2011
(from 9.2 percent at end-2010), as world commodity prices eased. Although the external current
account deficit widened in 2011 (to 18 percent of GDP), larger capital inflows (mainly sizable
foreign direct investment) produced a small surplus in the balance of payments, thus increasing
international reserves.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

An EPA is required for all members having longer-term program engagement with the Fund. EPAs
are intended to provide an opportunity to step back from continuing program relations to consider an
analysis of the economic problems facing the country, review progress under Fund-supported
programs, and draw forward-looking lessons for future Fund engagement.

2
The fiscal outturn of 2011 surpassed expectations. The tax reform of 2009 and the strong output
recovery boosted tax revenues, while central government spending as a share of GDP
remained broadly stable. As a result, the central government recorded a surplus of 0.6 percent
of GDP (following a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2010), which was primarily used to pay down
debts of the state-owned electricity generation company. Elsewhere in the public sector, a
deterioration in the fiscal result of the social security system, the municipality of Managua, and
the state-owned enterprises was partly offset by a smaller operating deficit of the central bank
than in 2010. On net, the consolidated public sector recorded a small surplus for the first time
since 2007.
Monetary policy continued to bolster the international reserves position and conditions in the
financial system strengthened. The central bank maintained the crawling-peg system, which
helped anchor inflation expectations. Banks’ liquidity remained ample while credit growth picked
up significantly towards the end of the year. Nonperforming loans ratios declined as banks’
profitability improved and deposits (in local and foreign currency) rose.
Looking ahead, real GDP growth is expected to slow in 2012 and inflation to rise to between
8 and 9 percent owing to oil price increases. The consolidated public sector is projected to post
a deficit in 2012 as some spending pressures resurface, but its fiscal position is expected to
improve gradually in the medium term with expenditure restraint at the level of the central
government, central bank, and state-owned enterprises. The external current account balance
is expected to widen in 2012 on the back of weaker external demand and a larger oil bill, which
would reduce moderately the international reserves coverage. Risks to the economic outlook for
2012 are tilted to the downside given Nicaragua’s exposure to economic activity abroad.
The Ex Post Assessment (EPA) reviewed Nicaragua’s performance under the 2007–11
program supported by an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The EPA concluded that
although the Nicaraguan economy was buffeted by a series of adverse shocks between 2007
and 2011, the ECF-supported program was effective in helping the authorities develop an
appropriate policy framework to support macroeconomic stability. The program also paved the
way for some reforms of the tax system and the energy sector, but it fell short in key areas,
such as pensions and public financial management.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Nicaragua’s robust economic recovery and favorable
macroeconomic performance on the back of sound policies, high export prices, and large
investment inflows. Nevertheless, Directors underscored that important macroeconomic and
structural challenges remain to be addressed, including widespread poverty and large external
imbalances. With downside risks prevailing due to the uncertain global environment, Directors
encouraged the authorities to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies and step up the pace of
structural reform.

3

Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation should be the cornerstone of macroeconomic
stability. With wage bonuses and higher electricity subsidies worsening the fiscal outlook
for 2012, Directors urged firm expenditure restraint. In the medium term, reforms to strengthen
further the revenue effort and to revamp the pension system will be critical, alongside current
expenditure restraint, in accommodating higher social and infrastructure spending while
maintaining fiscal sustainability. Particularly important will be to widen the tax base by curtailing
exemptions.
Directors underscored that reducing external vulnerabilities related to the large external current
account deficit will be a key challenge in the period ahead. They supported plans to cut back on
oil imports and increase international reserves. They also stressed the importance of reducing
the size and improving the composition of the public debt, and encouraged the authorities to
step up efforts to obtain debt relief on HIPC terms from non-Paris Club creditors.
Directors urged the authorities to prioritize and address the key structural impediments to
growth and poverty reduction. They highlighted the need to strengthen governance and
institutions, improve public financial management, reduce labor market informality, and tackle
weaknesses in the energy sector.
Directors welcomed the progress in improving banking supervision, reflected in the overall
soundness of the financial system. They encouraged concerted action to deal with remaining
vulnerabilities, including increased collaboration with regional supervisors. Directors welcomed
the creation of a financial intelligence unit, and urged the authorities to seize the opportunity to
bring the regime against money laundering and terrorism financing into compliance with
international standards.
Directors welcomed the conclusion of the Ex Post Assessment that the Fund’s engagement in
Nicaragua during 2007–11 contributed to macroeconomic stability. They noted, however, that
exogenous shocks and at times weak program ownership led to uneven progress in structural
reforms. In light of this, Directors highlighted several lessons for the future. In particular,
Directors stressed that policies should have strong ownership by the authorities, structural
reforms should be well designed and well targeted, and implementation should be flexible to
accommodate unexpected shocks and capacity constraints.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Pérez-Verdía, Executive Director for Nicaragua, and
Mr. Cosenza Jimenez, Advisor to Executive Director
June 27, 2012
We would like to thank staff for their illustrative and balanced reports and for their
constructive dialogue with our authorities. Our authorities concur with the main messages of
the reports and we simply wish to emphasize the following points:
1. Recent Economic Developments
As the reports indicate Nicaragua’s macroeconomic situation is sound and stable with the
central government and the consolidated public sector posting a 0.6 percent and 0.1 percent
surplus, respectively, in 2011. Current expenditure was reduced, tax revenues increased in
2011 and reserves are at a comfortable level. Public external debt remains stable at about
55 percent of GDP. Economic growth is expected to remain in the 4.0-4.7 percent range,
while inflation will be in the 7-9 percent range. Bank capitalization and liquidity are ample
and nonperforming loans have decreased to 2.2 percent.
The authorities plan to issue their new medium term economic and financial program in the
next couple of months. The program will continue to gear policy towards the attainment of
social objectives, in a context of strengthened macroeconomic stability. In the near term the
government will continue to promote fiscal consolidation in a context of increased public
investment to support growth.
The authorities continue to place great importance on equitable growth and on pro-poor
spending. As a result, poverty continues to decrease. It is estimated that the percentage of the
population living under the international poverty line, that is those earning less than $2 per
day, decreased from 48.3 percent in 2005 to 42.5 percent in 2009.
2.


Outlook and Policies
The Formal and Informal Sectors

In spite of the significant accomplishments mentioned in the previous paragraphs, Nicaragua
is still beset by widespread poverty and low income per capita. Poverty has indeed fallen,
but not enough or sufficiently fast. Indeed, deeper poverty reduction demands faster
economic growth; which in turn requires higher economic productivity.
The authorities agree with staff that one of the main obstacles to higher productivity is the
size of the informal sector. The temporary and ephemeral nature of informal employment
discourages investing in worker training and in the technology and tools necessary to raise
productivity. The authorities are fully cognizant of the need to reduce the size of the informal
sector. Consequently, they seek to decrease or eliminate the perceived disadvantages of
formalization, while simultaneously explaining its inherent advantages. This requires, inter
alia, the simplified access to micro finance services and the elimination of red tape and
onerous charges and taxes levied on micro and small enterprises. It also demands better
monitoring efforts to ensure that companies do not operate clandestinely in the informal

2
sector simply to avoid paying a fair wage and providing social benefits to their employees
while simultaneously evading taxes and social security contributions. To this end, simplified
electronic processes are being implemented to reduce red tape and taxes are being kept low
for micro and small enterprises. In addition, a single identification number will be issued to
all companies by the national and local governments and by the Social Security Institute, thus
ensuring that registration with any one of them will lead to registration with the other two,
thereby rendering evasion more difficult.
The government’s strategy to reduce the informal sector also comprises investing wisely in
health, education and in infrastructure, particularly in the electricity sector. The authorities
are committed to improve the composition and effectiveness of public spending prioritizing
infrastructure investment. This commitment already bore fruit in 2011.
Informality notwithstanding, Nicaragua has recorded important gains in competitiveness.
Nevertheless, the authorities are aware of the need to continue to improve the business
climate and the staff reports recognize steady improvements in external competitiveness, in a
framework of an export strategy based on product diversification, the consolidation of
traditional and new markets and the negotiation of free trade agreements. Furthermore,
important efforts are being made to achieve a broad consensus on key economic decisions,
through a tripartite approach involving the private sector, workers and the government. As a
consequence of these efforts direct foreign investment reached a record in 2011 when $967
million flowed into the economy, nearly doubling the 2010 figures. The investmentpromotion agency, Pro Nicaragua, actively seeks foreign investment and its efforts are
partially responsible for the recent surge in investment flows. The relative calm and social
cohesion that prevail in the country bode well for continued foreign direct investment flows
henceforth.


The Electricity Sector

The authorities wish to acknowledge that the document Lifting a Constraint on Growth:
Achievements and Challenges of Nicaragua’s Electricity Sector, included in the Selected
Issues annex, has made a valuable, and welcome, contribution to the understanding of the
sector issues. As that document indicates, Nicaragua, as a non oil-producing country, has
suffered from the steep fuel price increases registered in the last decade. Electricity
production is predominantly (70 percent) fuel-based. Nicaragua, however, is endowed with
ample natural resources that can be harnessed to meet its electricity needs and the authorities
are committed to dramatically altering the status quo by 2017. By then it is expected6 that 75
percent of the electricity will be generated with natural, renewable resources, mainly
hydroelectric, geothermal, eolic and biomass, where additional 270MW, 100 MW, 120 MW
and 20 MW, respectively, are expected to come on-line by 2016. Several private companies,
local and foreign, are already building the generating stations that will sell their renewable
energy to the private distribution companies that already operate in the country, with the state
assuming a subsidiary role.
This transformation of the electricity sector underpins the authorities’ strategy to address the
financial difficulties that beset it. The tariffs currently charged to consumers would appear
adequate for the cost of producing, transmitting and distributing electricity once the new

3
renewable energy generating stations are commissioned. The issue therefore is how to best
bridge the financial gap that the sector will experience between now and 2017. The
authorities fully understand that a financially healthy sector, with adequate generation
capacity and tariffs, low electricity losses and targeted subsidies, is a fundamental
precondition for accelerated growth. Based on this understanding, they currently work in the
definition of the strategy to follow in the 2012-2017 transition period, as they expect that the
situation will be vastly ameliorated once the new, renewable energy stations come into
operation by 2017.


Social Security Reform

The authorities appreciate the advice and technical assistance that the Fund has provided on
this issue. They fully recognize the importance of the issue and the need to proceed
cautiously so as not to erect an additional barrier to formalization. The authorities intend to
undertake a public consultation process with regard to the social security reform and, once
that process is concluded, to submit a proposal to the National Assembly to modify the
current system.
3. Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain firmly committed to further consolidate public finances by continuing
to control expenditures and enhance revenue collection. As stated in the Article IV Staff
Report, expenditures were contained in 2011 and revenue collection improved. Nicaragua’s
tax burden is 19.4 percent, which is reasonable for a low income country. Nevertheless, the
authorities have decided to complete the tax reform process begun in 2009 in order to render
the system more progressive and equitable, while simultaneously making it simpler to
operate and monitor. Although revenue enhancement is not the goal of the reform, it is likely
that a streamlined system which reduces tax incentives and exemptions and incorporates the
proper use of transfer prices will result in higher revenues. The authorities have recently
begun a consultation process with all stakeholders, including the private sector. It is expected
that the result of this participative and transparent process will culminate in September so
that the anticipated results of the reform may be reflected in the budget to be submitted to the
National Assembly in mid October. It is estimated that the National Assembly will
subsequently enact this new tax legislation and that the new system will be implemented in
2013.
Finally, the authorities are committed to improve the quality of expenditure thereby creating
the space for additional investment in infrastructure, in human capital and in the social safety
nets. The authorities’ resolve is evinced in the current expenditure reduction posted in 2011.
4. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
The Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation states that the exchange rate is “broadly in
line with fundamentals”. The authorities will continue to implement an announced annual
devaluation with respect to the US dollar, as this has served the country well hitherto. As
indicated in the Staff Report, reserves remain at a comfortable level, amounting to the
equivalent of 2.6 times the monetary base. Although the current account deficit (18 percent

4
of GDP) might appear high, it reflects Nicaragua’s high dependence on oil imports and
significant investment needs. This deficit has been partially offset by the recovery of
important flows, in particular, remittances (mainly from the USA and Costa Rica) which are
now stable and estimated to be about 12.5 percent of GDP, while income from tourism
represents 5 percent of GDP. The remaining current account deficit is fully financed with
FDI, grants and concessional loans.
5. Financial Sector Policy
In the financial sector the authorities will continue to upgrade regulation and supervision, as
well as expand the supervisory perimeter to include microcredit organizations and credit
cooperatives. In general, the sector is healthy and no major issues afflict it. Furthermore, the
micro credit subsector is on firmer ground after new legislation was enacted to promote and
regulate it.
6.

Debt Management Policy

About one quarter of the outstanding public external debt is with non-Paris Club members.
Although the negotiation process has been excruciatingly slow, the authorities remain
steadfast in bringing it to fruition. Furthermore, the authorities’ commitment to further fiscal
consolidation ensures a reduction of the public debt henceforth. Finally, the authorities will
continue to prioritize external financing through grants and concessional loans, while
developing the domestic debt market. In order to further advance in pending debt relief,
Nicaragua will, once again, request full participation of all creditors in the debt reduction
initiatives.
7.

Aid and Transparency

As mentioned in the reports, Nicaragua receives substantial financial support from several
sources, including Venezuela. In the latter case, assistance is provided through a private
sector entity, without sovereign guarantee and its use, along with that of other important
external financing, is transparently presented in a biannual report on official external aid.
The staff reports also delve into the deleterious consequences of a sudden stop of the
Venezuelan support. However, the question of sustainability of the support provided by
Venezuela is no different from that of other important partners, and the historically strong
ties between Nicaragua and Venezuela render the probability of such an event extremely low.
Nevertheless, if the risk of reduction of external aid was to materialize, the necessary
adjustment would be implemented to limit a significant adverse impact on the fiscal position.
8. Conclusion
As the Ex Post Assessment indicates, the ECF program recently completed by Nicaragua was
quite successful. Although the international environment worsened significantly after the
program was initiated, the Fund and the authorities responded flexibly and adapted the
program to the new reality. Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that the completion
of some of the reviews was delayed. However, the authorities persevered and the program
was successfully completed. This clearly attests the ownership of the program by the

5
authorities. In fact, the successful performance in the last two programs evinces Nicaragua’s
strong ownership of the programs supported by the Fund.
We close by reiterating our appreciation for the thorough and detailed work that underlies the
reports prepared by the IMF mission teams. Our authorities appreciate the high quality
dialogue that resulted from their visits to Nicaragua and will give due consideration to their
recommendations and observations.
