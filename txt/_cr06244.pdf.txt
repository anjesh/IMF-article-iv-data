REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2006 Consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan
Approved by David Owen and Scott Brown
May 17, 2006

•

Article IV consultation discussions were held in Astana and Almaty during March 30–
April 11, 2006. The mission met with Deputy Prime Minister Massimov, National Bank
of Kazakhstan Governor Saidenov, Minister of Economy and Budget Planning
Kelimbetov, Minister of Finance Korzhova, Financial Supervision Agency Chairman
Dunayev, other government officials, parliamentarians, and the private sector. The staff
team comprised Messrs. Husain (head), Davoodi, Henne, Sumlinski, and
Ms. Ter-Martirosyan (all MCD), and Mr. Gasha (MFD). Mr. Saudabaev (OED) joined
the discussions.

•

Kazakhstan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1996 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate regime is a managed
float with limited de facto flexibility against the dollar, although flexibility has increased
in recent months. The authorities subscribe to the SDDS and the provision of data is
adequate for surveillance purposes.

•

In previous consultations, the Fund has praised the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic
policies, which have been critical in achieving rapid growth and improved social
indicators. In particular, the Fund has supported the easing of the fiscal stance and the
authorities’ steps to address emerging risks in the banking sector. The Fund has also
called for increased upward flexibility of the exchange rate and an acceleration of
structural reform to enhance the investment climate. Progress in these areas has been
mixed. The Public Information Notice for the 2005 Article IV consultation is available
at: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn0587.htm.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic activity remains very strong in Kazakhstan, with 2005 marking the sixth
consecutive year of real GDP growth in excess of 9 percent. High oil prices and rapid growth
in non-oil revenues permitted a further substantial expansion in budgetary expenditures and,
at the same time, a sizable increase in the overall fiscal surplus. Activity is expected to
remain buoyant in 2006, although non-oil growth will likely slow from the heady pace of
2005.
The key policy challenge relates to mounting risks in the banking sector and the
marked pickup in inflation in recent months. Credit growth has risen to an annual rate of
over 70 percent, financed in part by a surge in banks’ external borrowing—$4.5 billion
(8 percent of GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2005 alone. As a result, banks’ vulnerability to a
tightening of international financing conditions, which could lead to a sharp slowdown in
credit expansion and deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios, has increased. Inflation,
which picked up to near 9 percent in February–April, is projected to stay near or above
8 percent through mid-2007.
Monetary tightening and further prudential measures are needed. Staff recommended
early action to raise policy interest rates, broaden the coverage of reserve requirements, and
allow more exchange rate appreciation. Additional regulatory measures and intensified
supervision will also help contain risks in the banking sector.
Adequate tightening on the monetary and regulatory side will facilitate the
implementation of fiscal policy plans, which envisage significant spending increases and
tax cuts in 2007–08. An acceleration of structural reform will help sustain economic
performance over the longer term.

Macroeconomic conditions were buoyant in 2005 and early 2006. Real GDP grew
9.4 percent in 2005 and by an estimated 7.7 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of
2006. While hydrocarbon output decelerated, the income and wealth effects associated with
high oil prices lifted non-oil output growth to 11 percent in 2005 (Table 1). Construction and
financial services output expanded particularly rapidly (by 40 percent each in real terms).

3.
The current account edged into a small deficit in 2005. A sharp increase in oil
exports (by $6 billion;10.7 percent of GDP) was more than offset by higher income
remittances to foreign direct investors and a sharp increase in goods and services imports,
including FDI-financed imports by the oil sector (Table 2).1 Banks borrowed heavily from
abroad but also increased their holdings of foreign assets, while amortization of FDI
liabilities picked up, reflecting the stronger cash position of oil companies.2 With net
outflows increasing, official reserves declined in 2005, albeit by less than the increase in
foreign asset accumulation in the NFRK, and the tenge depreciated by 3 percent against the
dollar (Table 3). In early 2006, however, official reserves recovered sharply, including on
account of continued rapid bank borrowing abroad, and the tenge appreciated by 10 percent
against the dollar. In real effective terms, the tenge has appreciated by about 5 percent since
end-2004 and 13 percent since end-2003, with little apparent consequence for the non-oil
sector’s competitiveness (Box 1).

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
The focus of the discussions was on mounting risks in the banking system and
the marked pickup in inflation in recent months. The discussions centered around the
needed steps to tighten monetary conditions, curb banks’ external borrowing, and reduce
banks’ vulnerability to a sharp deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios. Discussions also
covered the authorities’ plans to use the considerable fiscal space available over the medium
term, and their plans for structural reforms to diversify the economy.

1

Data disaggregating imports by sector are not available. However, the authorities estimate
that FDI-financed enterprises accounted for over 90 percent of the increase in services
imports in 2005.
2

The bulk of FDI in the oil sector is recorded in official data as debt. These obligations,
however, do not have fixed repayment schedules or prespecified interest rates.

-6-

A. Outlook
5.
Economic activity is expected to remain strong in 2006. Although non-oil growth
will likely slow from the heady pace of 2005 and only modest expansion in oil output is
anticipated, real GDP is expected to grow by about 8 percent. However, inflation is projected
to stay near or above 8 percent through mid-2007, including on account of a further large
civil service wage increase (30 percent on average) that is planned for January 2007. The
current account is projected to register a small surplus, with continued growth in imports and
income outflows to direct investors more than offset by a further increase in oil export
receipts. Oil sector FDI is expected to remain large, although tighter monetary conditions
domestically and abroad should curb banks’ inflows later in the year.
6.
The baseline medium-term scenario is favorable. Growth is projected to remain
brisk, notwithstanding some moderation in non-oil sector growth to its estimated longer-term
trend.3 The external position should remain strong, with broad balance in the current account
and continued substantial inflows of FDI, including in connection with the projected increase
in oil production, as well as other capital. The main risks to the outlook relate to a decline in
global oil prices and the possibility of a sudden stop in the availability of foreign financing at
attractive terms to Kazakhstani banks.
7.
Debt sustainability analysis indicates that external debt—almost all of which is
private—should remain manageable, even under standard stress tests. Continued rapid
economic growth and tenge appreciation in an environment of sustained high oil prices are
expected to reduce external debt ratios substantially under the baseline scenario (Table 4 and
Figure 1). While a sharp depreciation of the tenge and/or a very steep decline in oil prices
would result in a large increase in the external debt ratio, the overall external debt position
excluding intracompany obligations—the relevant measure for vulnerability analysis4—
would remain manageable. Nevertheless, continued rapid external borrowing by banks is
raising their vulnerability to a sharp tightening in the availability of external financing and a
rapid deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios.

3

As noted in Chapter I in Republic of Kazakhstan—Selected Issues (Country Report
No. 05/240), various analytical techniques suggest that real non-oil sector growth of
6–8 percent can be maintained over the medium term.
4

A large share (about 45 percent) of external debt comprises intra-company obligations
(mainly in the oil sector) without a fixed repayment schedule. Public debt sustainability
analysis was not undertaken in view of the very low level of public debt.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.

The monetary policy stance has been accommodative.

•

Money growth remained high in 2005, despite a substantial contraction in net
foreign assets (Table 5). In early 2006, with net foreign inflows rebounding, broad
money growth accelerated to 34 percent at end-March (year-on-year).

•

Policy interest rates are low.
Although the interest rate paid by the
National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK)
on commercial bank deposits—the
principal tool for soaking up
liquidity—was raised late in 2005 and
early 2006, the increase has been well
short of the rise in international shortterm rates.

•

The coverage of reserve requirements remains narrow. To enhance its ability to
manage liquidity, the NBK broadened the coverage to include net foreign liabilities
from October 2005. However, liabilities of remaining maturity exceeding two months
and interbank borrowing—including syndicated loans from abroad—remain outside
the coverage, foreign liabilities are

•

Banks’ lending rates have declined
markedly in real terms, further
fueling credit demand. The average
real interest rate—measured as the
nominal interest rate less actual
inflation over the previous
12 months—on tenge-denominated
loans was 5 percent in February 2006,
compared with 7.3 percent at end2004.

9.
The authorities agreed that a tighter monetary stance is needed to limit
vulnerabilities in the banking sector and keep inflation from rising further.
•

The NBK plans to raise its deposit interest rate further. The authorities noted,
however, that raising domestic policy rates significantly above international rates
could attract even more capital inflows.

•

Broader reserve requirements are under consideration. A working group is
drawing up a menu of possible options. It is likely that all liabilities, except domestic
interbank liabilities, will be covered. Changes to the requirements will be
implemented in a phased manner to allow banks to adjust their balance sheets without
undue disruption.

•

The NBK will scale back its exchange market intervention and allow greater
tenge appreciation, which will help to restrain inflation. An informal NBK survey
indicated that non-oil exporters do not view the nominal exchange rate as a major
determinant of competitiveness. Nevertheless, the authorities believe that large and
rapid nominal appreciation could prove disruptive, and continued occasional
intervention will likely still be needed, especially for lumpy transactions. Since
mid-April, the tenge has appreciated by 5 percent against the dollar.

•

The NBK’s ability to conduct monetary policy has been strengthened. An
amendment to the Budget Code enacted in mid-2005 envisages capital injections to

-9-

the NBK to cover losses related to monetary operations, including interest expenses
for sterilization operations and revaluation losses resulting from tenge appreciation.5
C. Banking Sector Policies
10.

Credit is booming, funded in part by a surge in external borrowing.

•

The financial deepening process is
continuing, but at an unusually
rapid pace. Credit growth in
Kazakhstan has been substantially
higher than in other transition
countries and credit-to-GDP is now
broadly in line with that in several
Emerging European economies
(Box 2).

Mortgages and construction loans
almost doubled in 2005, while consumer credit grew even faster. Property prices have
escalated sharply in major urban areas and a large share of property purchases has
reportedly been for speculative investment rather than own-use purposes.

•

Banks are funding their lending partly by external borrowing. External liabilities
of the banking sector more than doubled to $15 billion (27 percent of GDP) at
end-2005, from $7.7 billion at end-2004.6

•

Banks’ external assets also grew sharply in 2005. The banking system’s foreign
assets rose to $9 billion ($4 billion at end-2004), with particularly high growth in
deposits and securities. Cross-border lending—mainly to enterprises in Russia and
other CIS countries—expanded 50 percent; banks also stepped up lending through
their foreign subsidiaries and branches.

5

The NBK incurred substantial sterilization costs and unrealized revaluation losses in 2004,
experiencing a net loss of about T 60 billion (about 1 percent of GDP and 70 percent of its
combined capital and reserves at end-2004). In 2005, the NBK registered net profits of
T 9 billion, which were transferred to reserves. Its capital and reserves amounted to
15 percent of reserve money at end-2005.
6

At end-2005, about one half of banks’ liabilities was external.

- 10 -

•

Significant gaps in the maturity composition data on banks’ external debt
complicate risk assessment.7 Moreover, systematic monitoring of the banking
system’s debt repayment profile, with a view to identifying lumpy payments and the
associated rollover risk, is not yet in place.

•

Financial soundness indicators have remained broadly stable, but partly on
account of the very favorable macroeconomic environment. The banking system’s
capital adequacy ratio eased slightly in 2005, but remains well above the required
minimum. However, the stock of nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased by
36 percent in 2005—despite a small decline in the NPL ratio (to 9.6 percent at
end-2005) due to the very rapid growth in loans—possibly indicating deficiencies in
banks’ credit risk management practices (Table 6). Dollarization remains relatively
high; about one half of bank loans and over 40 percent of deposits are foreigncurrency denominated.

11.
The authorities are concerned about banking sector risks and have taken a
number of measures to mitigate them.8
•

Prudential regulations have been tightened. Banks’ open foreign currency limits
were reduced in early 2005 and capital adequacy requirements for market and
operational risks have been introduced. The risk weight for high-value property loans
has been raised and the scoring system used by banks for loan classification has been
toughened. To mitigate risks related to cross-border lending, the risk weight for loans
to nonresident entities—excluding loans through foreign branches and subsidiaries—
has been increased from 100 percent to 150 percent for subinvestment-grade
borrowers.

•

Supervision has also been strengthened. On-site inspections have been intensified.
Larger banks are inspected at least once a year; other banks are inspected at least once
every two years. Occasional unscheduled special topic inspections are also conducted.
In addition, off-site supervision has been strengthened and, since early 2006, banks
have been required to submit additional information on their assets, contingent
liabilities, and related party and holding operations. Banks are required to regularly
submit stress test results—covering liquidity, credit, interest rate, exchange rate, and
oil and real estate price shocks—and currency gap analysis to the FSA.

7

The NBK’s external debt data are compiled on an original-maturity rather than
remaining-maturity basis, and obligations under which creditors may exercise early
repayment options are not classified as short term. Separate data compiled by the Financial
Supervision Agency (FSA) are on a remaining-maturity basis, but their coverage does not
match that of the NBK. According to NBK external debt data, 38 percent of banks’ foreign
liabilities at end-2005 was short term.
8

The measures are broadly in line with the 2004 FSAP update recommendations.

- 11 -

•

Risks associated with related-party lending are being addressed. New legislation
adopted in early 2006 introduced consolidated supervision over banking-industrial
conglomerates.

12.

Further regulatory measures are also under consideration.

•

To address risks related to external borrowing, the authorities are considering
further reducing net open position limits, introducing liquidity requirements by
currency, and/or introducing limits related to bank capital on external borrowing,
especially short-term obligations. A higher reserve requirement for external liabilities
than domestic liabilities is also being considered.

•

To mitigate risks on the assets side of banks’ balance sheets, the authorities are
considering tightening loan classification rules for property loans by streamlining the
treatment of collateral and introducing stricter loan-to-value ratios. Tougher
classification rules for foreign currency loans to borrowers without foreign currency
earnings, as well as exposure limits for construction loans and mortgages, are also
under consideration.

•

Additional regulatory tightening will be implemented at a measured pace to
avoid unnecessary transition difficulties for banks. The authorities were also
cognizant of the need for beefing up supervisory resources at the FSA, where the
availability of qualified personnel is already being stretched.
D. Fiscal Policy

13.
Strong expansion in oil and non-oil receipts in 2005 permitted continued rapid
spending growth within a sharply increasing surplus position of the overall budget.
•

•

The overall fiscal surplus
widened to 6 percent of GDP
in 2005 (Table 7). The non-oil
deficit increased to 4.8 percent
of GDP (from 4.4 percent in
2004), well within the
sustainable level given the
outlook for oil prices and
Kazakhstan’s oil production
(Box 3).
Expenditures grew by over
20 percent in real terms, with
social spending and civil service
salaries increasing even more
rapidly.

Non-oil revenues expanded at a faster pace than non-oil GDP on account of the
brisk economic conditions and improvements in tax administration, including the
implementation of an electronic tracking system for the VAT.

Savings in the NFRK rose sharply. With oil revenue nearly doubling—due to
record high oil prices as well as one-off receipts9—assets of the NFRK rose by about
$3 billion to $8 billion (14 percent of GDP). Public external debt was also paid down,
with the outstanding stock falling by $1 billion to $2.4 billion (4 percent of GDP).

•

For 2006, budgetary plans envisage a broadly unchanged non-oil deficit in
relation to GDP, with expenditure and non-oil revenue both growing in line with
nominal GDP. The overall fiscal surplus will narrow slightly to 5.6 percent of GDP.

14.
The authorities recognize that rapid spending growth warrants intensified
scrutiny over spending quality and enhanced budget transparency.
•

New rules that will fully integrate the NFRK with the budget are to be
implemented from July. Under the new rules, all oil revenue will accrue to the
NFRK, which will transfer funds to the budget to cover development spending.10 The
authorities believe that the new rules—which will be incorporated in the mediumterm budget framework—will help rationalize future spending growth and link the
use of oil revenue to the development of the country’s physical and human capital.
Full implementation of the new rules will commence from 2007, with the next budget
cycle.

•

Kazakhstan has joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
A memorandum of understanding has been signed by the government, a number of
resource companies, and NGOs. Audited accounts are to be published this year.

•

Legislation presently with parliament aims to improve the quality of budgetary
expenditure. Draft amendments to the budget code envisage the introduction of
explicit cost-benefit analysis for proposed programs, tightening of the rules governing
program selection and control over program execution, and allowing the transfer of
unutilized funding to the next budget year to ensure project completion.

9

One-off payments accounted for almost 20 percent ($1.1 billion) of oil revenue in 2005,
including advance royalties, bonus payments, and receipts arising from a project ownership
transfer between oil companies.
10

The coverage of expenditure under the development budget is somewhat broader than
capital spending and includes a number of health and education programs that are designed to
develop human capital.

- 13 -

15.
The authorities agreed that there is considerable room to loosen the fiscal stance
without compromising sustainability.
•

Spending will rise further through 2007, mainly on account of the announced
public sector wage increase (estimated at 1.5 percent of GDP), which will be
accompanied by reform of the wage and civil service structure. Thereafter, spending
will decline in relation to GDP, which should help ensure expenditure efficiency.

•

From 2007, the focus of the fiscal strategy will shift to reducing the tax burden.
The aim is to diversify the economy by enhancing the private non-oil sector’s growth
prospects.

16.

Significant tax cuts have already been announced.11

•

The VAT rate will be reduced by 1 percentage point to 14 percent from 2007.
The authorities plan to gradually reduce the rate further, possibly to 12 percent by
2010.

•

A flat 10 percent personal income tax will be introduced, also from 2007. This
will replace the existing 5–20 percent progressive rate structure. The minimum
taxable threshold will be raised.

•

From 2008, social (payroll) taxes will be reduced by 30 percent to a range of
5–13 percent. Social taxes covering foreign and domestic employees will be
harmonized.

•

New tax concessions are to be introduced for high value-added industries and for
projects in certain locations, including the Free Economic Zones.

17.
The authorities emphasized that the fiscal position is expected to remain in
surplus, even under conservative assumptions on the impact of the tax cuts.
•

Their estimates indicate that the impact on tax revenue will be about 0.5 percent
of GDP in 2007 and under 2 percent of GDP in 2008. These estimates assume no
widening of the tax base, although the authorities expect a significant expansion in
practice.

•

They also expect to achieve further gains in tax administration, including by
introducing information tracking systems for other taxes (as was done recently for the
VAT).

11

The authorities are receiving technical assistance from the World Bank in tax policy and
administration.

- 14 -

E. Structural Reform and Other Issues
18.
The authorities recognize that structural reforms to enhance the investment
climate are critical for sustaining the non-oil sector’s growth prospects. While
acknowledging that some business climate surveys suggest mixed progress on structural
reforms (Box 4), the authorities noted that a multi-pronged strategy is now in place to make
Kazakhstan one of the world’s 50 most competitive economies (under the World Economic
Forum’s rankings). They are implementing institutional, administrative, and legal reform of
the business licensing and registration system, strengthening anti-monopoly and competition
policies, and have launched a project to improve assessment of the investment climate with a
view to promoting investment.12 A major investment program to upgrade the country’s
transportation system has also been launched. WTO accession negotiations are proceeding,
and significant steps to align the legal framework with WTO requirements have been taken.
In addition, the “clusters” initiative is supporting the non-oil sector through labor training,
infrastructure provision, and some tax concessions. Funding for development institutions has
also been increased in order to enhance the non-oil sector’s access to long-term financing.
19.
The authorities expressed appreciation for the Fund’s technical assistance to
improve the quality of statistics. The recent STA mission’s recommendations are being
implemented, with the aim of improving the quality of national accounts and balance of
payments data, including better disaggregation of the oil and non-oil sectors. On AML/CFT,
the authorities indicated that draft legislation is being considered by parliament.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
Economic activity remains very strong in Kazakhstan and the baseline outlook is
favorable. However, banks’ vulnerability to a tightening of international financing
conditions and/or a sharp slowdown in credit expansion—which would lead to a deterioration
in the quality of loan portfolios—has increased and inflation has picked up markedly. To
sustain strong economic performance, policies will need to be geared to mitigating risks in
the banking sector and bringing inflation down.
21.
A marked tightening of the monetary policy stance is needed. The NBK will need
to move quickly to soak up liquidity to slow the pace of credit expansion and contain
inflationary pressures. This can be achieved by increasing policy interest rates and by
broadening the coverage of reserve requirements to include all liabilities, which should also
help slow external borrowing. In addition, consideration should be given to a moderate and
temporary increase in reserve requirements to aid in mopping up liquidity. It is expected that
banks will pass on the higher policy interest rates and tighter reserve requirements to their
customers in the form of higher lending rates. That would be a welcome development which
would help curb credit demand.
12

These initiatives are being supported with technical assistance from the European Union.

- 15 -

22.
Nominal appreciation of the tenge will also help curb inflationary pressure and
stem capital inflows. Indeed, underlying economic fundamentals and the major
improvement in Kazakhstan’s terms of trade on account of high oil prices suggest that
significant real appreciation is inevitable over the longer term. Limiting nominal appreciation
of the tenge in these circumstances will lead to higher inflation that could be difficult to
reverse and ultimately prove more disruptive to the economy. The authorities’ decision to
allow increased tenge appreciation since mid-April is welcome.
23.
Tighter monetary conditions will affect the NBK’s balance sheet, which will
eventually need to be replenished from the budget. Legislation passed in 2005 that
envisages capital replenishment in response to revaluation losses and sterilization costs is a
welcome step. In current circumstances, an early capital injection into the NBK would send a
convincing signal to markets that monetary policy can shoulder the burden of combating
inflation squarely and will not be constrained by profit and loss considerations.
24.
A number of welcome prudential regulations have been adopted over the past
year to contain risks associated with banks’ loan portfolios, including on related-party
lending, real estate exposures, and cross-border loans. In light of the ongoing rapid escalation
of property prices and continued surge in mortgage and construction lending, a further
tightening of loan-to-value ratios and the credit scoring system for loan classification may
need to be considered, especially if credit growth decelerates more slowly than desired in
response to tighter monetary conditions. Moreover, consideration should also be given to
tightening prudential regulations on banks’ foreign lending and investment activities.
25.
Early implementation of further prudential measures to contain external
funding is also needed. The staff strongly supports measures under consideration to tighten
liquidity requirements for foreign liabilities, a further reduction in net open position limits,
and the introduction of limits on short-term external borrowing—including longer-term
borrowing with an early repayment option—related to bank capital. These could be
supported by higher reserve requirements on external liabilities than domestic liabilities on a
temporary basis. In addition, data on the maturity structure of banks’ external obligations
need to be improved and systematic monitoring of the future debt repayment profile should
be developed. This will aid in assessing rollover risk for the banking system as a whole.
26.
The regulatory measures will have to be supported by vigorous supervision to
ensure banks’ compliance. A further increase in the frequency and depth of on-site
inspections, especially unscheduled special topic inspections, will be an important
component of an intensified supervisory effort and will support recent steps to enhance
off-site stress testing and monitoring of banks’ liquidity models and maturity gap analysis.
Enhanced supervision of banks’ cross-border activities is also needed. Maintaining the FSA’s
independence will be critical for its credibility and effectiveness. In addition, an increase in
supervisory resources at the FSA will likely be required. In view of the mounting risks, the
FSA will need to stand ready to deal with any violations of prudential regulations
expeditiously and, should difficulties emerge, to intervene and resolve the situation before
any spillover effects develop.

- 16 -

27.
Adequate monetary tightening should facilitate implementation of the
authorities’ fiscal plans, which aim to address social and infrastructure needs and help
diversify the economy. With oil revenue projected to rise further and with non-oil revenue
expected to remain strong, there is significant room to expand spending and reduce taxes—
along the lines envisaged by the authorities—without compromising fiscal sustainability.
Under the spending plans currently in place, government expenditure will continue to rise in
relation to GDP through 2007. This underscores the importance of intensified scrutiny over
expenditure efficiency, especially the project approval and ex-post evaluation mechanisms.
In addition, strengthening of procurement processes is a priority. On the revenue side, the
staff cautions against tax incentives that are distortive or erode the tax base, and against
excessive reliance on tax cuts to effect increased tax compliance, including from the shadow
economy.
28.
The authorities have taken important steps to enhance the investment climate
and economic governance. The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to join the EITI.
Expeditious implementation, including the publication of audited reports, will mark an
important gain in transparency. Transparency will also be enhanced by the implementation of
the new mechanism governing the NFRK. The mechanism will clearly identify the scale of
oil revenue and its use, and will help in the design and implementation of the medium-term
budget strategy. However, the new mechanism will not automatically instill budget
discipline, and the authorities’ prudent fiscal approach will need to be retained. The staff also
welcomes the implementation of the information system for the VAT, which has led to a
marked improvement in VAT administration as evidenced by sizable revenue gains.
29.
An acceleration of structural reforms is needed to sustain the non-oil sector’s
growth prospects. Significant gains in productivity will be required to offset the impact of
the inevitable trend real exchange rate appreciation on the non-oil sector’s competitiveness
over the medium term. Early WTO accession, customs administration reform (supported by a
World Bank Modernization Loan), and further progress in enhancing regional trade—
including by streamlining procedures that raise the cost of cross-border trading—will help
secure these gains. In addition, reforms to address weaknesses identified in business climate
surveys—such as telecommunications infrastructure, excessive inspections and business
documentation and licensing requirements, as well as anti-competitive practices—will boost
growth prospects.
30.
Better disaggregation of national accounts and balance of payments data into the
oil and non-oil sectors will facilitate the assessment of macroeconomic conditions. The
staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to enhance data compilation. Close cooperation
between the Ministry of Finance (Customs Control Committee), the NBK, the Agency on
Statistics, and the Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning will be needed.
31.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Exchange Rate Regime and Competitiveness
Tenge: De Facto Flexibility

The de facto flexibility of the tenge increased in 2003–
04, but reversed significantly in 2005. With more than
80 percent of monthly exchange rate changes over the
previous two years falling within the +/- 1 percent range,
the tenge was tightly managed against the dollar until
2003. During 2003–04, monthly fluctuations increased,
but the pattern reversed in late 2004 and 2005.1 Flexibility
has increased again in 2006, especially since mid April.

Non-Oil Exports and REER

The real appreciation of the tenge in recent years
appears not to have affected the competitiveness of
non-oil exports. Kazakhstan’s share in nonfuel world
exports has increased steadily, although part of the recent
rise is due to the buoyancy of nonfuel commodity prices.
In addition, Kazakhstan’s ranking as an exporter
improved or stayed broadly unchanged across all product
groups during 1998–2004.

That said, significant further real appreciation is
likely over the medium term. Staff estimates indicate
that, based on purchasing power parity comparisons,
the tenge was undervalued by 66 percent against the
dollar in real terms in 2000.2 Taking account of the
terms of trade improvement due to higher oil prices and
relative productivity differentials—which have likely
appreciated the tenge’s equilibrium real exchange
rate—and actual exchange rate developments since
then, the real undervaluation of the tenge against the
dollar in 2005 is estimated to have remained very large.

Box 2. Credit Growth and Financial Soundness Indicators
Kazakhstan has experienced especially rapid growth in bank credit over the past half decade, even in
comparison with other Central Asia and Emerging Europe (CAEE) economies.1 Although credit growth in the
region has taken place against a backdrop of generally shallow financial markets, and credit-to-GDP ratios
remain relatively low in many countries, financial deepening—as measured by the change in the credit-toGDP ratio—appears to have proceeded more quickly in Kazakhstan than elsewhere.

Under favorable macroeconomic conditions, Kazakhstan’s financial soundness indicators have
remained broadly stable. Bank capitalization has edged down in recent years as assets have expanded,
although a similar trend has been evident in many other CAEE countries. By contrast, the slight decline in the
Kazakhstan banking system’s nonperforming loans ratio, in an environment of particularly rapid loan growth,
has been more limited than in most other CAEE countries.

Box 3. How is Oil Revenue Being Used?
Kazakhstan’s saving from its current oil revenue has been higher than in many other oil-producing
countries. The ratio of the overall fiscal surplus to oil revenue—the share of oil revenue saved—was over onehalf in 2005. In view of the expected substantial increase in oil production over the next decade, staff estimates
indicate that a significantly wider non-oil deficit in the near term (up to 8 percent of GDP—and 6½ percent of
GDP under 20 percent lower oil prices—compared with an actual non-oil deficit of under 5 percent in 2005)
would still be consistent with maintaining real per capita oil wealth at the present level.1

Box 4. Structural Reform and Investment Climate Indicators
Recent surveys and indicators point to mixed progress in the structural and business climate areas.
•

The World Economic Forum’s business competitiveness index ranks Kazakhstan 62 out of 117 countries.
Kazakhstan received high marks in macroeconomic stability and effectiveness of law-making bodies, but
relatively weak scores in foreign ownership restrictions, quality of public institutions, and telecommunications
infrastructure.

•

The World Bank-EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance (BEEPS) survey suggests that
problems encountered by businesses in the areas of tax administration and customs and trade regulations have
declined since 2002, but difficulties in obtaining permits and licenses and the extent of anticompetitive
practices have increased. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan compares favorably against the EU accession countries
and Russia in most of these areas.

•

The latest EBRD transition indicators continue to show limited recent progress in structural reform, especially
in the areas of enterprise restructuring and competition policy.

•

The World Bank Doing Business in 2006 survey indicates that Kazakhstan is among the 10 countries (out
of 155) with the most difficult environment for trade.

Net public external debt (in millions of US$) 1/

Sources: The Kazakhstan authorities, and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Total external public debt minus gross official reserves, and minus NFRK assets.
2/ Excludes transitory domestic currency deposits.
3/ Kazakhstan eurobonds are mostly held by domestic investors who have limited investment opportunities abroad.
Therefore, bond spreads of Kazakhstan are not comparable to those of other countries and do not fully reflect country risks.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real
GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006
B6. Permanent drop in oil price to $20 pb in 2006

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The
official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held
daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are
quoted for over 30 other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. Since late 1999, the exchange

- 31 -

APPENDIX I

rate regime has been a managed float with no pre-announced path, although there has been
limited de facto flexibility against the dollar and the ruble in recent years. On March 2, 2006,
the rate was T 130.17 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rates at numerous exchange bureaus are
very close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small.
The exchange system is free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

FSAP Participation and ROSCS

Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000.
The staff report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on
November 27, 2000 (FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC
modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, Core Principles for
Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good Practices on Transparency in
Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities
Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP update mission took place in
February 2004. The fiscal transparency module was completed in October 2002 and the final
report published in April 2003. A data module mission took place in April/May 2002, and its
final report was published in March 2003.
XI.

Technical Assistance

Kazakhstan has received considerable technical assistance and training by the Fund in
virtually every area of economic policy, including through about 75 technical assistance
missions provided during 1993–2003 by FAD, LEG, MFD, STA, and the IMF Institute. In
addition to short-term missions, the Fund has provided resident advisors to the National
Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and to
the ministry of finance. Other international agencies and governments, including the
World Bank, EU TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of
technical assistance.
The following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan
since 2002.
Monetary and Financial Systems
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress to be made in a number of arrears related to
monetary and exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting,
payments system reform, central bank organization and management, foreign operations and
reserve management, banking supervision, monetary statistics, currency issuance, monetary
operations, and money-market development.

APPENDIX II

Kazakhstan—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 30, 2006)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992 and of
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. The Bank’s lending program
has been curtailed in recent years as a result of the country’s reduced borrowing needs, but
the program of economic research has expanded and in FY06 it amounts to $2 million of
which half is directly financed by the authorities. The research undertaken under this
umbrella focuses on issues of overall competitiveness, fiscal and expenditure management,
human development, infrastructure and environment.
At present, there are ten active projects (nine IBRD loans and one Global Environmental
Facility (GEF) grant) with a total commitment of $648 million, of which $325 million have
been disbursed. In the active portfolio, there are five old loans (Uzen Oil Field
Rehabilitation, Road Transport Restructuring, Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation, Syr
Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea Phase I, and Nura River Clean-Up) with a commitment
of $454 million, one old GEF grant (Drylands Management) of $5 million, and four new
loans which went to the board this FY (Agricultural Post-Privatization Assistance II,
Agricultural Competitiveness, Forest Protection and Reforestation, and North-South
Electricity Transmission) with a commitment of $189 million.
The Bank is also preparing four new loans (Technology and Competitiveness, Customs
Modernization, Irrigation and Drainage II, and Ust-Kamenogorsk Environment Remediation)
with an expected financing envelope of about $235 million, and one new GEF grant
(Irrigated Ecosystem Management) of $6 million.
Kazakhstan is IFC's largest client in Central Asia. The current IFC net committed projects in
Kazakhstan amount to $277 million for its own account plus $75 million in syndicated loans
and are concentrated primarily in the oil, gas and mining and financial sector. To date $252
million have been disbursed. IFC has also been active in promotion of small and medium
enterprises and leasing sector, and provision of Technical Assistance in the areas of corporate
governance, housing market, leasing, and SMEs.
The Bank is assisting the government in attracting grants from the Global Environmental
Facility, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and, together with UNAIDS,
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and TB.

APPENDIX III

Kazakhstan––Relations with the EBRD
(As of February 1, 2006)
The EBRD is the largest investor outside the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan. As of
end-January, 2006, the EBRD’s gross cumulative disbursements amounted to
EUR 875.1 million. The current portfolio is composed of 87 projects with a total value of
EUR 2.9 billion, of which EUR 1.4 billion are financed by the EBRD. The Bank expects to
sign new project agreements in Kazakhstan on the order of EUR 200–250 million per year.
Operations in Kazakhstan are focused on building earning assets in the oil and gas sector and
the development of the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector. There are also well
established and effective relationships between the Bank and the government for financings
in the transport and general industry sectors. About 70 percent of all investments are now in
the private sector.
Strategic priorities
The latest country strategy, approved in November 2004, outlines the following strategic
priorities:
•

Enterprise Sector: Support economic diversification and promote new capital
investment, including FDI inflows. The Kazakhstan Small Business Programme
(KSBP) will remain the centrepiece of SME operations; the Trade Facilitation
Programme (TFP) will further expand Kazakh enterprises’ access to international
markets. Support for the domestic agribusiness sector will be provided primarily
through the Grain Warehouse Receipts Programme (GWRP). EBRD continues to
seek opportunities to finance projects directly in the manufacturing sector. New
financing structures will also be considered.

•

Infrastructure: Promoting commercial principles, ensuring open, nondiscriminatory
access to infrastructure as well as supporting regional cooperation will remain key
priorities. Lending operations in the transport, power and communication sectors will
be undertaken in conjunction with appropriate regulatory and institutional reform, and
will stress the need for more regional cooperation where appropriate.

•

Financial Sector: Focus on diversifying financial services, including the provision of
longer tenor and more sophisticated products. Further promote higher corporate
governance standards through equity investments. Support local competition and the
expansion strategy of selected banks in CIS countries where feasible. Extend
activities to nonbank financial institutions in sectors such as pensions, mortgages and
leasing. Develop suitable funding structures for local currency lending.

- 35 -

APPENDIX III

The Bank’s activities will continue to be guided by the existing country strategy until a new
country strategy is approved by the Board, scheduled in October 2006.
Main trends in the portfolio over the past year
During 2005, the total business volume was EUR 290.7 million with all but one of the new
operations representing the private sector.
In the telecommunications sector, the Bank financed a EUR 83.3 million loan to a private
mobile phone operator Kar-Tel (K-mobile). In the energy sector, a EUR 44 million loan was
provided to KEGOC for the completion of a new transmission line. It provides power to the
more populated South of the country and assists to eliminate seasonal imbalances.
In the general industry sector, EUR 29.1 million loan was provided to Karcement, an
affiliate of Central Asia Cement, for the expansion and modernisation of the cement plant in
Karaganda. This loan represents the first major investment in the cement industry in 15 years,
helping to satisfy the demand for cement, and support the construction sector, and thereby
diversification of the Kazakhstani economy.
Investments in financial institutions remained an important part of the portfolio, with
continued support of the Trade Facilitation (five loans). During 2005, the investments into
the FIs sector amounted to EUR 84 million. The EBRD places paramount importance on
supporting development of MSE/SME. Under the Kazakh Small Business Program (KSBP),
which is channelled through 7 Kazakh banks in 45 cities (more than 210 banking outlets
participate), approximately 4,000 loans are disbursed per month totalling $43 million,
resulting in an average loan size of about $11,000. Since inception of the KSBP in 1998, the
cumulative number of loans disbursed is 168,500 for a total volume of $1.1 billion. The
EBRD increases its efforts to support nonbank financial sector such as insurance, leasing,
and mortgages. In February 2005, it signed a $10 million loan to BTA Ipoteka to finance
residential mortgages.
The agricultural sector benefited from continued implementation of the Grain Warehouse
Receipt Programme (GWRP). With three loans of EUR 20 million each under the GWRP,
the EBRD continues working with agribusiness companies, grain traders and banks on a risk
sharing approach. A EUR 13.3 million loan was granted to a sun flower oil producer Turkuaz
in Aktobe, and a further EUR 10 million loan to financing for agricultural equipment in
cooperation with Kazkommertsbank. Under the project, the Bank offer a scheme for risk
sharing in lending/leasing of agricultural equipment machines, primarily combine harvesters
and tractors.
The EBRD continued to conduct policy dialogue on the investment climate, mainly through
the Foreign Investors Council (FIC), and bilateral discussions. Coordination in terms of
policy dialogue and regional cooperation will be reinforced, in particular with the Asian
Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and key bilateral
donors. EBRD will also continue to link its provision of funding for investment activities to
enhancements in transparency, integrity, corporate governance and effective regulation.

- 36 -

APPENDIX IV

Kazakhstan—Relations with the Asian Development Bank
(As of January 31, 2006)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. As of
January 2006, total loan commitments amounted to $483 million, covering 14 loans in
agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and communications, and
water supply, sanitation and waste management.
At end-December 2005, total loan disbursements amounted to $434.4 million. Current
Country Strategy and Program (CSP) was formulated in 2003 for 2004–06 and is being
updated annually. The CSP is anchored to Millennium Development Goals and aimed to help
Kazakhstan’s long-term developmental objective of diversifying resource-based economy.
The CSP has four key pillars: (a) private sector development, (b) human development,
(c) environmental sustainability; and (d) regional cooperation. Knowledge transfer is a the
basis of collaboration, using both technical assistance (TA) and loans. CSPU for 2006–08,
approved in 2005, retained essentially the same strategy and approaches, but sharpened its
focus on areas of rural support (e.g., rural development, rural water supply, water resources
management) and sectors of regional impact (e.g., finance, transport). Kazakhstan is no
longer eligible for concessional resources from the Asian Development Fund.
Private sector operations, which commenced in 2005, will be at the forefront of future ADB
operations in the country. Such operations will gradually expand over time and focus on
SME support, infrastructure, water, power, and the financial sector. This new thrust towards
private sector operations will be supported by public sector technical assistance and
investments to create an enabling environment for the private sector and selected public
lending programs in rural water supply and water resources management aimed at improving
livelihood in rural areas and reducing urban-rural gap.
The ADB has provided Kazakhstan with TA grants in several sectors, including agriculture,
education, finance, pension reform, transportation, energy, water supply and sanitation, aid
coordination and management, public investment programming, and poverty reduction
planning and implementation. As of December 31, 2005, total ADB’s TA program since l994
has reached 62 technical assistance projects with a total of $26.4 million.

APPENDIX V

Kazakhstan—Statistical Issues
The quality and coverage of Kazakhstan’s economic statistics are generally adequate for
surveillance. The April 2002 data ROSC mission found that international standards for
methodological soundness, accuracy and reliability of data are either fully observed or
largely observed. Nevertheless, there were shortcomings in some statistical practices that
could detract from accurate and timely analysis of economic and financial developments and
the formulation of appropriate policies.1
Kazakhstan has made considerable progress since the 2002 data ROSC mission. On March
24, 2003 Kazakhstan became the 53rd subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), marking a major step forward in the development of the country’s statistical system.
It is the first country to graduate from the General Data Dissemination System to the SDDS,
and the second country of the Commonwealth of Independent States to subscribe to the
SDDS. Measures have been taken to address delays in disseminating SDDS prescribed data
for different data categories, including the official reserve assets and government finance
statistics.
Building on the progress achieved since 2002, an IMF multitopic statistics mission visited
Kazakhstan during 20–24 February, 2006 to help develop a more analytically rigorous
disaggregation of national accounts and balance of payments statistics into the oil and non-oil
sectors of the economy, in order to allow a better assessment of macroeconomic
developments and policy formulation. The mission also provided recommendations for
improving their quarterly national accounts (QNA).
Sector specific issues
In the area of national accounts, several weaknesses remain in both the quality of GDP
estimates by sector produced by the National Statistical Agency and the quality and
timeliness of GDP estimates by expenditures. First, the quality of GDP estimates by
industry is affected by the poor coverage of production and financial statistics, particularly
concerning small enterprises and informal activities. Second, while some progress has been
made in making GDP estimates by final expenditure consistent with output-based
measures, there remain substantial shortcomings, particularly in the estimation of fixed
capital formation. Quarterly GDP series are compiled both on a cumulative and discrete
basis, but the former are not in accordance with the concepts and definitions of the Quarterly
National Accounts Manual (QNA Manual). The 2006 multitopic mission found deficiencies,
however, and proposed that only the discrete series be compiled. Also, the mission made
recommendations in a number of areas, including: the deflators used; data sources for
intermediate consumption and inventories; adjustments for holding gains for intermediate
consumption; methods for deriving constant price estimates of changes in inventories, taxes
and subsidies, and retail trade; and methods for recording work in progress.

APPENDIX V

As a result of extensive technical assistance, the quality of fiscal data has improved, in
particular following the consolidation, in 1999, of most extrabudgetary and social
security funds into the fiscal accounts and the provision of more detailed expenditure data
on a quarterly basis. However, the coverage of oil revenues, particularly royalties, is not
transparent and may be significantly undervalued. Progress has also been made in the
establishment of a classification of the fiscal accounts consistent with the Fund’s
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology. However, as a
result of the reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of budgetary units,
difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears.
Since 1997, the authorities have reported detailed data for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
The latest data reported for publication cover consolidated general government and are
presented using the new template consistent with the GFSM 2001. The ministry of finance
also provides monthly indicators covering the general government for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The existing framework for compiling monetary statistics generally conforms to
recommended Fund methodology, and data are compiled on a timely basis. Steps are being
taken by the NBK to further improve the quality and coverage of data. In particular, the
chart of accounts for commercial banks has been revised to enable the NBK to distinguish
sectors and financial instruments in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. The NBK has extended institutional coverage to compile a financial sector survey
that includes the Development Bank. The authorities have started implementing the
recommendations of past money and banking statistics missions regarding the use of
residency criteria as defined in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5),
including changing the data base where foreign branches and foreign companies’
representatives should be classified as resident. However, there are inconsistencies among
banks in recording syndicated lending which can distort the measure of net foreign assets
and credit to the domestic economy. Also, data revisions in the monetary statistics are not
synchronized with those for the International Investment Position and balance of payments
statistics. MCD and STA staff are working with the authorities to harmonize the presentation
of monetary statistics.
There are also significant shortcomings in external debt statistics. First, public and publiclyguaranteed debt does not include external debt of public enterprises and development
institutions, which is instead included in private debt. Second, external debt data are
compiled and reported on an original-maturity rather than remaining-maturity basis. Third,
there are substantial discrepancies in the maturity composition of banks’ external liabilities
reported in the monetary statistics and the external debt statistics.
In the area of balance of payments, the overall quality and timeliness of data are
satisfactory. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the Fund technical
assistance recommendations. In particular, the coverage of trade data has been improved
through a survey to determine the volume of shuttle trade and travel expenses. The NBK has
also worked closely with relevant agencies, including the STA staff, to update the ratios used
for adjusting c.i.f. imports to an f.o.b. basis, which was implemented in March 2005 and

- 39 -

APPENDIX V

resulted in revision of import data from 2000 to 2004. Compilation of export and import
price indices has been initiated, and historical data are also now available. However, some
work remains to be done to address certain deficiencies.
First, the timeliness of trade data remains an issue; improvements can be expected with the
continuing computerization of the customs administration. In addition, separation of import
data into those related to the oil sector would aid in macroeconomic analysis and assessment
of the policy stance. Second, foreign direct investment statistics are not fully in line with the
standards set forth in BPM5, as local branch offices of foreign companies operating in the
construction sector are considered as nonresident entities. This leads to an inconsistency with
national accounts statistics where this activity is treated as domestic production. Finally, the
Data ROSC mission in 2002 also noted that commercial banks define nonresidents on a legal
basis rather than on the BPM5 principle, affecting the data reported by these banks for
balance of payments purposes.

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Kazakhstan
On June 14, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan.1
Background
Macroeconomic conditions were buoyant in 2005 and early 2006. Real GDP grew 9.4 percent in
2005. While hydrocarbon output decelerated, the income and wealth effects associated with
high oil prices lifted non-oil output growth to 11 percent, with construction and financial services
output expanding particularly rapidly. The unemployment rate declined further to 8.1 percent.
However, inflation picked up to 7.6 percent in 2005 (period average) and jumped to almost
9 percent in February–April 2006 (year-on-year). A 30 percent increase in pensions and public
sector salaries contributed to inflationary pressure.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the June 14, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

- 42 The current account edged into a small deficit in 2005. A sharp increase in oil exports (by
$6 billion;10.7 percent of GDP) was more than offset by higher income remittances to foreign
direct investors and a sharp increase in goods and services imports, including FDI-financed
imports by the oil sector. Banks borrowed heavily from abroad but also increased their holdings
of foreign assets and securities, while amortization of FDI liabilities picked up, reflecting the
stronger cash position of oil companies. With net outflows increasing, official reserves declined
in 2005, albeit by less than the increase in foreign asset accumulation in the National Fund of
the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), and the tenge depreciated by 3 percent against the dollar.
In early 2006, however, official reserves recovered sharply, including on account of continued
rapid bank borrowing abroad, and the tenge appreciated by 8 percent against the dollar. In real
effective terms, the tenge has appreciated by 5½ percent since end-2004 and by about
13 percent since end-2003, with little apparent consequence for the non-oil sector’s
competitiveness.
Monetary policy was accommodative and bank credit boomed, fueled in part by bank borrowing
abroad. Money growth remained high and policy interest rates were flat for much of 2005. Credit
growth accelerated to over 70 percent (year-on-year) in late 2005 and early 2006 as banks’
lending interest rates declined in real terms. Banks funded their lending partly with a surge in
external borrowing—banks’ external liabilities rose to $15 billion (27 percent of GDP) at end2005, from $7.7 billion at end-2004. On the fiscal side, policy remained prudent. The overall
fiscal surplus rose to 6 percent of GDP, with surging oil revenue permitting a further rapid
expansion in public spending (by over 20 percent in real terms).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic framework, which
helped Kazakhstan achieve an impressive economic performance over the past five years,
including in the non-oil sectors of the economy. Looking forward, Directors welcomed the
continued favorable outlook, but cautioned that mounting inflationary pressures and risks in the
banking sector needed to be addressed.
Most Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten the monetary policy stance further. While
they welcomed the recently announced broadening of the coverage of reserve requirements,
they recommended further increases in policy interest rates. Directors also welcomed the
nominal appreciation of the tenge in recent months and supported more exchange rate flexibility
to allow greater appreciation of the tenge to help absorb liquidity and curb inflation. They
pointed out that tighter monetary conditions would affect the National Bank Kazakhstan’s (NBK)
balance sheet and recommended an early capital injection into the NBK to send a convincing
signal to markets that monetary policy will not be constrained by profit and loss considerations.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a number of prudential regulations over the past year to
help contain risks associated with banks’ loan portfolios. They urged the authorities to consider
further prudential measures, particularly for real estate-related and foreign currency lending,

- 43 and for investment activities. Directors also considered the need for an early tightening of
prudential regulations to contain external bank funding and strongly supported measures
recently announced by the authorities, including tougher liquidity requirements and net open
position limits. In addition, they urged the authorities to improve monitoring of the maturity
structure of banks’ external obligations and debt repayment profiles to better assess the rollover
risks.
Directors emphasized that regulatory measures would have to be supported by vigorous
supervision to ensure banks’ compliance. They recommended increased on-site inspections
and enhanced supervision of banks’ cross-border activities. They also underscored the
importance of maintaining the Financial Supervision Agency’s (FSA) independence and
stressed that the FSA should deal expeditiously with any violation of prudential regulations.
Directors considered that an adequate monetary tightening would facilitate implementation of
the authorities’ fiscal plans, which aim at addressing social and infrastructure needs, and
helping diversify the economy. They noted that there remains significant room to raise spending
and cut taxes without compromising fiscal sustainability. However, in light of the continued rise
in government expenditure, Directors underscored the importance of intensified scrutiny over
expenditure efficiency. They also cautioned against distortive tax incentives that would erode
the tax base.
Directors welcomed the important steps taken by the authorities to improve the investment
climate and economic governance. They noted that transparency would be enhanced with the
expeditious implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the new
design of the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Directors noted that the growth prospects and competitiveness of the non-oil sector would
benefit from an acceleration of structural reforms. They pointed in particular to the need for early
WTO accession, continued reform of customs administration, and further progress in enhancing
regional trade, including by streamlining procedures that lower the cost of cross-border trading.
Directors also urged reforms to address weaknesses identified in business climate surveys.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve data disaggregation into the oil and nonoil sectors of the economy. In this context, they called for closer cooperation between various
agencies involved in compiling and analyzing the relevant data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
