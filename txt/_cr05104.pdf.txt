•

A staff team comprising Messrs. Kramer (head), Komori, Ginting (all APD), and
Mr. Christensen (OTM) held the Article IV discussions in Pohnpei during
October 18–28, 2004. The mission overlapped with visits by a PFTAC team and an
MFD expert.

•

The team met with President Urusemal, Vice President Killion, Secretary of Finance
and Administration Andon, Secretary of Foreign Affairs Anefal, and other senior
officials. It also met with representatives of Pohnpei state government.

•

The mission conducted a number of outreach activities, meeting with representatives
of the National Congress, the banking and business communities, a local research
institute, and a newspaper.

•

In concluding the prior consultation in January 2003, Directors agreed that the
Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) faced major challenges in adjusting to reduced
external assistance under the second Compact of Free Association with the
United States. They stressed that only with strong fiscal adjustment, structural
reforms to stimulate private sector activity, and greater investment in human capital
could the FSM look forward to macroeconomic stability and economic growth.
Directors recognized that, given the FSM’s structure as a loose federation of
autonomous states, the authorities should spare no effort in garnering the needed
political and community consensus for reforms.

•

The FSM has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Setting
•

The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) relies heavily on U.S. grants under
the Compact of Free Association. These grants, which are currently sizeable, have
been declining and are set to fall further and expire in FY2024. Reflecting large
grants, the public sector dominates economic activity.

•

Success in adjusting to past declines in Compact grants has been mixed. The
wage bill was reduced in the 1990s but it remains high relative to GDP. Fiscal
discipline has been uneven across the four states, which have budgetary autonomy.

•

Output contracted in FY2004 with a stepdown in Compact grants but is
expected to grow slightly in FY2005. The drop in grants also precipitated
deteriorations in the fiscal and external balances. Employment is stagnant, and
inflation remains low, notwithstanding rising fuel prices.

Key Policy Issues
•

Fiscal and structural reforms are needed for the FSM to achieve self-sufficiency.
The large government sector will be increasingly unsustainable given coming
declines in grants. A sizeable budgetary adjustment is needed to curb fiscal
vulnerabilities as well as to build up sufficient assets as a buffer against future
shocks. In addition, structural reforms are needed to promote private sector
development and employment.

•

The authorities agree on these priorities, but progress in fiscal and structural
reforms may well remain slow. This situation reflects a highly decentralized fiscal
system, a lack of understanding among stakeholders of the policy challenges, and
capacity limitations.

•

Fiscal adjustment will need to comprise both expenditure cuts and revenue
measures. There is room to rein in current spending, although core health, education
and infrastructure spending must be preserved given its importance to growth. The
best option to increase revenue remains comprehensive tax reform and the
introduction of a VAT; the government is discussing this option but agreement is not
likely soon.

•

Structural reform priorities should include improvements to the legal
framework for land use, foreign investment, and lending. Public enterprise
reforms could both reduce crowding-out of private firms and yield budgetary savings.

(FSM) is a small Pacific island country that 90

Since independence in 1986 it has relied

currently, they amount to about a third of
GDP or about $700 per capita. Starting
in 2024, the FSM will be able to draw on a trust fund established with its own contributions
as well as those of the United States. The trust fund will invest in U.S. stocks and bonds (see
Box 1).
2.
The country comprises four states in a loose federal structure. Each state has its
own administration and legislature; there is a national government as well. Presidents are
selected by the National Congress from the four at-large Congressmen, and serve four-year
terms; the current president took office in May 2003. The states formulate their own budgets,
which are a significant share of the consolidated budget, and levy taxes, thus limiting the
national government’s influence on the overall direction of fiscal policy.
3.
Success in adjusting to past reductions in Compact funds has been mixed. During
FY1996–99, the public wage bill was cut substantially in the context of a Public Sector
Reform Program supported by the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), but these cuts were
partly reversed, and the wage bill remains high. Modest recent surpluses partly reflected a
temporary increase in grants and compression of investment, while fiscal discipline has been
uneven across states.
4.
Reflecting the size of Compact grants, the public sector dominates the economy.
Notwithstanding past declines, public expenditure is over 60 percent of GDP while
government accounts for half of formal employment. Moreover, high public sector wages—
around double those in the private sector—exacerbate structural impediments to private
sector development. While the private sector has grown modestly over time, many firms
mainly serve the government and its employees. Export-oriented sectors—tourism,
commercial agriculture, and fisheries—account for only 6 percent of employment.

The fiscal year runs from October to September (e.g., FY2004 ended in September 2004).

Box 1. Renewed Compact of Free Association with the United States
The economic assistance provisions of the original Compact covered FY1987–2001. It provided
annual cash grants of $97.9 million during FY1987–91, $91.1 million during FY1992–96, and
$79.2 million during FY1997–2001. The funds were to cover general government and capital
expenditures, with the latter to comprise a minimum of 40 percent of grants. During the FY2002–03
interim, while the Compact was being renegotiated, grants were provided at the average level of the
initial Compact period—a sizeable increase.
The renewed Compact covers FY2004–23 and features declining grants assistance, a trust fund,
and enhanced accountability and monitoring:
•

Total funding: Total funding of $92.7 million per year comprises grants, audit funds
($0.5 million), and trust fund contributions. Grants are $76.2 million during FY2003–05, after
which they decline by $0.8 million per year in nominal terms. Grants and trust fund
contributions are indexed at the lesser of two-thirds the increase in the U.S. GDP deflator or
5 percent.

•

Trust fund: Trust fund contributions rise from $16 million in FY2004 to $29.6 million in
FY2023. In addition, the FSM made a $30.2 million contribution in FY2004 (of which
$30 million was required under the Compact). The trust fund cannot be used to finance
spending or as collateral for borrowing before 2024. The fund is administered by a fivemember committee (three U.S. and two FSM appointees), and can invest in U.S. stocks and
bonds and other instruments as approved by the committee.

•

Accountability and monitoring: A US-FSM Joint Economic Management Committee
(JEMCO) approves grant allocations and reviews performance outcomes and audits. The
committee is comprised of three U.S. and two FSM members.

•

Sectoral allocations: Funds are to be allocated to six priority sectors—health, infrastructure,
education, capacity building, environment, and private sector development. There are no
explicit formulas for allocation by sector, but JEMCO has resolved that infrastructure spending
should rise towards at least 30 percent of annual Compact grants and achieve that level in
FY2006.

Other key provisions of Compact II include:
•

Disaster assistance from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency is to be phased out
over time and replaced by assistance administered through the U.S. Department of State.

•

Funding under certain U.S. educational programs is to be replaced by the Supplemental
Education Grant (about $12 million in FY2005).

•

Immigration provisions were tightened (for instance, visitors now must show a passport).

-6-

5.
A lack of domestic job opportunities appears to have driven significant
emigration, particularly following the late 1990s government restructuring and the
subsequent economic slump (the Compact allows FSM citizens to readily emigrate to and
work in the United States). According to unofficial estimates, emigrants comprise 10 to
25 percent of the population, most of whom live in the United States or in its territories such
as Guam. As a result of increased emigration, since the mid-1990s annual population growth
has slowed from about 2 percent to about 0.2 percent. Micronesians living overseas probably
send substantial amounts of income home, increasing the resilience of the domestic
economy. While official data put net remittance inflows at only 1 percent of GDP, these
estimates are based on a household survey from the 1990s, and the subsequent pickup in
emigration has likely boosted remittances.
6.
The authorities recognize the need for fiscal and structural reforms, but
implementation has been slow. The authorities have made some progress in addressing
problems highlighted by Directors at the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation:
fiscal accountability has been enhanced under the amended Compact, and modest headway
has been made in some areas of structural reforms under the AsDB-supported Private Sector
Development Program. In addition, the FSM’s third Economic Summit held in early 2004
highlighted the benefits of a sustained-growth development strategy and identified key
policy challenges, and disseminated information to the public on the need for reforms.
However, much remains to be done: fiscal imbalances remain sizeable; the wage bill is
high, including by regional standards; revenues remain low; a VAT is still under discussion;
and key structural reforms have not moved forward. The limited progress reflects the
difficulty of reaching agreement among the states on national fiscal priorities, as well as a
lack of understanding among stakeholders of the challenges facing the FSM and policy
options for dealing with them. In addition, weak capacity continues to hamper policy
implementation.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK2
7.
Real output contracted in FY2004 (Table 1). In FY2003, government spending
rose, while private sector activity recovered owing to reduced uncertainty as Compact
negotiations ended. In FY2004, however, economic activity was adversely affected by a
stepdown in Compact grants and a typhoon. Employment growth has been stagnant the past
two years, with falling public employment broadly offset by rising private employment,
while wage growth has been modest. Inflation has remained low despite higher oil prices.
8.
The fiscal position swung sharply to deficit in FY2004 (Table 2). This
deterioration after two years of surpluses reflected both a programmed drop in Compact
grants and the withholding of Compact infrastructure grants disbursements owing to delays
in preparing a required infrastructure development plan. Domestic revenues continued falling

varied, with Chuuk state accumulating
arrears. Reflecting the consolidated deficit
and a $30 million trust fund contribution,

Domestic credit continues to
shrink. The FSM’s two commercial banks are well capitalized and highly liquid, with low
nonperforming loans.4 However, owing to limited domestic lending opportunities and
shortcomings in the legal framework, the financial sector mainly invests in U.S. securities
markets, rather than lending to domestic businesses and households. In the recent period,
private sector credit has been contracting owing to weak economic prospects, and the
loan/deposit ratio has declined to record lows.

rises and private-sector activity picks up. Inflation is expected to remain low. The fiscal

Box 2. The FSM Economy: Comparison with Other Compact Countries
The FSM, the Republic of the Marshall Islands
(RMI), and the Republic of Palau (all formerly
part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands)
currently have Compact of Free Association
agreements with the United States. These three
countries have similar characteristics, with
heavy reliance on official grants and
dollarization. Nonetheless, cross-country
comparisons highlight notable differences
among them.
Compared with the RMI, the FSM has
experienced higher GDP growth and enjoys
higher GDP per capita at present. However,
both the FSM and the RMI have lagged Palau in
terms of economic development, and a large
part of their population is still in the subsistence
sector. Furthermore, growth in paid privatesector employment has been modest. The
differing economic performances might be
partly attributed to geography: Palau is the
closest to large Asian countries and receives the
greatest number of international visitors. All
three countries have enjoyed price stability
during recent years, thanks to the U.S. dollar’s
use as the domestic currency.

Regarding fiscal performance, the three

FSM has the lowest domestic revenue, the
highest grants, and the largest wage
expenditures. That said, its government debt,
along with Palau’s, is at comfortably low levels,
thanks to large grants and relatively prudent
past fiscal policies.

deficit should narrow to 2 percent of GDP if grants withheld in FY2005 are disbursed as
anticipated. The external current account would remain in significant deficit owing in part to
the pending closure of a garment factory. Steady emigration is likely to continue owing to
limited job opportunities, although the attendant increase in remittance inflows would partly
offset its effects on income. Downside risks to the outlook include a sustained increase in oil
prices and a global slowdown that could dampen exports. Adverse weather conditions are
another risk, which could worsen over time with global climate change.5
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Framework
12.
The discussions revolved around medium-term prospects, and particularly the
need for fiscal and structural adjustments to adapt to reduced Compact funding
(Annex I). The mission stressed that growth is likely to be sluggish in the medium term—
around 1 percent a year—unless fiscal and structural reforms are undertaken. In addition, the
large government sector will be increasingly unsustainable given coming declines in grants.
Slow or partial reforms would entail mounting fiscal vulnerabilities and a continued drag on
private sector activity, while a prolonged lack of private-sector opportunities could spur more
rapid emigration that would reduce human capital and economic potential. To be sure, the
FSM’s remoteness, small size, and limited resource base continue to pose obstacles to
development. However, strong private-sector growth in Yap state and higher per-capita GDP
and employment in nearby Palau suggest that such obstacles are not insurmountable. The
mission also stressed that fiscal and structural reforms could complement one another: for
example, structural reforms would aid the fiscal effort by stoking growth in the tax base.
13.
The authorities agreed on the need for policy adjustments, but highlighted the
difficulty of mobilizing public support and implementing policies. In particular, the states
account for a large proportion of the overall fiscal imbalance, and thus must undertake a
significant share of the measures to correct it. Moreover, while the states and Congress are
exploring options for adjustment, they are not convinced of the need for a VAT. The
authorities continue their outreach and coordination efforts in the context of the Economic
Summit and an Economic Policy Implementation Council (comprising the leaders of the five
governments, including Congressional representatives). The mission recognized these efforts
and encouraged the authorities to build upon them, but stressed the urgency of launching
adjustments in earnest to promote medium-term fiscal and economic sustainability.
B. Fiscal Adjustment
14.
The authorities noted that the FY2005 budget incorporated expenditure
restraint. Wage freezes and hiring ceilings would remain in place, holding down the wage

bill. While expressing concerns that states might experience pressure on service delivery
given Compact restrictions on how grants can be spent, the authorities nevertheless thought
that each state should be able to trim other current expenditure, including on wages and
travel. On the revenue side, customs administration has improved with the recent
introduction of an automated clearance system. However, the revenue impact has been small,
and audits and penalties need strengthening.
15.
The mission supported steps to restrain expenditure but stressed the need for
immediate fiscal consolidation. Based on the FY2005 budget, the mission estimated that
current expenditures would remain broadly unchanged, while capital expenditure would
recover with the release of Compact grants held back in FY2004. Tax revenues would remain
low, while grants would rise substantially. Overall, the deficit would narrow but would
remain large. To reduce this imbalance, immediate cuts in the wage bill and other current
expenditures are needed. Efforts are also warranted to stem the decline in tax revenues by
further improving administration, although the initial payoff would be modest. Delays in
reducing the deficit would worsen fiscal vulnerabilities through further erosion of
government financial assets and buildups of arrears—which was particularly a risk in Chuuk
state. Alternatively, prompt consolidation would signal commitment to stabilizing the public
finances and streamlining expenditure, and thereby bolster public support for tax reforms.
16.
The mission stressed that a
sizeable fiscal adjustment would be
required in the medium term. Mediumterm surpluses of around 3 percent of GDP
would be needed to accumulate assets
sufficient to absorb shocks and supplement
trust fund income after 2023, as well as to
stabilize assets relative to GDP in the long
run. This would entail an adjustment of
5 percentage points of GDP from FY2005.
With such an adjustment, complemented
by reforms to spur private sector
development, income on assets would
stabilize relative to GDP in the long run.

A more decisive fiscal strategy is
needed to achieve this adjustment. As
significant revenue measures would take
several years to implement, continued
reductions in current expenditures would
be needed. Indeed, the structure of
expenditures could benefit from a broad
review. However, as core expenditures on

should be preserved, given their crucial importance to growth and to meet Compact
requirements, revenue efforts should contribute significantly to fiscal adjustment over time.
This would include further strengthening administration to boost tax revenue, which
remained low by regional standards, as well as aid with implementation of future tax policy
measures. Beyond this, however, more fundamental tax reforms are needed to reduce
distortions and improve compliance while bolstering revenue. In this connection, the mission
expressed concern that piecemeal measures introduced by Congress, such as increasing
duties, would divert attention from fundamental tax reforms and could even undercut revenue
gains by worsening compliance. The authorities noted that a high-level Task Force that
includes representatives of the five governments and the National Congress is reviewing
options for comprehensive tax reform.
18.
The staff argued that the best option for tax reform remains introduction of a
VAT, similar to those introduced in a number of other Pacific island countries. Properly
planned and implemented, this could yield 2 to 3 percentage points of GDP in revenue.
Moreover, it would reduce distortionary tax cascades—taxes levied upon taxes—as well as
conform with plans for trade liberalization and improve compliance. The administrative
burden could be managed by setting an appropriately high sales threshold for selecting the
firms that would be required to comply with the VAT (other firms would be covered by a
presumptive tax similar to the existing gross revenue tax). The authorities noted that the Task
Force saw the VAT as an important option. However, implementation would require the
cooperation of the states, which have constitutional jurisdiction over consumption taxes (a
proposed constitutional amendment to allow a national VAT failed in 2002). A VAT could
be implemented through the introduction of four state VATs, although coordinating the tax
schemes would be challenging. The mission recognized these difficulties but noted that other
options, such as expanding the income tax base, were unlikely to yield as much revenue.
Thus, absent a VAT, larger expenditure cuts would be needed.
19.
The mission and the authorities concurred that reforms of public enterprises are
needed to reduce their budgetary burden and avoid crowding out private firms. Heavy
government involvement in commercial activities, notably in agriculture and fishing, has
failed: some public enterprises are defunct, while others depend on subsidies. The public
enterprise sector remains significant in size, accounting for 5 percent of employment—
roughly the same size as all the main export-oriented sectors combined. The authorities’
strategy going forward is to facilitate private sector development by creating a fertile
business environment, rather than undertaking commercial activities. The mission welcomed
this aim, but noted the need to expeditiously close inessential enterprises and strengthen
essential but weak ones.
20.
The financial situation of the Social Security Administration warrants attention.
While the Administration currently runs a small surplus and is unlikely to be a drain on the
budget soon, its unfunded future liability remains very high at $203 million (90 percent of
GDP). This situation mainly reflects an unsustainably high rate of return on contributions: for
most participants, the present value of benefits is 300 to 400 percent higher than the present

- 12 -

value of contributions. Accordingly, it was agreed that measures will be needed to address
the unfunded liability—perhaps by increasing the retirement age or reducing benefits.
21.
Budgetary management needs to be strengthened. Progress has been made toward
compliance with the Fiscal Procedures Agreement (FPA) under the renewed Compact, but
capacity limitations risked further delays in meeting FPA requirements that could hold up
disbursements. Thus, the mission considered that efforts to meet the Compact’s
accountability and oversight requirements needed to be intensified. The authorities noted that
the planned implementation of a unified financial management information system should
improve financial control and reporting, as well as timeliness in completing audits (final
accounts for FY2002 are still unavailable).
22.
Draft legislation would allow foreign corporations to pay corporate income tax
in the FSM, thus exempting them from paying tax at home and creating a tax haven.
The authorities stressed that they opposed the legislation, which was pushed by members of
Congress. The mission and PFTAC advisors strongly advised against the measure, which
would likely bring few if any economic benefits to the FSM but would be viewed
unfavorably by the international community. The President vetoed the legislation but the
veto could be overridden by Congress. (The FSM is not now on the OECD list of tax
havens.)
C. Structural Reforms
23.
It was agreed that structural reforms are needed to encourage private sector
development and employment. Structural problems include periodic power outages in some
parts of the country, obstacles to foreign ownership of land and to the use of land as
collateral for loans, and an intransparent and lengthy review process for foreign investments.
The authorities’ priorities to resolve these problems, as reflected in the Private Sector
Development Program (PSDP; Box 3) and the third Economic Summit, include:
•
•
•

infrastructure enhancements to reduce the cost of doing business;
measures to ease the use of land for production and for investment and collateral; and
steps to make the foreign investment regime more efficient and transparent by
reducing bureaucratic discretion and shortening the review process.

24.
The mission concurred with these priorities but noted that progress in reforms
has been slow. Approval of PSDP loans was delayed for over two years, reflecting limited
capacity and a lack of a sense of urgency about reforms. As a result, considerable reform
momentum has been lost, with little or no legislative action in most areas. The mission
stressed the need for prompt and concrete progress, noting the risks and costs of further
delays, and encouraged the authorities to intensify their dialog with stakeholders on the
importance of timely reforms.

- 13 -

Box 3. Private Sector Development Program
Since 2003, the FSM has been implementing the Private Sector Development Program
(PSDP) with $13 million in financial support from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB).
The PSDP complements the late 1990s Public Sector Reform Program, which helped to cut
government payroll costs (though the progress was partly undone later).
The goal of the PSDP, which is to be completed in 2006, is to promote economic growth by
expanding the private sector, thereby raising domestic employment and incomes and
reducing dependence on external assistance. To attain this goal, the PSDP’s objectives are
to: (i) improve the policy and legal environment for private sector development, and
(ii) strengthen capacity to manage land, labor, and capital resources. Its key performance
targets and required actions are the following:
•

Public sector reforms:
o
o
o
o

•

Maintaining balanced budgets (in terms of current revenues and
expenditures);
Setting aside the FY2002–03 increase in Compact grants for the trust fund;
Maintaining government payroll levels; and
Reforms of at least one public sector enterprise by each national and state
government.

Economic and legal reforms to enact or revise laws in the areas of long-term land
leases, mortgages, foreign investment, and bankruptcy.

Progress in implementation has been generally limited. The FSM satisfied prior
conditions for the first tranche of the program loan, which was disbursed in 2003. To
receive the second tranche disbursement ($2.5 million) slated for 2005, however, AsDB
staff consider that much needs to be done, particularly on economic and legal reforms.
Progress in economic and legal reforms has been as follows:
•
•
•
•

Public sector enterprises. Reforms have been delayed. These reforms are seen as the
biggest hurdle to disbursement of the second tranche.
Long-term land lease laws and new foreign investment laws. Local and national
governments have prepared relevant model legislation.
Mortgage laws. Only Chuuk passed the law, while other states submitted legislation.
Bankruptcy law. A draft law has been prepared.

are to privatize public fishing enterprises
and encourage FSM-based fishing fleets, with due attention to marine resource sustainability;
and to increase agricultural production and reduce reliance on imports for food security
purposes.
D. Other Issues
26.
The banking system remains well supervised and regulated but lends little
domestically. The 2002 Banking Act amendment brought supervision and prudential
standards closer in line with the Basle Core Principles. However, the mission and the
authorities agreed that reforms to improve the lending environment are still needed to better
support the domestic economy. The authorities noted that drafts of a bankruptcy code and
secured transaction legislation have been prepared, but were not yet taken up by Congress.
The mission saw these elements of the legal framework as key priorities.
27.
The banking system also includes a development bank, which accounts for half
of domestic credit. It has a slightly larger nonperforming loan rate than the commercial
banks and received total capital contributions of around $2 million from the National
Government over the past three years. The authorities saw the bank’s competition with
private banks as limited, as it deals mainly with loans that commercial banks considered too
risky to underwrite, and viewed the associated fiscal risks as modest. The mission
nevertheless noted that the development bank should avoid competing with the commercial
banks and should contain possible budgetary implications of its operations.
28.
Efforts have been under way to strengthen the AML/CFT framework. Money
laundering legislation was put in place in 2001 and bank staff have received AML/CFT
training. A 2003 Legal Department mission provided assistance in upgrading AML
legislation to conform with international standards and advice on establishing a financial
intelligence unit (FIU), which has recently been created. (The FSM is not on the FATF’s list
of countries that are noncooperative in AML/CFT.)
29.
The authorities intend to pursue trade liberalization. The mission saw the strategy
of engaging in regional trade agreements as a prelude to broader liberalization as appropriate;

- 15 -

ratification of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) would be a step
forward in this regard.6 The FSM is a member of the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic
Relations, which is a framework for negotiation of regional trade agreements, and
participates in Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations with the EU (which are at an
early stage). The FSM has a relatively open trade regime, rated “4” on the Fund’s index of
trade restrictiveness. A few items are subject to import duties of 25 percent but rates for food
and general merchandise are 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively. There are no quantitative
restrictions on imports and no significant nontariff barriers to trade. While the government
maintains a monopoly on copra exports, such exports are at negligible levels.
30.
Domestic capacity to produce economic statistics remains weak, hampering
economic monitoring and policy evaluation. The mission welcomed ongoing efforts, based
on a 2003 PFTAC plan, to strengthen the capacity of local staff and reduce reliance on
external experts. It also encouraged the authorities to participate in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) to complement enhancements in capacity and define a
framework for further improvements to statistics.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The medium term outlook is worrisome. Given anticipated declines in external
assistance the large government sector will be increasingly unsustainable. In addition,
minimal progress has been made towards rectifying fiscal imbalances or undertaking
structural reforms needed to promote private sector development. Without steps to remedy
these problems, the medium-term outlook is for weak growth and mounting fiscal
vulnerabilities, with a significant risk of more rapid outward migration.
32.
The main policy challenge is thus to foster fiscal and economic self sufficiency.
Reforms will be difficult, particularly given the states’ policy autonomy, and the country’s
remote location and small size will continue to pose obstacles to development. Nevertheless,
starting comprehensive reforms in earnest is the only option to ensure medium-term
sustainability. Further dialog with public and private stakeholders will be essential to raise
awareness of the choices facing the country and to build the needed consensus for reform.
33.
Given declining assistance, fiscal adjustment is unavoidable and should start
right away. In the context of the FY2005 budget, efforts to restrain the wage bill through a
continued wage freeze and hiring ceilings are welcome. The authorities should build on these
efforts by making immediate cuts in the wage bill as well as reductions in other current
expenditure. Prompt consolidation would both reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and usefully
signal the commitment to stabilizing the public finances and rationalizing expenditure.

6

PICTA entails phased elimination of tariffs vis-à-vis other Pacific island countries by 2012. Given the limited
trade between these states, little or no trade diversion would result. The process may provide an introduction to
the mechanics of trade liberalization, which could prove useful for liberalization at the multilateral level.

- 16 -

34.
In the medium term, a sizeable adjustment will be needed. Because necessary
comprehensive tax reforms will take time to implement, expenditure cuts will need to
continue beyond FY2005. However, fiscal adjustment should preserve core expenditures on
health, education, and infrastructure, given their importance to growth and Compact
requirements to target them. In addition, revenue administration and budgetary management
should be strengthened.
35.
To safeguard core expenditures, revenue measures should contribute
significantly to the medium-term adjustment. The best option remains comprehensive tax
reforms centered around introduction of a VAT, which would eliminate tax cascades,
conform with plans for trade liberalization, and improve compliance. Implementation will be
challenging given the decentralized fiscal system. However, viable alternatives are lacking:
absent a VAT, significantly larger expenditure cuts that would imperil core social spending
would be needed.
36.
As the public sector shrinks with falling assistance, structural reforms can
encourage private sector growth and employment. In this connection, the authorities’
strategy to facilitate business by creating a fertile business environment and avoiding
commercial activities is welcome. Priorities should include improvements to infrastructure
and to the legal frameworks for land use, foreign investment, and lending. Also, public
enterprise reforms could reduce crowding out of private firms, as well as yielding fiscal
savings. With regard to trade policy, the strategy of using PICTA as a stepping stone to
broader liberalization is appropriate.
37.
Economic monitoring and policy evaluation remain hampered by the limited
domestic capacity to produce economic statistics. Efforts to move compilation from
outside experts to local staff are welcome and should continue. Participation in the GDDS
would complement capacity enhancements and guide further improvements to statistics.
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
24 month cycle. The authorities expressed interest in a staff visit during 2005, possibly
focusing on tax reform.

ANNEX I

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA—LONG-TERM FISCAL ADJUSTMENT
Coming declines in external Compact assistance will necessitate both fiscal adjustment and structural
reforms if the FSM is to attain economic self-sufficiency. Illustrative calculations describe the possible
outturn under baseline, fiscal reform, and comprehensive fiscal and structural reform scenarios. The
results suggest that comprehensive reforms could foster both strong private-sector-led growth and a robust
fiscal position over the long run.
Basic assumptions
•

Compact grants and trust fund contributions will be disbursed as scheduled during FY 2004–23
(see the table), with adjustments for inflation as described in Box 1 (U.S. and FSM inflation are
assumed to be 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively). No other new assistance is made available.
Neither the trust fund nor the income from it are available to finance spending before FY2024.

•

Except in the baseline scenario, capital expenditure is raised over the near term in line with
Compact requirements to raise spending on infrastructure.

•

No additional borrowing takes place (borrowing has been for development purposes rather than to
finance deficits; no new loans are currently scheduled).

Baseline Scenario
Assumptions: Tax revenues are assumed to remain around the current level as a percentage of GDP, and
capital spending bears the brunt of fiscal adjustment to accommodate declining external assistance. With
capital spending insufficient to shore up the infrastructure, economic growth is about 1 percent.
Outcome: With the budget in balance, usable government assets remain low, leaving only a slim buffer to
absorb fiscal shocks such as the end of Compact grants in 2023. Returns on the trust fund plus other assets
would initially suffice to replace expiring Compact grants, but only for a few years, and the stock of assets
would decline relative to GDP over time. As in the other scenarios, usable government assets rise relative
to GDP in the long run because returns on assets exceed the growth rate of nominal GDP.
Fiscal Reform Scenario
Assumptions: On the revenue side, a VAT is introduced in FY2006, increasing revenues by 3 percent of
GDP. From 2007 onwards (including beyond 2023), further improvements to tax administration foster a
modest rise in taxes relative to GDP. On the expenditure side, wages are frozen up to FY2010, while
travel and other current expenditures are cut by 10 percent over FY2006–08 and then indexed to inflation.
Capital expenditure increases in line with Compact requirements through 2007 and grows by 4 percent
thereafter. Higher capital expenditure facilitates private-sector activity, raising GDP growth to around
1¾ percent.
Outcome: The fiscal balance initially rises steeply after the introduction of the VAT, then declines to
about 1 percent of GDP reflecting the fall in Compact funds. In the long run, returns on assets are too
small to replace expiring grants, as assets fall relative to GDP. Assets are lower relative to GDP than
under the baseline because GDP is higher.
Comprehensive Reform Scenario (Fiscal-Private Sector Development)
Assumptions: In addition to the above fiscal reforms, current expenditures other than wages are cut by a
further 5 percent over FY2006–08. Also, structural reforms are undertaken that raise private-sector growth

- 23 -

ANNEX I

to 6 percent—in line with the growth rate of Yap state during the first Compact period. Overall GDP
growth rises to 2¾ percent.
Outcome: Better fiscal performance permits both modestly increased capital expenditure and higher longrun surpluses. In the long run, assets stabilize relative to GDP and returns on the trust fund plus other
assets suffice to replace expiring grants. Assets are lower relative to GDP than under the baseline or fiscal
reform scenarios because GDP is higher.

ANNEX IV

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA—RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PFTAC)7
Since 1998, the Center’s assistance to the FSM has included 34 advisory missions, mostly in the area of
banking supervision and tax policy and administration. The FSM has also sent 13 officials to various
regional seminars and workshops organized by PFTAC.
Public Financial Management
A July 2001 mission assessed fiscal transparency against the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal
Transparency. A performance-oriented budget system has been introduced (partly to comply with
Compact reporting obligations), but some building blocks are missing. A mission is planned for
CY2004 to review progress and discuss further budget reforms.
Tax Administration and Policy
A Tax Reform Task Force has been established to review tax options, including recommendations of
a PFTAC report. Depending on the outcome of the Tax Force’s work, a mission will provide further
TA, including designing an action plan to assist implementation.
PFTAC also designed a Customs Modernization project in 2002, which resulted in a sharp drop in the
average time to clear goods, and also introduced electronic customs declarations (now more than
40 percent of the total); self-assessments; internationally accepted coding systems; a single
identification number for income tax and customs duties; the metric system and the CIF value for
customs forms; and standardized procedures for all four states. More training is proposed on risk
management, post-clearance audit and valuation.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
Since January 2001, a Fund peripatetic advisor has visited the FSM five times to provide technical
assistance, focusing mainly on on-site examination. Further missions over the next twelve months
will focus on off-site surveillance and prudential reporting. The Banking Commissioner has benefited
from Fund and PFTAC seminars and workshops.
Economic and Financial Statistics

A March 2003 mission reviewed an earlier development plan for economic statistics. It
recommended strengthening the statistics function and reducing reliance on external
consultants by recruiting four economic trainee statisticians, extending the resident external
adviser position for two years, and conducting a new Household Income and Expenditure
Survey. Participation in the GDDS was also encouraged. The number of qualified staff
increased in 2004, but other initiatives have yet to be implemented.

The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) joined the World Bank Group on June 24, 1993.
To date, no loans have been extended to the FSM. The main focus of the World Bank’s work
in the FSM has been regionally focused economic and sector work and country specific work
in the fisheries sector.
The Bank approved a grant of about $140,000 in 1995 through the Institutional Development
Fund to help improve the institutional capacity for coordinating fisheries development
policies across the four states and to improve the performance of fisheries parastatals,
including through privatization.
More recently, the World Bank has been collaborating with the AsDB, the Forum Fisheries
Agency, and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in estimating the economic importance
of fisheries to key Pacific Island countries, including the FSM. It presents new estimates of
the economic importance of fisheries in these countries that takes into account employment
values, volume and value of fish harvested (including commercial and subsistence fisheries),
export and import data, access fees, and levels of fish consumption. The study was published
by ADB as a joint publication with the World Bank in 2002.

THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Since becoming a member in 1990, the FSM has received substantial assistance from the
AsDB. As of August 2004, cumulative AsDB assistance to the FSM consisted of six loans
and a number of TA prospects.10 During the period 1997–99, the AsDB launched the Public
Sector Reform Program (PSRP), achieving important reductions in public sector payroll
costs and employment through the Early Retirement Program with significant budgetary
savings.
The AsDB continues to support the FSM with three pillars of the country strategy: (i) good
governance, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) pro-poor economic growth. In
addition, the AsDB’s country strategy for 2005–06 will emphasize further the underlying
themes; (i) promoting wider participation of civil society to development processes of the
country, (ii) addressing hardship (poverty) issues more explicitly, and (iii) providing
assistance with a long-term perspective, with a view to increase the effectiveness of its
assistance.
Currently, three loans are active: one focused on basic social services, and two on the
development of the private sector. The AsDB approved a Private Sector Development
Program (PSDP) at the end of 2001, with two loans totaling $13.0 million. The PSDP aims at
promoting small and medium sized businesses, enhancing the regulatory and policy
framework, and improving factor markets. Measures are also planned to mitigate any adverse
social impact of these adjustment polices. A new loan project for infrastructure development
in power, water supply and waste water sectors is being processed with anticipation of AsDB
approval in 2004.
The AsDB has been assisting the FSM to improve public sector efficiency and effectiveness
since 1995 through TA in economic management and capacity building. The AsDB
continues to support the government in increasing its institutional capacity in public sector
management, administration and auditing through TA activities.

ANNEX VII

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
The Office of Planning and Statistics is responsible for the compilation of national statistics,
and the first Statistical Yearbook was published in July 1999. There have been a number of
improvements in data compilation, reflecting substantial assistance provided by the AsDBfinanced Economic Management Policy Advisory Team (EMPAT) and PFTAC. However,
major weaknesses remain, particularly in the area of national accounts.
Real Sector
The last official GDP estimate is for FY1996. No unemployment or aggregate production
indicators are available. Recent GDP estimates are calculated by EMPAT from tax and social
security data. The authorities have published a quarterly consumer price index for the nation
as a whole and each state.
Government Finance
The national and the state governments and public sector enterprises publish annual audit
reports detailing their fiscal operations, and are now available in GFS format. However, long
publication lags exist. Further improvements in the quality of the fiscal data are dependent on
greater cooperation between the national and state governments through timely and accurate
reporting of data to the Division of Statistics in the FSM Department of Economic Affairs.
Monetary Accounts
An IFS country page was established in 2000. The Banking Commissioner sends updated
data to STA on a monthly basis, with some need for improvement in timeliness. The reported
data comprise interest rates, the accounts of the monetary authorities, commercial banks and
the FSM Development Bank.
Balance of Payments
The authorities provide annual estimates of the balance of payments and external debt
statistics.

ANNEX
VII 3/2/05

Statement by Michael Reddell, Alternate Executive Director
for the Federated States of Micronesia
and Evelyn Adolph, Advisor to Executive Director
February 25, 2005
Key Points
•

The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is heavily dependent on a declining level
of grant assistance.

•

Substantial progress has been made in recent years to reduce the share of government
expenditure in the economy, through wage restraints and cuts in subsidies.

•

Substantial further adjustment will be required over the coming decades and the
authorities recognize that tax reform, and higher overall domestic revenues, will have
to be an integral part of that adjustment.

•

Development partners, and agencies such as the Fund, have a significant role to play
in helping provide the technical support for reform and in identifying the key
effective barriers to securing a strongly-growing self-sustaining private sector in an
isolated and very small economy.

Facing the substantial challenge of adjusting to the amended compact, the President and his
administration welcomed the Article IV consultation’s timely contribution to the active
policy dialogue taking place in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Staff’s advice has,
in many cases, helpfully served to reinforce the importance and urgency of many of the
efforts they are currently pursuing. The staff team put considerable effort into understanding
the country’s particular economic developments and challenges and their work was
appreciated.
Economic Developments and Challenges
The FSM economy remains heavily dependent on financial assistance under the Compact
arrangements with the United States (with compact grants currently equivalent to a third of
GDP). However, this assistance has been declining, and will continue to fall in the years
ahead, and changes in compact assistance levels have been quickly mirrored in short-term
fluctuations in the rate of GDP growth (the economy saw the sharpest declines in the two
years of compact funding step-down, first in 1997, and again last year reversing the trend of
positive economic growth since 2000).
The scale of adjustment already achieved, however, has been impressive. Since 1999,
current government expenditure as a share of GDP has fallen by 13 percentage points (from
65 percent to 52 percent). The authorities have shown an impressive, and sustained, degree
of fiscal discipline in bringing about this adjustment. Nominal wages in the public sector
have been frozen since 1997, and subsidies to public enterprises, once a very large
proportion of public spending, have been cut further from 4.3 percent of GDP in 1999 to 1.3
percent now (most of the operational public enterprises are now generating sufficient revenue

-2to cover costs). These are substantial adjustments by any standards and the authorities
deserve considerable credit for what has already been achieved. It is also encouraging that,
as public sector employment has fallen, employment opportunities in the private sector have
steadily increased, and the number of private sector employees now exceeds those in the
public sector.
With a typhoon and delays in Compact-funded capital expenditure exacerbating the decline
in output, 2004 was a challenging year for the authorities. The fiscal position is set to
improve significantly in the 2005 budget as compact infrastructure grants resume and
expenditure restraint is maintained. The overall fiscal balance is projected to be only 2.1
percent of GDP this year and, if anything, increasing capital expenditure suggests that there
could be an upside risk to staff’s rather cautious growth projections for 2005. As staff note,
the government’s usable reserves fell sharply last year from 21½ percent to 8¼ percent of
GDP, but it is important to stress that the bulk of this fall represented FSM’s investment in its
own future, in the form of the $30 million contribution to the trust fund that is established
under the Compact. Moreover, debt remains low, with 50 percent of it on concessional
terms.
Policies under the amended compact
The amended Compact agreement with the United States reflects the shared objectives for
the FSM economy: macroeconomic stability, sustainable growth, and ultimate self-reliance.
To achieve these objectives, the amended compact incorporates the following features:
•

declining annual grants;

•

sectoral grant allocations with emphasis on health, education, and infrastructure;

•

trust fund contributions; and

•

enhanced accountability and monitoring1.

Dealing with the far-reaching fiscal, political, and economic implications of the amended
compact has been the biggest issue confronting the government for the last few years, and
will remain so in the years ahead.
Looking ahead, the authorities agree that a comprehensive set of fiscal and structural reforms
will be needed to promote medium-term fiscal and economic sustainability. Building on the
substantial adjustment already achieved since the mid-1990s, these are important medium1

The requirements for greater oversight and accountability under the amended compact
should facilitate improved financial management and reporting by all levels of government to
facilitate greater transparency. For instance, whereas completion of the audited government
accounts faced substantial delays in the past—FY2002 audited government accounts were
completed in November 2004—the amended Compact requires submission of the audited
government accounts by end-third quarter of the following fiscal year.

-3term challenges, and meeting them will require strong political leadership, continued efforts
to build a consensus for reform, and ongoing support from FSM’s international partners.
The road ahead will be difficult in places and many of the necessary changes are likely to
occur only slowly. But progress in meeting the new challenges continues to be made. The 3rd
FSM Economic Summit held last year was instrumental in building public awareness on the
alternatives facing the country, illustrated by the three scenarios presented in the selected
issues paper. The summit endorsed pursuing the third scenario of comprehensive fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms. Reflecting the priorities that came out of the summit,
the FSM Strategic Development Plan (SDP) was then drawn up providing an overall
framework to guide the use of government resources, including compact grants2.
The annual reduction in the operating grant featured in the compact is designed to ensure that
a gradual shift away from compact grant to greater reliance on domestic revenue takes place.
This will inevitably require on-going fiscal adjustments over the life of the amended
compact. The authorities agree that, in the shorter-term, the expenditure side will have to
bear the brunt of the fiscal adjustment (although would put less emphasis than staff on the
need for “immediate cuts in the wage bill and other current expenditures”). However, given
the magnitude of the adjustment over time, and the substantial adjustments already achieved
in recent years, expenditure cutting will not be able to meet the medium- to long-term fiscal
adjustment needs without severely compromising the government’s ability to provide
essential services. Also, as staff note, tax revenue remains low as a share of GDP by
regional standards, although it is augmented by significant fishing access revenues which
raise total domestic revenue to around 19 percent of GDP at present.
It is therefore widely accepted that in the medium-term revenue increases will be relied upon
to meet some of the adjustment needs. Indeed, the action by congress in December 2004 to
increase the rates on certain “sin taxes”, reflect a growing awareness in FSM that revenue
increases must be part of the adjustment effort. For the longer-term, the government has for
some time been considering a comprehensive tax reform program, two main features of
which, are the value-added-tax and improvements in tax and customs administration. Good
progress has been made recently in improving the customs and tax administration, including
the introduction of the an automated customs clearance system to modernize customs
procedures, self-assessment has been introduced, and international codes and classifications
have been put in place. The authorities have opted for a cautious approach to the VAT, and
are somewhat constrained by the constitutional (and resulting practical) constraints outlined
in the staff report. To reinvigorate the momentum on tax reform, a high-level task force on
tax reform was officially established last month by a Presidential Order. To ensure
consensus, the task force decided that it will now take a step back and consider all possible
alternatives for reforming the tax system with the view to selecting one that is most suited for
FSM’s unique circumstances. It has invited PFTAC to give a presentation on the VAT in the
next task force meeting scheduled for the coming month.

2

Completion of the SDP is a requirement under the amended Compact.

-4The first round of fiscal consolidation, in preparation for the second compact funding stepdown in 1997, had noticeable adverse economic impacts. The country saw a sharp rise in
migration to the US in the period immediately following the government’s implementation of
its PRSP, which focused on retrenchment of government workers. That experience
underscores to the authorities that any further fiscal consolidation in preparation for reduced
compact assistance must be complemented by a more aggressive private sector development
program. Against this background, the authorities are attaching more importance to pursuing
private sector development.
To support private sector development, discussions on the allocation of annual compact
sectoral grants has resulted in agreement to protect the infrastructure sector grant to a
minimum of 30 percent of annual compact grants. To build on earlier progress to improve the
investment environment, the authorities are now implementing an ADB-funded Private
Sector Development (PSD) project/program loan. Under the on-going PSD project, progress
has been made in improving the capacity and management of land administration offices in
the state governments. Consistent with one of the policy conditions, the nation’s first
bankruptcy law was passed by the FSM congress last month. Further work in strengthening
the legal and regulatory framework is expected under the program. My authorities are
committed to taking the measures needed to ensure the success of this programme. More
generally, they welcome sustained engagement with development partners and agencies, such
as the Fund where the real pressure points might be that hold back the development of a truly
self-sustaining private sector in a small isolated multi-island economy.
Improving the pace of reform implementation
Staff described in some detail the loose federation of government in the FSM, which has
been one of the key factors in slowing down the pace of reform implementation. Indeed,
while some countries are struggling to enhance the participatory nature of their decision
making process, in the FSM the highly participatory nature of decision making is
complicating the authorities’ task of adjusting to the amended compact. Unfortunately, in the
FSM there is no way around a time-consuming and resource-demanding process.
The reform process is now at a critical stage where agreement has been reached on the
overall objectives. What is needed now is endorsement and implementation of specific
measures (such as the VAT, further expenditure streamlining, and structural reforms) to
effect the agreed objectives. To help political leaders sell the case for change, it is important
that the authorities have available high level technical support, in their administration and
from outside advisers. Consistently articulating the links between specific reform measures,
such as the VAT and the longer-term objectives that the government has already agreed to, is
vital to help move the reform and adjustment process forward. The government currently
relies on technical assistance from the outside, including ADB and PFTAC advisors, to
provide this critical support; and while extremely useful, occasional visits are not enough to
meet demanding requirements of securing support for these important measures and seeing
them through to implementation.
Against this background, interest has been expressed in staff’s offer of an interim visit, in the
off-year of the biennial surveillance cycle. This is an important initiative by APD, and in

-5FSM’s case, such a visit, focused on tax reform issues, could help to strengthen the President
and his administration in building consensus for change.
Conclusion
As we noted at the outset, our authorities appreciated the contribution this Article IV round
has made. Nonetheless, as we have pointed out previously, the effectiveness of Article IV
missions can benefit greatly from more continuity in the composition of missions, especially
when full staff reports are done only every two years. We would also encourage future
Article IV missions to FSM dedicate more time to outreach. Outreach is especially needed
in the context of the decentralized decision making-process that exists in FSM.
In a decentralized system, with limited technical capacity, and a history of generous aid
support, the progress of reform and adjustment is always likely to be slower than suggested
by some abstract ideal. But material progress has been made in adjusting to the changing
environment, and moving towards greater self-reliance, and my authorities are committed to
confronting the challenges ahead. They continue to appreciate the support of all of their
international partners, bilateral and multilateral alike. They continue to value the bi-ennial
Article IV consultations and reiterate their interest in an interim staff visit. They have also
indicated their consent to the publication of the staff report.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the
Federated States of Micronesia
On February 25, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Federated States of Micronesia.1
Background
Economic developments in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) remain dominated by
external assistance, particularly sizable U.S. grants under the Compact of Free Association.
In FY2004 (ending September 30), a fall in Compact grants, along with a typhoon, precipitated
a contraction in real output. Employment has been stagnant this year, and the public sector
continues to account for half of formal employment. Wage growth has been modest, with a
persistent wide differential between public and private pay. Inflation remained low despite
higher oil prices.
The fiscal position swung sharply to deficit in FY2004, due to both a scheduled drop in
Compact grants and delays in disbursements. With softening economic activity, domestic
revenues continued to fall relative to GDP. Reflecting a loose federal system, the states’
budgetary performances varied, with Chuuk state accumulating arrears. The fiscal deficit
contributed to a decline in usable government financial assets to 8¼ percent of GDP.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The external position also worsened, as the trade deficit widened due to rising oil prices as
well as the typhoon’s effects on agricultural exports. External debt has remained low, and debt
service is around 6 percent of exports. With the U.S. dollar the official currency, the real
exchange rate has depreciated modestly in recent years.
Domestic credit continued to shrink in FY2004. While the FSM’s two commercial banks are
sound, they mainly channel deposits overseas, rather than lending domestically. As a result,
the loan/deposit ratio has reached record lows. This situation reflected continued uncertainty
about economic prospects and shortcomings in the legal framework for lending, both of which
continue to restrain private sector development.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed signs that the economy is recovering from the effects of the recent
reduction in grants under the Compact of Free Association with the United States, and that
inflation remains low. Directors noted with concern, however, that employment has been
stagnant, the external and fiscal positions have recently worsened, and domestic credit has
been contracting. Against this backdrop, limited private sector job opportunities have fostered
steady emigration, undercutting the development of human capital within the country. Directors
recognized that the Federated States of Micronesia’s geographic remoteness and small size
pose challenges to economic development. At the same time, they were of the view that
following a prudent fiscal policy aimed at reducing reliance on grant assistance, combined with
the implementation of structural reforms to foster private sector development and raise
employment, would be the most effective way of confronting those challenges.
Directors observed that growth is likely to be sluggish over the medium term without fiscal and
structural adjustments to promote stability and growth. Given the coming further reductions in
Compact funding, the costs of the large government sector will be increasingly unsustainable,
and the fiscal situation will deteriorate further. Directors therefore urged the authorities to make
every effort to promote medium-term economic and fiscal sustainability and to build the
needed political consensus for adjustment through greater outreach efforts.
Directors welcomed efforts by the authorities to restrain spending through a continued wage
freeze and other means, but further efforts are needed to reduce the fiscal deficit, including
cuts in the still-high wage bill and in other current expenditures. Directors stressed the need to
deal with the unfunded liability of the social security system, including through cutbacks in
benefits, if necessary. Comprehensive and timely reforms of the public enterprises could yield
budgetary savings and improve prospects for private businesses. Directors encouraged the
authorities to further strengthen budgetary management to meet the Compact’s accountability
and oversight requirements.
Directors emphasized the need to protect core expenditures on health, education, and
infrastructure to underpin growth. Given the difficulties of making further spending cuts beyond
those envisaged in other areas, and in light of fiscal adjustments previously undertaken by the
authorities, the primary focus must be on raising revenues. In particular, greater efforts are
needed to boost tax revenues, including through improvements in tax administration. Directors

-3encouraged the authorities to move expeditiously in the context of the Task Force on Tax
Reform to design and implement a comprehensive tax reform strategy. Some Directors saw a
Value Added Tax as the best option for tax reform, especially if related constitutional issues
can be resolved, but noted that it will need to be carefully designed and well-coordinated
among the states.
A few Directors expressed concern about the passage of tax haven legislation by the
Congress, which they viewed as harmful for the transparency of the tax system. They urged
the authorities to work closely with relevant international groups to ensure that the tax haven
scheme is not subject to abuse.
Directors stressed that structural reforms are needed to encourage private sector development
and employment. In that connection, they broadly endorsed the authorities’ priorities of
enhancing infrastructure, easing restrictions on the use of land, and streamlining the foreign
investment regime. They urged that measures to reach these objectives be accelerated.
The authorities should also move ahead to develop the tourism, fisheries, and agriculture
sectors, which could also help to improve the external imbalance. Directors considered
appropriate the authorities’ pursuit of regional trade liberalization as a prelude to broader
liberalization.
Directors noted that domestic lending continues to decline, notwithstanding the banks’ strong
capital and liquidity positions. Enhancements to the domestic lending environment can help
the private banking system to better support the domestic economy. In this connection, the
Development Bank should avoid competing with commercial banks, and the budgetary impact
of its operations should be limited. Directors commended the authorities for strengthening their
effort to prevent money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism by establishing a
financial intelligence unit.
Directors called on the authorities to strengthen economic statistics to improve their usefulness
for economic monitoring and policy analysis. Domestic statistics-gathering capacity in
particular needs to be enhanced. They encouraged the authorities to participate in the General
Data Dissemination System.
