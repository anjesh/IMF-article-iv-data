STAFF REPORT ON THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, THE THIRD

REVIEW UNDER THE STANDBY CREDIT FACILTY ARRANGEMENT,
REQUEST FOR A WAIVER FOR NONOBSERVANCE OF A PERFORMANCE
CRITERION, AND FINANCING ASSURANCES REVIEW

KEY ISSUES
Background, outlook, and risks. Economic growth is projected to remain strong at 7 percent
next year and in the medium term. Inflation is at 6 percent, gradually converging to the
authorities’ 5 percent medium term objective. The external current account deficit remains
among the largest in the region, at 14 percent of GDP this year. Fiscal revenue shortfalls and
overruns in domestically-financed spending led the deficit to rise to 6.8 percent of GDP in
2012/13. Revenue shortfalls in 2013/14 compared to the budget approved by parliament have
prompted the authorities to undertake expenditure cuts during the fiscal year in an effort to
meet their 5 percent of GDP target. Based on the debt sustainability analysis, Tanzania remains
at low risk of debt distress. A major upside risk for the long term, not yet incorporated in the
baseline projections, relates to sizable finds of offshore natural gas that, if confirmed as
commercially viable, could bring in large revenues during the next decade.
Program implementation. All performance criteria under the program were met, except a
sizable breach of the performance criterion on net domestic financing at end-June 2013. The
structural benchmark on submission to parliament of the VAT reform for November 2013 was
missed. The authorities have taken corrective measures.
Macroeconomic and structural policies. Preparations for the draft 2014/15 budget are under
way. A VAT reform aimed at improving efficiency and reducing exemptions is ready for
submission to parliament prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year. A priority in the next
few years is to establish the institutional and policy framework to ensure that, if natural gas
revenues materialize, they will bring benefits to all Tanzanians.
Staff recommends completion of the third (and final) review under the SCF arrangement and
approval of the authorities’ requests for a waiver for nonobservance of a performance criterion
and for completion of the financing assurances review.

CONTEXT
1. Prudent policies and macroeconomic stabilization have underpinned the strength and
resilience of Tanzania’s economic performance over the past decade. Despite the global
financial crisis of 2008-09, the food and fuel price shocks of 2007–08 and 2011–12, and the
energy crisis of 2011, real GDP growth has proved resilient, averaging 7 percent over the past
decade. The poverty headcount in mainland Tanzania declined from 33.6 percent of the
population in 2007 to 28.2 percent in 2011/12, but remained relatively high in rural areas, where
job creation was insufficient to absorb a young and growing labor force.1 Macroeconomic
performance under the three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI, July 2010–June 2013) and the
Standby Credit Facility (SCF, July 2012–April 2014) has been broadly satisfactory. Box 1 presents a
summary of Tanzania’s policy response to the key recommendations in the 2011 Article IV
consultation.
2. During the next few years, policymakers will need to manage and meet expectations
stemming from three main sources, while preserving fiscal and debt sustainability:
a. Public investment in infrastructure is seen as key to strengthening competitiveness
and removing growth bottlenecks. The authorities’ “Big Results Now” (BRN) initiative
envisages ambitious infrastructure investment that, after further prioritization, needs to be
fully integrated into the budget process, while safeguarding critical social expenditures.
b. Over the next decade, Tanzania has good prospects of becoming a major producer
and exporter of natural gas. This is beginning to generate expectations that greater
spending is warranted by likely future revenues. However, a final decision on whether to
develop a large-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) project using offshore gas resources may
not be made by the natural gas companies until 2016, with production to begin no earlier
than 2020. Beyond keeping expectations in check until such uncertainty is resolved,
decisions made in the next few years on the contracts and the framework for the
management of natural resources revenues will have long-term implications for whether
the ensuing benefits will accrue to all citizens.
c.

Political factors may engender additional spending pressures. Uncertainties stem from
the ongoing review of the constitution, including the relationship between mainland
Tanzania and Zanzibar, which might have significant economic and fiscal implications.
General elections will be held in October 2015, when President Kikwete’s second and last
term in office expires. Against this background, undertaking reforms will likely require even
greater resolve.

In the 2011/12 Household Budget Survey, poverty was estimated at 33.6 percent in rural areas, 4.2 percent in
Dar es Salaam, and 21.7 percent in other urban areas. The results of the 2007 and 2011/12 surveys are not fully
comparable, owing to methodological changes.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3. The broad-based nature of economic growth has contributed to its resilience. Growth
has been driven by services, construction and low-technology manufacturing (Figure 1); laborintensive agriculture has lagged resulting in a persistently high unemployment and
underemployment. In 2011 real growth declined to 6.4 percent partly because of significant
power shortages caused by a slump in hydro generation. As the authorities quickly restored
power supply by procuring thermal generation capacity from the private sector, growth
recovered in 2012 and has remained at about 7 percent since then.
4. Tanzania has experienced significant economic transformation since the 1990s. The
share of agriculture in output declined from 32 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in 2012, giving way
to higher value-added manufacturing and services. The decline in the share of agriculture in nongold exports of goods and services was even more marked, from 49 percent to 13 percent over
the same period. This diversification of the economy was facilitated by subsequent waves of
reforms from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s aimed at reducing the role of the state in the
economy, market liberalization, and policy modernization (Annex I). The pace of reforms,
however, seems to have abated in recent years.
5. Inflation has returned to the mid-single digits. With the reversal of the 2011 surge in
global food and fuel prices, headline inflation fell steadily from its peak of 20 percent in
December 2011 to 5.6 percent in December 2013 (Figure 2). In January and February 2014,
headline inflation picked up slightly to about 6 percent, in part reflecting a direct one-off impact
of the near 40 percent average increase in power tariffs starting January 1 (see ¶13). Going
forward, supply-side risks to inflation seem to be limited, in view of a strong harvest and stable
global oil prices; the monetary stance is projected to contain demand pressures.
6. A deliberate slowdown in the key monetary aggregates has contributed to gradual
disinflation. Consistent with a tightening of reserve money targets, both broad money (M3) and
private sector credit growth declined from more than 20 percent in 2010 and 2011 to 10 and
15 percent, respectively, by end-2013. Interbank, Treasury bill, and other key interest rates have
not displayed clear trends (or provided clear guidance) in nominal terms over the past year or so,
but they have risen substantially in real terms as inflation has declined. The disinflation has also
benefitted from the broad stability of the nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, which
hovered within a narrow range during 2012 and depreciated by 3 percent between January 2013
and February 2014.

7. The current account deficit has been among the largest in the region for several years.
It widened from about 9 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and 2010/11 to 18 percent of GDP in
2011/12, owing to a significant surge in FDI, higher fuel prices, and one-off imports of thermal
power generation equipment to offset the drought-induced drop in hydro power capacity. 2 In
2012/13, the current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 14 percent of GDP as these
shocks waned and weaker gold export

8. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 33 percent as of January 2014
from August 2011, when it reached its lowest level since 2000. The appreciation stemmed
from a positive inflation differential relative
130
to trade partner countries. The central

The authorities’ efforts to more fully capture repatriated profits by FDI companies in the income balance
resulted in upward revisions to the current account deficits in 2011/12 and 2012/13, by 2 percent of GDP and
0.5 percent of GDP respectively.

Box 1. Response to the 2011 Article IV Consultation’s Key Recommendations
Mobilize domestic resources. Tax revenues as a share of GDP are projected at 16.2 percent in
2013/14 compared with 15.2 percent in 2010/11, continuing an upward trend experienced for the
past few years. The increase has stemmed primarily from strong growth, improved compliance, and
tax measures in the 2013/14 budget. Going forward, reductions in tax exemptions are expected via
the upcoming VAT reform.
Reduce overall expenditure while safeguarding priority spending. The budget deficit was lower
than programmed in 2011/12, but expenditure overruns led to a higher-than-programmed deficit
and a breach of the net domestic financing performance criterion at end-June 2013. Expenditure
pressures also pose a risk for executing the 2013/14 budget. Priority spending has been preserved.
Improve public financial management. Domestic arrears have been a recurring issue. Stricter
enforcement of spending commitment controls and better tracking of multi-year contractual
obligations would be warranted.
Enhance prioritization of public investment. The “Big Results Now” initiative has identified key
strategic priorities. Further prioritization will be needed as this initiative is integrated into the budget
process.
Strengthen debt management processes. The debt management office is not yet operational. The
Ministry of Finance published an updated Medium Term Debt Management Strategy in November
2013 (available at www.mof.go.tz).
In monetary policy, be vigilant to the impact of rising food and energy prices. Following the
2011 Article IV Consultation, a major shock materialized, leading to higher inflation in the region.
Monetary policy tightening and the unwinding of the shock have led to a gradual decline in inflation;
the authorities’ medium term target of 5 percent is within reach.
Follow up on the 2010 FSAP Update recommendations. See Section C.

9. Fiscal pressures re-emerged in 2012/13 and 2013/14, leading to program slippages.
Data yet to be finalized indicate that the deficit (measured from the financing side) in 2012/13
amounted to 6.8 percent of GDP compared to the 5.5 percent envisaged under the program.3
Domestic revenues turned out below expectations, by 0.7 percent of GDP, mostly owing to
underperforming VAT. Domestically financed spending was 0.4 percent of GDP higher than
envisaged under the program. As a result, the performance criterion on net domestic financing
was breached by 1.2 percent of GDP. Meanwhile total public debt rose to 40.8 percent of GDP at
end-June 2013.
10.
Optimistic revenue projections are posing challenges in the execution of the
FY2013/14 budget. The budget approved by Parliament for 2013/14 envisages a 5 percent of
GDP deficit, but assumes revenues (and expenditures) that are 1 percent of GDP higher than
indicated in the May 2013 staff report (IMF Country Report No. 13/166). Updated projections
3

The deficit target had been revised to 5.8 percent of GDP to permit a transfer to TANESCO, which was facilitated
by an IDA budget support operation (First Power and Gas Sector DPO). While the World Bank disbursed the
funds before the end of FY2012/13, the transfer to TANESCO occurred in early FY2013/14.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

suggest a likely shortfall in total revenues by 2 percent of GDP compared with the budget, partly
because of delays in introducing new taxes on SIM cards and bank transfers, lower gold prices,
and weaker revenue buoyancy than previously assumed. Parliament in December replaced the
SIM card tax with a further increase in excise duty on airtime by 2.5 percent. To achieve the
original deficit target in the wake of revenue shortfalls, the authorities restricted spending for
“other charges” in August, October and November, and introduced deeper spending cuts in the
context of the mid-year budget review undertaken in mid-March.
11.
Weaknesses in public financial management undermine the quality and timeliness
of fiscal data available to policymakers. The three main problems are: (i) recurrence of large
domestic unpaid claims (with duration above 90 days); these increased to 1.6 percent of GDP at
end-December 2013 from 0.5 percent of GDP in June 2012; (ii) growing expenditure “floats”
(estimated at 6 percent of domestically financed spending or 1.3 percent of GDP in 2012/13);4
and considerable delay in coming close to reconciling the discrepancies between “above the line”
deficit figures and the financing data. These issues point to weaknesses in budget formulation,
execution and monitoring, including difficulties in aligning expenditures with available financing
resources during the year.
12.
Additional firm and contingent obligations have built up in the pension system.
Firm obligations relate to the benefits of participants in the non contributory, pre-1999-reform
system (Box 2). Contingent obligations stem from loans provided by several pension funds to
finance activities by government entities, a practice that presents fiscal transparency challenges.
13.
Significant progress was achieved in addressing financial difficulties of the energy
sector. The independent energy regulator, EWURA, announced an electricity tariff increase by
about 40 percent (on average) effective January 1, 2014. Analytical work done by the World Bank
suggests that this is a significant step toward restoring the financial viability of TANESCO (the
national power utility), and will substantially strengthen the company’s financial situation in 2014.
To cover the losses for the current fiscal year and to clear the stock of the past arrears, TANESCO
borrowed an amount equivalent to US$250 million commercially (with a sizable government
guarantee) and received a direct budget transfer of about US$220 million (which was facilitated
by budget financing from the World Bank and African Development Bank). TANESCO is also
undertaking measures to improve collections and recovery of arrears and to minimize losses due
to power theft. TANESCO’s financial situation is expected to further improve in 2015, with
completion of a new natural gas pipeline and gas-fueled power plants leading to a decline in
power generation costs. Realizing the benefits of the increased pipeline capacity will also require
that the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation and the investors in the existing gas
fields come to a final agreement on new gas supply contracts.

The expenditure “float” measures payment orders that were issued in a given fiscal year, but were drawn from
the banking system in the following fiscal year.

Box 2. Fiscal Obligations Stemming from the Pension System
Prior to July 1999, the pension scheme for civil servants was non-contributory and pension benefits
were all paid from the budget. The system was transformed to a contributory Public Service Pension
Fund (PSPF) in July 1999. During a five- year transition period (July 1999–June 2004), the budget
paid all pension benefits. Although the government was expected to cover benefits associated with
the pre-July 1999 scheme beyond the transition period, the PSPF has been paying retirees on behalf
of the Government. Based on World Bank estimates, by December 2012, the government owed TSh
1.2 trillion (about 2 percent of GDP) to the PSPF. A 2010 actuarial valuation estimates the full pre1999 public sector liabilities at TSh 4 trillion (about 7 percent of GDP). In addition, the financial
position of the PSPF is fragile, in part reflecting delayed reimbursements from the government.
Ultimately, the central government is responsible for the pension obligations to civil servants.
Further, the actuarial deficit arising from the broader pension sector, including several other public
and private sector pensions also gives rise to substantial contingent liabilities.

14.
Credit to the private sector continues to expand in an environment of financial
system stability. The rate of growth of credit to the private sector in nominal terms has declined
compared with its peak in 2010, but remains strong at 15.3 percent y-o-y through December
2013, broadly in line with nominal GDP growth. Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP
stood at 17.6 percent in 2013, having almost converged to the median share for a group of
comparator countries selected on the basis of level of development and other characteristics (see
chart below). Strong credit growth has not come at the expense of financial stability. In its March
2013 Financial Stability Report, the BoT concluded that the banking system remains well
capitalized: the ratio of capital to total risk-weighted assets was 18.2 percent in December 2013
(December 2012: 17.5 percent; statutory minimum: 10 percent). Risks are receding: nonperforming loans declined to 6.5 percent of total loans in December 2013 from 8.1 percent the
previous year, though this remains above the regulators’ comfort level of 5 percent. To further
mitigate risks, the BoT has increased the number of supervisors, enhanced banks’ framework for
financial reporting, and implemented more updated stress-testing methodologies.
15.
Performance under the SCF arrangement has been mixed. All of the end-June
quantitative performance criteria were met except for the ceiling on net domestic financing,
breached by 1.2 percent of GDP. The indicative target on tax revenue collection was missed by
0.4 percent of GDP in June and September and by 0.8 percent of GDP in December. The endDecember indicative target on reserve money was missed by a small margin (0.1 percent of GDP).
The structural benchmark on the submission of the VAT reform bill to Parliament was further
delayed from end-November to May 2014, to allow broader consultation with stakeholders. At
the request of the authorities, the program was extended to April 30, 2014 (from its original
expiration date of January 5, 2014). This allowed them sufficient time to implement measures
envisaged under the program for completion of the third SCF review. The authorities are
requesting a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion on NDF at end-June
2013 on the basis that they have: (i) instituted revisions to the 2013/14 budget in the context of
the mid-year budget review, including downward adjustments to the revenue projections and
expenditure cuts of almost 2 percent of GDP to goods and services compared to the initial

2013/14 budget; (ii) obtained Cabinet approval for the main features of a reform to the VAT
reform, which the government plans to submit to Parliament in May 2014; and (iii) as noted in
¶13, implemented increases in electricity tariffs on January 1, 2014 to improve the financial
position of TANESCO and to reduce the need for the budget subsidies. The NDF target was met
at end-December 2013.

Statistical estimate of the expected median value of credit to the private sector as a share of GDP generated by
the FinStats tool created by the World Bank. The tool selects a peer group based on the level of economic
development, population, demographic characteristics, the global cycle and other special characteristics (e.g.,
whether the country is an oil exporter or an offshore financial center) and provides the median values of each
indicator for the peer group.

Sources: Tanzania authorities, World Bank, IMF staff estimates.

16.
The macroeconomic outlook remains favorable. Economic growth is projected at
about 7 percent in the medium term. Absent major external price shocks, inflation is expected to
reach the authorities’ 5 percent target by mid-2014 provided that the BoT maintains its prudent
monetary policy stance. Under the baseline assumption that the construction of a natural gas
pipeline and gas-fired power plants is completed in 2014/15, the availability of cheaper energy
would have a beneficial impact on economic growth and the current account. Nevertheless, with
continued strong domestic demand and sizable foreign direct investment, the current account
deficit is projected above 10 percent of GDP in the medium term.
17.
The economy faces several risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Table 6). Possible shocks
to food and fuel prices would further weaken the current account, exert pressure on consumer
prices and may necessitate additional social outlays. A sharp slowdown in China, on the other
hand, would reduce prospective FDI and credit flows to Tanzania undermining key infrastructure
investments and thereby future growth. This said, the most significant sources of risk relate to
domestic policy implementation and include: potential fiscal slippages because of the
intensification of pre-election spending; delays in the construction of the gas pipeline and the
power plants; and the fiscal risks described below (see Box 4 in particular).

18.
The long-term outlook will be influenced by the business climate and its impact on
investment. There seems to be considerable room for improvement through structural and
institutional reforms. In the 2013 survey of the World Bank Group’s ‘Doing Business’ indicators,
Tanzania ranks 134 out of 185 countries (for the average across all indicators) and lags behind
several of its peers in the region (including Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda). In particular, speeding
up the resolution of commercial disputes and rendering tax policy more predictable are
perceived as priorities by several entrepreneurs and financial market participants. In response,
the authorities have set up a “BRN laboratory” focused on improving the business climate.
19.
East African Community (EAC) integration is progressing, although significant
challenges remain.5 On November 30, 2013, the Heads of States of all five EAC countries signed
a joint protocol outlining the process toward EAC Monetary Union, with the introduction of the
common currency envisaged for 2024. Convergence criteria were agreed for inflation, foreign
exchange reserves, and fiscal variables (Box 3). Implementation of the protocols for customs
union (signed in 2005) and the common market (2010), including the elimination of remaining
non-trade barriers, is crucial to reap the full benefits of monetary union.
Box 3. Macroeconomic Convergence Criteria under the EAC Monetary Union Protocol
The EAC single currency is expected to be introduced by 2024 by member states that comply with
four primary convergence criteria, complemented by three non-binding, indicative convergence
criteria that will serve as early warning indicators:
Primary convergence criteria
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

ceiling on headline inflation of 8 percent
fiscal deficit (including grants) ceiling of 3 percent of GDP
ceiling on gross public debt of 50 percent of GDP in NPV terms
reserve cover of 4.5 months of imports

Indicative criteria:
(i)
(ii)

(iii)

core inflation ceiling of 5 percent
fiscal deficit (excluding grants) ceiling of 6 percent of GDP
tax- to-GDP ratio of 25 percent

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
20.
The discussions focused on informing a macroeconomic policy framework for the
next few years. The analysis of macroeconomic economic developments and of policies
undertaken in the context of the Fund-supported program was aimed at shaping a set of policies
whereby the authorities would continue to aim at fostering growth while maintaining
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
The stance of monetary policy is consistent with the authorities’ objective to keep
inflation at around 5 percent in the medium term. The authorities indicated that they would
aim at entrenching actual and expected inflation at their medium-term objective. To that end, the
authorities envisage reserve money growth around that of nominal GDP. This, in turn, is
projected to result in a moderate increase in broad money (M3), given the expectation that
financial development and inclusion would be mirrored in a gradual reduction in the velocity of
M3. At the same time, they saw financial deepening, with greater availability of credit to the
private sector, as an important factor to support economic growth (see section C below).
22.
The BoT intends to gradually modernize its monetary policy framework. Although
the authorities believe that the existing reserve money targeting framework has served the
country well, they are contemplating a gradual transition to a more forward-looking monetary
policy with more flexible operational targets and greater reliance on interest rates. The
authorities consider that an interest rate-based monetary framework may be better aligned with
a deeper financial system with greater private sector involvement, and may convey the stance of
monetary policy more clearly. The BoT is reviewing the functioning of key financial markets,
including the interbank market, and exploring ways to strengthen the transmission mechanism
from policy interest rates to the real economy. Among its initial steps, the BoT is analyzing the
existing links between market interest rates and key monetary aggregates.
23.
The BoT reiterated its commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime. The
authorities pointed to the enhanced flexibility observed over the past year. In view of the large
amounts of official aid and capital inflows being channeled through the BoT and the ensuing
necessary FX sales to sterilize them, the discussions focused on the relative merits of the existing
system, where the BoT announces the price at which it will transact on the existing interbank
foreign exchange market (IFEM) platform, and an auction mechanism (if feasible, building on the
IFEM infrastructure). There was agreement that interventions should be for liquidity management
purposes and to smooth out short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. The authorities also
noted that the relative importance of the organized market should not be overestimated, in view
of the even larger volume of foreign exchange transactions that occur outside of the market,
including sizeable banks’ dealings with their customers. The BoT indicated its intention to
gradually increase reserves as a share of imports.

B. Fiscal Policy
24.
The authorities aim at balancing the debt stabilization objective with the need to
invest in infrastructure and ensure adequate priority social spending. The debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) shows that Tanzania remains at low risk of external debt distress and that the
public debt outlook is sustainable, assuming that economic growth remains strong and that the
fiscal deficit gradually declines to 4–4½ percent of GDP over the medium term. The authorities
noted the difficult choices to be made in prioritizing expenditures and mobilizing additional
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

revenues to attain the deficit reduction objective, in light of a gradual decline in grants. They
emphasized that the budget is the sole and appropriate mechanism to make priorities
operational, including those outlined in the recent Big Results Now initiative.
25.
Budget preparations for 2014/15 are under way. The authorities indicated that they
would persevere in their efforts to mobilize domestic revenues, including through the upcoming
VAT reform. Thus, despite the decline in grants, the budget would aim at a moderate reduction
in the deficit compared with the 2013/14 target, while allocating resources for a modest increase
in infrastructure investment as a share of GDP and at least maintaining the share of spending on
priority social services. The authorities noted that, in view of recent experience, they would strive
to maintain revenue projections at realistic levels, so as to avoid the need for expenditure
compression during budget execution. They also indicated that the budget would include
modest allocations for the benefits of pensioners covered by the pre-1999 reform noncontributory system and for the clearance of longstanding domestic arrears through a
centralized process of verification and payment. The discussions also addressed the merits of
allocating potential one-off revenues (such as capital gains tax revenues arising from a sale of
participation rights in offshore production sharing agreements between two companies) to
clearing existing arrears.
26.
Consistent with the favorable debt outlook, the authorities planned external nonconcessional borrowing to finance infrastructure projects. Under the current SCF
arrangement, the ENCB ceiling of US$3,388 million (cumulative from July 2010) was set to permit
contracting of US$700 million this fiscal year, consistent with the budget. Out of the allocated
amount, US$84 million have been contracted as of February 2014 (the foreign currency portion
of a commercial loan contracted by TANESCO). The authorities indicated that they plan to use
the remaining amount under the ceiling to finance infrastructure projects, including a gas-based
power plant and an airport terminal—both would be implemented over a number of years. The
financing contracts for these loans are close to being finalized. More generally, the authorities
intend to explore a greater role for the private sector, including PPPs, to finance and undertake
infrastructure investment. The authorities also noted the importance of being able to contract
additional non-concessional financing—potentially including a sizable upfront bond issuance—
during the two months prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year, to avoid delays in executing
infrastructure projects. Staff concurred, in view of the positive DSA results, while noting the carry
costs involved in pre-financing.
27.
The authorities are making progress in debt restructuring discussions with external
creditors. Since the last review, staff was made aware of an existing stock of arrears to private
external creditors stemming from the lease of planes by Air Tanzania several years ago, whose
size is estimated well below 0.1 percent of GDP. In line with the Fund’s Lending into Arrears (LIA)
policy, the authorities have demonstrated and intend to continue good faith efforts, through
frequent bilateral communication and working out a repayment plan, to reach collaborative
agreement with their creditors.

28.
Disclosure and management of fiscal risks is limited, despite their macroeconomic
relevance. Fiscal risks are generally defined as the possibility of deviations of fiscal outcomes
from baseline projections. Information regarding some of the most macro-economically relevant
fiscal risks is not yet readily available to policymakers or the public (Box 4).

Box 4. Monitoring and Managing Fiscal Risks in Tanzania
Key fiscal risks in Tanzania stem from the following sources.
Macroeconomic shocks. The fiscal implications of potential changes in macroeconomic variables
could be significant: in particular, a prolonged decline in the currently high rate of economic growth
would considerably worsen debt dynamics. Nevertheless, the debt sustainability analysis suggests
that the magnitude of the impact is manageable and is not much different from peers. The DSA
prepared and published by the authorities is a helpful start in informing the public about the fiscal
implications of macroeconomic shocks.
Offshore natural gas. If the presence of commercial quantities of off-shore natural gas is
confirmed, large revenues could start accruing to the budget by the end of the decade. On the
other hand, the fiscal position would deteriorate if government expenditures were to increase
substantially in the expectation of higher revenues from natural gas, and these later turned out to
be short of expectations.
Public enterprises. Despite major privatization waves during the past two decades, PEs still play a
major role. The government has ownership in 215 PEs (including regulatory and policy making
bodies) and its shareholdings are valued at US$8.6 billion (TSh 14 trillion). At end June 2013, total
outstanding government loans to PEs amounted to 1 percent of GDP and total guarantees were
another 1 percent of GDP. Annually parliament receives a comprehensive list of public enterprises
and other government agencies, and information on state ownership, guaranteed loans, budget
transfers to and dividend payments by PEs. More detailed financial data (balance sheets and income
statements) are being collected by the Treasury Registrar but not shared with parliament or the
public. Disclosure of more comprehensive information on PEs would allow policy makers to gauge
(i) the importance of PEs in achieving public policy objectives; (ii) the need for subsidies, and (iii) the
extent to which dividends paid by the PEs are commensurate with their profits and operations. As
natural resources gain importance, the financial situation of PEs involved in the sector will merit
even further disclosure of information.
Public-private partnerships and guarantees. In recent years, guarantees issued by the central
government have been relatively limited and have been generally disclosed. Public-private
partnerships have also seen little activity, though prospectively this could be an important area as
new projects emerge.
Government obligations that may not be captured in the fiscal accounts. This includes, for
example, off-budget spending by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) financed by
pension funds to construct hospitals, universities, and other projects which were not funded within
the budget framework; in several instances, the MDAs are not servicing the debt obligations. This
weakens transparency; moreover, the ensuing obligations will eventually need to be recognized as
central government debt.

C. The Financial Sector
29.
Financial sector development and economic growth have been mutually
reinforcing. Indicators of financial development show that Tanzania’s experience is similar to
other countries in the region, though there is scope for further progress given the country’s level
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

of development. In response, the authorities have focused on fostering financial stability to
engender confidence in the system, allowing the private sector to leverage on innovations such
as mobile banking that enhance financial inclusion. Indeed, indicators of credit availability and
financial inclusion display an upward trend. The growth in mobile banking transactions has been
especially rapid, rising from TSh 25.2 billion in 2008 to TSh28.9 trillion in 2013. The authorities
and private sector agents see these developments as supporting investment, economic
efficiency, and output growth. In order to support the prudent expansion of mobile banking and
money platforms, the authorities are working on regulations to ensure financial stability. A new
Payments System Act has been drafted to make the BoT’s supervisory role over mobile payment
platforms more explicit, and is expected to be tabled at the next parliamentary session.

Statistical estimates of the expected median value of the financial development indicators are generated by the
FinStats tool created by the World Bank. The tool selects a peer group based on the level of economic
development, population, demographic characteristics, the global cycle and other special characteristics (e.g.,
whether the country is an oil exporter or an offshore financial center) and provides the median values of each
indicator for the peer group.

30.
The authorities have made progress in regulatory and supervisory reform. The
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) update of June 2010 recommended several actions,
such as addressing data gaps to strengthen the oversight of banks, developing credit
information tools to mitigate systemic credit risk, and improving the framework for dealing with
banking crises. Progress to date includes collaboration committees of relevant supervisors and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

policymakers for effective surveillance and crisis management/resolution, as well as the
establishment of a credit reference database and bureaus. Further reforms are under way (Box 5).
31.
Tanzania has substantially addressed its Action Plan agreed with FATF to address
weaknesses in its AML/CFT framework. The last action item under the plan agreed with the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF)—a set of amendments to legal provisions to strengthen
provisions to seize terrorist assets—received its final parliamentary reading in November 2013
and was duly enacted in mid-December.6 Regulations to make the revisions operational were
issued soon thereafter. Tanzania may be removed from the list of jurisdictions that are subject to
FATF’s monitoring process after an on-site visit by FATF to confirm implementation of the
reforms.7 To make the AML/CFT framework more efficient, the authorities are also undertaking a
national assessment to identify the key risks. Ultimately, this will make it possible to adopt a
more flexible set of measures, in order to target resources more effectively and apply preventive
measures that are commensurate to the nature of risks.

D. Managing Natural Gas Reserves
32.
Tanzania is likely to become a major producer and exporter of natural gas in the
medium term. Significant offshore discoveries have been made over the last 2–3 years, and
further exploration is underway. Although gas resources have not yet been declared
commercially viable, estimates of discoveries indicate recoverable offshore gas resources of at
least 24-26 trillion cubic feet, potentially sufficient for a four-train LNG plant (possibly as a
common facility for several upstream gas fields). A final investment decision is expected at the
earliest in late 2015 or 2016. Total investment during the development phase could amount to
US$20-40 billion, the largest investment ever in Tanzania, with gas production starting after
2020.
33.
Potentially significant revenue from natural gas could play a transformative role for
the development of Tanzania, if well managed. The authorities and the mission discussed the
importance of putting in place a sound policy, legal and regulatory framework well before
natural gas exploration reaches an advanced stage. These will be reflected in the authorities’
revised gas policy framework, which is expected to address the inter-generational policy question
of natural resource wealth management, ensure integration of resource revenue in the budget
framework and institutionalize transparency and accountability of spending. Decisions made in
the next few years on the contracts and the general fiscal framework will have long term
implications for whether the benefits of likely revenues from newly discovered offshore natural
gas will accrue to all citizens. Removing policy uncertainty about the fiscal regime would facilitate
the final investment decision (see Selected Issues Paper).

Box 5. Status of Recommendations from the June 2010 FSSA Update
The June 2010 FSSA Update recommendations, covering both bank and non-bank financial sector
participants, include proposals to strengthen capital standards in banks; improve credit information systems;
create a crisis management framework; develop avenues for long-term financing, including capital markets;
and improve international cooperation with financial regulators, both in the region and elsewhere. The
authorities have made progress in all these areas.
A high-level group, known as the Tanzania Financial Stability Forum (FSF), comprising all financial regulators
and other key official stakeholders was established in March 2013 to monitor developments in the financial
sector with a view to preserving financial stability. Meeting at least once every quarter, the group will guide
the implementation of macro and microprudential measures in response to risks, and formulate and
implement crisis management measures. The FSF had its first meeting in November 2013, at which members
discussed possible options for a stress testing and crisis management framework for non-banks.
Other key developments in regulatory and supervisory policy:










The BoT set up a credit reference database and licensed two firms to act as credit reference bureaus,
with a third application pending.
The Social Security Regulatory Authority was established in March 2011 and is now the primary regulator
of pension funds.
Minimum capital requirements for commercial banks were raised to TSh 25 billion in February 2014
(TSh 5 billion previously), which most banks have met. The capital adequacy ratios will be further raised
from March 2014 by 2.5 percentage points to 12.5 percent for Tier-1 capital and 14.5 percent for total
capital.
The BoT has entered into information sharing and other cooperative arrangements with financial
regulators in members of the EAC, Comoros, Cyprus, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe, with ongoing
discussions with additional countries.
The authorities are setting out a framework for consolidated supervision of more complex financial firms,
including amendments to the legal provisions that allow regulators to increase oversight of bank holding
companies. Draft regulations to support this have been prepared and the authorities envisage being able
to submit them for gazetting by June 2014.
In line with EAC agreements, further opening of the capital account to investors from other EAC
members is envisaged by end-June 2014, extending this to the rest of the world by December 2015.

The main operational improvements include:





To improve transparency and communication, the BoT has started publishing semi-annual financial
stability reports. As part of this, it is improving data collection, including through surveys of credit
officers, households and corporates.
To address capacity and organizational challenges in banking supervision, the BoT has hired 15 new
supervisors since 2010, and training has been stepped up.
To further improve the supervision process, greater use of technology, including automated submission
of reports by banks to the BoT, has started.

Further work is needed to:






Improve the frequency and timeliness of data. The BoT’s financial stability reports are issued with some
delay (March 2013 is the latest issue available, with September currently in preparation). The publication
schedule is being aligned with that of FSF meetings, thereby enhancing timeliness.
Improve the stress-testing framework. Fund TA, including to expand stress-testing to pension funds, is
being provided.
Bolster the deposit insurance fund. Efforts to enhance the operational independence of the Deposit
Insurance Board by transforming it into a full-fledged Deposit Insurance Corporation are underway.

E. Structural Reforms
34.
The authorities have prepared a draft new VAT law that would improve efficiency
and help to mobilize revenues. Beyond modernizing the VAT, the reform is aimed at
broadening the tax base by significantly reducing exemptions. A policy document outlining the
main features of the law has been approved by Cabinet. The authorities indicated that the draft
law, which incorporates initial rounds of stakeholders’ comments, would likely be submitted to
Parliament in May 2014, in the proximity of parliamentary debate on the 2013/14 budget, which
it is designed to support. They agreed that effective implementation of the new VAT regime
would require strengthening the existing VAT administration, especially the refund mechanism.
35.
The authorities noted their determination to stem and ultimately reverse the
increase in domestic expenditure arrears. They noted that a high-level committee has already
identified measures to prevent the emergence of new arrears (such as a halt in new multi-year
projects in some ministries) and a framework for central verification and payment of old arrears.
Further steps being explored included: more conservative revenue projections; enhanced cash
flow planning; more timely and frequent validation of arrears; and greater enforcement of
sanctions against officers incurring government obligations in the absence of budgetary
resources.
36.
The discussions on the pension system focused on the central government’s
obligations to the Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) and broader pension reform. A
government task force recently completed a report assessing the magnitude of the obligations
to the Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF). The discussions began exploring potential modalities
for addressing the outstanding liabilities. The authorities were also exploring potential parametric
reforms to enhance the sustainability of the broader pension system, which consists of several
funds. An option under consideration is to harmonize the parameters by implementing the same
changes recently applied to one of the funds; this would make a substantial dent in the actuarial
deficit of the system.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Preserving macroeconomic stability is essential for continued strong growth.
Tanzania’s buoyant economic growth and its recent return to moderate inflation are to be
attributed, in no small part, to generally prudent macroeconomic policies. Yet, vulnerabilities may
be building up, with mounting pressures for additional fiscal expenditures and a large current
account deficit. Moreover, following the successful reforms of the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, the
appetite for further reform seems to have abated somewhat, perhaps with the rapid growth itself
instilling a sense that the current situation is adequate to deliver strong economic performance.
In the years ahead, to support continued rapid growth and to ensure that its benefits are widely
shared, leading to poverty reduction, policymakers will need to address both longstanding and
new challenges.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

38.
In the fiscal area, policy action will be needed to preserve fiscal sustainability.
Pressures to increase spending reflect genuine needs in areas that may be expected to foster
inclusive growth. Priority areas identified by the authorities include infrastructure, education,
health, and essential social services. Meanwhile, a declining trend in grants has made deficit
reduction more challenging. The need to finance additional spending while reducing the fiscal
deficit has occasionally led to optimistic revenue assumptions, as evidenced during the current
fiscal year. The near term priority for 2013/14 is to contain expenditures within the limits set in
the mid-year review and to make further efforts in revenue administration in order to contain the
deficit at about 5 percent of GDP. In 2014/15 and subsequent fiscal years, efforts will be needed
to mobilize additional revenues, beginning with the VAT reform, while ensuring that revenue
assumptions are realistic, so as to eschew the accumulation of new arrears and to avoid abrupt
expenditure cuts during budget execution.
39.
Improving public financial management remains a priority. In particular, guidelines to
prevent arrears accumulation need to be implemented and a plan is required for the gradual
reduction of the existing stock, with appropriate verification and safeguards. More generally, the
accuracy and timeliness of fiscal data is necessary for better informed policymaking. Priority
areas include: a net reduction in the stock of arrears; diminished use of expenditure floats at the
end of the fiscal year; and more timely compilation of fiscal outturn data consistent with
financing data.
40.
A key challenge will be to set up appropriate institutional arrangements to ensure
that any gains from natural resources accrue to the benefit of all citizens. In the next few
years, this will involve establishing a clear taxation framework that retains good revenues for
citizens while providing reassurance to natural gas companies that their investments will remain
worthwhile; transparency in the contracts signed with private companies; a fiscal framework that
smoothes the use of natural resources and aims at intergenerational equity; ensuring that all
spending financed by natural resource revenues (including those collected by public enterprises
involved in the sector) is determined and undertaken through the general budget process and is
subject to the same degree of public scrutiny as that financed by other revenues.
41.
More generally, there is a need to improve the monitoring and management of
fiscal risks. Although the baseline trajectory of public debt remains sustainable, significant fiscal
risks may not be captured in the current headline central government deficit and debt data.
Some sources of fiscal risks relate to possible macroeconomic shocks, such as a halt in the
exceptional economic growth performance experienced during the past decade. Other risk
sources stem from the need to improve the quality and timeliness of information on the fiscal
accounts for both the central government and other public sector entities. In particular, more
timely compilation and disclosure of improved information on the public enterprises’ profit and
loss accounts would be warranted. Some public enterprises are profitable and carry implicit
guarantees, yet they contribute little central government revenues; others are loss-making and
periodically require transfers. It is also important to ensure that the central government settles its
obligations vis-à-vis the pension funds in a timely manner, and that pension funds are not used
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

to finance government activities. Disclosure and management of fiscal risks will become even
more important as member countries prepare to enter the East African monetary union, to
reduce vulnerabilities for both individual countries and the union as a whole.
42.
Greater focus on international competitiveness may be warranted. As the economy
becomes ever more integrated in international markets—with further opening up of the financial
account and increasing foreign direct investment—more powerful external shocks and the need
to foster the creation of a more diversified export sector call for enhanced attention to preserve
international competitiveness. This reinforces the need for the exchange rate to fully reflect
market conditions; for non-tariff barriers to be reduced, so as to exploit economies of scale in a
larger economic area; for deregulation to curb any remaining impediments to export-oriented
businesses; and for an improved business climate to attract both domestic and international
investors. Indeed, the fuller establishment of export-oriented businesses in a wide range of
economic sectors before offshore natural gas comes on stream would facilitate public discourse
and economic policy choices that reflect a more diversified set of interests in the years ahead.
43.
The frameworks for monetary policy and financial supervision will need to keep
pace with the economy’s modernization and its growing international integration. Initial
steps toward a monetary policy framework centered on a greater role for interest rates
appropriately include the analysis of the relationship between interest rates and the monetary
aggregates, and enhanced focus on developments in interest rates as an indication of the current
stance of monetary policy. The authorities are also encouraged to review the functioning of the
foreign exchange market and to consider moving to a more modern auction system. In the
financial sector, technological innovations and international integration are creating new
opportunities for financial deepening and inclusion, but also call for speedy implementation of
reforms of the financial supervision framework to reduce or manage any ensuing vulnerabilities.
A priority is to ensure effective collaboration among regulators, both domestically and with
international counterparts.
44.
The authorities’ resolve to meet these challenges has been evident in their policy
actions. Indeed, the authorities have addressed previous slippages in the program (¶15 and
Appendix 1). On the basis of actions taken, staff supports the authorities’ requests for a waiver
for nonobservance of a performance criterion and completion of the last review under the SCF
and for completion of the financing assurances review.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Tanzania be held on a
12-month cycle.

The gross expenditure float for a fiscal year Y relates to expenditures that are recorded in Y, but for which the payment is made—and thus the financing is recorded—in the
following fiscal year, Y+1. The net expenditure float for fiscal year Y is the difference between the gross expenditure float for Y and the gross expenditure float for the previous
fiscal year, Y-1; in other words, the net expenditure float for Y relates to expenditures recorded in Y whose financing was recorded in Y+1, minus the additional financing that
occurred in Y for expenditures that were recorded in Y-1.

A considerable
decline in natural gas
prices could reduce
incentives for
investment in the

Medium: Fiscal slippages
would result in higher deficit
and borrowing that could
weaken fiscal consolidation
efforts and undermine debt
sustainability. It could also
crowd out critical
infrastructure and social
spending.
Medium: The energy
infrastructure projects are
critical for reducing cost of
power generation and
ensuring uninterrupted power
supply. Power outages would
weaken growth and the
subsidies to TANESCO would
crowd out critical social and
capital expenditures.
Medium: As infrastructure
investment is seen as key to
removing bottlenecks to
growth, delays in funding
would weaken growth
potential.
Low: The exchange rate and
international reserves would
come under moderate
pressure. Lower FDI would
partly be offset by lower
imports.

Instability would
affect investment and
growth.

Medium: Growth prospects
could be dampened by a loss
of confidence and a slump in
investment, budget revenues
decline, and balance of
payments pressures emerge
from lost exports and
tourism.

With food accounting
for almost half of the
consumption basket,
the shock would
cause inflation and hit
the poor.

Medium: Pressures on
inflation and demands for
higher subsidies may emerge.

Greater exchange rate flexibility
would reduce external pressures,
complemented by monetary
tightening to limit pressures on
reserves and the exchange rate.
Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be
allowed to operate; cuts in lower
priority spending would help to
preserve fiscal sustainability.
Careful monitoring of second-round
effects on inflation and readiness to
tighten monetary policy to counter
pressures on core inflation. Targeted
social assistance would cushion the
impact on poor, but administrative
capacity would be a challenge.

Electricity tariffs should be raised to
cost recovery levels and adjusted
periodically to reflect changing prices
of inputs. Alternatively, lower priority
spending should be identified in the
budget to make room for temporary
subsidies and allow gradual tariff
adjustment.

The fiscal priorities would have to be
revisited to ensure that critical
infrastructure projects, especially in
the energy sector, are implemented.

Greater exchange rate flexibility

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, ”medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. Economic Diversification and Growth: Tanzania’s Experience1
1.
From the turn of the millennium, economic performance in Tanzania has
improved significantly (Figure 1). Growth accelerated markedly, from an average of 3 percent
during the 1990s to an average of 6.9 percent during 2001–2012, with per-capita GDP more
than doubling since 2000. The economy stabilized, as inflation fell from double to single digits,
international reserves increased, and the public debt burden declined substantially (partly
thanks to increased foreign aid and debt relief under the HIPC initiative and MDRI in the mid2000s). Average labor productivity increased by 50 percent in the last decade, 2 and the
productivity growth was among the fastest in the region in 2005–11.

Tanzania experienced a significant economic transformation since the 1990s. Its
successful diversification away from low value-added agriculture to higher value-added
manufacturing and services was likely fostered by macroeconomic stabilization and waves of
comprehensive policy and structural reforms that began in the mid-1980s, and accelerated
from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. These reforms reduced the role of the state in the

economy and offered fertile grounds for the private sector development, especially in gold
mining, manufacturing, tourism, and the financial sector, attracting significant FDI. They
covered a broad range of areas including exchange, price and trade liberalization, tax and
public finance reforms, introduction of a modern monetary policy and the liberalization of the
financial sector, reforms of the public sector and privatization of SOEs, and the onset of
regional integration (Box 1). In response, donor support was also scaled up, which helped
increase public investment and alleviate poverty.

The share of agriculture in total output declined from 30 percent in 2000 to
23 percent in 2011 (Figure 2). Even as the share of agriculture in output and exports declined,
the sector itself diversified. Output of high-volume cash crops, such as cotton and coffee,
continued to grow, but smaller-volume crops such as cashew nuts, tobacco, and tea grew
faster. In addition, agricultural production reoriented toward the domestic market to meet the
demands of a rapidly growing population.

The Theil index is calculated as T= ∑

is the share of the sector k in

total output. The calculation is based on new IMF in-house database, compiled using information on the
sectoral composition of GDP provided by the country authorities to IMF country desks. The dataset contains
value added series in constant prices for 12 economy-wide sectors in Africa for the period of 2000–2011. The
12 sectors include agriculture (including forestry and fishing), mining and quarrying, manufacturing, utilities
(electricity and water), construction, trade and repairs, hotels and restaurants, transportation and
communication, financial intermediation, real estate and business activities, public administration, and other.
FISIM and net taxes are excluded. The share of each sector is calculated as a ratio of the value added of a given
sector to the sum of all 12 sectors. For some countries, data were not available for all 12 sectors.

Box 1. Overview of Tanzania’s Policy and Structural Reforms
Reforms of the socialist economy began in the mid-1980s in response to weak growth, high
inflation, and a balance of payments crisis (Edwards, 2012; Nord et al, 2009). With the launch of the
Economic Recovery Program in 1986, the exchange regime was gradually liberalized to eliminate
overvaluation that penalized exporters, first by the introduction of a crawling peg in 1986 and
subsequently by full exchange rate unification in 1993, eliminating restrictions on current account
transactions and on holdings of foreign currency. In parallel, export and import procedures were
simplified, and tariff and non-tariff trade barriers reduced. By 1991 domestic price controls had
also been lifted on almost all products (more than 400 prices were regulated in 1990), except for
petroleum and public utilities. Further, the private sector was allowed to replace state owned
marketing boards (state monopolies), some of underperforming parastatals restructured, and a
comprehensive privatization program launched in 1993.
However, reform efforts were derailed in the early 1990s, leading to another episode of weak
performance (as well as declining donor support). Eventually, beginning in 1996, the market
reform efforts resumed with stronger national ownership. By 2003 most of manufacturing and
commercial parastatals have been restructured, liquidated or transferred to private ownership,
while non-commercial entities merged into government bodies. To strengthen the business
environment, since 2002 business licensing and registration were simplified, labor policies
reformed, and property rights strengthened. In the financial sector foreign banks were allowed to
enter Tanzanian market from 1992, while state-owned banks were restructured and privatized, or
liquidated. Management of public finances was also strengthened through tax policy reforms,
including the introduction of VAT in 1998, and improved tax administration. In addition, increased
public investment in infrastructure including in the energy sector, has provided a platform for
productivity growth in the private sector and expansion of exports.

5.
During the same period, manufacturing, construction and services have increased
their shares in the economy (Figure 2). Growth in manufacturing was driven primarily by
small-scale production aimed at the domestic and regional markets.4 Growth was even faster in
construction and non-tradable services such as domestic trade and transport. This reflects
partly the liberalization of food crop marketing and subsequent replacement of the
underdeveloped distribution system of the previous planned economy by private traders, but
also spillover effects from tourism and manufacturing.

4

The Annual Survey of Industrial Production 2008, conducted by Tanzania’s National Bureau of Statistics,
reports that 88 percent of manufacturing enterprises employ less than 5 workers, and 97 percent employ less
than 10 workers.

6.
The mining sector—which consists mainly of gold mining—also has grown
rapidly, though it remained small. Supported by FDI, its volume expanded from 1.6 percent
of output in 2000 to 2.7 percent in 2007 and declined again slightly to 2.3 percent by 2012. On
the other hand, in value terms gold has become the single largest export commodity, growing
from zero in 2000 to nearly 9 percent of GDP and 40 percent of total exports of goods in 2012,
making Tanzania the fourth largest gold exporter in Africa. Growing investments in the sector
and the expansion of gold export receipts, however, was largely driven by rapidly rising gold
prices, which rose by over 450 percent.
7.
With rapid output growth, exports have also expanded and diversified. Overall
exports of goods and nonfactor services (GNFS) excluding gold have grown from 12 percent of
GDP in 1998 to 20 percent in 2012. Manufacturing exports have grown rapidly, from 3 percent
of non-gold GNFS exports to 19 percent (and rose by 3 percentage points of GDP), while
traditional exports (coffee, tea, cotton, cashew nuts, tobacco, sisal, cloves) declined from
31 percent to 17 percent of non-gold GNFS exports.
8.
The sheer number of export products has increased substantially. The number of
distinct products exported by Tanzania rose from about two hundred in 1990 to more than five
hundred in 2009. 5 Of these, the number of manufacturing products increased from about 130
5

The product disaggregation is at the 4-digit level of Standard International Trade Classification (SITC)

37

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

to more than three hundred. The picture remains broadly unchanged even when the analysis is
restricted to the distinct products with export revenues exceeding US$1 million.
9.
With the changing product structure of exports, the geography of Tanzania’s
trade has also changed. The share of the EU as a main trade partner declined considerably
and new partners emerged. Most importantly this reflects the emergence of gold as a
significant source of exports, accounting for a large share of trade with Switzerland and China.
At the same time, Tanzania’s regional trade also increased, especially with the EAC and South
Africa.

Lessons and Challenges
10.
The Tanzanian economy has diversified noticeably in the past decade. The broad
economic liberalization over the past two decades has yielded significant benefits in terms of
growth and diversification. External factors, such as rising commodity prices, have also
supported investment in new industries and the expansion of output and exports.
38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11.
Nevertheless, Tanzania is a low income country with high unemployment and
large productivity gap compared with more advanced peers. To achieve a higher level of
development, it will therefore need to sustain its recent growth rates, while increasing the
share of manufacturing in output, and further broadening of trade. This will require significant
upgrading of physical infrastructure, investments in human capital, and improving the business
environment, where Tanzania ranks poorly.6 In particular, speeding up the resolution of
commercial disputes and rendering tax policy more predictable are perceived as priorities by
several entrepreneurs and financial market participants.
12.
However, Tanzania’s economy may experience another commodity boom. If the
presence of commercial quantities of off-shore gas is confirmed in the near future, the country
is likely to receive multi-billion dollar foreign investments in the coming years and become one
of the largest exporters of natural gas in the region by 2020. Such a development might quickly
lift output, but would also make production and exports dominated by commodities. Tanzania
will then face significant policy challenges that are common to many resource-rich countries.7
To avoid loss of competitiveness in other tradables and sustain growth of the manufacturing
sector, which is a key ingredient to achieving a middle-income status, additional reforms are
needed to strengthen the business environment, remove the remaining non-tariff barriers, and
harmonize regional norms and investment rules to develop and fully exploit comparative
advantages within and outside the region.

6

The World Bank Group’s Doing Business Survey ranks Tanzania 134 out of 185 economies in 2013, behind
Kenya and Uganda and considerably behind Rwanda.

Annex II. Tanzania: Exchange Rate Assessment1
1.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 33 percent as of January
2014 from August 2011, when it reached its
lowest level since 2000. The nominal effective
rate (NEER) remained fairly stable over the same
period. Real appreciation stemmed from a large
positive inflation differential relative to trade
partner countries. Meanwhile, the terms of
trade remained broadly unchanged. The
improvement in relative productivity by 3-4
percent was insufficient to offset the loss of
competitiveness from the exchange rate
appreciation.

2.
Model-based analysis suggests that
the shilling is somewhat overvalued compared to what is implied by fundamentals
(Table 1). The results are based on several complementary methodologies, similar to those
proposed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER)2, extended to
emerging and developing economies (Vitek,
2013).3 These include macroeconomic balance
(MB), external sustainability (ES), purchasing
power parity (PPP), and equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) approaches. In addition,
staff estimated an alternative specification of the
macroeconomic balance approach by adding
foreign direct investments to the list of
explanatory variables.
3.
The MB and the ES approaches calculate the exchange rate misalignment as the
percent change in the real exchange rate that is needed to close a gap between the
current account ‘norm’ and the underlying current account. In both cases, the ‘norm’ is
determined by economic fundamentals, and is assumed not to be a direct function of the

real exchange rate.4 The underlying current account, on the other hand, is defined as a
medium-term equilibrium level of the current account (stripped of the temporary and cyclical
factors). It is assumed to be driven by external trade (exports and imports), which in turn is a
direct function of the real exchange rate. The exchange rate adjustment that is required to
bring the underlying current account to its norm is then calculated using trade balance
elasticities.
4.
The underlying current account for Tanzania is equated to its medium term
projection in 2017/18. In 2011/12 the current account deficit widened to about 18 percent
of GDP mainly because of a surge in FDI and the increased imports of oil and thermal power
generation equipment to offset the drought-related hydro capacity shortages. With the
completion of the gas pipeline and new
gas-fueled power plants, imports of capital
goods are projected to decline. Demand for
oil imports is also expected to moderate
once cheaper natural gas from domestic
fields becomes the major source of power
generation. Subsequently, the current
account deficit is expected to gradually
narrow to 11½ percent of GDP in 2017/18,
when all the above temporary factors are
phased out. The current account deficit
projection for 2017/18 is assumed to be its
medium-term equilibrium.5
5.
The elasticity of the trade balance with respect to the real effective exchange
rate is obtained from two alternative sources - the CGER and Tokarick (2010).6
Assuming that gold exports, which in 2012/13 accounted for about 35 percent of total goods
exports and is priced in US dollars, has unit elasticity to the exchange rate, the CGER yields
the trade balance elasticity of 0.16.7 The Tokarick estimate of the trade balance elasticity for
Tanzania is slightly higher at 0.22.
6.
The results of the MB approach are presented in Table 2. The current account
norms were calculated using two specifications—the benchmark model, which uses
coefficients obtained by Vitek (2013), and an alternative model estimated by staff, which also
includes FDI as an explanatory variable to capture the impact of FDI-related imports on the
4

In the MB approach, the current account norm is determined by steady state levels of savings and
investments in the medium term, whereas in the ES it is obtained as the current account balance that
stabilizes the country’s net foreign assets at a desired level.

Until commercial viability of potentially large off-shore natural gas deposits is confirmed, the projections
do not incorporate the impact of related foreign direct investments.

current account. The models imply current account norms of -5.8 and -8.2 percent of GDP
respectively compared to the underlying current account balance of -11.6 percent of GDP.
These gaps, combined with the elasticities above, suggest overvaluation of the shilling in the
range of 15.7–36.2 percent.

The elasticity of the trade balance with respect to the real effective exchange rate is obtained as follows:
1
, where export elasticity
0.71, import elasticity = 0.92, X and M are

exports and imports of goods and services respectively, and Xg is export of gold. By dropping the
assumption about unit elasticity of gold exports, the trade balance elasticity becomes 0.15.

7.
The ES approach yields similar overvaluation.8 With nominal GDP growth
projected at 12 percent and net foreign assets9 at -64 percent of GDP in 2017/18, the ES
methodology yields an estimated current account norm of -7.1 percent of GDP and
overvaluation of the shilling by 21–28 percent.

8.
The PPP approach suggests an
overvaluation of the shilling by about
17 percent. This approach assumes longterm stationarity of the real effective
exchange rate and calculates
misalignment as a percentage deviation of
the real effective exchange rate from its
long-term average. The long-term average
was calculated from monthly data for the
last 10 years (January 2004-December
2013).

9.
Finally, the ERER approach implies overvaluation of the shilling by almost
2 percent (Table 4). Unlike the MB and the ES, the ERER models the medium-term
equilibrium real exchange rate as a direct function of a set of economic fundamentals. The
8

The current account that stabilizes net foreign assets can be expressed as:
, where can is the
current account norm, g is nominal GDP growth in steady state, and nfa is the steady state level of net
foreign assets. (see Vitek, 2013; or Lee, J, and others., 2008).

Net foreign assets are obtained from the External Wealth of Nations database (Lane, P. and Milesi-Ferretti,
G.M 2011), and extended through 2017/18 using flow projections for foreign assets and liabilities.

panel regression is estimated using country-specific fixed effects, and the misalignment is
then obtained as a percent deviation of the actual REER from its estimated equilibrium level.
The country-specific intercept is derived by equating average ERER (i.e. fitted values from the
regression) with the actual average REER for the last 10 years, which implicitly assumes that
the average misalignment over the sample period is zero. As can be seen from the regression
output below, by far the largest determinant of the equilibrium real exchange rate is relative
productivity, a variable that is particularly prone to measurement error, especially for
developing countries with relatively weak statistics regarding labor market variables.

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director

Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.

Dear Madam Lagarde:
The Government of Tanzania requests completion of the last review under the SCF arrangement
based on overall performance under the program. In doing so, we request a waiver for the
nonobservance of the end-June 2013 performance criterion on net domestic financing, which was
breached by 1.2 percent of GDP primarily to offset the revenue shortfalls.
All quantitative indicative targets for September and December 2013 were met with the exception of
the floor on tax revenues (addressed through the mid-year budget review), and a marginal breach of
the reserve money ceiling in December. A structural benchmark for end-November 2013on VAT
reform was also missed.
In order to meet our deficit target of about 5 percent of GDP for 2013/14; the Government took the
following corrective measures: (i) on March 20, 2014, in the context of the mid-year budget review,
Cabinet approved revisions to the 2013/14 budget, including downward adjustment to the revenue
projections and expenditure cuts; (ii) the Cabinet also approved a policy document outlining the
main features of the VAT reform, which the Government plans to submit to Parliament in May 2014;
and (iii) to improve TANESCO’s financial position and reduce the need for the budget subsidies,
electricity tariffs were raised by 40 percent on average starting January 1, 2014.
The Government intends to treat the remaining tranches of the SCF arrangement on a precautionary
basis. The Government will continue to maintain close policy dialogue with the Fund. It intends to
disseminate this letter and the related Fund staff report, and hereby authorizes the IMF to publish
the same on its website after consideration by the Executive Board.

Safeguards Assessments:
Safeguards assessments of the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) were completed in December 2003, August
2008, November 2009, and November 2012. The 2012 assessment found that governance and
safeguards framework at the BoT had been strengthened. The BoT’s Audit Committee continued to
provide an active oversight of audit, financial reporting and control systems, and that BoT’s financial
statements are prepared in accordance with international standards and published. Key areas for
improvement identified in the assessment include strengthening the BoT Board’s oversight role in
decisions to provide credit to the government, and reducing the BoT’s involvement non-core
activities such as the provision of credit guarantees.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzania shilling. Tanzania de jure exchange rate arrangement is free
floating and its de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The official exchange
rate is determined in relation to the rate established in the interbank market for foreign exchange.
The weighted average rate in the interbank market was TSh 1,638.27 per U.S. dollar as of March 20,
2014. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Tanzania accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of
Agreement with effect from July 15, 1996.
Article IV Consultation:
The most recent Article IV consultation was concluded on March 16, 2011 (Country Report

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(as at March 31, 2014)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring purposes. The
authorities – led by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the mainland and the Office of the
Chief General Statistician (OCGS) for Zanzibar – have articulated a 5-year strategy under the
Tanzania Statistical Master Plan. The Plan – a multipronged approach to improve collection and
dissemination of statistics – is operationalized through a series of Annual Work Plans. For FY13/14,
the authorities will be focusing on carrying forward a number of ongoing initiatives, including
ongoing efforts to update the legal framework governing statistical collection in Tanzania; improving
the quality of national accounts data, especially from Zanzibar; rebasing the producer price index;
and improving indicators of industrial production.
National Accounts: National accounts statistics for mainland Tanzania are prepared by the NBS.
Separate accounts are compiled for Zanzibar by the OCGS. The data sources for estimating national
accounts by expenditure category and the indicators used to extrapolate benchmark production
levels suffer from deficiencies that complicate estimation of saving-investment. The accounts are
based on the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA) and are published at current and
constant (2001) prices.
East AFRITAC has been providing training and assistance in the compilation of quarterly national
accounts (QNA), a key element for subscribing to SDDS. QNA at current prices since 2001 have been
compiled, and were released in the publication for the first quarter of 2009.
Price Statistics: The NBS compiles a monthly consumer price index (CPI) for mainland Tanzania
based on consumer expenditure in 21 urban centers. A separate price index is compiled for Zanzibar.
The mainland CPI uses weights based on the 2007 HBS data and with 2010 as the base year. While
the CPI basket has become more comprehensive, the geographical coverage of the index remains
fairly narrow, focused on urban centers, whereas bulk of population live in rural areas. The producer
price index (PPI) is compiled monthly and published quarterly and draws from surveys of business
establishments with over 50 workers, with the basket based on the results of the 1999 Annual Survey
of Industrial Production (ASIP). The NBS will be working on improving the PPI, including by providing
data for 2000-2006 and moving from the ISIC Rev. 2 classification to the newer ISIC Rev. 3.1. One key
concern is the representativeness of the basket as it is based on a very old vintage of the ASIP.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities provide Fund missions with monthly data on central
government revenue, expenditure, and financing on a timely basis. Although the underlying
concepts broadly follow the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986, the reporting differs from
international standards in coverage and the treatment of lending minus repayments, and transfer
payments. Coverage of data on the operations of the central government refers to Tanzania

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

mainland only –the Ministry of Finance of Zanzibar established a unit tasked with developing a fiscal
reporting framework for Zanzibar. The data also exclude the operations of extra-budgetary units and
funds. Data for general government are not available as no information is yet provided on the
financial position of local governments, although the authorities have stated their intention to
produce such reports.
Despite improvements in the recording of government transactions, discrepancies remain between
revenue and expenditure data, on the one hand, and financing data. The discrepancies are related to
the lack of a fully integrated set of accounts and the delineation of the public sector and its subsectors, differing source data, and timing differences. In addition, there appear to be gaps in the
IFMIS that allow exchequers to be issued for work without corresponding entries in the Accountant
General’s system, leading to arrears. This primarily affects multi-year development projects, including
in road construction.
The Ministry of Finance created a database of donor-funded projects in FY2001/02, the Aid
Management Platform (AMP) with donor assistance. Since then, the number of foreign-financed
projects reported by and channeled through the budget has increased significantly. The integrity of
AMP data can be affected by late entry of data by major donors, which can give rise to discrepancies.
The government has completed the computerization of its accounting system for budgetary units.
Although the authorities indicated that it would allow resumption of reporting in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), no data were reported for the 2007 GFSY. The computerized
accounting system does not yet provide details about donor funded development expenditure and
has not yet been extended to cover the extra-budgetary units. The authorities regularly report fiscal
data for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary Statistics: The monetary statistics are broadly adequate for policy and analytical
purposes. In addition to monthly compilation of the Standard Report Forms (SRFs), which the BoT
shares with the Fund, the authorities have also been sharing daily developments in reserve money
through the program period. Key improvements going forward would be to complement the SRFs
with more timely compilation of statistics for non-banks and Islamic banking. The authorities have
been publishing quarterly data on financial stability, though with a lag, coinciding with the
publication of the Financial Stability Report. These data are made available on a more timely basis to
Fund staff.
Balance of Payments: The BoP data, compiled by the Bank of Tanzania, are broadly adequate for
surveillance. Data for merchandise exports and imports are recorded on the basis of Customs returns
and supplemented by data from mining companies and crop boards. For services transactions, the
chief data sources are the financial records of depository corporations and foreign exchange
bureaus, supplemented with information on merchandise trade (freight and insurance), revenue
data from the TRA (other insurance), and other international service providers. Data on travel
receipts are obtained from International Visitors’ Exit Surveys. Current transfers, capital transfers and
official financial flows are provided by donors and the Ministry of Finance. Data for direct investment

income are estimated based on information obtained from the Private Capital Flow Survey (PSFS).
East AFRITAC has provided assistance in international investment position statistics, and developing
price and volume indices for international trade.

Data Standards and Quality

Tanzania subscribes to the General Data
Dissemination Standard (GDDS). GDDS metadata
were posted on the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in July 2001 and
were updated in January 2014. Tanzania is
participating in the successor project to the
Fund’s GDDS Project for Anglophone Africa
(funded by the U.K. Department for International
Development (DFID)).

Risk of external debt distress:
Augmented by significant risks stemming from domestic
public and/or private external debt?

Low
No

Tanzania continues to face a low risk of debt distress based on the external debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). The external debt outlook improves as a result of an increase in the discount rate,
but this is partly offset by (i) a slower pace of fiscal deficit reduction and (ii) a shift in the longterm composition of external financing towards more non-concessional loans. While the baseline
public debt outlook remains favorable, continued fiscal consolidation is critical. In addition,
recognizing the outstanding pension and other liabilities has an impact on the level of public
debt. The baseline numerical analysis in this DSA does not take into account prospects related to
natural gas resources whose scale, while potentially favorable, remains uncertain. These results
highlight the need for Tanzania to sustain fiscal consolidation efforts, to adopt a conservative
approach to non-concessional borrowing, to promptly address pension-related liabilities, and to
further improve its debt management capacity.1

This DSA replaces the previous one prepared in June 2012. Tables and figures are in fiscal years (July-June).
For example, 2013 refers to fiscal year 2012/13. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
Tanzania is rated as a strong performer, with an average rating of 3.73 during 2010-12. Although the average
CPIA score is slightly below the boundary for strong performance category (3.75), the performance rating
remains strong since this is the first year of breaching the boundary and the breach is less than 0.5.

BACKGROUND
1.
Tanzania’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt as a share of GDP has
steadily crept upwards in recent years (text figure, left panel). Since the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) in 2006/07, which reduced the external debt-to-GDP ratio from 47 percent to 19 percent, PPG
external debt (excluding arrears under negotiation for relief) has increased to about 29 percent of GDP at
end-June 2013, or 17 percent of GDP in present value terms using a 5 percent discount rate2. Total public
sector debt (external plus domestic) stood at about US$12.4 billion or 40.9 percent of GDP at end-June
2013, rising from a low of 27.5 percent at end-June 2008.

2.
The majority of Tanzania’s PPG external debt is still concessional, but borrowing on nonconcessional terms has increased in recent years (text figure, right panel). At end-June 2013, more than
two-thirds of total public external debt was owed to multilateral institutions, of which the International
Development Association (IDA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) constitute the largest creditors.
Government borrowing from commercial sources amounted to about 20 percent of the total stock at endJune 2013, having risen rapidly from about 2 percent at end-June 2010. In February 2013, Tanzania raised
US$600 million from international capital markets in a private placement transaction.3 Tanzania is currently
in the process of obtaining its sovereign risk rating, which would facilitate future Eurobond issuance.
3.
Domestic public debt stood at 12 percent of GDP at end-June 2013, and mostly consisted of
Treasury bonds. Domestic public debt is held primarily by commercial banks (39 percent), the Bank of
Tanzania (35 percent), and pension funds and insurance companies (23 percent). Private external debt has
risen in recent years to about 5 percent of GDP in 2012/13, though there is considerable uncertainty
regarding private external debt data.

The discount rate was increased to 5 percent as of October 2013. See “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of
the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries” (SM/13/292).

This is an amortizing bond with a maturity of seven years, and was priced at 600 basis points over 6-month LIBOR
at the time of issuance. The amortizing feature helps reduce rollover risks, whereas the floating interest rate on the
bond implies increased exposure to changing interest rates.

4.
The current DSA only covers central government debt. Owing to data limitations, borrowing by
local governments and most public enterprises is excluded, thus potentially understating the total debt
level. The external public debt stock includes the foreign currency portion of commercial loans contracted
by the state-owned power utility TANESCO4. For the purpose of the current DSA, the domestic public debt
stock incorporates starting in 2013/14 several outstanding government liabilities that have yet to be
formally recognized as debt (but that were included in the DSA published by the MoF), amounting to
about Tsh4 trillion or 7 percent of GDP. These include outstanding liabilities to the Public Service Pension
Fund (Tsh1160 billion)5, outstanding unpaid domestic claims (Tsh892 billion)6, government guarantees for
public enterprises (Tsh912 billion), and other actual liabilities arising from past PPP transactions, court
orders, and explicit government guarantees.7
5.

public debt in recent years. A decomposition of

6.
The authorities continue to make progress in upgrading their debt management capacity.
With technical support from the World Bank and the East African MEFMI, the MoF conducted a debt
sustainability assessment in September 2013. The authorities’ medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) was also
updated in November 2013 with support from a joint IMF-World Bank technical assistance mission. Both
the DSA and the MTDS report have been published on the MoF’s web site, and are expected to serve as
key inputs that will guide the government’s borrowing policy going forward. There is an ongoing process
to put into operation a centralized debt management office (DMO), housed at the MoF, that will bring
together the fragmented debt management functions.

TANESCO borrowing in foreign currency amounts to about US$20 million in 2012/13 and US$84 million in 2013/14.

the road sector, which are not included in the DSA.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
7.
Compared with the previous DSA, the current assessment is based on a somewhat slower
pace of fiscal deficit reduction (text table). This reflects Tanzania’s need to increase growth-supporting
infrastructure investments while maintaining a sustainable debt outlook. The deficit is projected to narrow
gradually to 4 percent of GDP by 2015/16, and to further decline to 3 percent of GDP in 2020/21 and
thereafter in line with the convergence criteria agreed under the East African Monetary Union (EAMU)
protocol. Domestic revenues (excluding grants) are projected to grow from 18 percent of GDP in 2012/13
to over 23 percent of GDP by 2033/34, consistent with economic development and Tanzania’s tax potential.
External grants are assumed to decline gradually, from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2013/14 to 2 percent of GDP
in the long term.

The composition of external borrowing is assumed
to gradually shift toward non-concessional debt, consistent
with a reduction in aid dependency as the economy matures.
External non-concessional borrowing (ENCB) is expected to pick
up in 2013/14, due in part to a US$558 million projected
disbursement of the gas pipeline loan9, and in part to debt
contracted to finance new infrastructure projects.10 Beyond
2013/14, the assumption is that total gross foreign financing
would consist of about half ENCB and half concessional
(program and project) loans in the medium term. Thereafter,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

ENCB would gradually become the more prominent financing source, reaching about 70 percent of total
foreign financing requirements by 2033/34.
9.
Other macroeconomic assumptions remain broadly similar to the previous DSA (see Box 1
for detail). Real GDP is assumed to keep growing by 7 percent annually over the projection period, with
continued strong capital accumulation. The external current account (CA) is projected to gradually improve
over the medium term as the availability of gas-based power generation reduces the need for oil imports,
and to stabilize at a still-large deficit of 10 percent of GDP.
Box 1. Key DSA Assumptions


Growth, inflation, exchange rate. Real GDP growth is projected to remain at 7 percent over
the medium and long term. Inflation would converge to the Bank of Tanzania’s medium-term
target of 5 percent, yielding a nominal growth rate of about 12 percent per annum. The
Tanzanian shilling is projected to depreciate against the USD by 3 percent annually in the
medium and long run, due to the inflation differential between Tanzania and the US.



Exports and imports. Export and import values are assumed to grow at 11 and 10 percent
annually in the long term, respectively.



Fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 4 percent of GDP by 2015/16, and
further to 3 percent of GDP from 2020/21 onwards. Revenues excluding grants are assumed to
grow from 18 percent of GDP to 23 percent of GDP by 2033/34.



Aid and FDI flows. External grants are assumed to gradually decline to 2 percent of GDP by
2033/34. Foreign concessional loans (program and project loans) would slowly decline to
1 percent of GDP in the long term. Concessional loans are assumed to continue to come
primarily from multilateral creditors (IDA, AfDB, etc.) in the medium term, but would then be
increasingly provided by bilateral – particularly non-Paris Club – creditors, whose financing
terms are not as favorable. After a slight increase due to further offshore natural gas
explorations, net FDI inflows would stabilize at an average of 6.1 percent of GDP in the long
term.



Domestic borrowing. Net domestic financing is kept at a maximum of about 1 percent of
GDP throughout the projection period. New domestic debt is assumed to carry a real interest
rate of 10 percent with average maturity of seven years, consistent with recent experience.



External non-concessional borrowing. ENCB is assumed to finance about half of the gross
foreign financing requirement up to 2019/20 before gradually gaining importance over
concessional sources, reaching 2.5 percent of GDP by 2033/34. The grant element of new
borrowing is projected to decline considerably over the long run. New external commercial
borrowing is assumed to be provided by a combination of export credit agencies (ECA) and
commercial banks (syndicated loans), with the latter source becoming more prominent in the
long run. Consistent with prevailing market conditions, ECA loans have an average interest
rate of 4 percent with a 15-year maturity, whereas syndicated loans carry a higher average
interest rate (7 percent) and shorter maturity (7 years).

10.
The current DSA includes a government pension liability in the 2013/14 domestic public
debt stock. The government currently has Tsh1.16 trillion (about 2.1 percent of GDP) of past-due payment
liabilities it owes to PSPF for pension benefits related to the pre-1999 noncontributory scheme.11 Although
the authorities have acknowledged the outstanding liability and budget for partial repayment each year,
the liability has not been formally recorded in the fiscal accounts and thus was not part of the domestic
debt stock. This DSA assumes that recognition of this liability (and several other actual liabilities) occurs in
2013/14, resulting in a one-off increase in the 2013/14 public debt stock.12 Moreover, in interpreting the
fiscal deficit assumptions that underlie this DSA (and the related policy effort to meet such assumptions), it
is important to keep in mind the flow of future expenditure obligations (estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP
per year in the medium term, gradually slowing down thereafter) to cover the pension benefits of
pensioners in the pre-1999 system as a part of the deficit.
11.
The current DSA incorporates better-refined projections of debt service on existing external
debts. The assessment uses individual loan information provided by the authorities, reflecting their process
of upgrading the debt database and debt monitoring capacity. Future debt service obligations are
projected for each loan, then aggregated into several representative instruments (e.g., by creditor type and
lending terms).
12.

The discount rate is currently set at 5 percent, compared to 4 percent used in the previous DSA.

EXTERNAL DSA
13.
All PPG external debt burden indicators remain comfortably below indicative thresholds in
the baseline scenario (Figure 1 and Table 1). Under the baseline assumptions, the present value (PV) of
public external debt expressed as a share of GDP increases slightly from 20 percent in 2014 to a peak of
23 percent in 2019, before gradually declining to about 19 percent by the end of the projection period.
Debt service indicators are projected to rise gradually over time, reflecting the long-maturity nature of
concessional loans which make up the majority of the existing external debt stock, as well as the increasing
weight placed on new commercial borrowing.
14.
The outlook for the external debt ratios remains favorable under standard stress tests
(Figure 1 and Tables 3a-b). All debt burden indicators remain safely below their respective risk thresholds.
However, stress tests show that external debt dynamics would be adversely affected in the event of a onetime 30 percent depreciation in the nominal exchange rate. The PV of external debt expressed as a share of
exports is sensitive to a shock to financing terms, in which the interest rate on new public sector borrowing
11

The figure is based on the government’s estimation. Until June 30, 1999, the PSPF was a noncontributory pension
scheme, with all benefits paid from the budget. The PSPF was transformed into a contributory defined benefit
scheme on July 1, 1999, but benefits continued to be paid from the budget during a 5-year transition period (until
June 30, 2004). From July 1, 2004 onwards, the PSPF has been paying pension benefits related to the pre-1999
scheme on behalf of the government, for which it has not been reimbursed.
12

Correspondingly, for the purpose of this DSA, the fiscal accounts show an increase in domestic financing (below
the line). As a result of this one-off stock adjustment, domestic debt reported in the DSA is higher than in staff
projections.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

increases by 200bps. In addition, the external debt outlook would become less favorable in the event of a
permanent growth shock, whereby real GDP growth is lower at 5 percent (2 percentage points below the
baseline).
15.
Compared to the previous DSA, the favorable impact of the higher discount rate prevails
over the adverse effects of changes to the projected fiscal deficit and financing assumptions. Slower
fiscal consolidation leads to more debt accumulation, assumed to be financed with increasingly nonconcessional external debt. (The assumed concessionality of new external borrowing continues to decline
over the projection period, as can be seen by the declining grant element—Figure 1, top left panel).
However, the increase in the discount rate to 5 percent reduces the present value of external PPG debt by
about 2 percent of GDP on average.

PUBLIC DSA
16.
Indicators of overall public debt (external plus domestic) and debt service do not point to
significant vulnerabilities related to the level of domestic debt (Figure 2 and Table 2). In the baseline
scenario, the PV of total public debt expressed as a share of GDP and revenues is expected to decline
gradually over time. The PV of public debt peaks at about 36.3 percent of GDP in 2014, when various
outstanding government liabilities are recognized, but remains well below the benchmark level of about
75 percent associated with heightened public debt vulnerabilities for strong performers.13 The path of
public debt is also consistent with the authorities’ objective under the EAMU protocol of keeping the public
debt-to-GDP ratio (in PV terms) below 50 percent.
17.
Stress tests indicate that the sustainable public debt path hinges on continued fiscal
consolidation. In a scenario assuming that the primary deficit (as a percent of GDP) remains at the
projected 2014 level over the entire projection period, the PV of public debt would keep growing to
51.5 percent of GDP by 2034. This scenario highlights the critical importance of reducing fiscal deficits to
prevent excessive debt buildup. Fiscal consolidation in the medium term may present challenges for the
authorities in light of infrastructure needs and expenditure pressures to facilitate growth in key sectors (e.g.,
energy, transportation, and agriculture), as well as growing pension obligations and the upcoming general
election in 2015. The most extreme shock corresponds to a 10 percent of GDP increase in debt-creating
flows in 2015, which would capture some of the government implicit contingent liabilities and/or noncentral government borrowing that is not included in the DSA. The amount of known contingent liabilities
arising from pension obligations and government guarantees (about 9 percent of GDP) is broadly in line
with the magnitude of shock assumed by the standardized stress test.
18.
Growing pension obligations present a challenge to be met in order to preserve public debt
sustainability. The DSA shows that recognizing the outstanding liability to PSPF has a noticeable impact
on the public debt ratio. In the absence of a reimbursement for past benefit payments, PSPF is now in a
13

See Revisiting the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries for a discussion of public debt
benchmarks. Tanzania is still considered a strong performer as their CPIA score of 3.73 breaches the 3.75 threshold
slightly for the first time. The public debt benchmark for medium performers is 56 percent of GDP.

fragile financial position. Moreover, pension obligations related to the pre-1999 scheme will continue to
accrue and are ultimately a spending obligation of the government. More broadly, the actuarial deficit
across the pension sector (consisting of several pension funds) gives rise to further liabilities. This highlights
the need for the government to address its outstanding pension liabilities, budget for future payments
related to the pre-1999 scheme, and undertake parametric pension reforms to improve the funds’ financial
positions.

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF NATURAL GAS RESOURCES
19.
The baseline macroeconomic framework underlying the current DSA does not yet factor in
the potential impact of possible future natural gas production from emerging offshore large-scale
projects. Recent deep water exploration by major petroleum companies has confirmed large natural gas
deposits. Public information released by the companies exploring for natural gas indicates that there are
recoverable gas resources of at least 23-26 trillion cubic feet (TCF), although there remains significant
uncertainty about exact reserve estimates. There is potential for the reserve estimates to increase further
given the substantial exploration activities underway (although gas reserves are likely to remain significantly
smaller than those of neighboring Mozambique). While exploration and appraisal are well underway, the
final investment decisions to construct liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals have not yet been made. (Such
decisions are currently expected to be made in 2016.) Thereafter, the development phase would start, and
it would take several years before commercial production and exports of LNG could begin. Similarly,
significant fiscal revenues would not materialize for at least a decade from today.
20.
If natural gas prospects were to materialize, the impact on debt sustainability would depend
on a variety of factors. The development phase (until about 2020/21) would see a significant
deterioration of the external current account, given the import-intensive nature of LNG projects. The extent
of the deterioration depends on the scale of the projects, e.g., whether it would be a two-train or four-train
LNG plant. The larger CA deficit would be financed by a combination of FDI inflows and public sector
external borrowing depending on the government’s decision on how to manage natural gas resources, i.e.,
whether gas-related investments would be led by the private or public sector.14 A temporary increase in the
fiscal deficit and public debt buildup is therefore possible in the medium term. Once LNG commercial
production comes online (possibly in the early 2020s), natural gas exports would pick up significantly,
alleviating pressures on the current account (by how much depends on the commercially viable amount,
the portion earmarked for domestic consumption, and prevailing global natural gas prices— which are
particularly volatile). The fiscal impact would build up gradually, with tax yields initially mitigated by
deductions on investments. The overall long-term impact would likely be highly beneficial, with potentially
large fiscal receipts from gas revenues (Box 2), thereby reducing public sector borrowing needs and
enhancing debt sustainability. A more precise DSA scenario incorporating LNG developments will be
14

The government’s natural gas policy, which was adopted in October 2013, envisaged a more central role for the
national oil and gas company, TPDC (Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation), across the upstream,
midstream, and downstream sectors. Tanzania is working to finalize gas-related policies and regulations, which will
be encompassed in a new Gas Master Plan, the downstream-focused Natural Gas Act, and a new petroleum policy
which will cover the upstream sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

developed when commercially viable natural gas resources are known with greater confidence and when
there is reasonable certainty that the development of a large scale gas project will go ahead.

Box 2. Offshore Natural Gas: Resources, Investment, and Fiscal Impact
Tanzania has made significant offshore gas discoveries during the last two years. The resource discoveries
have been made by two groups of international petroleum companies that are still conducting exploration
and appraisal; neither has yet declared the gas discoveries to be commercial. A final investment decision is
expected at the earliest in late 2016, with production potentially commencing after 2020. The latest
estimates indicate that there are total recoverable gas resources amounting to 23-26 trillion cubic feet
(tcf). A rule of thumb is that 10-12 tcf of gas reserves is the minimum required for a two-train liquefied
natural gas (LNG) plant.
This box presents estimates of the possible investment and fiscal impact of an LNG project applying a
model developed for Tanzania by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD). With uncertainty about gas
reserves, project cost and gas prices, the fiscal regime, and potential government equity participation,
these are illustrative estimates, not forecasts.
Investment impact
The investment impact of an LNG project will be significant, ranging from US$20-40 billion depending on
the scale of the project.1 Two-thirds of the development cost relate to pipelines and liquefaction facilities.
During the development phase (possibly from 2018 to 2021), the sizeable investment will widen the
current account deficit and temporarily boost growth. The fiscal impact during the development phase will
depend on policy decisions regarding state participation in a project. As an illustration, if the government
were to take a 15 percent equity share in the downstream of a large LNG project, the government’s
contribution to total development cost could be close to US$4.5 billion.
Fiscal revenue impact
Given the project uncertainty, and that the fiscal regime likely will evolve further, through either
contractual negotiations or general reforms, it is only possible to simulate the fiscal impact under specific
assumptions rather than make firm projections. The fiscal revenue impact would be highly beneficial. At
full production, annual revenue collections by the government reach between US$3 billion and US$6
billion in the two different project simulations. These would have a transformational impact on the debt
outlook, as by way of comparison today’s public debt stock amounts to $12.4 billion. Most of the fiscal
revenues would originate from the upstream, reflecting the higher effective tax rate and the assumption
that the downstream will be regulated as a public utility. The fiscal regime is a hybrid combining royalty
and income tax with production sharing. The largest revenue stream comes from production sharing,
highlighting the importance of treating production sharing as any other source of fiscal revenue which
should be paid to the Treasury and not retained by the national oil company.

Simulations have been done for two project sizes: a two-train liquefaction plant with capacity for annual

production of 10 million metric tons of LNG and a four-train plant producing 20 million metric tons per year.

CONCLUSION
21.
Tanzania continues to face a low risk of external debt distress and low risks from domestic
public debt, but continued prudent policies are needed to preserve debt sustainability. Compared
with the June 2012 DSA, the higher discount rate has a positive impact on the debt outlook, although this
is partially offset by the assumption of a slower pace of fiscal deficit reduction and the assumed gradual
reduction in the concessionality of external borrowing. While the public sector debt outlook remains
favorable in the baseline, the public DSA, which only covers central government debt, shows that
Tanzania’s public debt would not stabilize in the absence of continued fiscal consolidation. The rising share
of non-concessional borrowing would increase the average interest rate as well as potential exposure to
interest rate fluctuations (if it took the form of variable rate loans) and rollover risks (if it took the form of
Eurobond issuance with a lumpy repayment profile). Another challenge stems from government
obligations related to the civil service pension sector, as well as yet-to-be-captured borrowing by local
governments and public enterprises. Moreover, adverse shocks to economic growth, financing terms, or
the exchange rate would significantly worsen the debt dynamics. A major upside risk relates to potentially
large revenues from natural gas finds, which however would materialize only a decade from now. These
results highlight the need for Tanzania to sustain fiscal consolidation efforts, to adopt a prudent approach
to non-concessional borrowing, to initiate pension reforms, and to take concrete steps in improving its
debt and public investment management capacity.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April, 25, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Third Review of an Arrangement Under the Standby
Credit Facility with Tanzania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today concluded the third and
final review of an arrangement under the Standby Credit Facility (SCF)1 with Tanzania. The SCF
was approved in July 2012 (see Press Release No. 12/252). In February 2013, the authorities
drew the full accumulated amount of US$114 million under the SCF arrangement through that
date. No drawings have been made since then, and the authorities have indicated that they do not
intend to make further drawings on the arrangement, which expires on April 30, 2014.
The Board also concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation; a press release will be issued
separately.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, said:
“The Tanzanian authorities are to be commended for the broadly satisfactory implementation of
their economic program supported by the Fund’s Standby Credit Facility. Prudent
macroeconomic policies have delivered buoyant economic growth and successful disinflation.

1

The SCF supports low-income countries that have reached broadly sustainable macroeconomic positions, but may

experience episodic, short-term financing and adjustment needs, including those caused by shocks. The SCF
supports countries’ economic programs aimed at restoring a stable and sustainable macroeconomic position
consistent with strong and durable growth and poverty reduction. It also provides policy support and can help
catalyze foreign aid. (See http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/scf.htm.) Details on Tanzania’s SCF are
available at www.imf.org/tanzania

2

“Preserving macroeconomic stability is essential for continued strong growth. Yet,
vulnerabilities may be building up, with pressures for additional fiscal expenditures and a large
current account deficit. To safeguard the sustainability of the public finances, improved public
financial management is a priority, going forward.
“A key objective for the remainder of this fiscal year is to contain expenditures within the limits
set in the mid-year budget review and to strengthen revenue administration. Looking ahead,
efforts will be needed to mobilize additional revenues, beginning with the VAT reform, while
ensuring that revenue assumptions are realistic, so as to eschew the accumulation of new arrears
and to avoid abrupt expenditure cuts during budget execution.
“A crucial medium-term challenge will be to set up appropriate institutional arrangements to
ensure that the benefits from the exploitation of natural gas fields accrue to all Tanzanians. This
will involve establishing a fair taxation regime, transparent contracts with the companies
involved, and a framework to manage resource wealth that promotes inter-generational equity
and is fully integrated with the budget process.
Tanzania is becoming increasingly interconnected with the global economy and greater focus on
international competitiveness is warranted. Accordingly, the exchange rate should fully reflect
market conditions, and a variety of reforms need to be undertaken to dismantle remaining
impediments to trade, including infrastructure bottlenecks, and improve the business climate.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 15, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Tanzania
On April 25, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Tanzania and completed the third and final review of the country’s
performance under an economic program supported by a Standby Credit Facility arrangement
(see Press Release No. 14/182).
Economic growth in Tanzania is projected to remain strong at 7 percent next year and in the
medium term. Inflation is at 6 percent, gradually converging to the authorities’ 5 percent medium
term objective. The external current account deficit remains among the largest in the region, at
14 percent of GDP this year. Fiscal revenue shortfalls and overruns in domestically-financed
spending led the deficit to rise to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13. Revenue shortfalls in 2013/14
compared to the budget approved by parliament have prompted the authorities to undertake
expenditure cuts during the fiscal year in an effort to meet their 5 percent of GDP deficit target.
Based on the debt sustainability analysis, Tanzania remains at low risk of debt distress. A major
opportunity for the long term, not yet incorporated in the baseline projections, relates to sizable
finds of offshore natural gas that, if confirmed as commercially viable, could generate significant

Executive Directors commended the skilful macroeconomic management that has delivered rapid
growth, falling inflation, and continued poverty reduction in the context of Fund-supported
economic programs. Noting risks to the outlook and remaining vulnerabilities, Directors
encouraged the authorities to consolidate the gains so far by stepping up efforts to improve the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

policy frameworks, reconstitute buffers, and push ahead with structural reforms in a variety of
areas.
To safeguard the sustainability of the public finances, Directors recommended containing public
spending within the limit of the mid-term budget review, while addressing poverty alleviation
and the large infrastructure deficit through careful expenditure prioritization. They also
encouraged the authorities to intensify revenue mobilization, including through accelerated VAT
reforms. More broadly, Directors agreed that the achievement of fiscal targets would benefit
from further improvements in public financial management, which would prevent the recurrence
of arrears and facilitate their resolution. It would also be important to improve the quality and
dissemination of fiscal data.
Directors commended the Bank of Tanzania for reducing inflation to the mid-single digits and
preserving financial stability. Looking ahead, they advised to further strengthen prudential
oversight, including as regards the regime against money-laundering and the financing of
terrorism. Directors also welcomed the central bank’s intention to transition to an interest ratebased monetary policy framework, and encouraged a review of the foreign exchange market to
promote greater transparency and efficiency.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the Tanzanian shilling appears to be somewhat
overvalued in real effective terms, but agreed that Tanzania’s ongoing structural transformation
amplifies the uncertainty surrounding such assessment. They nonetheless considered that the
persistently high external current account deficit points to the need to boost external
competitiveness through enhanced exchange rate flexibility as well as additional reforms to
reduce implements to trade, promote financial deepening, and improve the business climate.
Noting that the recent offshore discoveries of natural gas could present a major opportunity for
Tanzania, Directors recommended establishing over the medium-term transparent institutional
frameworks for natural gas taxation and wealth management with a view to fostering good
governance and inter-generational equity.

Statement by Mr. Saho, Executive Director for United Republic of Tanzania
April 25, 2014
Introduction
The Tanzanian authorities have demonstrated a track record of sound macroeconomic policy
implementation, which has culminated in robust economic growth and a stable macroeconomic
environment. The judicious implementation of a Fund-supported Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
(June 2010–June 2013) and the current 18-month Standby Credit Facility (SCF) arrangement has
laid a solid foundation to sustain the growth momentum, improve the country’s external
competitiveness, maintain price stability, and rebuild fiscal buffers. Overall economic policy, going
forward, will focus on the scaling-up of investments in infrastructure and key productive sectors,
preserving macroeconomic stability and addressing the underlying structural impediments to
growth, consistent with the key national and regional objectives set out in their poverty reduction
strategy (the Mkukuta II), the Five Year Development Plan, and the East African Community (EAC)
protocols.
Performance under the SCF arrangement has been broadly satisfactory since the inception of the
program in July 2012, reflecting the authorities’ adherence to prudent macroeconomic policies
and commitment to deepen structural reforms. In view of the continued strong performance—
with all but one quantitative PC for end-June 2013 met together with most indicative targets for
end-September and December 2013, and the significant progress achieved in implementing the
structural reform agenda—my authorities request Directors’ support for the completion of the
third and final review under the SCF arrangement. In this context, they request a waiver for the
nonobservance of the performance criterion on net domestic financing, breached in the
authorities’ bid to ensure continued financing of critical development projects in the face of
shortfalls in foreign financing and domestic revenue mobilization.
The Tanzanian authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and policy dialogue with staff
in their effort to address the daunting socio-economic challenges and create an environment
conducive to supporting their development agenda. They value highly the support of the Fund
Management and Executive Directors, and consider the staff report informative, well balanced,
and an important source of meaningful policy advice.
Recent economic developments and prospects
The Tanzanian economy continues to register strong economic growth, estimated at
7.0 percent in 2013. Growth has been largely broad-based, driven by increased activity in the
agriculture, transport and communications, trade, real estate and business services, and
manufacturing sectors. Overall economic growth is projected at 7.2 percent in 2014. The inflation
environment remains benign, with headline and core inflation declining during the second half of
2013, on account of tight monetary policy and reduced supply side bottlenecks. Annual headline
and core inflation were 5.6 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, in December 2013 down from
12.1 percent and 8.9 percent in December 2012.

Fiscal management, in FY2012/13, was challenged by dwindling external budgetary support,
optimistic revenue projections, and weaknesses in public financial management systems.
While total expenditures were contained within program targets, the shortfall in domestic revenue
mobilization relative to budget projection and the program target resulted in a higher-thananticipated fiscal deficit, breaching the overall deficit target of 5.5 percent of GDP by 0.3 percent.
In spite of efforts to address the accumulation of domestic arrears, the stock increased over the
year by 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent of GDP at end-June 2013.
The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has maintained a tight monetary policy stance, culminating in a
decline in key monetary aggregates, with broad money (M3) and private sector credit growth in
line with end-December 2013 program targets. Inflation expectations have been effectively
anchored and, as highlighted inter alia, inflation has continued to trend downwards. The
exchange rate has remained fairly stable, supporting the disinflationary path. The banking sector
has remained profitable and adequately capitalized. Financial soundness indicators are robust,
with most commercial banks fulfilling the new statutory minimum capital requirement. The
portfolio of non-performing loans shrunk steadily from 8.1 percent at end- 2012 to 6.5 percent at
end-2013. Effort to improve loan quality and minimize default was bolstered by the establishment
of credit reference bureaus.
Medium-term policies and outlook
Fiscal policy
My authorities have continued to pursue prudent fiscal policy aimed at promoting economic
growth, enhancing service delivery and improving the socio-economic welfare of the populace, all
within the ambit of macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. To this end, they will seek to
strike an appropriate balance between their objectives of promoting inclusive growth and
preserving macroeconomic stability. To achieve these objectives, they intend to pursue a path of
gradual but sustained deficit reduction, culminating in the attainment of the 3 percent of GDP
stipulated under the East African Monetary Union (EAMU) protocol. Expenditure restraints and
enhanced domestic revenue mobilization would form centerpiece of their medium term fiscal
strategy.
On expenditures, the authorities intend to contain recurrent spending, including on the wage bill,
while focusing on priorities outlined in the Mkukuta II and the Five Year Development Plan. The
strengthening of the public financial management systems will also be vigorously pursued to
improve budget execution, including curbing the recurring issue of accumulation of domestic
arrears. In the meantime, prompt action is being taken to clear a sizeable portion of longstanding
arrears, including by earmarking a portion of potential capital gains taxes on the sale of offshore
natural gas exploration rights. To help prevent further build-up of new arrears, a moratorium has
been imposed on the contracting of new domestically-financed multi-year projects and a highlevel committee comprising key government entities established to provide oversight.

2

On the revenue front, the authorities are committed to expediting implementation of VAT
reforms, with a view to modernize the VAT administration, broaden the tax base and streamline
the scope of tax exemptions. Key tax legislations will also be revised in line with international best
practices.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
My authorities aim to maintain a tight monetary policy stance with the objective to further reduce
inflation to the BoT’s policy target of 5 percent in the medium term. To achieve this objective, the
BoT will set its policy rate consistent with the envisaged disinflationary path. The authorities will
remain vigilant and closely monitor risks to inflation, including those arising from regional supply
shocks and domestic energy prices. The array of monetary policy instruments at the Bank’s
disposal will be expanded, the sterilization of excess liquidity complemented by more active
foreign exchange sales, and the liquidity forecasting and management framework further
strengthened. In addition, the authorities will undertake to better understand the channels
through which monetary policy impulses are transmitted through the real economy, with a view
to gradually transit to an interest rate-based monetary policy framework. They will continue to
rely on Fund technical advice and practical operational guidance to ensure a smooth transition.
On the exchange rate, the BoT reaffirms its commitment to a market determined exchange rate
regime, and considers it an important safeguard against exogenous shocks. To this end,
interventions in the foreign exchange market will be limited to liquidity management and to
smoothen out short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. The BoT will also seek to attain a
healthy level of gross international reserves, consistent with the statutory requirement of its Act.
In the spirit of the EAC common market protocols, the capital account will be fully liberalized by
December 2015 to allow for freer movement of capital within the community and with the rest of
the world.
Financial sector stability
My authorities have preserved the stability of the financial sector and promoted its further
deepening. While financial soundness indicators have been favorable and the banking sector
adequately capitalized, the BoT’s efforts at reinforcing the bank supervisory and regulatory
framework will be unrelenting. Consequently, the authorities will continue to sharpen financial
stability monitoring tools and enhance the bank stress-testing framework, with technical
assistance from the Fund. In addition, the authorities are in the process of developing a
framework for consolidated supervision. They also plan to build on the progress in addressing the
weaknesses in the country’s AML/CFT framework by undertaking a national assessment of
potential risks and proffering appropriate policy measures to mitigate these risks.
Structural reforms
My authorities are committed to implementing far-reaching structural reforms to complement
their sound macroeconomic policies, with a view to achieve a more broad-based growth, create
employment opportunities and reduce poverty.

3

Recent offshore discoveries of substantial natural gas reserves, if found to be commercially viable,
have the potential to lead to the structural transformation of the Tanzanian economy. Mindful of
this immense opportunity, my authorities have initiated a process of developing an appropriate
fiscal framework that ensures efficient management of prospective revenues from natural gas. A
natural gas policy has already been adopted and, with donor support, a comprehensive policy
and regulatory framework is being developed. Drafting of a policy paper on fiscal management of
gas revenues and amendments to the Income Tax Act incorporating mining and petroleum
taxation are expected going forward.
Restoring the financial viability of the national power utilities company (TANESCO) remains a
major preoccupation of my authorities going forward. Implementation of an
average 40 percent increase in electricity tariff, with effect from January 1, 2014, underscores their
commitment to achieving this goal and ensuring more efficient service delivery. Given the recent
progress in addressing its financial obligations, and with the expected realization
of external donor funding, the profitability of TANESCO is expected to be restored over the
medium term.
Development of the private sector will constitute an important component of the country’s
economic program for FY2014/15 and the medium term. Efforts to improve the business
environment will focus on addressing the huge infrastructure deficit, strengthening the
institutional and legal framework for doing business, and enhancing access to credit.
Effective implementation of the Mkukuta II is to continue up to end-June 2015. Subsequently,
review of the Mkukuta II process is to be undertaken and a successor poverty reduction strategy
developed.
Conclusion
My Tanzanian authorities remain committed to pursuing sound macroeconomic policies and
implementing far-reaching structural reforms to promote a more inclusive and balanced growth
and address the high level of unemployment, within a stable macroeconomic environment. In this
regard, they intend requesting Board approval of a successor PSI in the months ahead, following a
process of extensive internal consultations to ensure broad ownership and political buy-in of the
proposed economic and financial policies. They expect a new program to be effectively aligned
with the policy objectives set out in their medium-term macroeconomic framework.
