SOUTH AFRICA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with South Africa
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Adnan Mazarei
August 15, 2008
Executive Summary
Background: After several years of relatively high growth, a number of shocks are slowing
growth, while pushing inflation and the current account deficit up. Global increases in food
and fuel prices have pushed inflation into double digits, while strong investment, including
an ambitious public investment program, is contributing to a worrisome widening of the
external current account deficit. Policies remain broadly appropriate, with substantial
monetary tightening and a small fiscal surplus aiming to moderate domestic demand. The
financial sector is sound and well regulated, but now faces a less benign environment.
Challenges: In the near term, it will be critical to preserve macroeconomic stability by
containing inflation and addressing external vulnerabilities so that the push to accelerate
growth and spur job creation will not be derailed. More fundamentally, higher output and
employment growth are needed to reduce still high unemployment and inequality.
Staff views: Risks to macroeconomic stability have increased with rising inflation and the
widening current account deficit, the financing of which has become less assured. Further
monetary tightening may be needed to prevent second-round effects from the food and fuel
price shocks. Given the large public infrastructure program and low private saving, a gradual
increase in the structural fiscal balance would avoid exacerbating current account pressures
and bolster confidence. In the medium term, increases in saving and investment, deficitneutral tax and spending policies to strengthen incentives to invest and work, and structural
reforms to boost competitiveness and productivity could raise growth and employment.
Authorities’ views: While broadly sharing staff’s assessment, the authorities were more
optimistic regarding risks to external stability as they consider markets to be willing to
finance the investment-driven increase in the current account deficit, which they also expect
to be somewhat lower than staff’s projections. They felt they had little alternative but to
increase public investment to address critical infrastructure bottlenecks and noted there was
little leeway and support for increasing government saving. The SARB indicated its intention
to tighten monetary policy as needed to anchor inflation expectations.

I. BACKGROUND: STRONG MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND RISING CHALLENGES 1
1.
South Africa has made strong economic progress in the past several years. Good
macroeconomic management and favorable external conditions raised growth to
5–5½ percent in 2005–07, lowered inflation to mid-single digits until recently, strengthened
the public finances, and improved the external reserve position (Figure 1). Employment grew
steadily, allowing the unemployment rate to decline from over 30 percent in 2002 to
23 percent by 2007. The expansion was led by strong domestic demand. Household
consumption was driven by growing disposable income and wealth effects from rising
housing and stock prices, while private investment was buoyed by strong business
confidence and high commodity prices.
2.
At the same time, South Africa has continued to face difficult challenges in
overcoming its apartheid legacy and addressing high levels of unemployment and
inequality. Unemployment is high in part because of the strong increase in labor force
participation following the end of apartheid, and also because various factors, such as weak
product market competition, have supported a two-tier labor market comprising relatively
well-paid formal sector workers and others—particularly less-skilled black workers—who
have been excluded from employment altogether. 2 Nevertheless, labor force participation
remains low by international comparison and growth, although rising, has trailed behind rates
in dynamic emerging market economies (EMEs). Income inequality remains among the most
acute in the world, highlighting the pressing need to ensure that growth is shared broadly, as
underscored by the government.

The discussions were held during June 18–July 1, 2008. The mission met with the Minister of Finance, the
Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, senior officials, and representatives from Parliament, the
private sector, trade unions, and the academic community. The staff team comprised Ms. Corey (head),
Messrs. Cuevas, Gueorguiev, and Eyraud (all AFR), and Ms. Nkusu (PDR). Messrs. Nolan and Burgess,
resident representatives in Pretoria, participated in the mission. Mr. Wajid (MCM) joined the mission to discuss
the conclusions of the FSAP Update. Mr. Aboobaker (OED) also attended the meetings.

3.
President Mbeki’s government is in its final year in office, with national elections
expected in April 2009. The leadership of the ruling African National Congress (ANC)
experienced a major turnover in December 2007, with many incumbents losing office. The
new leadership, headed by former Deputy President Jacob Zuma, has underscored the party’s
commitment to policy continuity in key areas.
4.
Since the beginning of 2008, the South African economy has been buffetted by a
series of shocks.
•

In January, power cuts disrupted output and exports (particularly in mining), taking
the public by surprise (Box 1). Continuing power rationing is expected to constrain
output growth until additional generation capacity is brought on stream over several
years.
The global financial market turmoil in early 2008 heightened investors’ sensitivity to
South Africa-specific risk, reflecting concerns about the power crisis, the rising
current account deficit (9 percent of GDP in 2008Q1), and the impending political
transition. Risk premia on South African debt increased and portfolio inflows turned
negative, weakening the stock market index and the rand, which depreciated by
about 20 percent between end-2007 and mid-March, before recovering somewhat
(Figure 2).
Global food and fuel price shocks intensified, leading to sharp increases in consumer
price inflation (11.6 percent in June) and inflation expectations.

•

•

5.
Recent indicators point to a
slowdown in activity reflecting the
cumulative effect of power shortages,
the global slowdown, and past monetary
tightening. Growth of manufacturing and
mining output has weakened; retail and
vehicle sales have contracted; and
residential property price growth has
slowed to low single digits. Business and
consumer confidence indices now point to

a weakening economy. The expansion in credit to the private sector has moderated
somewhat, partly reflecting stricter lending standards introduced in June 2007. Households’
debt has reached a record high, while the continued rise in debt service—largely reflecting
the rise in mortgage interest rates—has dampened consumption. Investment, however,
remains strong reflecting in part higher public infrastructure spending.
Box 1. South Africa’s Power Crisis
South Africa has long produced low-cost electricity, reflecting its abundant coal reserves.
Electricity prices have been among the lowest in the world, some 60 percent below the average
price in major economies—a key factor in the development of energy-intensive mining and
mineral processing sectors.

South Africa’s electricity-generating capacity has stagnated in recent years while demand
has continued to rise. Private investment in generation did not materialize, partly because
electricity tariffs were set too low to provide the returns sought by investors, while investment
by the state-owned electricity provider Eskom was delayed. As a result, the reserve margin in
the system has declined, causing periodic power cuts. In January 2008, unplanned emergency
maintenance and a drop in coal stocks forced power cuts to large industrial users for the first
time, leading to a temporary shutdown of mining production.
The government’s response to the crisis aims to reduce demand by about 10 percent until
new capacity comes on stream. Most large mines and other industrial customers remain
rationed to 90–95 percent of their normal electricity needs. Eskom’s plans include an ambitious
increase in its generating capacity by some 50 percent over the next 9–10 years. Electricity
prices have been raised by 27½ percent on average since July 1, 2008 and are set to increase
substantially over the next several years to help finance rising costs of operation and
investment, while promoting conservation. Nevertheless, the supply-demand balance is likely
to remain tight for the next few years, with significant risk of power disruptions.

7

6.
A critical challenge in the period ahead will be to ensure that possible instability
related to the current account deficit does not derail the push to accelerate growth and
spur job creation. Within this overarching theme, discussions focused on:
•

assessing the economic outlook and risks;

and policies to:
•

contain inflation in the face of successive large global food and fuel price shocks and
slowing growth;

•

address vulnerabilities, including by ensuring the health of the financial sector,
reflecting the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update; 3 and

•

foster shared growth by addressing the main constraints to growth.
II. DISCUSSIONS ON THE OUTLOOK: A SLOWING ECONOMY WITH
INCREASING DOWNSIDE RISKS

7.
The short-term outlook for South Africa has weakened over the last year. Staff
projects output growth to moderate to below 4 percent in 2008 and 2009 due to power supply
constraints, lower demand in partner countries, and the cumulative effect on consumption of
previous monetary policy tightening. Inflation is expected to peak later this year and to
remain above the target band for a significant period, reflecting the pass-through of higher
food, fuel and electricity prices as well as second-round effects. Despite slowing private
consumption growth, the current account deficit is projected to rise to 9–9½ percent of GDP
in 2008–09—provided external financing remains available—due to strong public
investment, high oil prices, and output constraints in the mining sector.
8.
Potential output growth is being affected by the constraints in the electricity
sector, but investment should restore growth potential down the road. Emergency
rationing schemes will constrain potential output in the short term, implying that pressures on
the current account and inflation will persist despite the slowdown in demand and output
growth. An ambitious public infrastructure investment program seeks to address the
bottlenecks in electricity, rail, and ports, and as infrastructure constraints are eventually
relaxed, potential growth should rise towards an estimated 5 percent in the medium term.

Downside risks have increased significantly:

•

the large current account deficit, which leaves South Africa vulnerable to a loss in
investor confidence and a sudden stop in capital inflows (Box 2) that would result in
an abrupt adjustment in domestic demand and a sharp depreciation of the exchange
rate, implying renewed inflationary pressures and necessitating further interest rate
increases;

•

further increases in global food and fuel prices, which would put direct additional
pressure on the current account deficit and inflation, and would also slow down the
economies of partner countries; and

•

and, on the domestic side, elevated debt service burdens among households, which
pose risks to consumption growth and possibly to pockets of the financial system as
interest rates remain high or are raised further.

Box 2. Current Account Vulnerabilities
South Africa’s current account deficit (CAD) is high relative to those of most EMEs and tends
to be financed by potentially more volatile capital inflows. Compared with other EMEs, foreign
direct investment (FDI)—which tends to be relatively stable—accounts for a smaller proportion of
South Africa’s CAD financing. Among countries with large CADs, South Africa remains an outlier in
its heavy reliance on portfolio flows, reflecting its well-developed financial markets.

Current account balance plus net FDI inflows.

Capital inflows to South Africa have become more volatile lately. In late 2007 and early 2008,
nonresidents’ net purchases of South African equities and bonds shrank significantly and total
portfolio flows turned negative. By end-March 2008, reflecting political uncertainty and power
outages, South Africa’s EMBIG spread widened more than those of other EMEs with large current
account deficits, before receding somewhat by mid-year.

Financing of the current account deficit has become less reliable. In 2007Q4, widening interest
rate differentials vis-à-vis mature markets appeared to have encouraged banks to repatriate foreign
assets to the tune of US$3.5 billion. In 2008Q1 a one-off deal—the purchase of a 20 percent stake in
Standard Bank by ICBC, a major Chinese bank—led to a large net FDI inflow (US$4.5 billion). In
addition, nonresidents increased deposits with South African banks by some US$2.5 billion, possibly
reflecting a shift in the composition of inflows in response to higher interest rates. These flows could
be volatile and thus not a reliable source of financing for the current account deficit in the longer run.

10

10.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s macroeconomic projections, the
principal difference being their more optimistic outlook for the current account. They
envisage a current account deficit in 2008–09 of 7–8 percent of GDP mainly reflecting lower
oil price assumptions (by 19 percent on average in 2008–09) and lower projections for net
factor payments abroad, compared with the staff’s projection.
11.
The authorities concurred that risks have sharpened, particularly with regard
to the current account deficit, but underscored that the outlook remains positive on the
whole, and the risks manageable. They stressed that the widening of the current account
deficit reflects in part the ongoing investment drive to address infrastructure constraints—
which the staff agreed was essential for South Africa to maintain its growth momentum over
the medium term. They were confident that nonresident investors would continue to fund the
current account deficit, as they would recognize that these resources were being channeled to
productive investments that would yield a globally competitive rate of return.
12.
The authorities also emphasized that South Africa’s fundamentals prepare it to
weather possible shocks. The country still has a low level of external debt (26½ percent of
GDP at end-2007), over 40 percent of which is denominated in rand. Gross reserves exceed
short-term foreign currency debt by a comfortable margin. The banking sector is sound, and
corporate and financial sector balance sheet exposures to exchange rate and interest rate
shocks are limited, even if pockets of weakness exist among over-extended households. The
authorities underscored their continued commitment to the current stability-oriented
macroeconomic policy framework, which would bolster investor confidence. Should
sentiment change anyway, foreign investors would share in the adjustment due to the flexible
exchange regime and the high proportion of their investments held in rand, particularly in the
form of equity.
13.
Staff agreed that South Africa’s fundamentals remain strong, but emphasized
that the size and relatively rapid expansion of the current account deficit itself posed
risks. Staff analysis suggests that South Africa’s

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Box 3. Summary of Previous Consultation Discussions
There has been broad agreement on policies, as the Fund has generally supported the authorities’ choices
on fiscal policy, inflation targeting, exchange rate policies, international reserves accumulation, and
exchange control liberalization. On structural policies, the Fund has supported South Africa’s fiscal and
financial sector reforms, and trade liberalization. It has encouraged identifying and revising aspects of
labor legislation and institutions that constrain job creation. The Fund has also recommended further
liberalization and simplification of the trade regime; the authorities have indicated that actions in this
area depend on the outcome of multilateral negotiations.

SARB officials stressed the challenges of addressing the most recent wave of
global food and fuel price increases, which has caught South Africa late in a monetary
tightening cycle launched initially to address domestic demand pressures. The SARB
has raised its policy rate by a cumulative 300 basis points since June 2007, on top of the 200
basis point increase in 2006 (Figure 3). It has faced a sharp increase in inflation and inflation
expectations since the beginning of this year, at a time when its tightening cycle would have
been expected to end as activity slowed. The SARB has noted that it will tighten as needed to

Food items account for 26 percent of the CPIX basket, and gasoline for about 5 percent. These weights will,
however, decline to about 18 percent and 3½ percent, respectively, from January 2009, based on weights from
the 2005–06 household survey.

anchor inflation expectations and contain
the second-round effects of global price
shocks. Even as it has continued to tighten
its policy stance, the SARB has implicitly
accepted a lengthening of the time horizon
within which inflation is forecast to return
to the target band. Officials explained that
this reflected their preference for raising the
policy rate at an even pace (usually 50 basis
points) to avoid the risk of policy volatility,
given the uncertainty surrounding the
inflation forecast.

16.
Staff supported the tightening of monetary policy and suggested that further
rate increases are likely to be needed to bring inflation down. The SARB’s actions are in
line with those of many other central banks facing similar shocks and the professional
consensus on the appropriate response. 5 In staff’s view, further tightening is likely to be
needed for inflation to fall within the target band in a reasonable time period, provided
supply shocks do not reverse and the output slowdown does not exert stronger-than-expected
downward pressure on inflation. Staff also supported the effective lengthening of the
monetary policy horizon given the large size of the shocks—the full effects of which are still
working their way through the price system—and the unusual degree of uncertainty
surrounding both their future path and the inflation forecast.
17.
High levels of household debt pose a risk of unintended side effects from
monetary policy tightening. The average household debt service ratio is approaching levels
last seen in the second half of 1998, when an interest rate spike caused a noticeable
deterioration in loan quality. Practically all household loans in South Africa carry a floating
interest rate that tracks the policy rate closely. As the distribution of debt by household
income is not reliably known, monetary tightening could have a larger-than-expected effect
on household consumption and, eventually, the output gap. Given the strength of the
financial system (see paragraphs 28–32), the risk is mainly macroeconomic, rather than
systemic, in nature (Box 4). SARB officials noted that they keep a close watch on the
average ratio of households’ debt service to disposable income and felt that there was room
for some additional tightening. Staff suggested that monetary policy deliberations ought to be
informed by the collection and regular analysis of data on the distribution of household debt
and debt service by income category since averages can mask tail risks. Assessments of
financial system stability should also feed in to ensure—particularly at this stage of an
extended tightening cycle—that cyclical and financial system effects of policy rate increases
are assessed correctly.

South Africa.”

13
Box 4. Risks from Rising Household Debt
Mortgage nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios are rising, most likely as a result of the increase in
interest rates. Rising mortgage rates seem to affect NPL ratios with a lag of 4–6 months. This impact
could be accelerated and amplified by the slowdown in housing prices and real disposable income since
late 2007.
The increase in mortgage NPL ratios has been steeper than in the previous cycle in 2002. Since
the interest rate tightening cycle started in June 2006, mortgage debt repayments have expanded by
some 36 percent. Each 100 basis points increase in mortgage rates has been associated with a rise in the
mortgage NPL ratio of 0.5 percent—an impact four times larger than during the previous tightening
cycle in 2002. This effect may be due in part to the much higher household indebtedness in June 2006
relative to the start of the previous tightening cycle. It could also indicate that a new class of
borrowers—middle-income households—is being disproportionately affected by rising interest rates.
Recent surveys (Credit Suisse Standard Securities, 2007 and 2008) show that most of the expansion in
debt has occurred among the middle class, while higher-income households’ debt exposure has
remained constant or even declined. Still, the risk of large-scale foreclosures appears limited, as the
“originate and hold” mortgage model prevails and banks tend to engage in debt workouts with troubled
borrowers.

The banking system appears to be resilient to a deterioration in asset quality. FSAP Update stress
tests suggest that banks could easily withstand a variety of large shocks. Specifically, basic stress tests
assuming a default of all counterparties with a probability of default greater than 10 percent indicate
that the impact would be limited to below 3¾ percentage points of bank capital for each large bank.

14
Clear communications to contain inflation expectations
18.
Staff noted that the ongoing supply shocks and rising inflation expectations
heighten the importance of clear communication, a key part of the inflation targeting
regime. The quality of the SARB’s written communications is high, with analysis of
economic risks and rationale for policy decisions clearly laid out. At the same time, to help
contain the rise in inflation expectations and discourage backward-looking wage indexation,
additional efforts could be made—both by the SARB and the government—to educate the
public about the nature of the current shocks and the absence of a long-run tradeoff between
inflation and growth. As also noted by some market analysts, the SARB could also improve
communication at the margin, for instance, by having the inflation fan chart reflect the
Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) assessment of the inflation outlook and risks and
publishing it and the quantitative outlook each time the MPC’s decision is announced. It may
also be useful to explore the possibility of communicating in broad terms the MPC’s future
policy intentions in the statement issued after MPC meetings, as is the practice among some
inflation targeting central banks.
19.
The authorities agreed on the importance of a careful communications strategy.
Their efforts have been geared at explaining their actions to the public, both through their
publications and through public fora held all over the country on a semi-annual basis. They
have set out to explain the global nature of recent shocks and to offer context by discussing
the actions of other central banks around the world. The authorities also felt that they convey
sufficient information on their outlook for inflation, and that attempting to provide additional
or more structured signals of their possible future actions to diverse audiences would be
risky, as such signals would be easy to misinterpret as commitments.
B. Addressing Vulnerabilities
Tighter fiscal policy to avoid exacerbating current account pressures
20.
South Africa’s large current account deficit reflects a somewhat overvalued
exchange rate (see paragraph 26) and a rising rate of investment that is funded by
foreign saving. External stability therefore depends closely on maintaining foreign investors’
confidence in South Africa’s continued stable macroeconomic policies and good growth
prospects. The inflation targeting framework, including the operational independence of the
SARB, and prudent fiscal policy are both critical to investor perceptions of stable
macroeconomic policies.
21.
The steady strengthening of the public finances has been a positive factor in
maintaining investor confidence even as the current account deficit has widened
(Figure 4). For the second year running, the national government posted a fiscal surplus
in 2007/2008. Revenue was boosted beyond budgeted levels by strong income growth and
commodity prices, as well as improved efficiency in tax collection. On the expenditure side,

15
an increase in social spending and transfers
to municipalities and public corporations
more than offset a decline in interest
payments. The public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) was broadly balanced,
which allowed public sector debt to decline
to 35.4 percent of GDP by end-2007.

23.
In view of the risks from the large current account deficit, the already high
burden on monetary policy, and plans to raise public investment significantly, staff
suggested that government saving could be increased gradually to bring the structural
PSBR to zero over the medium term. With existing government and public enterprise
investment plans treated as a given, this would imply increasing the government’s cyclicallyadjusted overall balance by 1½–2 percentage points of GDP over the next three years starting
in FY2009/10. Such an increase in government saving would help assure markets and foreign
investors that the government is taking firm action to ensure that the public sector does not
add to the rising external imbalance. As the offsetting decline in private saving for a given
increase in public saving tends to be greater for tax increases than for expenditure cuts, the

16
fiscal strengthening would be more effective if achieved by containing the growth in current
spending.
24.
While agreeing that the current account deficit posed risks, the authorities
indicated that there was little leeway to increase government saving given the rising
demand for public services. South Africa’s comparatively weak outcomes in education and
health, and high crime rate limited the scope for containing current spending. With little
prospect of raising national saving, they had no choice but to rely on foreign saving to fund
the higher public investment needed to relieve the constraint on growth from electricity and
other infrastructure bottlenecks. That said, the authorities stressed their commitment to a
prudent budget policy and their expectation that these policies would continue after the
political transition next year as well. The authorities also noted that they had taken advantage
of the strong growth over the last several years to reduce government and public debt to
moderate levels, and hence a modest widening of the PSBR to fund investment needs posed
limited risks. Staff recognized the constraints faced by the authorities, but felt there was some
scope for increasing saving by seeking better value for money and placing more emphasis on
policy reform, rather than additional spending—especially since spending in areas such as
education was not low by international comparison (see paragraph 36).
External policies geared to cushioning shocks
25.
South Africa maintains a flexible exchange rate system. The rand is a relatively
volatile currency—partly reflecting the relatively high proportion of off-shore trading.
Officials noted that, in line with its published policy, the SARB purchases foreign exchange
in the market to build up gradually its reserve position, without seeking to influence the value
of the exchange rate. They emphasized their commitment to a freely floating exchange rate,
and indicated that the rand would be allowed to depreciate in the event of capital outflows, as
in early 2008. Staff agreed that the exchange rate should be allowed to adjust flexibly,
including in the event of an adverse shock.
26.
The Fund’s methodology for assessing the level of the exchange rate suggests
that the rand may be moderately overvalued, although considerable uncertainty
surrounds this estimate. Staff’s assessment, based on two methodologies, suggests that the
rand’s overvaluation was about 13–16 percent in mid-2008, reflecting the projected large
current account deficits (Box 5). However, a third methodology suggests undervaluation of
about 12 percent, indicating the range of uncertainty surrounding the estimates. The
authorities view the exchange rate as the outcome of market forces and in line with
fundamentals. They dismissed as counterproductive—and the staff agreed—calls from some
quarters to try to influence the level of the real exchange rate through intervention.

17

Box 5. The Real Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
Staff’s assessment of South Africa’s exchange rate is based on the IMF’s CGER methodology, using
data as of mid-2008.1 Two of the methods—the macroeconomic balance approach and the external
sustainability approach, which compare the medium-term current account deficit to a “norm” derived from
cross-country analysis—yielded an overvaluation of about 13 and 16 percent, respectively, reflecting the
substantial projected current account deficits, even after adjusting for the temporary rise in public
investment.2 Under the third method—the equilibrium REER approach (a single-equation method relating
the real effective exchange rate to its fundamental determinants)—the rand appeared undervalued by
12 percent, mainly reflecting high commodity export prices.
South Africa’s export performance has been somewhat lackluster. In value terms, South Africa’s
market share has been rising gently since 2002, in line with the upward trend in world commodity prices. In
real terms, however, market share has been on a declining trend reflecting in part the falling volume of gold
exports. Export performance has varied across the four largest destinations.

Survey-based evidence suggests that South Africa has room for improving competitiveness in some
areas. It scores relatively weakly on economic performance (reflecting its large current account deficit and
high unemployment) and infrastructure, and comparatively well on government efficiency. Overall, among
selected EMEs, South Africa ranks close to Brazil and Mexico, but not as high as Chile and the more
dynamic Asian economies.

The methodology uses three approaches, which the staff has adapted to South Africa’s circumstances. Using
comparisons with other EMEs, staff estimates South Africa’s current account norm at about 3.3–4.1 percent of
GDP, although estimates are sensitive to assumptions (see IMF Country Report 07/274). The medium-term
(2013) current account deficit, stripped of temporary factors, is projected at 7.2 percent of GDP.
2

Temporary factors should be excluded from the assessment of the equilibrium exchange rate. Including the
surge in public investment, the estimated overvaluation would rise to 20 and 24 percent, respectively.

The authorities indicated that they intend to continue strengthening gradually
their gross international reserves, which rose to US$34.9 billion at end-June 2008. They

Enhancing the resilience of the financial system
28.
A robust financial system is critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability
and increasing the economy’s resilience to shocks. The FSAP Update found that South
Africa’s financial system is sound, underpinned by a well-established legal and financial
infrastructure and a generally effective regulatory framework. Financial institutions have
enjoyed good profitability, capitalization levels and reserves, and the system so far has
weathered the global financial market turmoil without major pressures. The implementation

19
of Basel II at the start of 2008 has proceeded smoothly and is largely capital-neutral for the
largest banks.
29.
Financial institutions are now, however, facing a less benign environment and
are beginning to see the effects of slowing economic activity and rising interest rates on
asset quality and returns. With households’ indebtedness at record levels and their debt
service burden rising, the banking system is facing elevated credit risk in its household loan
portfolio. Also, the concentration of banks’ deposits on relatively few large corporations
makes their balance sheets sensitive to changes in sentiment about the relative strength of
individual banks. In such an environment, staff recommended that the SARB should continue
its forward-looking proactive engagement with banks and use the scope available under
Basel II to ensure that capital buffers in banks are adequate to cope with increasing risks. In
addition, it would be important to closely monitor emerging risks through robust financial
stability analysis, particularly regular offsite integrated top-down and bottom-up stress
testing, including of adverse macroeconomic scenarios. Such tests of systemic stability based
on individual bank data would allow the identification of tail risks that may not be evident in
aggregate top down exercises. Staff also recommended that bank liquidity and funding risks
should also be monitored closely.
30.
Staff welcomed the strengthening of the framework for contingency planning
and emergency liquidity assistance as a bulwark for mitigating the fallout, should an
adverse event occur. The Financial Sector Contingency Forum aims to facilitate interagency coordination and preparedness for addressing crises. Staff suggested that the
arrangements should be periodically tested and the authorities should consider undertaking a
crisis simulation exercise relating to a macrofinancial shock such as a capital outflow or
distress in a large financial sector institution.
31.
The FSAP Update also found that South Africa’s regulatory framework for the
financial sector is modern and generally effective and suggested some areas for further
strengthening, including:
•
Consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates. This should be possible within
existing organizational arrangements by combining strong sectoral supervision with a focus
on risks that cut across intermediaries within a financial group. Coordination among
regulators and policy makers could be strengthened, with gaps and overlaps minimized, and
respective responsibilities clearly delineated;
•
Risk management, corporate governance, internal controls in the nonbank sector.
Continue efforts by the Financial Services Board to develop standards for corporate
governance, risk management, and internal controls and harmonize its risk-based models for
different sectors. Further measures are also needed to encourage the consolidation of pension
funds and to strengthen their governance and risk management;
•
Furthering the reach of financial services. Fostering greater competition and
innovation in developing affordable, flexible, and appropriate financial products for the low-

20
income market. This will require a regulatory environment that provides space for innovation
while maintaining financial stability.
32.
The authorities broadly agreed with the findings and recommendations of the
FSAP Update. They indicated that they would continue to enhance their risk analysis,
including by exploring ways to conduct systemic stress testing while protecting the
confidentiality of individual bank data. Staff encouraged the authorities to explore
mechanisms used by other countries to overcome this hurdle. The authorities noted that their
crisis management systems had been tested to some extent by several actual (nonsystemic)
crises, but agreed to consider a simulation of the sort suggested by staff, provided they could
ensure that the simulation itself does not become a source of risk. The authorities indicated
that they were exploring possibilities for consolidating supervision of financial
conglomerates, for instance, by establishing supervisory “colleges” (comprising supervisors
from different agencies) for each conglomerate. The authorities also indicated that they
would consider the various detailed recommendations of the FSAP Update, including those
pertaining to insurance, pensions, and securities markets. They planned to convene an interagency forum to discuss the detailed findings and to develop proposals for addressing them.
C. Fostering Shared Growth
33.
The authorities’ medium-term growth strategy (ASGISA) aims to raise growth
from 4½ percent in 2005–09 to 6 percent in 2010–14 by addressing six key constraints
on growth: (i) inadequate infrastructure and logistics; (ii) skills shortages; (iii) barriers to
entry and competition in several key economic sectors; (iv) the regulatory environment;
(v) capacity limitations within the government; and (vi) the volatility of the exchange rate. 6
However, structural reforms to address these constraints have lagged, in part because of the
complexities of addressing problems inherited from the apartheid era and resistance by
vested interests.

long-term investment, the overall evidence on its harmful effects was inconclusive (see IMF Country Report

lower total factor productivity growth. 7 While a number of factors have affected
investment, low national saving seems to be the most important one. South Africa’s national
saving rate has fallen sharply since the mid-1980s and is now low compared with that of
other EMEs. While the household saving rate is very low, it is mainly the decline in
corporate saving (which comprised 97 percent of nongovernment saving in 1997–2007) that
has driven the national ratio downward. Closer analysis suggests that private saving has
evolved in line with the structural (e.g., urbanization, demographics) and economic
fundamentals of the economy, which would be difficult to reverse. Higher public saving
appears to be the main option available to raise national savings over the medium term, even
with a partial offset from the private sector. To the extent that it is politically infeasible to
increase public saving by an adequately large amount, staff argued that more emphasis would
need to be placed on (i) modifying government revenue and expenditure policies to support
growth and employment; and (ii) implementing structural reforms to boost total factor
productivity growth.

Growth and employment could be strengthened by continuing to rebalance the
government’s revenue-expenditure policies within a given overall fiscal stance. For
instance, combining the increase in public infrastructure investment with cuts in the
corporate income tax could boost growth. 8 Cuts in the personal income tax—aimed at
benefiting the middle income range of skilled workers and small business—or a wage
subsidy could raise employment, although the gains may be modest. Such a package could be
financed by the planned introduction of mining royalties—capturing some of the economic
rents provided by high mineral prices—environment-friendly levies, or property taxes, and
slower growth in government consumption than currently planned. Adverse distribution
consequences could be addressed by appropriate adjustments in the transfer system. In a
similar vein, staff noted that it will be important over the medium term to make sure that the

planned social security reform is designed to avoid negative effects on labor costs,
competitiveness, the fiscal balance, and national saving.
36.
Structural reforms, particularly in labor and product markets, are critical for
improving total factor productivity and employment growth. The ASGISA framework
has already identified limited competition, skill shortages, and implementation capacity
within government among the factors constraining growth. While efforts are being made to
address these issues, much remains to be done. Staff suggested that:
•
opening up the economy to greater international competition is critical for efficiency.
The overall level of protection could be further reduced and the MFN import tariff structure
simplified, including by reducing the number of tariff bands and lines;
•
lowering administrative and regulatory burdens in product and labor markets could
also help foster labor-intensive growth in tradables; 9
•
involving the private sector in public service provision could improve efficiency,
including through greater competition in electricity generation and distribution, port services,
and rail transport; 10 and
•
improving educational attainment is important for ensuring labor productivity gains in
the long term. Since South Africa already spends comparatively generously on education,
efforts need to focus on improving results within the existing budget envelope and raising
student achievement towards international standards.
37.
The authorities agreed that growth would benefit from further structural
reforms, but had different views on the potential for reform in certain areas. They were
skeptical of the growth dividend from additional cuts in the corporate tax rate. While they
agreed that further opening the economy to external competition would increase efficiency,
their preference was to take decisions in this area in the context of multilateral negotiations.
They pointed to efforts to identify interventions to raise the productivity of education

A recent OECD report links weak product market competition and low labor utilization in South Africa,
noting that the former has enabled “large incumbent firms to set high prices and make excess returns, which in
turn makes possible for them to pay wages above…the market clearing wage rate”. The report stresses the
complementarities between measures to strengthen product market competition and policies to facilitate
mobility in labor markets, which would permit more job-rich, equitable growth. OECD, Economic Assessment
of South Africa, July 2008, pp. 5–6.

10

The OECD report also finds that “the overall burden of regulation is relatively heavy by OECD standards and
…state ownership and interference impose high barriers to entry in many areas. In particular, the lack of
competition and uncertain decision-making processes in network industries impede their efficient development
in terms of productivity and innovation, with negative spillover effects for the whole economy.” OECD,
Economic Assessment of South Africa, July 2008, Summary, p.2.

spending—which they considered unsatisfactory—but noted that improvements in quality
may require additional public spending.
D. Regional Integration
38.
South Africa attaches high importance to efforts to promote regional economic
integration within the framework of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC). SADC is scheduled to initiate a free trade agreement (FTA) at its annual summit
meeting in mid-August, although not all fourteen members of SADC will participate. The
FTA was to be a stepping stone towards implementing a SADC customs union in 2010, but
South African officials noted that this timetable was no longer achievable. In their view, a
realistic plan for a regional customs union would likely have to be based on some form of
gradual expansion of the existing Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU).
39.
Seven SADC countries have been negotiating an Economic Partnership
Agreement (EPA) with the European Union. Four of the five members of SACU
(Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland), along with Mozambique, initialed an Interim
EPA with the EU in late 2007, and discussions on elements of a full EPA with the EU are
ongoing. South Africa did not sign the Interim EPA, but is continuing negotiations with the
EU on trade and market access issues.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
South Africa has made significant economic strides over the past several years.
Output and income have expanded steadily, while inflation has remained moderate until
recently. Strong employment growth has reduced unemployment despite a sustained increase
in labor force participation. These achievements can be attributed in no small measure to
sound macroeconomic policies, implemented in the context of a transparent policy
framework, which have provided a stable environment for private sector activity.
41.
The short-term outlook has deteriorated and downside risks have increased
significantly. Growth is expected to be constrained for some time until the infrastructure
investment program bears fruit, while inflation stays elevated due to global price shocks and
the external current account deficit remains high, underscoring the dependence on potentially
volatile capital inflows. The main risks stem from a possible loss in investor confidence and
sudden stop in capital inflows; a possible further deterioration in the global economic
environment, especially a significant increase in the world oil price; and high levels of
household indebtedness, particularly as interest rates are raised to combat inflation and
income growth slows. The impact of any shocks would be mitigated to some extent by South
Africa’s strong fundamentals, which include a sound macroeconomic policy framework, a
low level of short-term external debt, and strong financial system balance sheets.
42.
The SARB’s tightening of monetary policy and effective lengthening of the
policy horizon have been appropriate responses to the successive supply shocks from

24
food and energy prices. Further monetary policy tightening may be needed to anchor
inflation expectations and contain second-round effects, if supply shocks do not reverse and
the downward pressure on inflation from slowing activity does not turn out to be larger than
expected. It will be important, in this context, to monitor closely the impact of high interest
rates on overextended households. Clear and consistent communications to the markets and
public will also be important in influencing inflation expectations and containing secondround effects.
43.
Fiscal policy could be geared to addressing vulnerabilities by not adding to the
rising external imbalance and bolstering investor confidence. Given plans to raise public
investment, government saving could be increased starting next fiscal year to reduce the
structural public sector borrowing requirement to zero over the next three years. Maintaining
a broadly unchanged cyclically-adjusted overall government balance this year would help
safeguard macroeconomic stability by allowing the full play of automatic stabilizers in
response to cyclical conditions. Beyond that, taking public sector investment plans as a
given, the PSBR could be reduced to zero by increasing the cyclically-adjusted general
government balance by 1½–2 percent of GDP over the next three years. Containing current
expenditure, rather than raising taxes, may be more effective as offsetting behavior by the
private sector is likely to be less pronounced for spending than for taxes.
44.
South Africa’s floating exchange rate regime provides an important buffer
against external risks. The flexibility of the rand has contributed to limiting foreign
exchange exposure in corporate and financial sector balance sheets and discourages
speculative inflows when interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the rest of the world widen.
Moreover, in the event of a sudden stop in capital inflows, the flexible rate implies that
foreign investors would share in the adjustment burden. The exchange rate appears
moderately overvalued, but is driven by private sector behavior rather than public policies.
45.
The government’s policy of gradually building up international reserves
remains appropriate. An adequate reserve cover is also an important cushion against
current account vulnerabilities. Although reserves are comfortable in relation to short-term
debt, they are less so when measured against other indicators.
46.
The FSAP Update found that South Africa’s sophisticated financial system is
broadly sound, well capitalized, and well regulated, but now faces a less benign
environment as activity slows and interest rates rise. In this context, the SARB should
continue its forward-looking proactive engagement with banks and use the scope available
under Basel II to ensure that capital buffers in banks are adequate to cope with increasing
risks. In addition, it would be important to closely monitor emerging risks, particularly
related to high levels of household debt, through integrated, forward-looking financial
stability analysis based on bank-level data. The strengthening of the framework for financial
contingency planning and emergency liquidity assistance is welcome and periodic testing,
including through crisis simulations, may be useful. The regulatory framework could be

25
further strengthened by consolidating the supervision of financial conglomerates; continuing
efforts to strengthen insurance and pension supervision; and fostering greater competition
and innovation in meeting the needs of the low-income market.
47.
The pressing need to accelerate growth and employment over the medium term
is clear, the question is how to do this without jeopardizing macroeconomic and
financial stability. South Africa’s low national saving rate is a constraint on raising
investment on a sustained basis to levels seen in comparable emerging market countries.
Raising public savings should be the first step in boosting national savings. If the scope for
raising public saving, and hence investment, is limited, more emphasis needs to be placed on
other policies to boost productivity and employment growth. Modifying government revenue
and expenditure policies within a given overall fiscal stance to strengthen incentives to invest
and work is an option. Possibilities could be explored—for instance, further cuts in corporate
taxes or well-targeted wage subsidies financed by the planned introduction of mining
royalties or property taxes, or a slowdown in government consumption.
48.
Structural reforms, particularly in labor and product markets are also critical
for improving productivity and employment growth. More focus could be given to:
(i) opening up the economy to greater international competition by reducing and simplifying
tariffs; (ii) strengthening product and labor market competition by lowering administrative
and regulatory burdens; (iii) improving efficiency in public service provision by greater
private sector involvement, particularly in electricity generation and distribution, port and rail
transport; and (iv) reforms to improve education outcomes for given public spending.
49.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. SOUTH AFRICA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
South Africa’s public debt position remains sustainable. The ratio of government debt to
GDP continues to fall steeply, from 35¼ percent in 2005 to 28½ percent at end-2007. Under
the policies outlined in the 2008/9 budget and the medium-term expenditure framework,
government debt should continue to decline to below 16 percent of GDP over the next five
years. Gross financing needs should fall to less than 2 percent of GDP per year in the
medium term, significantly below the average of the past five years (Figure 1). Total public
debt would fall more gradually, as public enterprise borrowing to finance their investment
expansion would add about 5½ percent of GDP in debt by 2013 (Table 1).
The declining trend in the public debt-to-GDP ratio appears to be broadly robust to a
variety of shocks, including weaker GDP growth, a lower primary balance, a 30 percent real
depreciation of the exchange rate, and a 10 percent increase in the debt stock (Figure 1).
Under most of these scenarios, the government debt ratio is only slightly above the baseline
over the projection period, and in the case of the “no policy change” scenario it falls well
below. It picks up somewhat, while remaining manageable, in the case of a hypothetical
10 percent contingent liability shock, which is more than the sum of the projected increase in
public enterprise debt over the period and the current stock of government financial
guarantees (3.4 percent of GDP by February 2008).
South Africa’s external debt is projected to rise to about 35 percent of GDP in the
medium term. The current account deficit is projected to remain large during the entire
projection period. During 2008–09, despite slower domestic demand growth, the current
account deficit is projected to widen, reflecting deteriorating terms of trade and the pick up in
public investment with a high import content. The deficit will peak at just over 9½ percent of
GDP in 2009 and decline slightly to about 9 percent of GDP by 2013, as import growth
subsides. The deficit is envisaged to be financed by a mixture of debt and nondebt creating
capital inflows, driving the external debt-to-GDP ratio up to about 35 percent of GDP
by 2011, at which level it would remain in subsequent years.
The outlook for South Africa’s external debt deteriorates without becoming overly
unfavorable under a broad range of shocks (Figure 2). With rand-denominated debt
accounting for 42 percent of external debt at end-2007, currency risk is moderate; the share
of short-term debt in foreign-currency denominated debt (42½ percent at end-2007) implies
moderate rollover risk as well. The results of various stress tests indicate that the largest
adverse impact on the external debt would arise from a larger than projected current account
deficit—a noninterest current account deficit higher by about 1½ percentage points of GDP
on average over the next five years would bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 42 percent by
end-2013. Permanent adverse shocks to real GDP growth and real interest rates, whether
considered individually or together, or a 30 percent one-time real exchange rate depreciation
would have only a minor-to-moderate effect.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The South African rand floats against other currencies. South Africa maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for measures implemented solely for the preservation of national or
international security which South Africa is in the process of notifying the Fund about
pursuant to the procedures set out in Decision No. 144-(52/51) (August 14, 1952). On
May 20, 2008 the exchange rate of the rand was US$0.1318=R1.
With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. They are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets without restriction and
to repatriate dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original
investment capital. Foreign companies, governments and institutions may list on South
Africa’s bond and securities exchanges.

3
Since 1995, exchange controls on capital transaction by residents have also been relaxed.
Rather than completely liberalizing particular types of current or capital transactions, the
authorities have pursued a strategy of allowing an increasing array of transactions, with each
subject to a quantitative cap that has been progressively raised over time. Regarding outward
foreign direct investment by South African corporates, application to the South African
Reserve Bank’s Exchange Control Department is still required for transactions above
R 50 million a year, for monitoring purposes and approval in terms of existing foreign direct
investment criteria, including demonstrated benefit to South Africa. The South African
Reserve Bank (SARB) reserves the right to stagger capital outflows relating to large foreign
direct investments so as to manage any potential impact on the foreign exchange market.
In 2008, the authorities initiated a process of replacing direct exchange controls on local
institutional investors with prudential regulations and relaxing their foreign exposure limits.
Under the new system, the SARB will monitor these investors’ foreign exposure through
quarterly reports, abolishing the existing pre-transaction authorization requests; however,
substantial changes in foreign exposure will still require pre-notification. Institutional
investors are permitted to invest in foreign securities, subject to an overall limit of 20 percent
of their total retail assets for retirement funds and long-term insurers. Investment managers
registered as institutional investors for exchange control purposes and collective investment
schemes management companies are restricted to 30 percent of total retail assets under
management. There is an additional allowance of 5 percent of assets for portfolio investment
in Africa for all institutional investors. Banks’ foreign exposure limit (which remains to be
precisely defined) will be raised to 40 percent of liabilities from 40 percent of capital.
Corporates are not allowed portfolio investment at present. They may, upon application, be
permitted to establish primary listings at stock exchanges offshore under certain conditions.
Their currency proceeds from exports must be repatriated within 180 days from accrual. All
local entities are now allowed to participate in the rand futures market, enabling them to
hedge and diversify their portfolios.
Private individuals are allowed to invest up to R 2 million offshore. In addition to the above,
they can take out further R 500,000 a year in documented discretionary allowance (gifts,
donations, travel, etc.). There are restrictions on the transfer of funds abroad by emigrants
(“blocked funds”). The transfer of blocked funds in excess of R 2 million for individuals and
R 4 million for families is allowed, provided a 10 percent exit levy is paid. Large amounts
may be staggered to manage any impact on the foreign exchange market. Dividends and
interest payments on the blocked funds are freely transferable abroad.

Article IV Consultations

The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 8,
2008. South Africa is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Technical Assistance

4
A FAD mission took place in 2003 to discuss with the National Treasury their draft royalty
bill. A monetary and financial statistics mission took place in 2003, followed up by a visit
during May–June, 2004.
A STA mission, supported by a labor statistics consultant funded by the World Bank,
undertook a review of South Africa Labor Force Statistics in March 2005. The mission
recommended steps to produce statistics that are more reliable, better quality, and more
closely aligned with International Labor Organization (ILO) standards.
A number of LEG missions in 2007-08 assisted the authorities in the ongoing process of
rewriting the Income Tax Act and drafting a new Tax Administration Act.

III. SOUTH AFRICA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes. South Africa subscribed to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on August 2, 1996 and is in observance of
specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data, although using a flexibility
option on the timeliness and periodicity of unemployment data. A Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes—Data Module, Response by the Authorities, and Detailed Assessments
Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) was published on October 16, 2001.
Real sector
The national accounts are compiled according to the SNA 1993. In November 2004, the base
year of the national accounts was changed from 1995 to 2000. At the same time,
benchmarking was undertaken to reflect more accurately the structure of the economy and to
introduce other methodological changes to the compilation of data. These changes resulted in
an upward revision of the average annual growth rate of real GDP for the period 1998 to
2003 from 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent. Reporting of real sector data for International
Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely.
Labor market statistics are published with lags of three months. Given the seriousness of the
unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design would benefit from better,
more frequent and timely labor market data. A new quarterly Labor Force Survey has been
introduced; results for the first and second quarters of 2008 have been published in August
2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all households living in metropolitan and urban areas,
which represent approximately 56 percent of the total number of households and 75 percent
of private consumption expenditures. The CPI weights are based on an Income and
Expenditure of Households Survey conducted from November 1999 to October 2000.
Beginning with the April 2003 index, Statistics South Africa issued revisions to the
Consumer Price Index for the period January 2002 to March 2003, reflecting the
incorporation of more reliable data on residential rents. After finalizing the ongoing analysis
of the 2005 Income and Expenditure Survey, Statistics South Africa plans to update the
weights in the CPI basket in January 2009. At the same time, Statistics South Africa will
change the way of measuring housing costs. The concept of owners’ equivalent rent will be
used to more accurately reflect the cost of the accommodation services derived by owner
occupiers from their own homes.
Government finance
Data are compiled and disseminated according to the GFSM 2001 framework. Data for social
security funds and central government’s extra budgetary funds have been reported on an
accrual basis, starting in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities have
included additional noncash data, consistent with their migration to accrual accounting.

7
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated general government for publication
in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the
cash operations of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS.
Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by SARB are consistent with the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. South Africa regularly reports good quality
monetary statistics for publication in the IFS and the IFS Supplement, although there is room
for improving the timeliness of the data on non-depository financial institutions.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are broadly consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). The authorities are also working with their partners in the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) to improve the coverage of intra-SACU trade
flows. Data reported for Direction of Trade Statistics differ substantially from external trade
data reported for IFS, particularly exports, due to balance of payments adjustments.
The banking sector holdings of foreign-currency assets have been removed from the official
measure of reserves, in accordance with international practice. Data on international reserves
position are disseminated in line with the requirements of the IMF’s template on international
reserves and foreign currency liquidity.
Net errors and omissions in the balance of payments are large, averaging 2 percent of GDP
during 2003–07. Work is ongoing to improve the reliability and accuracy of balance of
payments data.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 8, 2008

1.
This statement summarizes economic developments since the issuance of the staff
report. These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
In July, annual CPIX inflation reached 13 percent, up from 11.6 percent in June,
reflecting a jump in gasoline and electricity prices. Inflation excluding food and energy
prices rose slightly to 6.2 percent. Producer prices increased by 18.9 percent relative to
July 2007.
3.
GDP growth in Q2 was somewhat stronger than consensus at 4.5 percent year-onyear, lifted by good performance in agriculture, nonresidential construction, and
manufacturing. Output in the mining sector remained about 5 percent below its level a year
ago, despite some recovery from an electricity-shortage-induced slump in Q1. As highfrequency indicators point to a slowdown in interest-sensitive industries, staff’s projection of
annual GDP growth in 2008 remains unchanged at 3.8 percent.
4.
The current account deficit in Q2 narrowed to 7.3 percent of GDP on an annualized
basis from 8.9 percent in Q1 on the strength of merchandise exports. It was financed mainly
by net portfolio investment which had been negative the previous quarter. Monthly trade data
indicate that imports rose sharply in July.
5.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the South African Reserve Bank kept the
policy interest rate on hold at 12 percent at its meeting in August. The Committee noted the
decline in international oil prices and domestic agricultural producer prices, as well as the
drop in inflation expectations as measured by the break-even inflation rates derived from the
bond market, reflecting the expected technical effect of reweighing and rebasing the inflation
index in January 2009. The Committee nevertheless observed that significant risks to the
inflation outlook remained.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
South Africa
On September 8, 2008 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with South Africa. 1
Background
South Africa’s economic performance has strengthened in the last several years, with
real GDP growing by 5–5½ percent in 2005–07, inflation declining to mid-single digits
until recently and employment growing steadily. Growth last year was driven by strong
domestic demand, with private consumption and investment spending supported by
robust consumer and business sentiment. Household consumption was also boosted by
growing disposable income, rising employment, and wealth effects from rising asset
prices until late in the year. Total employment grew by 3.4 percent in the year to
September 2007 and the unemployment rate declined to 23 percent.
However, 2008 saw a slowdown in activity reflecting the cumulative impact of electricity
power shortages, the global slowdown, and past monetary tightening. Real GDP growth
slowed to 4.2 percent (year-on-year) in the first half of 2008, and subsequent highfrequency indicators point to further moderation.
Inflation pressures have intensified further. Twelve-month CPIX inflation has been rising
since early 2007—reaching 13 percent in July 2008, well above the South African
Reserve Bank’s (SARB) 3–6 percent target range—mainly reflecting rising global food
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
and fuel prices and, until recently, demand pressures. 2 Inflation expectations for the
year ahead have picked up markedly. In response to the deteriorating inflation outlook,
the SARB has raised its policy interest rate by 300 basis points since June 2007, to
12 percent by June 2008, but decided to keep it on hold in August in light of falling
commodity prices and some moderation in inflation expectations.
Credit to the private sector has begun to moderate but still remains resilient, expanding
by 20.3 percent in the year ending in June 2008. Household debt rose slightly to a
record level of 78¼ percent of disposable income by the first quarter of 2008. Pushed
mainly by rising interest rates, household debt service has risen to about 11¼ percent of
disposable income, but remains below historic highs.
Asset prices continued to rise rapidly in 2007 but has moderated significantly since then.
Strong commodity prices drove the JSE all-share index up by 16 percent in 2007.
In 2008 the index fell by 4 percent through July, reflecting weakness in financial and
manufacturing share prices, which were only partially offset by the strong performance
of resource equities. Residential property prices recently slowed considerably, growing
by about 4 percent in the year ending in June 2008.
The current account deficit expanded sharply to 7¼ percent of GDP in 2007 and almost
9 percent in the first quarter of 2008, driven by strong public and private investment and
rising international oil prices, before narrowing somewhat to 7¼ percent of GDP in the
second quarter of 2008. The deficit was financed by a mixture of equity and debtcreating inflows, bringing external debt to 26½ percent of GDP by end-2007. Net
portfolio flows were negative in the first quarter of 2008 and the current account deficit
was covered by the proceeds from a large foreign direct investment (FDI) deal and an
increase in nonresident bank deposits; net portfolio inflows turned positive again in the
second quarter. Risk premia on South African debt in international markets rose steeply
in the first quarter of 2008, reflecting turmoil in global financial markets, before
moderating somewhat by mid-year.
The SARB has maintained a flexible exchange rate system, with a publicly-announced
policy of purchasing foreign exchange on the market only to bolster its reserve position.
Consistent with this policy, gross reserves grew to US$34.9 billion by June 2008— well
over 200 percent of short-term external debt. After depreciating markedly in early 2008,
the rand strengthened somewhat by end-July 2008. In real effective terms, the rand has
depreciated by 10 percent in the 12 months ending April 2008.
The fiscal balance of the national government turned into a surplus of 0.9 percent of
GDP in FY2007/08, bringing government debt down to about 28 percent of GDP. The
surplus, the second in a row, reflected a large increase in tax revenue, owing to strong
economic activity over most of the period and continued collection efforts. Total public
debt, including obligations of public enterprises and local governments, fell to about
35 percent of GDP.
2

The CPIX—the measure targeted by the SARB—excludes interest payments on mortgage
loans.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the significant economic strides made by South Africa
over the past several years, reflected in high economic growth, low inflation, and rising
employment. These achievements have been based on sound macroeconomic policies
and a transparent policy framework. South Africa’s economic fundamentals remain
strong, the external debt is low, and the financial system is resilient.
Recent developments, however, have heightened economic vulnerabilities and made
more challenging the achievement of the authorities’ medium-term growth strategy. In
particular, global food and fuel price shocks have boosted inflation and the external
current account deficit, while economic growth has slowed in the context of still-high
levels of unemployment and inequality. On the domestic side, an elevated household
debt and debt service burden poses further risks to growth and possibly to pockets of
the financial system. The deterioration of the economic outlook has heightened the risk
of a slowdown of capital inflows. Directors accordingly underlined the importance of
continuing to address the constraints to economic growth and job creation, while taking
steps to preserve macroeconomic stability and strengthen economic resilience. This will
require redoubled efforts to raise South Africa’s national saving rate, improve
infrastructure, and implement further structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ pursuit of a prudent fiscal policy, and their intention
to maintain a broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2008 while strengthening the social safety
net in response to the increase in food prices. Directors acknowledged South Africa’s
pressing infrastructure and social spending needs, and noted the authorities’ plan to
raise public investment significantly. Given the importance of sustaining investor
confidence and the limited scope for raising private saving, most Directors called for an
increase in public saving so as to bring the structural public sector borrowing
requirement to zero over the next few years. This should be achieved mainly by
containing current expenditure and increasing spending efficiency. Several Directors
suggested that the authorities explore options for addressing infrastructure and social
needs that would avoid weakening fiscal policy—for example, by relying more widely on
public-private partnerships established within an appropriate transparent regulatory
regime.
Directors considered that the inflation targeting framework has served South Africa well.
They supported the tightening of monetary policy so far in 2008 to contain inflation
expectations and the second-round effects of the food and fuel price shocks. They noted
the central bank’s current pause in further tightening, but considered that the authorities
should stand ready to raise interest rates further if supply shocks resume or domestic
demand pressures do not dampen as expected. Some Directors considered that
conditions warrant the resumption of monetary tightening. Directors also considered the
effective lengthening of the policy horizon for bringing inflation back within target range
to be appropriate, given the increase in inflationary pressures. They commended the
high quality of the central bank’s written communications and public discussions, and
underscored the continued importance of a clear communication strategy for containing
inflation expectations.

4
Directors considered that South Africa’s floating exchange rate has served as a useful
buffer against external shocks, limiting foreign exchange exposure in balance sheets
and discouraging speculative inflows. While acknowledging the considerable uncertainty
surrounding estimates of the equilibrium value of the currency, Directors took note of the
staff’s tentative assessment that the currency may be moderately overvalued. Directors
supported the authorities’ policy of gradually building up international reserves.
Directors welcomed the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update finding
that South Africa’s financial system is sound, well capitalized, and well regulated. They
stressed the importance of the authorities’ continued proactive engagement with banks
to ensure that capital and liquidity buffers are adequate—especially in the current
context of a less benign environment, including high exposure to the household sector.
Directors called for prompt implementation of the FSAP update recommendations—in
particular, those relating to deeper forward-looking financial stability analysis based on
bank-level data, and to an improved regulatory framework based on consolidation of the
supervision of financial conglomerates and strengthened insurance and pension
supervision.
Directors stressed the importance of structural reforms to boost productivity and
employment growth. Possible fiscal reforms to be explored include deficit-neutral
modifications to revenue and expenditure policies aimed at strengthening incentives to
invest and work. Directors also encouraged the authorities to persevere with steps to
open the economy to greater international competition, strengthen product and labor
market competition, and improve education outcomes.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for South Africa
and Goolam Aboobaker, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 8, 2008
Introduction
1.
The South African authorities find the Article IV report a fair reflection of their
discussions with the Fund staff. They agree with the broad thrust of the Staff appraisal. They
find the FSAP Update to be thorough and are in broad agreement with the recommendations
contained therein.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
After several years of robust, above-trend economic growth of about 5 percent, real
GDP growth has slowed down in 2008. GDP growth in the first quarter slowed to 2.1 percent
having been badly affected by serious electricity supply disruption that affected both mining
and manufacturing output. However, second quarter data indicate a significant rebound,
pushed by mining, agriculture, manufacturing, and construction, with an annualized growth
rate of 4.9 percent in Q2. A star performer in the first half has been gross fixed capital
formation (GFCF), which accelerated at 16.9 percent q/q in Q1. Although it slowed to 9.1
percent in Q2, if the trend continues, GFCF would push potential growth into a higher
trajectory for the medium term.
3.
South Africa has not been immune to the inflationary pressure arising mainly from
increases in global food and oil prices. Inflation has continued to rise with CPIX inflation
reaching 13 percent in July 2008 y/y and is expected to peak later this year before beginning
a downward trajectory. The South African Reserve Bank has acted decisively by tightening
monetary policy in order to dampen inflationary pressures and to counter second round
effects as well as inflationary expectations. The repurchase rate has risen by a cumulative
500 basis points (bps) since June 2006. This has brought down retail sales and household
consumption continues to decelerate. Recent data indicate that private sector credit extension
has also begun to moderate.
4.
Results released from the latest quarterly labor force survey indicate that the economy
has continued to create employment and show that in the first quarter of 2008 the level of
formal non-agricultural employment increased by 3.9 percent. However, the unemployment
rate, standing at about 23 percent, remains high. Of particular concern is the unemployment
rate amongst the youth (15 – 24 years) which is recorded at over 40 percent. The authorities
consider appropriate measures to tackling this problem a priority.
5.
In the context of slow employment growth and widespread poverty, the authorities
continue to rely on social transfers to ensure that benefits of economic growth are shared
equitably. Recent data indicate that the roll out of social security grants, principally child

2
support grants and old age pensions, increased to a total of 12.4 million beneficiaries. Social
transfers comprise 3.1 percent of GDP. There has also been a significant decrease in the
number of people living below the various poverty lines. However, while the income of all
sectors of the population has increased, the level of inequality has remained high.

Preliminary estimates indicate a widening of the current account deficit in the first
quarter of 2008 to 8.9 from 7.3 percent for 2007 but a narrowing back to 7.3 percent in the
second quarter largely because exports increased by 20 percent. Nonetheless, the concerns
about the size of the deficit remains, underpinning the need to accelerate exports and increase
savings as indicated in several statements by the authorities. However, we need to reiterate
an observation contained in a recent survey of the South African economy by the OECD that
this “deficit does not correspond to public dissaving, but to private savings-investment
behavior.” The pressure on the current account has come largely from the public and private
sector investment program with significant import components. Moreover, South Africa’s
external debt at 26.6 percent of GDP in 2007 remains low.
Fiscal Policy
7.
The authorities remain committed to fiscal prudence. Their 2008 consolidated
national budget made provision for a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP, with slightly declining
surpluses in 2009 and 2010. The authorities also made provision for a public sector
borrowing requirement of 1.3 percent of GDP over the MTEF period to ensure that financing
requirements of state owned enterprises, municipalities, and other public entities are met.
8.
The authorities agree that the downside risk posed by a widening of the current
account deficit is a serious concern, especially in light of current developments in the global
economic environment. The staff suggestion of a significant improvement in government
savings is in line with the authorities’ thinking; and will remain an important objective of
fiscal policy into the foreseeable future. However, the authorities remain uncertain as to the
desirability of increasing savings at the pace recommended by the staff. The concern is that
while the suggested government savings may be expected to improve the current account, it
would not significantly relieve the financing concerns of the economy as a whole. In
addition, in the short term this would require significant increase in the tax burden or
reduction in consumption expenditure (short-term opportunities for efficiency gains are
limited), the net effect on the economy and broader economic environment of such an
aggressive increase in government savings could in fact be negative. The authorities agree
with staff that low savings rate is a key constraint on increasing investment on a sustained
basis. This is a recurring theme that the authorities regularly articulate through public
statements.
9.
The authorities have noted the serious decline in corporate savings which appears to
correlate with the increase in revenue. However, they are uncertain that in order to boost
corporate savings, the corporate income tax rate has to be reduced further. While the

3
corporate tax rate was reduced from 35 percent in 1996 to 29 percent in 2007, corporate
savings declined.
Monetary policy
10.
Inflation outlook has deteriorated as a result of a combination of factors –
depreciation of the South African Rand against USD and other major currencies, the upward
revisions in oil prices and administered prices. The SARB has responded to the deterioration
in inflation by increasing the repo rate by a cumulative 500 bps since June 2006 resulting in
an increase in money market rates. The authorities agreed on the importance of clear
communication of their inflation targeting approach to combating inflation and its
expectations.
11.
The ZAR depreciated by 11.9 percent against the US$ at end-August 2008 mainly
because of risk aversion among global investors, bigger current account deficit and the
expected impact of electricity supply constraints on economic growth. The daily turnover of
foreign exchange against the ZAR in domestic foreign exchange market has also seen an
increase, reaching a peak of US$ 14.4 billion at the end of 2007. There has also been a
significant increase in the volatility of the ZAR’s exchange rate, reaching a high of 28.2
percent before declining to 17.0 percent. International reserves at end July 2008 stood at
US$ 35 billion and the Authorities remain committed to increasing reserves which currently
are adequate to cover 3.2 months of imports of goods and services
12.
The authorities reaffirm their commitment to the flexible exchange rate system as it
continues to serve them well and have noted the conflicting results produced by Fund
methodologies regarding its value.
13.
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the local equity bourse, has seen an
increase in equity prices of about 45 percent since the end of 2005 driven largely by high
commodity prices, positive performances in corporate sector, healthy economic growth as
well as merger and acquisition activity. Since the end of 2007, it has declined by under
10 percent (September 4, 2008). Despite the turmoil in global financial markets, the South
African economy and the JSE have continued to attract net capital inflows demonstrating
economy’s resilience. In Q2 there was a net inflow of R44.7 billion, with a large portion
being portfolio investments. However, the authorities are monitoring these developments to
take the necessary actions to deal with downside risks.
Financial sector
14.
The South African financial system is sound, underpinned by a well-established legal
and financial infrastructure, and an effective and modern regulatory framework. The system,
amidst the current global financial market turmoil, has remained largely unaffected and
strong.

15.
There has been a sharp increase in non performing loans, but from a very low base
and at end of 2007 stood at 1.4 percent. A significant percentage of NPLs are mortgage
related. Debt service cost to disposable income increased from 11.3 percent in first quarter to
11.6 percent in the second. The authorities share staff concerns regarding the elevated debt
service burden affecting households but would like to add that NPLs remain low in
comparison to other EMs. They also agree with Staff suggestion that it would be important to
have a better understanding of the distribution of household debt and debt service costs by
income category. Meanwhile the authorities are monitoring the situation and encouraging
financial institutions to take appropriate prudential measures.
Structural reforms and Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa
(ASGISA)
16.
The authorities are aware that the key challenge confronting the country is how to
strengthen growth and employment; and in meeting this challenge serious structural reforms,
including in labor and product markets, have been considered. This was the principal reason
for launching ASGISA.
17.
Alongside the launch of the ASGISA, the authorities appointed an international panel
of notable economists to undertake an examination of the constraints to faster economic
growth and advise the government on how to accelerate growth so as to halve poverty and
unemployment by 2014. The panel completed its investigation and its report was publicly
released earlier this year so as to generate debate. The Panel’s broad conclusion is that the
key challenge confronting authorities in employment creation is how to develop/promote the
tradable sector of the economy so as to absorb semi-skilled and unskilled workers to produce
for export markets. This would help to reduce unemployment.
18.
The recommendations of the panel, informed by a series of policy papers, are far
reaching and cover wide policy areas. Their recommendations include measures to respond
to volatility of the exchange rate, how to address low national savings, the need to introduce
a wage subsidy to encourage the employment of youth between 16 – 24 years (school
leavers), tariff reform and a proactive competition policy in order to reduce barriers to entry,
etc.
Conclusion
19.
The authorities remain steadfast in their commitment to formulating and
implementing sound policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and robust growth to
facilitate poverty reduction.
