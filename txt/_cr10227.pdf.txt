I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
The growth outlook remains weak and uncertain. The economic situation
worsened since the January review and staff revised the 2010 GDP growth forecast from
+0.8 percent to -0.5 percent. However, high-frequency indicators suggest that the recession is
bottoming out and staff expects growth to turn positive in the remainder of the year.
2.
Disappointing fiscal performance in Q1 2010 required adopting additional
adjustment measures. The fiscal deficit target was missed by a small margin, as was the
ceiling on government payments arrears. Without further adjustment, staff estimated the
deficit would climb to 9.1 percent of GDP by year-end, compared to the 5.9 percent target.
To take account of the cyclical deterioration of the economy, staff and the authorities agreed
to revise the SBA’s deficit target to 6.8 percent of GDP and the authorities chose a package
of measures involving expenditure cuts of roughly 2 percent of GDP to achieve the new
deficit target.
3.
While the banking sector has so far withstood the crisis well, banks face
deteriorating asset quality and rising provisioning costs that are squeezing profits. The
authorities are carefully monitoring the liquidity and solvency ratios of the system and
proactively asked banks to add 2009 profits to capital. The system remains liquid and
adequately capitalized and foreign banks as a group have broadly maintained their exposure
to Romania.
4.
Progress on fiscal reforms has resumed. The Fiscal Responsibility Law was
approved. The government is also preparing amendments to the Local Public Finance Law to
improve financial controls on local governments as well as further reforms to combat tax
evasion. Pension reform legislation was approved by the government and sent to Parliament
for debate and approval on an urgent basis. However, further fiscal consolidation is required
in coming years to sustainably reverse the imbalances which left Romania vulnerable to
crisis.
5.
Pressing ahead with structural reforms is key for boosting growth and
achieving sustainable real convergence. Future growth depends not only upon
reestablishing macroeconomic stability, but also on improving capital investment, and
increasing labor productivity. To boost investment, steps should be taken to improve the
business climate, improve infrastructure and EU funds absorption, and strengthen
competition. Higher labor productivity should be fostered by reforming the labor market to
address significant rigidities and low labor participation rate and by education reforms.
II. CONTEXT: BOOM, BUST, AND WEAK OUTLOOK
A. Rapid Growth and Growing Imbalances
6.
As in many other CEE countries, Romania's economy boomed in conjunction
with its EU accession in 2007, but high growth rates were associated with the build-up
of both external and internal imbalances. Large capital inflows stimulated domestic

5
demand while labor constraints and fast rising public sector wages exacerbated wage
inflation resulting in pressures on prices. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) adopted
sharply tightened monetary policy to counteract price pressures, but inflation expectations
remained high. Procyclical fiscal policy helped drive domestic demand to unsustainable
levels (Figure 6).
7.
The rapid development of the banking system came with increasing
vulnerabilities to outside liquidity shocks and foreign exchange risks. Dominated by
foreign banks, banking activity grew quickly. From 2003 until the crisis, private sector credit
grew at an average annual rate of 50 percent. As credit expansion outpaced the growth rate of
local deposits,1 bank lending became increasingly dependent on external financing, much of
which came from the parents of foreign-owned banks. The share of foreign currency lending
also reached almost two-thirds of total credit. Hence, the banking sector became vulnerable
to two major sources of risks: (i) liquidity risks if inflows from aboard dried up and (ii)
foreign exchange risks through the banks’ exposure to the unhedged businesses and
households. To contain credit growth rates, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) sharply
increased reserve requirements on both RON and FX liabilities and tightened prudential
regulations. However, direct lending from abroad also increased as firms sought to
circumvent local market restrictions.

B. Recent Crisis and Policy Response
8.
The global economic and financial crisis severely hit Romania in late 2008
and 2009. Capital inflows suddenly dried up amid the global financial crisis, Romanian
exports began to plummet, and country risk indicators skyrocketed as markets perceived the
country to be among the more vulnerable to the downturn. Real GDP plummeted2 as
domestic demand also contracted sharply, while balance of payments pressures drove a
15 percent depreciation of the leu
against the Euro from October 2008
to early 2009, putting pressures on
household, corporate and bank
balance sheets (Figure 7). Although
banks generally entered the crisis
well capitalized, they faced rising
non-performing loans (NPLs), a
dried up interbank market liquidity
and limited access to external
sources of funds. The country’s
large pre-crisis fiscal imbalance left
it in a weak position to respond to
these developments.
9.
Faced with deteriorating conditions, in early 2009 the authorities put
together a comprehensive policy package supported by an IMF Stand-By Agreement
(SBA) along with funds from the EU and other multilateral institutions. The program
aimed at correcting fiscal and current account imbalances that built up before the crisis while
avoiding excessive contraction. The policy instruments included (i) gradual fiscal
consolidation accompanied by structural reforms to restore fiscal sustainability and boost
market confidence, (ii) steps to further strengthen the resilience of the financial sector and to
obtain commitments from foreign parent banks to maintain their Romanian subsidiaries
capitalized and liquid3, and (iii) prudent monetary policy management to reduce inflation.

Real GDP dropped by 13 percent (quarter-on-quarter, annualized) in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with
the pre-crisis average growth of 9 percent.
3

Banks have provided additional capital as a cushion against future losses, and the nine largest foreign banks
with subsidiaries in Romania joined the European Bank Coordination Initiative under which they agreed to
maintain their overall exposure to the country and to provide capital as needed. The deposit insurance system is

10.
The program contributed to stabilizing the economy and alleviating
financing pressures. Economic activity remained weak throughout 2009 (declining by
7.1 percent y-o-y), but exchange rate pressure eased, the country risk premium narrowed
significantly, and financial sector stress eased. The sharp decline in domestic demand helped
adjust the current account, while the multilateral support package and the commitment of
international banks to maintain their exposures in Romania eased capital account pressures.
Financial market stabilization (Figure 4) allowed the central bank to prudently ease monetary
policy. The government was able to finance its fiscal deficit through disbursements from the
EU and the Fund, together with improved access to the local and international bond markets
as sovereign CDS spreads for Romania gradually returned to near pre-crisis levels.

Romania’s external trade and current account deficit contracted sharply
in 2009. The collapse in global trade and capital flows hit Romania’s economy hard. As a
result of the sharp contraction in domestic demand that followed, imports fell by nearly
35 percent (y-o-y) during the first nine months of 2009, almost double the rate of decline of
exports during the same period. Hence, the crisis contributed to a sharp external adjustment,
with the current account deficit falling to 4½ percent of GDP in 2009 from a peak of
13½ percent in 2007. Such adjustment was one of the largest among new EU member states.
Reflecting global trade patterns, Romania’s trade staged a recovery towards end-2009, with
export growth again outpacing import growth.

being strengthened and bank resolution laws are being improved so that the government can better respond if
banks were to get into trouble.

C. Outlook and Risks
12.
The outlook for 2010 is challenging. Economic activity continued to decline in
the first quarter of 2010 and, while staff projects a moderate recovery in the remainder of the
year, growth is likely to be slightly negative for the year as a whole. Domestic demand will
remain subdued for some time, as unemployment continues to rise and real wages adjust to
the recession with a lag, while investment will pick up slowly given tight credit conditions
and a low capacity utilization rate. The contribution of net exports is expected to remain
positive in 2010, although less so than last year given the tepid recovery in Romania’s main
trade partners and some revival in imports. While the banking sector has so far withstood the
crisis well, banks face deteriorating asset quality and rising provisioning costs that are
squeezing profits. NPLs increased sharply from 6.5 in December 2008 to 15.3 in
December 2009 and are projected to reach about 20 percent at the end of the year.
13.
Risks to the outlook are tilted towards the downside and uncertainty is
particularly high. With domestic demand still weak, the expected recovery rests on hope of
an upturn in demand in Western Europe. Financing constraints, banking sector
vulnerabilities, skittish investors, as well as potential spillovers from regional developments
and volatile international markets may slow down the incipient recovery. In particular, recent
regional developments have generated

may prop up growth and the easing of monetary policy may begin to stimulate credit growth
to fuel a rebound in consumption and investment.
14.
Beyond 2010, GDP should recover, with growth forecast to rise by around
3½ percent in 2011 and rising to the range of 4–4½ percent per year in 2012–15. Staff
envisages some lasting effects of the crisis on potential output growth in the medium-term
due to the lower capital stock and lasting effects on financial intermediation. Potential output
growth is expected to average 3–3½ percent in the medium-term, well below the average
growth rates experienced in 2003–2008 (Box 1).
15.
The current account deficit is expected to stabilize at a sustainable level in
the medium run, financed mainly by FDI inflows. Staff baseline projections are for the
current account deficit to increase to about 5 percent of GDP in 2010, and stabilize at around
that level over the medium term. This stabilization is projected on the basis of the expected
economic recovery in Romania’s trading partners, sluggish recovery in domestic demand
reflecting the real exchange rate depreciation that has taken place since mid-2008, as well as
limited scope for private credit growth as banks continue to deleverage. FDI inflows are
projected to amount to about 4½ percent of GDP over the medium term, and thus expected to
finance most of the projected current account deficit. As a result, external debt is projected to
decline gradually to about 45 percent of GDP in 2014, from 65 percent in 2009.

10

Box 1: The Crisis Impact on Potential Growth
Historically, economic growth has been largely driven by investment. The accumulation of capital
explains most of output increases up to the crisis year. During the latest strong-growth period, labor
input also provided additional growth stimulus but the contribution of Total Factor Productivity
(TFP) was slightly negative. In 2009, the contribution of capital fell substantially but remained
positive. The strikingly negative contribution of total factor productivity appears to reflect the crisis
situation, implying a severe reorganization of the economy. Near-term economic growth is expected
to follow the same historical pattern with capital accumulation being the main source of growth.

Reduced financing will affect capital accumulation through lower investment rates, and total factor productivity through
the credit crunch and lower investment in research and development (R&D).

III. SHORT-TERM ISSUES AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
The program remained broadly on track in Q1, but weak revenue and a build-up of spending
pressures pointed to significant deviations for the remainder of the year. Even after adjusting
for weaker GDP growth, additional consolidation measures were necessary to reach the
end-year targets. As domestic demand plummeted, core inflation fell allowing the NBR to
pursue prudent monetary easing. The financial sector reacted well to the international
support package, but banks face the challenge of rising NPLs and potential liquidity
pressures.
A. Performance Under the Program
16.
Most first quarter program targets were met, but mounting expenditure
pressures and weaker-than-expected revenue collection caused fiscal targets to be
missed and jeopardize compliance with end-of year 2010 targets. The government missed
the end-March fiscal deficit target by a small margin, and once again missed the target on
domestic payments arrears (for which they request waivers). Revenues fell far short of
programmed levels, forcing the authorities to slash discretionary outlays in March in an
attempt to reach the target. All other quantitative performance criteria were met by ample
margins, as were the indicative targets on general government current expenditure and
operating losses of SOEs (LOI ¶2).
17.
All structural benchmarks for the review have been met (Table 2). On the
financial side, banking legislation was modified to increase the authority of the special
administrator to implement promptly a broad range of measures in bank resolution, including
purchase and assumption, sales of assets, and transfer of deposits while taking into account
the provisions of EU company law. The NBR’s decision-making power with respect to the
proceedings to deal with an insolvent credit institution was strengthened and the Deposit
Guarantee Fund claims were provided with the same seniority as claims of depositors. On the
fiscal side, the Fiscal Responsibility Law was approved by Parliament, legislation on SOEs
to improve their accountability has been enacted, and the first stage of the tax administration
reforms has also been approved.

B. Fiscal Consolidation
18.
The first quarter fiscal performance was disappointing. Cumulative tax receipts
in the first quarter of 2010 were not only lower than anticipated (by 0.4 percent of GDP), but
also lower compared to the same period in 2009. The revenue shortfall, stemming mainly from
lower VAT revenues and social security contributions, was partly due to weaker-thanexpected economic activity and still rising unemployment, but also to lower yields as tax
evasion, especially in excises, appears to have increased substantially. While cash
expenditures were held to well below program in an attempt to meet the Q1 target, underlying
expenditure pressures accumulated. Pension and other social outlays were significantly higher
than anticipated, and promised cuts in goods and services spending did not materialize, due in
part to significant overruns in the health care system. The increase in arrears also reflected
accumulated expenditure pressure, despite the authorities’ commitment to remedial measures.
19.
Reaching the original end-year targets proved unrealistic. The downward
revision in economic conditions, falling revenue yields, and the sharply higher projected
expenditures in goods and services, pensions and social transfer payments, combined to move
the program’s deficit target of 5.9 percent of GDP well out of reach. In the absence of
compensatory measures, staff estimated the deficit would have climbed to 9.1 percent of GDP.
Of this deterioration, roughly 0.8 percent of GDP is due to lower economic growth and a
statistical revision in the size of GDP, 1.3 percent of GDP is due to expected expenditure
overruns (including paying down arrears), and 1 percent of GDP due to falling revenue yields.
Staff and the authorities agreed to adjust the target to 6.8 percent of GDP to accommodate for
the cyclical deterioration of the economy and the statistical revision of GDP without
endangering the medium term credibility of the consolidation path.
20.
Attaining even the adjusted deficit target required measures totaling
2.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Staff and the authorities discussed a number of different possible
revenue and expenditure packages to close the gap, with staff advocating a greater reliance on
revenue measures. However, the authorities opted for a package focused almost entirely on
radical expenditure cuts to meet the revised program target. Their adjustment measures consist
of expenditure cuts of roughly 2 percent of GDP, including a 25 percent cut in public sector
wages and 15 percent reduction in pensions and transfer payments (LOI ¶7).4 Public staffing
will continue to be streamlined. Moreover, structural reforms in the health system, pensions,
education, and local government finance will generate further savings and assist in
consolidation efforts going forward (LOI ¶12, 17–20). In addition, revenue-boosting measures
of 0.3 percent of GDP will include widening the tax base, improving tax enforcement and
introducing a turnover tax on medical suppliers (see text table). The authorities recognized that

4

Due to legal concerns about the cuts in wages and social transfer payments, the authorities have specified in the
law (now pending in the parliament) that the specific reductions will be in effect until end-2010. However, the law
also specifies that the 2011 budget limits for wages and social transfers will be set on the basis of the new, lower
outlays, assuring continuation of the reductions.

14
the heavy emphasis on expenditure cuts posed political and implementation risks. Political
opposition could scuttle the measures in parliament, and likely court challenges could delay or
derail implementation. For this reason, they agreed that enactment of the measures would be a
prior action for conclusion of the review and committed to implementing revenue measures if
their expenditure cuts are not applied or fall short (LOI ¶7).

The authorities took some steps to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable.
The minimum pension will remain unchanged and no pensions will be cut below that level.
There will also be no reduction in the minimum wage and workers near that threshold will be
protected from falling below it. To mitigate the social consequences of cutting social transfers,
less efficient social assistance programs will be cut by more so as to allow for lesser reductions
in better targeted programs. Social assistance programs will also be reformed to better target
the poor and most vulnerable as agreed with the World Bank.
22.
While substantial, the cuts in personnel compensation and social transfers
mostly reverse recent increases. In 2005–2008, spending on public wages and pensions
nearly doubled and public wage growth has outpaced growth in private wages (see figure
below). A cut of 25 percent in personnel compensation would result in compensation falling to
between 2007 and 2008 levels in nominal terms and the 2006 level in percent of GDP. A
15 percent cut in pensions would put pensions back at the 2008 level. In addition, many social
assistance programs are poorly targeted and have witnessed large increases as well (about 10–
40 percent growth in 2008–2009 for some large programs). The authorities argued that their
expenditure-based consolidation program was superior to one including tax increases because
it directly addressed the expenditure boom that generated the fiscal gap, notwithstanding
distributional concerns about the adjustment falling mainly on public employees and recipients
of social transfer payments. Staff broadly supported public wage cuts, but expressed the view
that increases in broad-based taxes would spread out the adjustment burden on a wider group
than the cuts in social spending. In addition, the mission suggested that reductions in public
employment and a more targeted restructuring of the social benefits and health system would
yield better results. The authorities agreed in principle, but noted that such reforms take time;
meanwhile, they preferred spending cuts to tax increases. In the mission’s discussions with
trade unions, union leaders generally recognized the need for significant fiscal adjustment, but
stressed their preference for greater reliance on revenue measures (particularly progressive
taxation) with more gradual expenditure reductions.

The authorities are struggling with the chronic problem of domestic arrears.
The stock of arrears has increased since the beginning of the year mostly due to increases in
the health sector and central government, which caused them to miss the program target yet
again in March, 2010.5 Efforts to control arrears in late 2009 and early 2010 were swamped by
falling revenues at all levels of government, leaving little cash to clear arrears while covering
ongoing expenditures. The authorities indicated that they will take further steps to address the
arrears issues both at the central and local government levels. First, at the general government
level, more spending will be allocated in the budget this year to clear health arrears and a
restructuring plan is underway to contain arrears growth in the future. Line ministries will
monitor their subordinated units to observe commitment ceilings and sanctions for breaching
limits will be enforced. Second, at the local government level, the government plans to use
swap agreements to clear mutual debts between local authorities and public enterprises.6 Going
forward, the amendments to the local public finance law (structural benchmark endSeptember 2010) will preclude the accumulation of overdue payments. In addition, the
authorities plan to integrate the accounting reporting system with the Treasury payment system
(structural benchmark for end-March 2011) to improve monitoring commitments and assist in
budget management and control (LOI ¶10). The authorities have made progress in recent
months in reducing arrears in VAT refund payments to exporters.
24.
The authorities made progress on fiscal structural reforms. The Fiscal
Responsibility Law was approved by parliament (end-March structural benchmark).
Legislation to improve the accountability of SOEs has been approved in early 2010,
significantly ahead of the end-June structural benchmark. The authorities are committed to
refining the Unified Wage Law (UWL) approved in 2009. They indicated that work on the
implementing legislation on the UWL is progressing and that they expect to be able to meet
the September program target. To further reduce pressures on the wage bill, the government
has committed to reducing personnel by another 70,000 by January 2011 on top of a reduction
of roughly 30,000 since late 2009; has already restructured about 100 state agencies; and a
functional review of major ministries is being carried out by the World Bank. Sustained efforts
to improve revenue collection and streamline tax administration operations are being
continued with support of the IMF technical assistance missions in 2009-10, and the first stage
of these reforms, focused on noncompliance and increasing control of largest taxpayers, has
been approved as part of the end-April structural benchmark (LOI ¶13). Further reforms in tax
administration will focus improving methodologies to identify and audit unreported income,
especially of high-income individual taxpayers (proposed structural benchmark for endNovember 2010; LOI ¶13), and on combating other forms of tax evasion. Supported by IMF

In particular, arrears rose in the health sector as the health authorities had negotiated agreements in 2009 to
allow for deferred payments on medicines and supplies. These deferred payments are coming due in 2010, adding
to pressure on arrears.

6

The swap arrangement would involve mutually cancelling overdue tax obligations of public enterprises with
arrears owed to those enterprises by the general government.

17
technical assistance in April 2010, the government is also preparing amendments to the Local
Public Finance Law to mitigate potential fiscal risks from local governments; to allow
additional time for improving the draft legislation, the associate structural benchmark is
proposed to be moved from end-June to end-September, 2010 (LOI ¶11–17).

The widening output gap helped reduce core inflation but supply factors
sustained headline inflation. Core inflation fell from a peak of 8.1 percent in mid-2008 to
2.1 percent in May 2010 due to weak demand and receding exchange rate pressures. The
decline in headline inflation lagged, however, preventing the central bank from meeting its
inflation target in 2009 for a third consecutive year. Factors boosting the headline rate
included significant hikes in tobacco excises (which contributed about 2 percentage points out
of 4.7 percent at end-2009), direct and

26.
As inflationary and exchange
rate pressures abated, the NBR was able to ease monetary policy in response to the crisis.
Interest rates were cut by 400 basis points since February 2009 to 6.25 percent, reserve
requirements were reduced significantly (in particular on foreign currency liabilities), and the
NBR provided ample liquidity to the banking system, especially through repo operations. A
more aggressive relaxation was hindered by the need to maintain inflation expectations in
check given the persisting high headline inflation and by exchange rate concerns in early 2009.
27.
There is room for further prudent monetary easing in the near future,
provided subdued inflationary pressures and weak demand conditions persist (Figure 5).
Inflation is projected to fall to about 3¾ percent by end-2010, close to the middle of the
authorities’ range of 3½ percent ±1 percentage points, as the impact of the supply shocks
largely dissipates. Risks to the inflation outlook are broadly balanced: cyclical factors should
continue to put downward pressure on inflation, while domestic food prices will reverse their
negative contribution to inflation, with further upward risks from continued increases in world
energy prices and adjustments in regulated prices. Potential pressures from regional economic
uncertainties and unsettled financial markets also argue for a measured approach to further
easing.

Box 3. Inflation in Romania: How Persistent?
Headline inflation in Romania has remained high relative to its EU peers over the past two
years, despite the collapse in demand during 2008-09, raising the question of why it has been so
persistent. In part, the high inflation can be attributed to supply shocks. During 2009, Romania’s
adjustment in tobacco excise duties to EU
ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO INFLATION
(yoy percent change, December 2009)
requirements has been among the largest in the
region and added some 2 percentage points (of the
4.7 percent) to the headline inflation at end-2009.
The exchange rate depreciation (~15 percent), has
also been among the largest in the region, further
fuelling inflation. However, core inflation has also
remained high relative to the peers and started to
decline only in late 2009. Has inflation in Romania
been intrinsically persistent, or do supply factors
account fully for the high inflation in recent years?

Standard measures of inflation persistence—such as the sum of autocorrelation coefficients in
univariate autoregressive models—show that headline and core inflation in Romania are not
more persistent in the long run than their regional peers and that inflation inertia has decreased
significantly after the introduction of inflation targeting regime (see Analytical Note 1).
However, it does appear that headline inflation is relatively sticky. For example, the half-life of a
shock to headline inflation in Romania―i.e. the number of periods it takes for a shock to dissipate to
below half of its original magnitude―is 15 months in Romania, compared to 10⅓ months in other
inflation targeters and 5.2 months in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes (chart). This suggests
that the main source of the persistence in headline inflation lies in the sluggishness of “noncore”
items such as tobacco and food. Indeed, inflation in these subindices of the CPI has been among the
most persistent. It also suggests that while monetary policy focus on core inflation is appropriate, it
should not fully accommodate supply shocks

D. Financial Sector Challenges
28.
The deep contraction in economic activity during 2009 is taking a toll on the
banking sector. Non-performing loans continued to increase and rising provisions
compressed banks’ profits while lending to the private sector continued to contract. The rate
of increase in impairments for consumer loans slowed, suggesting NPLs in this category may
have peaked. However the system is still experiencing a rapid deterioration of loan portfolio
quality in the small and medium enterprise and corporate sectors as bankruptcies are rising.
29.
Banks’ capital levels continue to remain adequate as the NBR has
proactively requested capital increases in a number of banks and shareholders have
applied a conservative earning retention policy. At the aggregate system level, the average
capital adequacy ratio in the system rose to 14.03 percent at end-2009, against 13.77 percent
at the end of 2008. At the level of individual banks, all banks have a capital ratio above
10 percent7. Moreover, while the capital ratios of some small banks did come under
pressures, recent stress tests by the NBR showed that the current ratios are sufficient to
withstand the expected deterioration in loan portfolios throughout 2010. In addition, for
banks experiencing rapidly deteriorating asset quality, owners are expected to provide further
resources in the course of the year.
30.
The parents of the largest foreign owned banks have largely complied with
their commitment of maintaining their exposure to Romania. While there are
fluctuations, as a group the nine banks have broadly maintained their exposures to Romania
in the 12 months to March 2010. However, as market conditions have stabilized,
representatives from some banks favor a gradual easing in the exposure limits that would be
consistent with internal risk-management models and credit developments while continuing
to provide capital buffers to ensure strong solvency and support confidence.
31.
The authorities have been preparing for the possibility of spillovers from
market volatility. Existing regulations require banks to have in place contingency plans as
well as plans for alternative financing. The supervision department of the NBR has been
reviewing such plans and ensuring they encompass credible assumptions. NBR has also been
strengthening its liquidity operations framework. It has enhanced its liquidity monitoring
including through the reporting of assets and liability’s maturity breakdown by currency and
has reviewed emergency lending arrangements, which are available to all banks, foreign- and
domestic-owned. In addition, the NBR has taken steps to broaden the range of acceptable

7

The regulatory minimum for the capital adequacy ratio is 8 percent.

20
collateral for refinancing operations at the central bank. As other European central banks, the
NBR has made contingency plans to address episodes of financial distress.
32.
The authorities have been keeping close watch on the developments in
Greece. They are aware of the possibility of liquidity pressures and have intensified liquidity
monitoring of all banks in the system. Although some pressures have appeared, evidenced in
particular by increased deposit rates, the liquidity position of the subsidiaries of Greek banks
remains in line with that of the rest of the system. As for capitalization, the average capital
ratio for the subsidiaries of the Greek banks’ is higher than the average of the banking
system. In effect, Greek parent banks have proactively increased capital resources, while the
ratio of NPLs to total loans is also lower than average. Subsidiaries of Greek banks in
Romania constitute roughly 20 percent of system assets.

To further support confidence, authorities are strengthening the Deposit
Guarantee Fund. The NBR will draft amendments to the legal framework of the Deposit
Guarantee Fund that will: (i) improve its governance to assure that no official of a credit
institution sits on its board; and (ii) improve the funding regime with a view to enhancing
confidence in the system by increasing both the actual and targeted coverage ratio and by
eliminating contingent credit lines by banks (structural benchmark for end-September 2010;
LOI ¶24). The process will begin with an increase in banks’ ex ante contribution rates.
34.
The NBR is striving to enhance the banking supervisory framework.
Technical support from the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF has been
requested to further strengthen the stress test methodology in different risk areas (LOI ¶22).
The prudential framework is considered adequate to address the current challenges and no
amendments are currently envisaged. Under the SBA arrangement, the authorities agreed to
consult Fund and European Commission staff prior to the introduction of new or revised key
prudential regulations. Formally raising the minimum level of the capital adequacy ratio from
8 percent to 10 percent remains a medium-term objective (LOI ¶25) while the authorities
remain committed to adopting the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

21
IV. MEDIUM-TERM PERSPECTIVES: THE CHALLENGE OF ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE
GROWTH
Romania faces three main challenges over the medium- and long-term to assure sustainable
economic growth: First, policies must be put in place to assure the resolution of the
macroeconomic imbalances generated in the run-up to the crisis. While the forced
adjustment of the crisis has brought an abrupt correction to external imbalances, additional
policy action is needed in coming years to eliminate the internal fiscal imbalance and
forestall a reemergence of competiveness problems and an unsustainable current account.
Second, as with other new member states of the EU, Romania has the medium-term objective
of accession to the euro area which requires nominal convergence to the Maastricht criteria.
Third, nominal convergence should be coupled with real convergence—that is to say
sustainable growth to bring Romanian living standards more into line with EU averages. For
both nominal and real convergence, Romania must improve the flexibility of the economy
and increase its potential growth rate through structural reforms in labor, product, and
investment markets, and increase investment—particularly in infrastructure.
A. Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation
35.
Optimizing fiscal policy in the medium term should aim at creating
conditions for stability and growth via low deficits and controls on current spending
that free up resources for investment. Although Romania’s public debt level has risen only
to about 30 percent of GDP at the end of 2009, high levels of deficit in future would preclude
euro area accession and risk incurring higher interest costs and adversely affecting the
private sector. While considerable effort has been expended in 2009–2010 to reverse the
unsustainable pre-crisis fiscal policies, additional medium-term fiscal consolidation is

include:

build up the pillar two private pension system. The proposed reform will in the long
run save several percent of GDP per year, bringing the public system nearer to breakeven status.


Reforms to permanently rein in the wage bill. While the authorities’ 25 percent cut in
wages in 2010 will generate a major improvement in the fiscal balance, it is not a
substitute for a comprehensive restructuring of public employment and pay. The
already adopted unified wage law aims not only at reversing the exponential growth
of the wage bill, but also to improve the simplicity, transparency, and fairness of
public compensation. Approval of follow-up legislation to implement a new system
will be crucial for medium-term fiscal sustainability. The increase in public
employment of some 250,000 during the pre-crisis period should also be reversed
over time.



Reforms of social spending. Much of the spending pressure affecting the fiscal
accounts in 2010 stems from poorly targeted and inefficient social spending,
including poverty assistance, the health care system, and education. The authorities
need to press ahead with their plans on reforming social assistance programs,
streamlining the number of programs and improving the targeting and incentives in
the remaining ones. Efforts already beginning to improve the efficiency and outcomes
of the health and education systems should continue.

23

Box 4: Fiscal Responsibility Law: A Major Reform of the Budget Process
Romania’s current budget process limits the government’s ability to run prudent
fiscal policy. The budget process is largely an unconstrained expenditure driven process
and has an annual focus. The controls on fiscal outcomes are weak with poor forecast of
revenues and expenditures, absence of credible and binding expenditure ceilings, and
numerous budget revisions during the year. The government uses notional medium-term
expenditure framework as the budget process starts afresh every year without giving due
consideration to the previous year’s expenditure estimates as a guide for setting ceilings
and preparing budget submissions. In addition, supplementary budgets are enacted several
times a year (five in 2008), usually reallocating resources from capital to current spending
and even resulting in higher deficits.
The Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) approved by Parliament at end-March is
designed to strengthen fiscal discipline, provided political commitment exists. The
FRL should help improving medium term fiscal planning, budget formulation and
execution, transparency of the budget process and accountability through the following
key elements:






Implementing fiscal rules. Fiscal rules such as expenditure ceilings and fiscal
balance limits will guide the government in setting expenditure envelopes. As a
result, the government has to engage in the process of prioritizing expenditures,
especially if any extra spending is desired. In addition, over the economic cycle,
the fiscal balance has to be in surplus or in balance, thus requiring the government
to run a prudent fiscal policy in good times to compensate for any deficit in
recessionary times.
Requiring supplementary budgets. With two supplementary budgets per year,
the budget planning and execution should improve. The first budget revision can
be submitted no earlier than July of each year, and the total budget envelope
cannot be increased.
Upgrading reporting requirements and raising accountability. Reporting
requirements will allow the government to analyze fiscal policy implementation,
adjust policy accordingly, and provide accountability and transparency. In its
current form, various data are gathered and presented but analysis is lacking. Halfyearly and annual reports on economic and budget outlook should provide a
platform to analyze the developments and suggest changes, if any. The
establishment of an independent Fiscal Council should help raise accountability.

24
B. Better Infrastructure
36.
Poor quality of infrastructure is one of the impediments to Romania’s
competitiveness and long-run growth. Poor infrastructure is in part a result of limited fiscal
space for undertaking large scale capital projects; lack of an adequate framework for capital
budgeting to evaluate, prioritize and monitor public infrastructure projects, which leads to
inefficiency and waste in public investment spending; significant state involvement in the
energy and transportation sector; and an underdeveloped market for long-term financing
which precludes private sector involvement in capital projects.
37.
Improvements in infrastructure will be key to boosting Romania’s long-term
growth, both through its direct impact on the capital stock and through its competitivenessenhancing effects. This could be achieved in a number of ways:


Creating fiscal space. Fiscal consolidation is already underway, and its focus on
reductions in current spending will have to be sustained over the medium-term in
order to create additional fiscal space for infrastructure investment. At the same time,
large EU grants for capital projects are already available to Romania and priority
should be given to increasing their absorption by: (i) enhancing technical capacity to
develop qualifying proposals; (ii) strengthening submission requirements for
domestically funded capital projects; and (iii) improving procurement procedures to
prevent challenges in courts that stall projects.

Using existing fiscal space efficiently through improved capital budgeting. The
recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Legislation should help improve the capital
budget process through focus on multiyear budgeting, but additional reforms will be
needed to: (i) improve the prioritization of projects; (ii) review the existing portfolio
of projects and rationalize it to focus on priority projects, with others deferred or
discontinued; (iii) ensure adequate funding for priority projects; (iv) setting a
database of proposed and approved capital projects ranked by economic and financial

25
return; (v) strengthen the project appraisal and review process through the
establishment of independent review teams; and (vi) improve the transparency of
capital budget project selection and performance by publishing regular updates on
MOF website.


Reducing state presence in electricity and transportation sectors. Divesting state
holdings in these sectors will not only reduce support to loss-making state enterprises,
but will also improve efficiency by attracting private capital. The authorities have
indicated their intention to reactivate the privatization program, especially in
industry, energy, and transport. The government intends to wind-up the energy firm
Termoelectrica, privatize the cargo rail firm, complete the privatization of additional
firms via the privatization agency AVAS. The Ministry of Economy will also initiate
the sale of minority stakes in several firms under its control. It envisages phasing out
subsidies for coal mining by the end of this year and developing an exit strategy to be
achieved within the next 5 years.
C. Competitiveness Issues

38.
Boosting competitiveness requires bringing inflation down and ensuring that
wages are set consistently with productivity growth. Staff analysis shows a recent
improvement in REER indicators. The results of three standard quantitative methods show a
sharp reduction in REER overvaluation from the 2007 peak and, on balance, suggest only a
modest, but manageable, overvaluation of the currency. Both the equilibrium real exchange
(ERER) and macroeconomic balance (MB) methods show a sharp reduction in REER
overvaluation from the 2007 peak. And while these methods indicate medium-term
overvaluation between 5½ and 13½ percent, such overvaluation is not statistically significant
at standard levels of confidence. The external sustainability (ES) method also suggests a
moderate overvaluation if Romania were to target an NFA level of -53 percent of GDP,
determined on the basis of its openness level. Romania has made rapid gains in both EU and
global export markets shares, mainly due to a rapid increase in non-textile manufacturing
exports, and has also increased the share of medium-and high tech exports. However,
Romania’s economy-wide unit labor costs (ULCs) have increased at a much faster pace than
in other new EU member states and while wages in the manufacturing sector remain among
the lowest in the region, so does hourly productivity (see Analytical Note 3).

D. Structural Reforms
Business climate-essential for boosting investment
39.
Improving Romania’s business climate would boost Romania’s growth
potential. Romania lags behind other EU member States in terms of quality of business
environment according to indicators on perceived corruption (Transparency International),
ease of doing business (World Bank) or competitiveness (World Economic Forum). The
EU’s latest report on Romania’s state of business climate notes mixed results while Romania
slid down by ten positions on the World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking in the past
year. In particular, Romania has room for improvement in tax simplification, contract
enforcement and hiring. The chart below shows the impact in terms of business-friendliness
of reforms that would bring Romania to the average level of the Euro area countries in areas
such as labor market, tax administration, and contract enforcement.

Labor market reform—improving hiring conditions and raising participation
40.
Raising Romania low labor force participation and employment rate would
boost both current welfare and longer-term growth. Romania has one of the lowest
employment rates among EU countries. Lifting the Romanian employment rate (58.6 percent
of the labor force) gradually to the average level in the EU (65.9 percent) while reforming
the early retirement schemes would boost

The authorities envisage a comprehensive education reform. After four years
of negotiations, a commission including all parties, unions and NGOs has signed the national
education pact. The corresponding new education law (vote in parliament expected for end
June) addresses several key challenges including a nationwide standard wage for teachers, an
increase in teaching hours per teacher, a nationwide system to allocate means according to
the number of pupils while at the same time all other decisions will be decentralized,
including the implementation of after school activities and establishing competence centers.
Education reform should contribute to fiscal consolidation while improving the productivity
of the future workforce through better training.
E. The Road to Euro: The Need for Reforms to Improve Flexibility
42.
While Romania is officially committed to seeking entry into the Euro area
in 2014–15, there is increasing recognition within the country that this timetable may be
overly ambitious. Entry into the Euro area in 2014 would require (i) joining ERM2 in 2011–
12, which in turn would require the ability to sustain reasonable exchange rate stability, and
(ii) adherence to the other Maastricht criteria. An overly ambitious timetable for adopting the

28
euro could be costly as entry into the euro area takes away important adjustment tools. While
adopting the euro eliminates exchange rate risks for foreign-currency denominated loans and
can help anchor inflation, it also comes at the expense of limited flexibility in response to
future shocks and the danger of loss of competitiveness if domestic adjustment capacity is
insufficient.
43.
Successful economic performance within the Euro area will depend upon the
flexibility and productivity of the Romanian economy. After adopting the Euro, Romania
will need to rely on internal adjustment mechanisms rather than on monetary and exchange
rate policy to deal with asymmetric shocks. Romania’s trade is Euro-oriented but the
structure of the economy is different and shocks are not fully synchronized with the EU (see
Analytical Note 5). If business cycles are not synchronized, the higher potential costs of
joining the monetary union need to be mitigated by other adjustment mechanisms which are
as yet underdeveloped. Specifically, the loss of the monetary policy tool needs to be
mitigated by flexible wages and prices, financial integration and a counter-cyclical fiscal
policy which is effective in stabilizing the economy. The newly adopted fiscal responsibility
law is a step forward as it will help anchor the deficit target in a medium-term framework
incorporating expenditure ceilings but more needs to be done to boost productivity and
flexibility.
V. PROGRAM MODALITIES AND OTHER ISSUES
44.
The attached Letter of Intent (LOI) describes the authorities’ progress in
implementing their economic program and sets out their commitments through endDecember 2010.


Some modifications to the program’s conditionality are proposed (Tables 1–2):
(i) the end-June fiscal deficit targets will be modified to make them consistent with
the new annual deficit target and the timing of the authorities’ measures; (ii) the
indicative target for current primary spending will be modified to make it consistent
with the revised fiscal projections; (iii) the indicative target on the operating balance
of certain state-owned enterprises will be tightened to make the target more binding;
(iv) the reference baseline of multilateral disbursements for the adjustor on the NFA
target will be modified to account for a revised schedule of disbursements; and (v) the
structural benchmark on approval of reform measures to mitigate fiscal risks from
local governments is moved from end-June 2010 to end-September 2010.



New structural benchmarks are proposed (Table 2): (i) integration of the public
accounting reporting system with the Treasury payment system (end-March 2011);
(ii) measures to improve the tax administration methodology for high net wealth
individuals (end-November 2010); and (iii) reform of the Deposit Guarantee Fund’s
governance arrangements and of the funding regime, including through an increase in
bank contribution rates (end-September 2010).

29
45.
Program modalities. The Fund arrangement remains adequate to meet
Romania’s balance of payment needs through end-2010, alongside financing commitments
from the European Union and the World Bank. The estimated external financing needs for
the year have declined somewhat against the backdrop of a faster-than-envisaged adjustment
in the current account. However, staff has not proposed changes to the initially programmed
phasing of disbursements given the fragility of the stabilization process and unsettled
regional markets (Table 8).
46.
Use of Fund resources. The authorities intend to draw the amount available at
the completion of the review, and have agreed that the full amount will be used by the NBR
for balance of payment support.
47.
Romania’s capacity to repay the Fund is expected to remain strong. Fund
credit outstanding would peak in 2011 at 32.7 percent of gross reserves (Table 9). Peak
payments would be in 2013–14 at a still manageable 12.4 and 13.3 percent of gross reserves,
respectively. While this exposure remains large, the associated servicing risks are mitigated
by the relatively low level of public debt. Direct public indebtedness is expected to remain
relatively low (under 37 percent of GDP), with public external debt peaking at around
14 percent of GDP at end-2010 (Table 10). Total external debt is projected to increase to
about 69 percent of GDP at end-2010 from 53 percent at end-2008, but the declining current
account deficit and a return to economic growth would gradually reduce it to manageable
levels in the medium term (Table 11). Romania’s strong political commitment to the SBA
program and its excellent track record servicing external obligations, also provide comfort
that it will fulfill its financial obligations to the Fund in a timely manner.
48.
Fund staff has continued to cooperate closely with the staff of the European
Commission (EC) and the World Bank (WB). Fund, EC and the WB staff have consulted
each other regularly regarding economic and policy developments in Romania, and they
participated jointly in meetings with the authorities. The EC disbursed its second tranche of
its support in March 2010 (€1 billion) and a third tranche is expected to be disbursed in
September 2010 (€1.2 billion). The WB disbursed its first tranche (€0.3 billion) in
October 2009, with the remaining tranches (€0.7 billion in total) expected in late 2010.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
The government decision to rely primarily on expenditure cuts to close
the 2010 fiscal gap is ambitious, but entails implementation risks and generates
distributional concerns. While it is clear that an unsustainable rise in current spending was
behind the pre-crisis increase in the fiscal deficit, legal and political challenges have made it
very difficult to reverse spending increases in the past, particularly in wages and social
entitlements. Attempts at expenditure cuts during the program in 2009 were hampered by
these difficulties. Staff would have preferred a greater reliance on short-term revenue
measures, together with a medium-term strategy to reduce current spending through wage

30
and pension reforms, which would have avoided some of these risks while achieving the
same objectives. In addition, increases in broad-based taxes (such as VAT and income taxes)
would likely have had less impact on the disadvantaged than the social spending cuts chosen
by the authorities. That said, the sharp short-term cuts may facilitate an earlier return to fiscal
sustainability and will help contain the share of public spending in GDP, which had risen
sharply in recent years. Having decided on these difficult measures, the authorities should
make every effort to ensure that these emergency cuts are translated into permanent
adjustment.
50.
In the medium term, fiscal policy should aim at a more permanent reduction
in fiscal deficit via reforms in current spending, while making room for growthenhancing investment. It is crucial that the expenditure reductions undertaken in 2010
become the base for future budgets—avoiding a rebound in spending in 2011. Pension and
public wage reforms are essential if these ad hoc cuts are to be translated into lasting savings.
However, with continued reductions in public employment and the enactment of pension,
health and education reforms, the deficit would remain on a downward path to fall below the
3 percent Maastricht threshold in the medium-term without the need for major tax increases.
The fiscal responsibility law is a welcome step towards avoiding ad-hoc intra-year
adjustments that have happened in the past. In addition, streamlining and making the public
administration more efficient while increasing it capacity to absorb EU funds, will be
essential for sustained higher economic growth.
51.
The NBR has skillfully negotiated a path between the need for monetary
easing to stimulate the economy and the need to contain exchange rate and capital flight
pressures. While they missed their end-2009 inflation target, inflation is on a declining
trend. Inflation is now within the NBR’s target band of 3.5 percent +1 percentage point, and
should remain there by end-2010. In staff’s view, there is room for further prudent monetary
easing in the near future, provided subdued inflationary pressures and weak demand
conditions persist. However, the authorities will have to remain alert to renewed pressures
on the exchange rate due to regional uncertainties. While there may be room for some
additional depreciation, which would boost exports and help the economic recovery, large
movements could have negative inflationary and balance sheet effects.
52.
The authorities’ proactive banking supervision and regulation has helped
maintain the stability of the financial system, but vigilance remains essential given
potential risk from regional uncertainties and pressures from the economic downturn.
Funding levels in the banking system have remained stable and average capital levels are
well above regulatory requirements, but pressures on capital will continue due to the impact
of the economic downturn on credit quality. Staff recommends that the authorities continue
to implement measures to preserve financial stability and carefully monitor risks that may
arise from liquidity pressures.

31
53.
Pressing ahead with structural reforms is required to prepare for eventual
euro adoption. Romania should not rush into ERM2, as its current economic structure is not
well-adapted to the rigors of monetary union with countries whose structure and response to
shocks is much different. Too-early entry into the Euro area could result in a loss of
competitiveness and an inability to bounce back from future downturns. However, Romania
should not postpone efforts to boost the economic flexibility and productivity. In particular,
labor market reforms should help unblock the economy’s rigidity and ensure that wages
remain in line with productivity, while improvements in the business climate, privatizations,
and better absorption of EU funds could boost investment.
54.
On the basis of Romania’s performance under the SBA, staff supports the
authorities’ request for completing the fourth review. Staff also supports the approval of a
waiver of nonobservance of the end-March 2010 performance criterion on the government’s
overall balance given the small nature of the deviations and the corrective actions undertaken
by the government and of the performance criterion on the accumulation of domestic arrears
on the basis of the corrective actions to be taken. Staff also recommends establishment of
quantitative conditionality for end- September and December 2010, and approval of the
modification of program conditionality, as proposed by the attached Letter of Intent.
55.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 24-month
cycle, subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 1. ROMANIAN INFLATION: HOW PERSISTENT?8
Unlike most countries, headline inflation in Romania has remained relatively high despite
the collapse in demand during 2008-09, and the central bank has missed its inflation target
for the past three years. This has brought forward question about why inflation in Romania
has remained persistent and what are the prospects for meeting the inflation target going
forward. This note addresses these issues.
Some Stylized Facts
The past ten years have been a period of dramatic disinflation in Romania, with
inflation brought down from close to 60 percent in the
HEADLINE HICP INFLATION
early 2000’s to levels similar to other emerging
markets in the EU. The subsequent surge in inflation
during 2008 mimicked developments elsewhere in the
region, as it was driven by commodity and food
prices, but inflation did not come down as fast as
elsewhere and remained about 3 percentage points
above the average for the regional emerging countries
(chart). At end-2009, inflation stood at 4.7 percent,
slightly above the central bank inflation target band.
The decline in inflation during 2008–09 was also slow
in light of the large collapse in demand during this period.

In part, the recent persistence in headline inflation can be clearly attributed to supply
shocks. During 2009, Romania saw a significant increase in tobacco and alcohol prices as a
result of having to adjust its specific excise duties to
ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO INFLATION
(yoy percent change, December 2009)
the minimum required by the EU. These adjustments
were higher in Romania relative to other countries,
because of (i) the higher gap relative to the EU
requirement; (ii) the large depreciation of the currency
in 2009, which further increased the local currency
value of the excise (set in euros); and (iii) the
authorities’ decision to speed up the adjustment and
carry the bulk of it out during 2009–10 (chart). Thus,
tobacco/alcohol inflation accounted for about
2 percentage points of the 4.7 percent inflation at end-2009.

CORE HICP INFLATION

Even if supply factors contributed significantly
to headline inflation, core inflation has also
remained higher relative to the regional peers.9
Despite the significant widening of the output gap
throughout 2009, core inflation started to decline
only in late 2009, dropping precipitously to about
2 percent by February 2010.

Has inflation in Romania been intrinsically
persistent, or do other factors account for the
high inflation in recent years? A common way of describing intrinsic persistence is by
looking at the autocorrelation properties of inflation, which we measure as the sum of
autoregressive coefficients in a univariate autoregressive model
of
monthly inflation with four lags. To avoid spuriously high estimates of persistence because
of the long span of the sample, we test for breaks in the time series properties of inflation in
our model and allow for discrete breaks in the intercept (mean inflation), but also look at a
shorter sample that covers broadly the inflation-targeting period in the case of Romania
(2005–10).



Estimated over the past fourteen years, the sum of AR coefficients for Romania is
about 0.4 (and significant), which is in line with the average for its regional peers
(chart). The inflation inertia declined following the introduction of inflation targeting
in 2005, with the persistence coefficient dropping from about 0.4 during the pre-IT
period to 0.26 during the inflation-targeting regime and appears among the lowest in
the region during this period. The low persistence relative to other countries in the
region reflects in part comparison with
HEADLINE INFLATION: PERSISTENCE PARAMETER
several countries with pegged exchange
rate regimes, whose inflation inertia
appears to have increased significantly
during 2005–10 because in the absence of
a nominal exchange rate instrument
inflation has been the main adjustment
mechanism for the real effective exchange
rate. Nevertheless, even excluding
countries with pegged exchange rate
regimes, Romania compares favorably

with the neighbors, with a 0.26 persistence coefficient compared to a 0.4 on average
for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey.


The results for core inflation do not reveal significant persistent either. The intrinsic
persistence of core inflation, once we
CORE INFLATION: PERSISTENCE PARAMETER
allow for a time-varying mean, has been
about 0.5 over the past ten year, which is
broadly in line with the average for
emerging markets in the region. Inflation
inertia fell after the introduction of
inflation targeting and, at 0.3 during 2005–
10, is similar to the regional peers with a
flexible exchange rate regime but lower
when compared to all emerging markets in
the EU, including countries with pegged
regimes.

Do the persistence properties of inflation change if we account for extrinsic influences
of inflation? To answer this question, we estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) model that
captures the interaction of annual inflation with domestic demand conditions (output gap);
monetary conditions (short-term money market rates); world food and oil prices; marginal
costs (average wage in industry); and the nominal exchange rate (measured by the NEER)10.
We estimate the model for a shorter sample 2003–2010 to avoid likely structural breaks in
the dynamic properties of inflation, but also look at the outcomes for a longer sample.
Stripping away various extrinsic determinants
of inflation appears to suggest that intrinsic
inertia of the headline inflation in Romania is
significantly higher than in its regional peers
(chart). Inflation inertia accounts for 41 percent
of the total variance in Romania, compared to
about 20 percent on average for its regional
peers, at a two-year horizon. This large
difference is again driven in part by comparison

We use a 2-lag model with monthly data in logs, which performs well for most countries on the basis of the
lag-length selection criteria. The model’s responses to shocks are assumed to follow the following causal
ordering of innovations: commodity prices -> exchange rate -> output gap -> wages->inflation -> interest rate.
This ordering implies that monetary policy shocks have no contemporaneous effects on any other variable as has
been commonly assumed in the literature. The output gap is proxied by (the inverse) deviations of the
unemployment rate from trend.

with currency board countries: this time, taking into account the impact of wages on inflation
has revealed that inflation persistence in pegged-regime countries is very small, which drives
down the average for Romania’s peers. Compared to other inflation-targeters, Romania’s
inflation persistence does appear higher

nevertheless, accounting for 41 percent of the

total variance compared with about 37 on
average for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and
Poland. Another measure of inflation
persistence―the half-life of a shock to headline
inflation, or the number of periods it takes for a
shock to dissipate to below half of its original
magnitude―confirms this finding: the half life
on an inflation shock is 15 months in Romania,
compared to 10⅓ months in other inflation
targeters and 5.2 months in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes.

The results also suggest that extrinsic factors have a significant impact on inflation:

and unfolds after about a year. We also find that the
impact of exchange rate shocks is asymmetric
during episodes of appreciations and depreciations:
while exchange rate depreciations tend to increase
prices, appreciations do not necessarily lead to price
decreases, suggesting inflation is unlikely to benefit
from the early-2010 currency appreciation, while it

Demand conditions have a somewhat delayed

in part why it has remained high in the face of a

a more persistent effect, peaking after two years.

Commodity prices account for a relatively low
share of the variability in inflation, because of a low passthrough of world food prices
to domestic inflation. While the contribution of oil prices to inflation variance is
about 16 percent, broadly in line with Romania’s peers, world food prices explain a
small portion of the inflation variation, consistent with the small pass-through we find

40

55
of the world commodity prices to domestic food prices in Romania, as these appear
driven significantly by local weather conditions.
A similar VAR analysis of the determinants of core inflation, on the other hand,
suggests that its apparent persistence to date is not due to inherent stickiness but to
extrinsic factors.11


Accounting for the extrinsic influences on core inflation still preserves the finding
that the inherent persistence of core inflation―measured as either the share of
variance due to inflation inertia or as the half life to shocks to core inflation― is not
out of line compared to other countries. In particular, shocks to core inflation have a
half life of about 7 months, compared to an average of 10 months among the peers.
This suggests that somewhat higher inflation inertia in Romania’s headline inflation
could be traced back to development in noncore prices. A look at the persistence
properties of various CPI subindices for Romania suggests that alcohol/tobacco
inflation and domestic food inflation―the two key subindices outside core inflation
― have been very sticky over the past seven years (chart). As a result, overall
noncore inflation, which also includes energy products, has remained significantly
above that of Romania’s peers (chart). While evidence traditionally points to notable
persistence in services inflation because of the high share of labor in the sector, this
does not appear to be the case in Romania, at least over the most recent period.

The exchange rate and second-round effects from noncore inflation are the key
extrinsic drivers of core inflation, together accounting for about 40 percent of its
variance. Impulse responses imply, for example, that the 16 percent depreciation of

As previously, we estimate a two-lag VAR model, with the following ordering of innovations: exchange rate > noncore inflation (food, energy, tobacco and alcohol) -> output gap -> wage inflation-> core inflation ->
interest rate. The model is generally estimated over 1999–2010, although for shorter periods when data are not
available.

56
the NEER during 2007–09 may have contributed up to 0.5 percentage points to core
inflation in the short-term. Similarly, the 3 percentage point increase in noncore
inflation in early 2010 in part reflecting the hikes in tobacco excises would add some
0.1 percentage points to the underlying inflation within the subsequent 6 months. This
second-round passthrough explains in part the relatively higher core inflation in
Romania compared to its peers,

noncore items account for 30-45
percent of the consumer basket, their share is significantly higher in Romania (60
percent). Moreover, tests suggest that, at the 5 percent significance level, exchange
rate and noncore inflation Granger cause core inflation.


Demand conditions and wage inflation have a delayed impact on core inflation as
well, peaking at about 20–21 months, which again may explain the delayed drop in
core inflation despite the significant widening of the output gap during 2009. For
example, the impact of shocks to output gap on core inflation in Romania peaks at
around 21 months, compared to an average of 9 months among the regional peers
(although similar to Poland). In addition, the slow response to demand shocks
suggests that that the costs of disinflation in terms of output could be relatively high,
since for a targeted reduction in core inflation, the output will need to be reduced by
more.

Conclusions and Outlook for Inflation
While standard measures of inflation persistence—such as the sum of autocorrelation
coefficients—suggest that inflation in Romania is not more persistent than its regional
peers, accounting for its extrinsic influences reveals that headline inflation is indeed
relatively sticky. We do not find this to be the case for core inflation, which remained high
until recently due to the effects of the sharp currency depreciation and the second-round
passthrough of hikes in tobacco excises.
This suggests that the main source of the persistence in headline inflation lies in the
sluggishness of “noncore” items such as tobacco and food, in the case of the former due

57
to staggered adjustments in excises. It also suggests that while monetary policy focus on
core inflation is appropriate, it should not fully accommodate supply shocks (such as food or
tobacco inflation) because of their second round effects on underlying inflation.
The findings suggest a favorable outlook for meeting the inflation target in 2010.
Barring further increases in commodity prices or administered price adjustments, most
cyclical factors at work should provide tailwinds to the disinflation effort. The output gap
and declining wage inflation, while appearing to have bottomed out, should put downward
pressures on inflation over the next year or so, given the response lags. The effects of the
2008-09 currency depreciation have largely dissipated and—while the recent leu
appreciation may not contribute much to the disinflation process given the asymmetric
impact of appreciation and depreciation episodes on inflation—it will also not add to the
pressures. The second-round effects of the hikes in tobacco excises in early 2010 could, on
the other hand, reverse the recent decline in core inflation, but only temporarily. Staff
forecasts suggest that headline inflation is likely to decline to about 3½–3¾ percent by end2010, in line with the authorities’ mid-band target. The main upward risks are continued
increases in world oil prices and administrative adjustments in domestic gas and drug prices,
which will also have strong second round effects on core inflation.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 2. ROMANIA’S EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS AND STABILITY12
I. MOTIVATION AND MAIN FINDINGS
In the run-up to EU accession, Romania became an increasingly attractive destination
for private capital inflows. This contributed to a sharp increase in the current account
deficit (from about 3 percent of GDP in 2003 to a peak of 13½ percent in 2007), and a rapid
appreciation of the real exchange rate (amounting to about 50 percent between mid-2004 and
mid-2007). The external situation has changed drastically since 2007—the current account
deficit has fallen by 2/3, the real exchange rate has depreciated sharply, and previously large
non-FDI capital inflows fell to a trickle in 2009.
Against this background, this analytical note reviews Romania’s external
competitiveness and stability, focusing mainly on price competitiveness indicators. On
balance, the analysis below suggests that while Romania’s external competitiveness has
improved considerably since 2007, but needs to be enhanced further. The real exchange rate
remains moderately overvalued, and to ensure strong competitiveness the focus of policies
should be to bring inflation down and press ahead with structural reforms. In the product
markets, such reforms should aim to increase productivity and, in the labor market, to ensure
that wages are set consistently with productivity growth.
II. RECENT EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS AND STYLIZED FACTS
Romania’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has been on a depreciating trend since
mid-2007, following a sharp appreciation in earlier years, although it appreciated
slightly in early 2010 (Figure 1). At end-March 2010, the CPI-based REER had depreciated
by about 13 percent relative to its peak in July 2007, reversing part of the appreciation since
mid-2004. The depreciation of the CPI-based REER 2008–09 was due to nominal
depreciation, which more than offset continued higher inflation in Romania relative to its
trading partners (Figure 2). The trend in ULC-based REER is similar, but the magnitude of
appreciation during 2004–07 is much larger compared to the CPI-based REER.

Romania’s external trade and current account deficit contracted sharply in 2009.
Following a strong absorption boom in the run up to the EU membership fueled by private
capital inflows, the global financial crisis hit Romania hard, contributing to a sharp
contraction in domestic demand. As a result, after years of double-digit growth, imports fell
by nearly 35 percent (y-o-y) during the first nine months of 2009, almost double the rate of
decline of exports during the same period. Reflecting global trade patterns, Romania’s
exports and imports staged a recovery towards end-2009 (Figure 3). The crisis also
contributed to a sharp external adjustment, with the current account deficit falling to
4½ percent of GDP in 2009 from a peak of 13½ percent in 2007. Such adjustment was one of
the highest among new EU member states, reflecting Romania’s large current account deficit
at the outset of the crisis (Figure 4).

Compared to BOP crises of the last decade, on average Romania has had a more
moderate real exchange rate depreciation, a lower current account adjustment, but
sharper collapse in external trade (Table 1). The depreciation of Romania’s real exchange
rate in the aftermath of the crisis was about 1/3 of the average depreciation in the BOP crises
in emerging market economies of the last decade, and about 1/2 of depreciation in Hungary
and Poland during this crisis. The subsequent appreciation has been much more moderate as
well. The collapse in global trade impacted severely Romania’s exports, and the sharp
retrenchment in domestic demand contributed to a decline in imports that exceeded that in
previous crisis, despite the more muted exchange rate adjustment.

III. QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR ASSESSING THE REER LEVEL
This section assesses Romania’s REER level on the basis of the exchange rate prevailing
at end-2009 using three standard methods: (i) equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER);
(ii) macroeconomic balance (MB); and (iii) external sustainability (ES). The discussion
on the first two methods below is based on Vitek (2010) results, which uses a panel data set
of annual macroeconomic variables for 182 economies, whereas the discussion on the third
method is based on standard trade elasticities and baseline projections of Romania’s growth,
inflation, and openness of its economy.13
A. Macroeconomic Balance
The MB method suggests a more moderate overvaluation of Romania’s REER
compared to the ERER method, and the estimated overvaluation is not statistically
significant (Figure 5). The MB results suggest that the medium-term REER is overvalued by
about 5½ percent (Figure 6). However, unlike the period 2005-08 when the REER was
clearly overvalued (i.e., was outside the 90-percent confidence interval by a large margin),
the REER overvaluation is no longer statistically significant (i.e., is well within the 90percent confidence interval).

13

See Lee et al. (2008) for a description and Annex 2.I for the main steps under the three methodologies.

B. External Sustainability
The ES method also suggests a moderate overvaluation of Romania’s REER. Romania’s
NFA declined from -53 percent of GDP at
Figure 7. Romania: External Sustainability Trade-Offs
end-2008 to -70 percent at end-2009. This
deterioration was due mainly to the sharp
GDP decline in 2009, but also official
borrowing from IFIs that more than offset the
reduction in external private debt during 2009.
The projected medium-term current account
deficit under the baseline scenario—about
5 percent of GDP—will lead to a gradual
improvement in Romania’s NFA position, and
will stabilize it at around -64 percent of GDP
(Figure 7). Based on IMF (2002), an appropriate NFA target for Romania would be around 53 percent of GDP, given its openness level. To stabilize Romania’s NFA at such a level, a
current account deficit of about 4.1 percent of GDP is needed, implying an REER
overvaluation of about 5¼ percent.

C. Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
The ERER method suggests a higher overvaluation of Romania’s REER than the MB
and ES methods, although not statistically significant at standard levels of confidence
(Figure 8). Results indicate that Romania’s REER was broadly in line with its estimated
equilibrium during 1995–2004, but started to become increasingly overvalued from 2005.
The overvaluation increased to about 25 percent in 2007 (statistically significant at the
10 percent level), but started to moderate in 2008. The ERER results suggest that Romania’s
medium-term REER is about 13½ percent overvalued, although not statistically significant at
the 10 percent level. This assessment seems to be supported by the fact that the adjustment in
the trade balance in 2009, seems excessive in light of the REER appreciation that has taken
place so far (Figure 9). It is thus unclear at this stage to what extent the current account
adjustment in 2009 is sustainable at the current REER level.

IV. ROMANIA’S COMPETITIVE INDICATORS
The assessment obtained from the three quantitative REER methods above is subject to
large margins of uncertainty, given that structural relationships in transition economies
such as Romania tend to have frequent structural breaks. In particular, it is not yet
known to what extent the global financial crisis will affect international trade and capital
flows. Given these uncertainties, this section reviews recent developments in a number of
indicators—such as Romania’s unit labor costs, manufacturing wages, trade market shares,
and export composition. The objective is to combine the information from these indicators
with the results from the quantitative REER methods above, to help reach an informed
judgment on Romania’s competitiveness and the

Romania’s productivity strengthened during
the last decade, and despite a rapid increase in
manufacturing wages they remain among the
lowest in the EU. Romania’s overall unit labor
costs (ULCs) declined by about 12 percent
between 2002 and 2004, but drifted higher in
recent years, offsetting part of the earlier decline
(Figure 10). This increase in ULCs since 2004
reflected the sharp real appreciation that started
in 2005, and also the impact of the crisis in 2009
as the decline in economic activity exceeded that
of employment. The developments in Romania’s
ULCs were more favorable than the average in the
EU-15 and the other new EU member states. At
the same time, Romania’s manufacturing wages
also remain among the lowest relative to other
new EU member states (Figure 11). More
specifically, manufacturing wages in Romania

averaged about 365 €/month in 2009. The country with the closest level of manufacturing
wages to Romania in 2009 was Hungary (almost 20 percent higher), whereas in the other
countries manufacturing wages were significantly higher than in Romania (ranging from
90 percent in Poland to 230 percent in Slovenia). While reflecting productivity differentials,
Romania’s lower manufacturing wages also make Romania an attractive location for foreign
investors. Indeed, FDI to Romania (as a share to GDP) have been among the highest in the
new EU member states in recent years.
Romania has gained export market share at a rapid pace and the composition of its
exports has shifted towards non-textile manufactures. Since late-1990s, Romania has
basically doubled its export shares in the regional and world markets, and continued to gain
market share in 2009 despite the sharp contraction in its external trade (Figure 12). The gain
in market share by Romania to the EU market during the 2000s is similar to that of Poland
and Bulgaria, and significantly faster than the Czech Republic and Hungary. In addition, the
composition of its exports has shifted towards non-textile manufactures, which has more than
offset the secular decline in textile manufactures (Figure 13).

V. CONCLUSIONS
The analysis in this note suggests moderate but manageable external competitiveness
concerns for Romania. To ensure strong competitiveness, the focus of policies should be to
bring inflation down and press ahead with structural reforms. In the products markets, such
reforms should aim to increase productivity and, in the labor market, to ensure that wages are
set consistently with productivity growth.
The results of the three standard quantitative methods suggest, on balance, modest
overvaluation of Romania’s REER that is not statistically significant at standard levels

overvaluation between 5½ and
13½ percent, such overvaluation is not statistically significant at standard levels of
confidence. The ES method also suggests a moderate undervaluation if Romania were to
target an NFA level of -53 percent of GDP, determined on the basis of its openness level.
The above results of quantitative methods, however, are subject to significant margins of
uncertainty, given the unknown impact of global financial crisis on global trade and capital
flows.
Various wage and labor productivity indicators show a moderate reduction in
Romania’s ULCs during the 2000s, and Romania has also continued to gain export
market share. While labor productivity has increased rapidly since early 2000s, Romania’s
wages in the manufacturing sector remain among the lowest in the region, reflecting
differences in productivity. At the same time, Romania has made rapid gains in both EU and
global export markets shares, mainly due to a rapid increase in non-textile manufacturing
exports, and has also increases the share of medium-and high tech exports.

This assessment is based on the level of the exchange rate prevailing at end-2009. In early 2010 Romania’s
REER appreciated by some 2-3 percent relative to end-2009 level reflecting mainly the appreciation of €/RON
exchange rate. If sustained, such appreciation would have posed increasing sustainability problems. As of endMay 2010, however, Romania’s REER had returned back to its end-2009 level.

Annex 2.I: Methodology and Data for Exchange Rate Assessment
This annex summarizes the steps for three methodologies used in this analytical note to
assess where Romania’s REER stands with respect to its fundamental determinants. The
ERER and MB methods are based on results of Vitek (2010), which uses a panel data set of
macroeconomic variables for 182 economies.
ERER Method


Estimating a reduced-form equilibrium relationship between the actual REER and a
set of fundamentals, consisting of terms of trade, relative productivity, relative
government consumption, net foreign assets, aid inflows, and remittance inflows.



Calculating the REER adjustment needed to restore equilibrium as a difference
between the actual REER and the “equilibrium REER” estimated on the basis of the
above set of REER medium-term fundamentals.
MB Method



Estimating an equilibrium relationship between the current account (CA) balance and
a set of fundamentals, including relative income, relative income growth, relative old
age dependency, relative population growth, relative fiscal balance, oil balance,
initial net foreign assets, aid inflows, and remittance inflows.



Calculating the needed REER adjustment to close the gap between the underlying CA
and the “CA norm” derived from previous step, using the medium-term semielasticity of the current account balance to the REER. The latter is estimated as
, where -0.71 and 0.92 denote, respectively, the
medium run elasticity of the volume of exports or imports with respect to REER, and
and
denote, respectively, the medium-term projection of the ratio of exports
and imports to output. The projected medium-term for Romania is -0.14.
ES Method



Calculating the size of the CA balance that will stabilize the NFA at a given
“benchmark” position. A range of NFA levels is used in this note.



Comparing the “stabilizing” CA balance obtained from the above step with that
expected to prevail in the medium term at unchanged policies.



Calculating the needed REER adjustment to close the gap between the “stabilizing”
CA balance and the projected CA at unchanged policies, using the semi-elasticity of
the current account balance to the REER (-0.14).

ANALYTICAL NOTE 3: ASSESSMENT OF RESERVE ADEQUACY FOR ROMANIA15
The financial situation in Romania has stabilized since it was granted exceptional financial
assistance from IFIs in May 2009 to cushion the adverse impact of the global financial crisis.
The sharp reversal in capital flows that started in late-2008 and continued into early 2009 has
moderated, and the disbursements of official financial assistance helped build international
reserves above the pre-crisis level.
Against this background, this analytical note assesses Romania’s reserve adequacy. In
summary, Romania’s reserves coverage compares well with other emerging market countries
(EMCs) and the level of reserves seems adequate. Romania’s reserves coverage is well above
the two main rules of thumb, and broadly consistent with the optimal level of reserves
suggested by a model-based approach that takes into account both the benefits of
consumption smoothing and the opportunity cost of holding reserves.
The note proceeds as follows. Section I discusses the principles determining the size of
reserves holdings in EMCs. Section II reviews recent developments in Romania’s reserves.
Section III uses a model-based framework to determine reserve adequacy for Romania.
I. PRINCIPLES DETERMINING SIZE OF RESERVES HOLDING IN EMCS
Holding of reserves is one of the main self-insurance mechanisms for countries to
cushion the impact of adverse economic shocks. An adequate level of reserves allows
countries to smooth consumption during a crisis, and may also help reduce the probability of
crises through confidence effects and giving authorities room for maneuver. However,
holding of reserves involves financial costs, as they yield a return that is generally well
below the interest rate that the authorities pay on their debt. Thus in determining the level of
reserves, countries have to balance the consumption-smoothing and potential confidence
benefits of a ready stock of reserves, against the financial costs of holding such reserves.16
As a general principle, it is not optimal to self-insure through reserves for any potential
shock. In the case of tail events, it seems superior to make temporary use, if needed, of
bilateral or multilateral resources (e.g., IMF). As regards insurance from “reasonable risks,”
given the EMCs increasing integration with international financial markets and thus higher
exposure to sudden stops in financial flows, their focus on reserve adequacy has shifted away
from trade considerations, and toward the financial account and balance-sheet fragilities. In

practice, this has meant placing increasingly less weight on the traditional three-month-ofimport rule, and more to the Greenspan-Guidotti rule, according to which reserves should
fully cover short-term debt.
II. HOW DOES ROMANIA’S RESERVE COVERAGE COMPARE WITH OTHER EMCS?
Romania’s international reserves increased rapidly in the run up to the EU. Driven by a
sharp acceleration in capital inflows, particularly debt-creating bank inflows, Romania’s
reserves increased from just under €8 billion at end-2003 to nearly €29 billion at end-2007,
an average annual increase of about 40 percent.
Reserves coverage to imports of goods and services (GNFS) increased sharply since
Figure 1. Romania: International Reserves Coverage
2003 despite a rapid trade expansion. Although
GNFS imports increased by about 17 percent per
year during 2003-07, the increase in reserves was
even faster. As a result, the coverage of reserves
doubled from about 4 months of GFNS imports
at end-2003 to 8 months at end-2007 (Figure 1).
The reserve coverage increased further to about
9½ months at end-2009, but this was mainly due
to the collapse in trade from the global financial
crisis.

1/ Short-term debt at remaining maturity (excludes interest payments on long-term debt).

In contrast, reserves coverage to short-term external debt declined rapidly since 2003.
With an increasing share of capital inflows as short-term debt, reserves coverage to shortterm debt declined from nearly 200 percent at end-2003 to below 100 percent at end-2008.
The improvement in 2009 reflected mainly the increase in gross reserves and an
improvement in the maturity structure of private external debt during 2009.
Romania’s reserves coverage compares favorably with other EMCs. Coverage to GNFS
imports was 9½ months at end-2009, well above the median of 6 months for the EMCs
included in Figure 2. In addition, coverage to short-term external debt at end-2009 was about
122 percent, right at the median level for the EMCs included in Figure 3. Compared to other
countries in the region, Romania has one the highest reserves coverage to short-term debt.

III. MODEL-BASED APPROACH TO RESERVE ADEQUACY IN ROMANIA
While Romania’s reserves coverage is well above both rules of thumb—i.e., the 3-monthsof-imports and 100 percent short-term debt—such rules lack analytical foundations. This
section calibrates the optimal level of reserves for Romania using the framework of Jeanne
and Ranciere (2006).
That paper develops a model that optimizes the reserves holdings, taking into account both
the benefits of consumption smoothing in a small open economy that is hit by a sudden stop
in capital inflows, as well as the opportunity cost of holding reserves. The model generates a
formula that calibrates the optimal reserves as follows:
1

      (1  p  )

(1)

where:
p  1


 (1     )

(2)

and:
ρ – is the level of reserves as a share of GDP
λ – is short-term debt as a share of GDP
γ – is the output cost of a sudden stop
σ – is the risk aversion parameter
δ – is the opportunity costs of reserves holding, and
π – is the probability of a sudden stop
To calibrate the level of reserves for Romania, the following baseline values were used: λ=25
percent of GDP (20 percent for short-term debt at remaining maturity at end-2009, and 5
percent for the current account deficit projected in 2010); λ=6.5 percent of GDP, and π=8
percent (both from Jeanne and Ranciere); δ=200 basis points (current difference between
charges on liabilities to IMF and interest from reserves); and σ=3 (Salman, 2005).

70
These parameters generate a baseline level of reserves for Romania of 25½ percent of
GDP, or about €31 billion on the basis of projected GDP for 2010. This is equivalent to
the level of Romania’s reserves at end-2009 (€30.9 billion), and lower than that projected for
end-2010 (€37½ billion). Clearly, except for the level of short-term debt (actual data) and
current account deficit (baseline projection), the choice of the other parameters above is
somewhat arbitrary. In addition, authorities may want to insure against a smaller amount of
sudden stop (the calibration assumes insurance for 100 percent of short-term debt at
remaining maturity, plus the full amount of the current account deficit).
The sensitivity of the optimal level of reserves holdings for Romania is greatest
regarding the size of sudden stop and the opportunity costs of reserves holding. Figure 4
below shows the sensitivity of the optimal level of reserves for Romania for four main
parameters: (i) size of sudden stop, (ii) sudden stop probability, (iii) opportunity cost of
holding reserves, and (iv) magnitude of risk aversion. For reasonable parameter values on
sudden stop probability and risk aversion, the sensitivity of results is relatively moderate.
However, sensitivity of results is significant for the size of sudden stop and the opportunity
cost of reserves. More specifically, if the sudden stop would affect only short-term debt (i.e.,
will have no impact on financing needed to cover the projected current account deficit), the
desired level of reserves would fall from 25½ percent of GDP (€31 billion) in the baseline, to
about 22 percent of GDP (€27 billion). Results are also highly sensitive to the opportunity
costs of holding reserves. For example, if the opportunity costs of holding reserves would
increase from 200 to 300 basis points, the optimal level of reserves would fall to 24 percent
of GDP (€29 billion).

ANALYTICAL NOTE 4: UNDERSTANDING OUTPUT COLLAPSE IN ROMANIA17
I. INTRODUCTION
While any economic crisis is always painful, the current global crisis is expected to be
particularly harsh and its economic and social consequences will be quite large. First, by
any measure, the economic meltdown is the deepest of the postwar period. Second, the degree
of synchronicity of the downturn is the highest over the past half century.18 This global crisis,
which started in the U.S. housing market, spread rapidly across markets and borders after the
Lehman Brother’s collapse in September 2008. Emerging markets and developing countries
were then confronted with two sizeable shocks. First, a “sudden stop” of capital inflows was
prompted by the global deleveraging process. Second, a decline in exports followed the
recession in advanced economies. However, despite the intensity of the shocks and its
synchronized propagation, the impact on economic activity varied widely across nations.
Why growth performance was relatively weaker in Emerging Europe than in Latin
American or Asia? Even though Emerging Europe has been hard hit on average, there is also
an extraordinary variation on how much economies in this region were affected. The 7.1
percent GDP contraction in Romania in 2009 was one of the largest in the region. Why this
heterogeneity even within countries in the same region? Were all countries just innocent
bystanders of a crisis that originated in financial sectors of the US and other advanced
economies? Or did weak policy frameworks impair countries resilience to external shocks?
Based on cross-country regressions, this note seeks to answer these questions.
II. PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA

serious output repercussions
worldwide, i.e. in both
developed and developing
economies, the severity of the
impact was far from
homogenous across regions or
countries. Figure 1 presents the

developing countries.19 In this sample growth rates varies from a low -18.5 percent for
Lithuania to a high 8.5 percent in China. Among regions, Emerging Europe was hit the hardest
as GDP contracted by 6.4 percent on average. In Latin America GDP also declined, but only
by 1.3 percent on average. In contrast, output in Emerging Asia grew by 1.1 percent on
average.
An analysis by quintiles also highlights
that countries in Emerging Europe were
badly hit by the global crisis.20 Figure 2
shows that European economies account
almost entirely for the first quintile.21
Moreover, 75 percent of countries in this

Previous studies have employed a wide range of variables to capture alternative
transmission mechanisms for the ongoing global crisis. Similarly, this paper explores five
likely channels of transmission: (i) macroeconomic imbalances; (ii) financial vulnerabilities;
(iii) trade linkages; (iv) overall policy framework; and (v) other variables. Economic
developments during the run-up to the global crisis had several common characteristics in
countries most affected by the meltdown. In particular, it seems that most potential channels
have played a central role for the cross-border transmission (and amplification) of the recent
shocks.
Table 1 shows, for each quintile, the average value of some variables employed in the
econometric exercises. Within the sample, it is clear that hardest hit countries exhibited large
internal and external imbalances in the run-up to the crisis. The financial linkage channel was
also important: the degree of leverage, the growth in bank credit and the amount of capital
inflows are positively correlated with the severity of the growth impact. Countries with higher
business cycle correlations with developed economies and more open to external trade have
also registered a worse growth performance. Finally, there is some indication that economies

III. REGRESSION RESULTS
This section uses cross-country regression analysis to assess more formally how recent
output dynamics were affected by different factors. The dependent variable in baseline
regressions is the 2009 GDP growth rate. For the econometric exercises, potential explanatory
variables are divided into two groups (see Appendix 4.II). The first group includes the control
variables, which portray each country trade linkages and main structural characteristics:
correlation of business cycles with developed economies, degree of openness, population size,
per-capita GDP, share of industry in GDP, institutional indexes, etc. The second group
contains a set of important pre-crisis fundamentals: current account balance, inflation rate,
general government balance, exchange rate regime, growth in credit to the private sector,
amount of capital inflows, international reserves ratios, etc. The empirical results are presented
in Table 2.
There is strong evidence that output contracted more in countries highly integrated to
the world economy. After controlling for GDP, the variable measuring the degree of
synchronization of economic cycles with developed economies (i.e. the average correlation
coefficient of business cycles with US, Euro area and Japan) enters significantly and with the
correct sign in all models. The empirical work also confirms that countries having important
financial sector vulnerabilities in years prior to the crisis suffered the steepest output
contraction. In particular, results suggest that domestic credit booms and sizeable capital

76
inflows22 are robust pre-crisis predictors of output declines. However, and in contrast to
previous findings in the literature, the degree of leverage did not enter significantly in any
model once one control for other factors.

Improved macroeconomic frameworks have also helped countries to reduce the degree of
output contraction, but there is stronger evidence for the importance of monetary and
fiscal policies than for exchange rate policy in dampening the impact of the crisis. For
instance, a better monetary framework (i.e. lower inflation rate) was instrumental across all
countries to avert systemic damages of the current meltdown. The effect of sound fiscal
policies is, however, not homogenous across all regions: the general government deficit was
statistically significant only for countries in Emerging Europe. In this region, countries that

Capital flows are defined as the sum of portfolios investment (liabilities) and other investment (liabilities).

77
pursued loose fiscal policies before the crisis (reflected in large budget deficits) have
experienced a greater fall in GDP, other things equal.23 The significance of other macro-policy
(like exchange rate regime or international reserve coverage) is not robust across all
specifications.
A growth accounting exercise could be performed using these econometric results. To this
aim, the explanatory variables employed in the regressions are divided into two categories:
exogenous and endogenous. The exogenous variables are those considered to be outside the
authorities’ control, at least in the short run, and include all the control variables. The
endogenous ones comprise the variables reflecting financial sector vulnerabilities and the
policy framework. These variables can be clearly influenced by government’s decisions. The
estimated parameters from regression model 6 and 7 in Table 2 and the variables mean values
(for each group of countries) are used to construct the predicted output drop arising from
endogenous and exogenous variables.
While deteriorating external conditions
were important factors, unsustainable
domestic policies explain a large part of
the recent output collapse in Emerging
Europe. Some countries in the region
entered the global recession with deeprooted vulnerabilities, running large
current account deficits due to loose fiscal
policy and excessive credit growth. Thus,
external shocks during the crisis were

exacerbated by poor macroeconomic
policies. The growth accounting exercise
indicates that weak domestic policies could
explain a large part of the recent output collapse in European countries. In fact, the output
contraction due to endogenous factors is estimated to be larger for European countries than for
the average country in Latin America or Asia.

The negative effects of weak domestic policies in Romania were far more important than
in almost any other sub-regional group. Financial sector vulnerabilities and weak
macroeconomic policies account roughly for a 6.1 percent GDP contraction in 2009, almost
the entirely actual contraction.24 If Romania had had the same macroeconomic policies as the
average country in the CEE sub-region, its growth rate would have been around 1.5 percent
higher.

23

This finding is in line with the notion that countries with more pre-crisis fiscal space were able to adopt more
effective countercyclical fiscal policies during the meltdown.
24
Using model 7 for the exercise delivers a similar result: weak domestic policies could account for a 4 percent
2009 GDP contraction in Romania.

78
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Results in this paper highlighted that sound policy frameworks were crucial buffers to
cushion external shocks. These shocks were wide-raging and severe, but some economies
fared better than others during the global meltdown. Cross-country regressions showed that a
relatively small set of variables could explain much of the difference in countries’ growth
performance after the financial crisis intensified in September 2008. In particular, empirical
results showed that trade linkages have played a key role in the transmission of the crisis to
emerging markets and developing countries. However, there is also robust evidence that
financial vulnerabilities and poor macroeconomic policies have intensified the impact of
external shocks. Countries with more rapid growth in lending to the private sector (usually
associated with massive capital inflows), weaker fiscal positions and higher inflation rates
prior to the crisis tended to suffer larger output losses.
While deteriorating external conditions triggered the inmediate crisis, unsustainable
domestic policies contributed to the large output collapses in Emerging Europe. Several
countries in the region were ill suited to face the global meltdown, including Romania. They
entered the global recession with deep-rooted vulnerabilities, running large current account
deficits due to loose fiscal policy and excessive credit growth. The pre-crisis capital inflowfueled-boom left the region highly exposed to a reversal in market sentiment and a “suddenstop” of capital inflows. In addition, expansionary macroeconomic policies further exacerbated
private sector demand pressures, built even larger imbalances and left no room for countercyclical stimuli once the crisis unfolded.
This empirical attempt to explain the heterogeneous experiences of countries suggest
some preliminary policy lessons. In years prior to the crisis some economies have made
strides in strengthening fiscal positions, solidifying financial systems and their regulation, and
anchoring inflation expectations. For this reason they were able to respond to the external
crisis with active (fiscal and monetary) policies to boost output and employment, suffering
considerably smaller declines in output. The message is clear: policy preparation could pay
important dividends when external conditions deteriorate. Importantly, as the crisis draws to a
close and economies start to move forward, the benefits of improved frameworks need to be
safeguard by a continuation of prudent policies. After all, the next financial crisis may be
around the corner.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 5. THE TRADE-OFFS OF EURO ADOPTION
I. NOT IF, BUT WHEN
For all new EU member states (NMS), participation in the eurozone is mandatory but
the candidate countries can set the target date. As part of the entry requirements to joining
the European Union, Romania has the obligation to join the Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU), as soon as it meets the Maastricht economic convergence criteria. However, the
treaty doesn’t set the pace of economic convergence with the EMU25. De facto, countries can
choose the timetable for euro adoption. The need to fulfill the Maastricht criteria prior to
entry is both a constraint and an opportunity to benefit from an independent monetary policy
until the economy is ready to join the currency area.
A premature adoption of the single currency—before achieving a sufficient degree of
convergence and economic flexibility—could be
detrimental for a candidate country. Adopting
the euro implies foregoing the exchange rate buffer
and the monetary policy tool and relying only on
nominal adjustments to compensate for economic
shocks. The loss of monetary policy will have to be
compensated by other adjustment mechanisms. In
addition, countries with relatively higher inflation
risks eroding competitiveness when entering a
monetary union and abandoning the possibility of
foreign exchange adjustment.
II. TRADE-OFFS OF ADOPTING THE EURO
A. Pros and Cons of Joining a Monetary Union
The main benefits expected from joining the euro area include macroeconomic stability
and growth as well as economic convergence toward the best performers of the area through
lower transaction costs, trade creation, and lower interest rates. The reduction in transaction

25

The economic convergence criteria include (i) the candidate country’s inflation shall not be above
1.5 percentage point the average inflation in the 3 EMU countries with lowest inflation, (ii) its deficit should be
below 3 percent of GDP, (iii) its public debt lower than 60 percent of GDP, (iv) the country needs to
demonstrate the capacity of maintaining a stable exchange rate through participation in ERM II, and (v) the
long-term nominal interest rate cannot be more than 2 percentage point above the rate for the 3 EMU countries
with the best performance in term of price stability.

83
cost is expected to fuel cross-country trade as the single currency eliminates the uncertainty
related to exchange rate movements and thus diminishes the risks related to foreign trade
while larger foreign investment are likely to raise potential output and improve welfare
Moreover, Romania would benefit from eliminating the exchange rate risks associated with
its substantial foreign exchange denominated debt.
However, adopting the euro implies losing the monetary and exchange rate policy
instruments. Once it has joined the EMU, if Romania is affected by a country specific
shocks, it won’t be able to use monetary policy for obtaining some counter-cyclical effects or
benefit from the exchange rate buffer. The ECB’s monetary policy might be less appropriate
for smoothing Romania’s output and price volatility. While emerging market are expected to
grow faster to catch up with core European countries, Romania will be subject to a monetary
policy that fits mature economies and might generate macro and microeconomic imbalances.
In addition, higher inflation might erode Romania’s competitiveness and lead to sluggish
growth and unemployment.
B. How Synchronized Is Romania with the Euro Area?
The degree of similarity in the economic structure of Romania and the Euro area
matters as it determines the degree of synchronization in their economic activity and
therefore similarity in the transmission of shocks.26 Among MNS, Romania’s value added
structure is the least similar to the euro area one. Romania is less open than some other NMS
but trade relatively intensively with the EU. A higher share of intra-industry trade implies
that Romania would be increasingly affected by common industry specific shocks. While
Romania’s GDP is highly correlated with the euro area, inflation’s co-movement with the
euro area has been low, reflecting the inflationary pressure associated with to the catching up
process.
Among candidate countries, Romania’s economy is the least structurally similar to the
euro area. In terms of output similarity measured by the Bray-Curtis value added similarity
index27, the structure of Romania’s economy is the least similar to the euro area among
candidate countries, which already have economic structures that are more dissimilar to the

26

A condition for the benefits of joining a currency area to outweigh the costs is for the business cycle of the
candidate country to be synchronized with the core of the union so that the one-size-fits-all monetary policy
doesn’t hurt the candidate country.
27

The Bray-Curtis similarity index is computed as the ratio between absolute differences and sums of the shares
of sectoral contribution to total value added in the given country and the euro area.

84
euro area than the historical member countries (Figure 1). The structural differences are due
to the relatively high share of agriculture in value added and much lower share in services
(Figure 2). Unsurprisingly, value added structural characteristics are persistent: as can be
seen from figure 3 showing the evolution of the index for historical members, the index
remains relatively stable over time even after entry in the EMU. The relative dissimilarity in
value added will contribute to amplify differences in transmission of shocks.

While the economy is relatively less open than other NMS, Romania’s trade is geared
toward the euro area and the rising share of intra-industry trade suggest that is likely
to getting closer to the euro area’s industrial structure. Another indicator of structural
similarity is the Grubel-Lloyd Index of intra-industry trade28, combined with the indicators of
the country’s share of trade in GDP and intensity of trade with the euro area. Shocks are
more likely to be more symmetric as the NMS’ trade with the currency area is more intensive
or intra-sectoral. As can be seen from Table 1 and Figure 4, while Romania’s main trading
partners are within the euro area, it remains less open than other candidate countries,
suggesting vulnerability to country-specific shocks. However, while remaining relatively
low, the share of intra-industry trade has increased over the past decade indicating that
Romania is progressively reducing its exposure to risks of external asymmetric shocks.

Finally, Romania’s co-movements of real GDP and inflation with the Euro area show
that output is relatively correlated but the price evolution reflects Romania’s
inflationary pressures. As Romania has entered the union with relatively low levels of
income, it has since experienced fast growth and convergence of income levels toward the
EU average. The income convergence is accompanied by price level convergence so it
generates upward pressure on the inflation rate of new members.

87

Figure 6: Correlation of GDP growth and HICP inflation with the Euro Area 2000-2009

C. Risks of Rising Imbalances and Loss of Competitiveness
An inadequate monetary policy could lead to rising imbalances and bring Romania
back to an unsustainable growth path. Joining the euro area is likely to lower Romania’s
nominal interest rates while inflationary pressures might remain present as income level will
continue to raise and catch up with the average euro area level. The drop in real interest rates
could fuel a lending boom, generate a widening positive output gap and lead to unsustainable
growth of domestic demand, a current account deficit –imbalances that have characterized
the pre-crisis situation.
Inflationary pressures in the absence of the exchange rate adjustment can lead to loss of
competitiveness and subsequent high unemployment and slow growth as shown in prior
examples such as East Germany, Greece and Portugal that have all experienced
competitiveness loss after joining a currency union.
Mitigating policies need to rely on flexible labor and product markets. What used to
come as a change in the real exchange rate from a nominal exchange rate with sticky
domestic costs and prices will need to come from domestic nominal variables. However,
downward wage flexibility is painful and is unlikely to be implemented over the long run.
D. Additional Post-Crisis Challenges and Credible Timetable
The financial crisis has worsened the fiscal situation of most EU countries but not
modified the entry requirements for the euro adoption. In particular, joining the euro
requires a fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP. Early euro adoption would require a very
ambitious fiscal consolidation path given the post-crisis weak outlook.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 6. THE ROMANIAN BANKING SYSTEM DURING THE DOWNTURN
The financial crisis sparked by the default of Lehman Brothers in generated a deep
contraction in financial flows to Central and Eastern Europe and was followed by a
sharp economic downturn. The reduction in exports and production and increases in
unemployment caused a significant deterioration of corporate and household sector balance
sheets across Europe. After several years of strong acceleration, credit growth in Romania
suffered a significant turnaround as external capital inflows halted.

In the whole of the CESEE region, private sector financing was curtailed as banks
reduced reliance on foreign funding and intensified efforts to increase their local
deposit base. Developments in Romania remained mostly in line with its neighboring
countries, although it become one of the countries where the effort to reduce reliance on
parent funding was more prominent, as evidenced by a significant reduction of the loan to
deposit ratio. Banks actively sought to increase their deposit base to reduce reliance on
parent funding. This was also reflected in a significant turnaround in the current account
balance experienced in the course of
2009. In the banking sector, this
represented increased competition for
domestic deposits which translated into
an increase in local deposit rates in the
early months of 2009, both in domestic
currency and in foreign currency. Such
pressures did ease during the course of
the year, although the market
segmented, with banks competing on
different deposit products.
In Romania, as in other countries, the banking sector business strategy during 2009 was
directed to strengthening the capital base. As in other CESEE countries, banks operating
in Romania faced a significant deterioration of on balance sheet asset quality as
unemployment and bankruptcies increased. Thus, it became necessary to rebuild capital
buffers to absorb losses. In line with their commitments in the framework of the European
Banking Coordination Initiative, parent banks have proactively increased capital resources

89
for their Romanian subsidiaries during the course of 2009, and applied a conservative
earnings retention policy. As a result, the capitalization ratio was strengthened in the course
of the year.
On-balance sheet risk was reduced
while banks’ portfolios were shifted
towards lower-risk investments, with
loans to the corporate sector falling
slightly as a share of total loans, while
the share of loans to state owned entities
increased. In addition, the portfolio of
government securities held by the
banking sector more than tripled
between November 2008 and
November 2009.
The increase in banks’ holdings of
government-issued securities
mirrored reductions in minimum
reserve requirements decided by the
NBR during the course of 2009. Such
trend was indicative of a commitment
of banks of maintaining the size of their
operations in Romania, which was also
formalized under the IMF and ECsponsored program. This implied a
reduction of the risk-weighted assets
without shrinking their total balance
sheet.
Both demand and supply factors
determined the sharp decline in private
sector credit growth, as total credit to
non-financial sector declined by
0.2 percent against a growth of 37 percent
in 2008. There was only a nominal increase
in EUR-denominated loans and the share of
EUR loans in total loans increased. This
was due primarily to a number of loan
portfolios banks repatriated in August
which had been previously held offshore.
This had the effect of boosting their FXdenominated loan portfolios reported in Romania, although no new lending took place.

90
The significant deterioration in
economic activity caused NPLs to triple
but banks provisioned accordingly.
Trends in NPLs have been similar to those
in neighboring countries; however,
absolute levels appear higher in Romania
as exposures are not netted of collateral
values, as is the case in many other
countries. Non-performing assets on
balance sheet increased significantly across
all categories of the loan portfolio, but in particular in the retail uncollateralized segment.
Most of the loans in the retail category are credit card loans which were extended in RON
with a floating interest rate. The loans with the lowest delinquency rates were the mortgage
real estate loans. In the corporate sector, construction and real estate loans were those with
the highest level of impairments, as the financial crisis brought a collapse in the domestic
real estate sector activity. Provisions for impairments have maintained a relatively stable
trend and did not diverge from those of other countries, as the banks increased provisions in
line with impairments.
FX-denominated portfolios performed
relatively well during 2009, with NPL
rates averaging 35 percent of the past due
portfolio against their 65 percent share in
of the total loan portfolio and a NPL rate of
65 percent for the domestic currency
portfolio. The performance of the FXdenominated portfolios has been surprising
and contrary to expectations following the sharp depreciation of the lei in the latter part
of 2008. However, FX loans are extended mostly on a collateralized basis and generally for
housing and for longer maturities, which typically increases incentives to repay.
Interest rates remained elevated
evidencing liquidity pressures and
heightened deposit competition. In the
early part of 2009, deposit rates in local
and foreign currency jumped evidencing
the significant liquidity strains in the
system. Bank net intermediation margins
suffered and profitability was affected.
Although the pressures eased through the
course of the year, pressure remained. NBR monetary policy actions were successful in
reducing interbank rates, but the market appears to have remained segmented with only
certain banks being able to finance through the interbank market, while others having to rely
exclusively on parent resources. The high levels of NPLs are causing lending rates to remain

91
high. The cost of risk increased significantly during the economic downturn and banks have
not reduced lending rates in accordance
with the reduction in policy rates, rather
directing credit to the public sector.
Going forward the system will still have
to generate significant provisions to face
the deteriorating portfolios and
competition for deposits will compress
lending margins. It is likely that the
profitability of the sector will remain
subdued as banks seek to manage the
challenges brought by the weak economy,
including the rise in bankruptcies and the impact of increasing unemployment.

APPENDIX I. ROMANIA: LETTER OF INTENT (LOI)
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC, 20431
U.S.A.

Bucharest, June 16, 2010

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The comprehensive anti-crisis program supported by the Fund, the EU, and the World
Bank has continued to play a crucial role in normalizing financial conditions reversing
economic imbalances, and setting the stage for economic recovery. These improvements
notwithstanding, conditions turned out to be more difficult than we had anticipated.
Economic activity remained depressed in recent months, due both to subdued domestic
demand and the slow recovery among Romania’s trading partners. Uncertainties related to
the crisis in Greece have also increased market risks. Accordingly, we now expect economic
recovery to become apparent later in the year, and project economic growth around zero or
slightly negative in 2010.
2.
The weaker economic growth and difficulties in revenue collections and pressures in
certain public spending categories have created challenges in meeting our fiscal targets.
However, our performance on other quantitative targets and the structural reform agenda has
been strong (Tables 1 and 2):


Quantitative performance criteria and inflation consultation mechanism. The
quantitative performance criteria on net foreign assets and general government
guarantees, as well as the continuous performance criterion on non-accumulation of
external arrears were met. The indicative targets on general government current
primary spending for end-March 2010 and on the financial balance of the largest lossmaking state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were also met. In addition, inflation remained
within the inner band of the inflation consultation mechanism throughout the period.
The performance criterion on the general government deficit for end-March was
missed by a very small margin, as was the quantitative performance criterion on the
target on general government arrears (see paragraph 3 below).



Structural benchmarks. The fiscal responsibility law was approved by parliament in
March, and implementation is underway. Amendments to the banking and windingup laws to enhance the bank resolution framework were also adopted in March 2010.
In addition, the legislation and internal regulations needed for the implementation of
tax administration reforms were adopted by government ordinance in April. The
discussion of pension reform legislation in Parliament is at an advanced stage, and we
expect Parliamentary approval by end-June. Finally, we are making significant

93
progress in preparing implementing legislation for the unified wage law as well as on
other structural benchmarks under the program.
3.
In view of this performance—and on the supplementary and corrective actions
outlined in this Letter—we request completion of the fourth review under the Stand-By
Arrangement. We request a waiver of nonobservance of the end-March 2010 performance
criteria on general government arrears and on the general government overall balance, and
that these performance criteria be modified for end-June 2010 as proposed in the attached
Table 1.
4.
We believe that the policies set forth in the letters of April 24, 2009,
September 8, 2009, February 5, 2010, and in this Letter are adequate to achieve the
objectives of our economic program, but the government stands ready to take additional
measures as appropriate to ensure achievement of its objectives. As is standard under all IMF
arrangements, we will consult with the IMF before modifying measures contained in this
Letter or adopting new measures that would deviate from the goals of the program, and will
provide the IMF and the European Commission with the necessary information for program
monitoring.
Macroeconomic Framework for 2010
5.
Economic activity remains weak and, contrary to earlier expectations, growth
continued to be negative during the first quarter of 2010. This mainly reflects weak domestic
demand, as well as adverse weather conditions in early 2010. We now expect economic
growth to improve later in the year, although uncertainties in external markets remain
considerable. However, for 2010 as a whole we forecast growth to remain around zero or
slightly negative. Inflation fell from 4.7 percent at end-2009 to 4.4 percent at end-May,
remaining well within the inner inflation band under the target with the Fund. At end-2010,
inflation is expected to ease further to around 3¾ percent on the back of weak domestic
demand and prudent monetary policy implementation. The weaker recovery in domestic
demand has restrained imports, and we now project a current account deficit of about
5 percent of GDP for 2010, compared to 5½ percent expected earlier. With capital flows
for 2010 largely unchanged from our earlier projections, we expect NFA to be higher by
about €1 billion relative to the end-2010 target. However, the NFA target will not be revised
upward, to provide the National Bank of Romania (NBR) greater flexibility to respond to
unexpected market disturbances.
Fiscal Sector
6.
A core objective of the program is to buttress our commitment to sustainable public
finances by containing the fiscal deficit and credibly reducing it over the medium term. To
this end, the 2010 budget was designed to achieve a fiscal deficit of around 6 percent of
GDP, about 1½ percentage points of GDP lower than in the previous year. Unfortunately,
several factors have placed that target in danger. First, downward revisions to the estimated
GDP mean that the original targets will yield a somewhat higher deficit ratio to GDP.

94
Second, the weaker-than-expected economic recovery has depressed revenue collections and
has boosted spending on unemployment benefits, particularly in the first quarter. Third, there
appear to be problems with increasing tax evasion, with revenue yields falling in many key
taxes (particularly excise taxes and VAT). Cumulative tax revenues are considerably lower
than initially projected (by 0.8 percent of GDP at end-April). The 2010 budget planned for
RON 2.4 billion non-tax revenue from a loan repayment from Rompetrol. However, actual
payment is uncertain. Negotiations will be concluded by the next review date on the exact
payment schedule. Finally, while overall expenditures were held to well below targeted
levels in an effort to reach the Q1 fiscal targets agreed with the IMF and EU, underlying
current spending pressures continue to accumulate, particularly in pensions, social transfers,
and in goods and services. These pressures have produced the overshooting of the arrears
target and have forced the undesirably low availability of resources for capital investment.
Together, these factors endanger compliance with the 2010 fiscal deficit targets. Under a nopolicy-change scenario the fiscal deficit would reach 9.1 percent of GDP at end-2010, some
3 percentage points of GDP higher than initially programmed.
7.
Given renewed uncertainties in international markets and the need to demonstrate our
clear commitment to a sustainable fiscal path, the government is committed to taking
additional difficult—but necessary—measures to bring the fiscal deficit to 6.8 percent of
GDP 2009 (which corresponds to 6.5 percent of GDP before the GDP revisions).


On the spending side, we will implement by June 1: (i) a 25 percent cut in total
wages, bonuses, and other compensation paid to all public sector employees
(1 percent of GDP this year); (ii) a 15 percent cut in pensions and other social
transfers (1 percent of GDP); (iii) cuts in transfers to local governments (0.3 percent
of GDP); and (iv) further reductions in heating subsidies (0.03 percent of GDP.
Further savings will be achieved through a temporary freeze on early retirement,
strict controls on new disability pensions, and by approving a new scheme to regulate
the payment of “stimulentes” (nonwage incentive payments for certain ministries).
Action has already been taken to reduce public employment by some 20,000 workers
in 2010, and we intend to further streamline staffing in the coming months. Structural
changes to the health system, pensions, education, and local government finance will
also generate savings (see ¶12 and ¶17-20);



To increase revenues, we will introduce the following measures: (i) a broadening in
the personal income and social security tax bases (as specified in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)); (ii) the introduction of a turnover tax
(clawback) on medical distributors.



Enactment of items (i-iii) on the spending side and of the measures to broaden tax
bases will be a prior action for the conclusion of the review. We will also take
measures to further streamline public employment in the coming months. If these
actions prove insufficient to achieve the end-year targeted deficit, we will take
additional action, including increases in tax rates as needed.

95
8.
To protect the more vulnerable members of society, we will keep the minimum wages
and pensions unchanged, and no wage or pension will be cut below that level. We will also
reform our social support programs with a view toward improving their effectiveness and
targeting them better on the poor and needy. In this context, the Guaranteed Minimum
Income (GMI) scheme, which is one of the better targeted programs, will be exempted from
the 15 percent cut in social spending, with other—less efficient—programs reduced by more
to attain the overall spending reduction. Specifically, we will reduce or improve the targeting
of the Lone (Single) Parent Allowance (LPA) and the Complementary Child Allowance
(CCA) as agreed with the World Bank. In parallel, we will be working to further reduce the
leakages from the GMI and others social programs to enhance their anti-poverty impact.
9.
The confidence generated by adherence to the program, together with improved
market conditions, has allowed us to improve the maturity profile of our public debt and
significantly lower the yields on new borrowing in recent months. To strengthen our ability
to respond flexibly to possible future market disturbances, we plan to continue increasing
gradually financial buffers at the Treasury to about 4 months of fiscal deficit financing and
public debt redemptions.
10.
The stock of domestic payment arrears has increased since the last review. We fully
realize the importance of not incurring further arrears and clearing the existing stock. At the
local government level, the amendments to the local public finance law (see ¶12) will
preclude the accumulation of future arrears. Most local arrears are to suppliers and we plan to
utilize swap agreements with local authorities to offset mutual debts. At the central level,
with most arrears in the health sector, we will implement a health sector restructuring plan
(see ¶ 18). To further improve monitoring and control mechanisms to eliminate arrears at
both central and local government levels, we will integrate the accounting reporting system
with the Treasury payment system (structural benchmark for end-March 2011). This link will
allow us to monitor commitments and assist in budget management and control. Lastly, we
will require line ministries to monitor their subordinated units in observing commitment
ceilings and enforce sanctions against institutions and individuals who breach the ceilings.
Fiscal reforms
11.
We are fully committed to implementing the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) passed
by Parliament at end-March 2010. The set-up of the Fiscal Council is under way, and we will
ensure that the Council members and the secretariat are fully staffed with appropriately
skilled people as soon as possible. We are developing the Fiscal Strategy (FS) for 2011-2013
and will submit it to Parliament by end-June. This Strategy will incorporate a fiscal deficit
target objective of no more than 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and will eliminate the 13th
salary paid to the public sector employees. We will also limit the 2011 wage bill to 39 billion
RON and set a limit of 1,290,000 total public employees at the beginning of 2011. To
encourage budgetary discipline, prioritize projects, and increase efficiency, the Ministry of
Public Finance will submit indicative expenditure ceilings to major spending institutions in
preparing the FS. We will link the FS to the annual budget process and will set up a Review
Team supported by the Cabinet to review line ministries’ budget proposals, press them to

96
improve their submissions so as to improve productivity, service delivery, and the quality of
regulations in line with the FRL requirements, and produce a report on efficiency-making
expenditure cuts to be incorporated into the 2011 budget.
12.
To strengthen fiscal discipline of local governments and preserve macro-fiscal
stability, we are in the process of amending the local public finance law. The amendments
will include: (i) changes to the legal definition of a balanced budget from one based on the
budgeted revenues and expenditures towards one based on actual revenues and accrual
expenditures; (ii) reflection in one law of all rules on local borrowing and introduction of
additional prudential limits, such as a ceiling on the stock of debt and requirement of
operating surplus in years prior to borrowing; (iii) approval of multi-annual borrowing
ceilings and investment transfers from the state budget to improve multiyear capital
budgeting; and (iv) incorporation of relevant sanctions from the FRL (structural benchmark
for end-September 2010). To comply with the Unified Wage Law, we will apply wage bill
limits according to staffing standards across local governments.
13.
Reinforced tax administration efforts are required to tackle the decline in revenue
yields during the recession. In the first stage, our efforts focused on addressing VAT noncompliance and fraud, improving management of growing tax arrears, and increasing control
of the largest taxpayers; the regulatory framework needed to support these efforts has been
approved by the government in April 2010. In the second stage, we will focus on highincome individual taxpayers and develop indirect audit methodologies to augment current
audit techniques to identify unreported income. In particular, we will amend the Fiscal Code
and the Fiscal Procedures Code to: (i) establish ANAF’s right to access bank records and
third-party records, upon proper notification and through a due process, to enable proper
determination of income; (ii) review the definitions of income to enable taxation of income
from any source not legally exempted; (iii) strengthen the requirement to report income; as
well as (iv) strengthen the right to audit for unreported income (structural benchmark for
end-November, 2010). We will also establish a special office to coordinate high-income
individual taxation issues and the development of initiatives or projects to identify, quantify,
or improve compliance in the high-income area.
14.
To combat tax evasion and smuggling and improve tax collection we will take the
following measures by end-June:


On VAT we will (i) establish common minimum standards for registration and
removal from records of the taxpayers who carry out intra-Community trade, in
particular acquisitions of goods, and (ii) set up a registry of the intra-Community
operators;



Establish collateral for intra-Community acquisitions of products with increased risk
of tax fraud;



Review the authorization regime for operators performing activities with goods under
suspension of excise duty by introducing more stringent requirements, including

97
setting mandatory collateral for the production, processing and holding of such
goods;


Review conditions for transferring shares/equity in companies, as well as those
governing the liability of administrators, shareholders and third parties in order to
combat the risk of fraud;



Amend the legal framework governing the trading of duty-free goods, including by
imposing a cap on the quantities of certain excisable goods traded in duty-free
regime, increasing surveillance on duty-free shops, introducing the mandatory
stamping of the excisable goods traded in duty free shops, tightening conditions for
licensing the duty free shops and for maintaining the already granted licenses,
reviewing the facts constituting contraventions and of those triggering the revocation
of the license and increasing the operating fee;



Improve legislation on the use of electronic cash registers;



Improve legislation on the organization and undertaking of gambling activities; and,



Strengthen legislative provision for enhanced legal protection of public sector
employees in carrying out their duties in good faith.

15.
Some progress has been made in the monitoring and control of the largest lossmaking public enterprises. However, more comprehensive effort is needed to deal with their
budgetary cost and payments arrears. Therefore, the government will aggressively reactivate
its privatization program, especially in the industry, energy, transport, tourism and
agriculture areas. We will take the following additional actions: (i) wind-up the energy firm
Termoelectrica by splitting out the viable assets and closing the remaining company by endJune 2011; (ii) privatize the cargo rail firm by end-March 2011. The privatization agency
AVAS will complete the sale of 18 small firms under its full ownership during 2010, and will
sell the minority stakes it holds in at least 150 additional firms. The Ministry of Economy
will also initiate the sale of minority stakes in several firms under its control. Finally, in
accordance with EU competition rules, we will phase out subsidies for coal mining by end2010 and we will develop an exit strategy to be achieved within the next 5 years.
16.
The unified wage law has been approved and is in force; it has already resulted in a
noticeable easing of upward pressure on the wage bill by eliminating some bonuses and
placing a ceiling on others. The preparation of the implementation legislation for the unified
wage law to fully implement new, unified wage scales throughout the public sector is on
track. We will agree on the text with the International Financial Institutions before
submission to parliament, with the aim of having it approved by law by end-September 2010
(structural benchmark).
17.
The pension reform now in parliament will generate significant savings in the coming
years, helping to bring the retirement system into a more sustainable financial condition.
However, in recent months there has been a spike in pension costs, due to a sharp increase in

98
individuals taking early retirement and new disability pension claims. Disability pensioners
now constitute nearly 4½ percent of the labor force, and have grown rapidly in recent years.
The increase in new pension claims is expected to increase this year’s pension deficit by over
½ percent of GDP to more than 2¼ percent of GDP. To bring the system’s short-term
finances under better control, we will approve legislation to allow new disability pension
claims only if they have been previously vetted by the Ministry of Labor’s medical
evaluation teams. On an immediate basis, we will also prohibit any new early retirement
claims until after the new pension reform legislation is in effect in 2011.
Health Care System
18.
Reforms in the public healthcare system are essential to improve the efficiency of
service and to better control public spending. To help improve the revenue stream of the
healthcare sector and tackle the stock of arrears, we remain committed to (i) introducing
patient service fees by next year, (ii) sharply narrowing the exemptions for such fees
compared to original plans, (iii) implementing the planned clawback tax on medical
suppliers; and (iv) cutting the number of hospital beds by 9,200. The Ministry of Health and
the National Health House will also take all necessary measures to ensure the functioning of
health care system within the budgetary allocations established in the 2010 budget. We will
also begin deeper structural reforms of the health care sector, in consultation with the World
Bank. The first prong of these reforms involves reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals by
promoting a consumption shift towards generic drugs and recentralizing drug procurement
especially in national programs. The second prong involves improvements in the efficiency
of hospital services and management and includes: (i) decentralizing the management of
most hospitals to local governments; (ii) introducing a new financing mechanism for
hospitals, based on standardized costs by type of hospital, cofinancing by local governments,
and ceilings on wage spending to limit overruns; and (iv) reforming the system of emergency
care to reduce excessive reliance on the system for primary care. These reforms will be
approved by government emergency ordinance by end-July 2010.
Labor Market and Education
19.
To improve the long term competitiveness of the Romanian economy, we are
undertaking reforms in education and the labor market aimed at improving efficiency and
productivity. We will introduce by end-2010 a revised labor code and collective contract
legislation, to increase flexibility of working time, and to reduce hiring and firing costs
through more flexible contracts. We also aim at allowing greater wage flexibility. The
Romanian government will also identify and enforce measures to fight tax evasion on the
labor market in order to improve the collection of social contributions.
20.
The Romanian government aims at improving the quality of education, enhancing the
productivity of the education system, and reducing public expenditures. The introduction
effective January 1, 2010, of the per capita financing provides long term predictability and
sustainability of the wages in the education sector. At the same time, based on the politically
agreed National Education Pact, the Government has submitted to parliament the new

99
Education Law that establishes a sound financial management of resources, both for wages
and for school expenditures. This law will also lead to a further optimization of the school
network.
Financial Sector
21.
The recession is taking a toll on the Romanian banking system but solvency levels
remain high. Banks face pressures on asset quality and rising provisioning costs that are
squeezing profits. Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose to 17.2 percent (representing loans and
interests classified as doubtful and loss) in March 2010 and lending to private sector
continued to contract. However, the rate of deterioration of asset quality is slowing
suggesting impairments may have peaked. The banking system remains well-capitalized after
paid-in committed increases in capital in a number of banks, which brought the average
capital adequacy ratio to 14.7 percent for the system with all banks having a ratio above
10 percent. The largest foreign banks have broadly complied with the terms of the European
Bank Coordination Initiative (EBCI). While individual bank exposures have fluctuated, as a
group by end-March 2010 the nine banks had retained their March 2009 committed exposure
to Romania.
22.
As in other European central banks, we have been preparing for the possibility of
spillovers from market volatility and made contingency plans to address episodes of possible
financial distress. We have enhanced the liquidity monitoring including through the reporting
of assets and liabilities’ maturity breakdown by currency. We have reviewed existing
emergency lending arrangements, and the collateral eligible for all refinancing operations has
been broadened to include euro denominated government securities issued in the domestic
market and will be broadened further to include bonds issued by IFIs listed on the Bucharest
Stock Exchange and Eurobonds issued by the Romanian government as soon as some
remaining technical issues have been clarified. With a view to further strengthening our
already comprehensive stress testing approach, we have asked for technical support from the
Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF on further enhancing our stress test
methodology in different areas.
23.
We remain committed to improving the resolution process of distressed financial
institutions. We have upgraded our domestic legal norms in line with EU requirements to
strengthen the resolution framework for problem banks. We have also strengthened the
existing authority of the special administrator to implement promptly a broad range of
measures, including purchase and assumption, sales of assets, and transfer of deposits. The
March 2010 structural benchmark regarding amendments to the bank insolvency regime was
met.
24.
We continue to be committed to further promote financial stability by increasing
resources for the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF). The target coverage ratio for ex-ante
financing will be increased to 2 percent. To achieve this target, over time the banks’
contribution rates will be set to 0.3 percent beginning in 2011 and the stand-by credit lines
will be eliminated (structural benchmark September 2010). We will also review the

100
governance arrangements of the DGF to ensure that neither members of the board nor
employees of credit institutions participate in the DGF Board (end-September 2010). We
have also provided the same seniority to the DGF’s claims as those of depositors
(March 2010 structural benchmark). We remain committed to support financial stability by
refraining from promoting legislative initiatives (such as the current draft of the personal
insolvency law) that would undermine credit discipline.
25.
The current provisioning framework is sound and the NBR does not consider that any
new prudential regulation in this area is necessary at present. The NBR will continue to
consult with the Fund and EC staff before introducing or amending other aspects of the
regulatory framework. Formally and permanently raising the minimum level of the capital
adequacy ratio from 8 percent to 10 percent remains a medium-term objective. The NBR and
the MoPF remain committed to adopting the necessary legal framework by the end of the
program period for implementing comprehensive International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), with a view toward applying IFRS as of the beginning of 2012.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
26.
Monetary policy will remain focused on keeping inflation within the target band.
Disinflation remains on track, helped by the large negative output gap, restrained wage
developments, and recent food price deflation. Headline inflation fell from 4.7 percent at
end-2009 to 4.4 percent in May 2010, despite a significant adjustment in tobacco excises
early in the year. Together with reduced exchange rate pressures, this has allowed a
measured adjustment of monetary policy, with interest rates reduced from 8 percent in
late 2009 to 6.25 percent recently, for a cumulative reduction of 400 basis points since
February 2009.
27.
Further adjustment in monetary policy in the near future will be conditional upon
subdued inflationary pressures and evolving recovery prospects. Inflation is projected to fall
to around 3¾ percent by end-2010, close to the middle of our target range of 3½ percent
±1 percentage point. The benign inflation outlook is consistent with the downward revision
of our inflation target to 3 percent ±1 percentage point for end-2011. At the same time, a
prudent approach will be maintained in light of risks from further adjustments in regulated
prices, increases in energy prices, and the unsettled financial markets in the region. These
risks also imply that the timing and pace of future reductions in reserve requirements will
have to be carefully calibrated to avoid disturbances in money and exchange rate markets. In
line with our inflation targeting framework, we will maintain the existing managed float
exchange rate regime.

Program Modifications and Monitoring
28.
The program will continue to be monitored through regular reviews, prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. The
quantitative targets for end-September and end-December 2010 as well as the continuous

101
performance criteria are set out in Table 1; and the structural benchmarks are set out in
Table 2. The understandings between the Romanian authorities and IMF staff regarding the
quantitative performance criteria and the structural measures described in this memorandum
are further specified in the TMU attached to this memorandum.

APPENDIX II. ROMANIA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
June 16, 2010
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) updates and replaces the
TMU dated February 5, 2010. It: (i) defines the variables subject to the quantitative targets
specified in the Letter of Intent (LOI); (ii) describes the methods to be used in assessing the
program performance and the information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the
targets (Section I); and (iii) provides clarifications for some of the structural conditionality
under the program (Section II). As is standard under all Fund arrangements, we will consult
with the Fund before modifying measures contained in this letter, or adopting new measures
that would deviate from the goals of the program, and provide the Fund with the necessary
information for program monitoring.
2.
For the purposes of the program, the exchange rates of the Romanian Leu (RON) to
the euro is set at RON 3.9852 = €1, to the U.S. dollar at RON 2.8342 = $1, to the Japanese
yen at RON 3.1419 = ¥100, and to the pound sterling at RON 4.1169 = ₤1, the rates as
shown on the National Bank of Romania’s (NBR’s) website as of December 31, 2008. The
exchange rates to other currencies, where applicable, will also be the ones shown on the
NBR’s website as of December 31, 2008.
3.
For the purposes of the program, the general government includes the entities as
defined in the 2010 budget. These are: the central government (state budget, treasury, selffinanced state entities included in the budget, etc.), local governments, social security funds
(pension, health, and unemployment), road fund company, and administration of the property
fund. This definition of general government also includes any new funds, or other special
budgetary and extra budgetary programs that may be created during the program period to
carry out operations of a fiscal nature as defined in the IMF’s Manual on Government
Finance Statistics 2001. The authorities will inform IMF staff of the creation of any such
new funds or programs immediately.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, INDICATIVE CEILING, AND CONTINUOUS
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Floor on the Net Foreign Assets
4.
For program purposes, Net Foreign Assets (NFA) are defined as the NFA of the
NBR minus Treasury liabilities to the International Monetary Fund.
5.
NFA of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) are defined as the euro value of gross
foreign assets of the NBR (including reserve requirements of the commercial banking system
held at the NBR) minus gross foreign liabilities of the NBR; and will be measured on the
basis of the NBR’s operational rather than accounting definitions. Non-euro denominated
foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into euro at the program exchange rates.

105
6.
Gross foreign assets of the NBR are defined to include the NBR’s holdings of
SDRs, the country's reserve position at the Fund, holdings of cash, securities and deposits
abroad in convertible foreign currencies. Excluded from reserve assets are: (i) gold and other
precious metals; (ii) assets in nonconvertible currencies; (iii) illiquid assets; (iv) any assets
that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered, unless there is also a gross foreign
liability associated with it; (v) claims on residents; and (vi) claims in foreign exchange
arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures,
forwards, swaps, and options).
7.
Gross foreign liabilities of the NBR are defined as all foreign exchange liabilities
to residents and nonresidents, including commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from
derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options), and all credit outstanding from
the Fund, but excluding (i) banks’ foreign currency deposits against reserve requirements;
and (ii) government foreign currency deposits at the NBR. This definition is meant to bring
the concept of foreign liabilities closer to the balance of payment definition, on which the
targets are based.

8.
NFA targets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in
program disbursements relative to the baseline projection. Program disbursements are
defined as external disbursements from official creditors (World Bank and the EC) that are
usable for the financing of the overall central government budget. The NFA targets will also
be adjusted upward by the increase in commercial bank reserve requirements held with the
NBR relative to end-December, 2009 (€7,874 million), measured at program exchange rates.

B. Consultation Mechanism on the 12-month Rate of Inflation
9.
The quarterly consultation bands for the 12-month rate of inflation in consumer
prices (as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) published by the Romanian
Statistical Institute), are specified below. Should the observed year-on-year rate of CPI
inflation fall outside the outer bands specified below, the authorities will complete a
consultation with the Fund on their proposed policy response before requesting further
purchases under the program. In addition, the NBR will conduct discussions with the Fund
staff should the observed year-on-year rate of CPI inflation fall outside the inner bands
specified for the end of each quarter in the table above.

C. Performance Criterion on General Government Balance
10.
The budget deficit will be monitored quarterly through the cash balance of the
general government. The authorities will consult with IMF staff on corrective measures in
the event of shortfalls in government revenue and financing.

11.
The budget deficit will be measured from above the line using the budget execution
data. The Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) will also provide monthly data to measure the
deficit from below the line. The balance of the general government measured from below the
line will include:
+ (i) net external financing, excluding valuation gains and losses;
+ (ii) change in net domestic credit from the financial system, excluding valuation
gains and losses from deposits denominated in foreign currency and including
adjustments for;
+ (a) received EU funds not yet spent (advance payments);
+ (b) claims of the government on EU funds;
+ (c) property fund obligations not yet paid;
+ (iii) change in the stock of issued government securities, net of valuation changes;
+ (iv) net changes in other financing.
12.
If the difference between the general government deficit measured from above the
line and from below the line is larger than lei 200 million each quarter during 2010, the
MoPF will consult with IMF staff.
13.
In the event that non-grant revenues exceed those projected under the program, the
deficit target will be adjusted downward by one half of the surplus to allow for additional
capital spending while reducing the deficit further. The following table shows the
accumulated projected non-grant revenue for 2010, to which the actual non-grant revenue
will be compared.

corresponding amount.

108
D. Performance Criterion Limiting the Issuance of Government Guarantees to the
Non-Financial Private Sector and Public Enterprises
15.
The issuance of general government guarantees to the non-financial private sector
and public enterprises will be limited during the program period. This ceiling may be
adjusted upward by up to RON 4.3 billion relative to the original ceiling of RON 7.7 billion
for guarantees for financing the counterpart payments of investment projects financed by the
EU or for guarantees on projects cofinanced by the EBRD, IFC, or EIB.

E. Performance Criterion on Non-Accumulation of Domestic Arrears
by the General Government
16.
The performance criterion established on the stock in domestic payments arrears of
the general government contemplates no accumulation of new arrears and their elimination
during the program period. In case of need, the government will take corrective measures to
prevent the accumulation of new spending arrears. For the purpose of the program, arrears
mean accounts payable past due date by 90 days (in line with ESA95 definitions for
expenditures).

F. Continuous Performance Criteria on Non-Accumulation of External
Debt Payments Arrears by the General Government
17.
The general government will not accumulate external debt arrears during the
program period. For the purposes of this performance criterion, an external debt payment
arrear will be defined as a payment by the general government, which has not been made
within seven days after falling due. The performance criterion will apply on a continuous
basis.
G. Indicative Target on General Government Current Primary Spending
18.
The indicative target on current primary expenditure of the general government is
defined as spending on personnel, goods and services excluding EU funds (specified under
external grant category), subsidies, transfers to public entities, pensions (social security
budget in social assistance category and one-third of the state budget in the same category),
state aid and other spending in other transfers category, Reserve Fund, and other expenditure
as classified in the monthly reporting tables:

H. Monitoring of Public Enterprises
19.
As of 2009, the Ministry of Public Finance, the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection, and other pertinent institutions have implemented a monitoring system of public
enterprises. During the program period, information will be provided to document that
sanctions—decline in remuneration and dismissal of management according to Ordinances
37/2008 and 79/2008—are imposed if the budgets and company targets for restructuring are
not observed.
20.
The quarterly indicative target for 2010 will be set on the aggregate operating
balance (earnings before interest and tax), net of subsidies, of the following public
enterprises: (1) C.N. Cai Ferate CFR; (2) S.N. Transport CFR Calatori; (3) CN a Huilei; (4)
SC Termoelectrica; (5) C.N. de Autostrazi si Drumuri Nationale; (6) S.C. Metrorex; (7) S.N.

Comerciala Electrificare CFR S.A.; and (10) S.C. Administratia Nationala a Imbunatatirilor
Funciare. The data shall be reported with operating results by firm. The targets for
June 2010, September 2010 and December 2010 will be -2000, -3000 and -4000,
respectively.
I. Reporting Requirements
21.
Performance under the program will be monitored from data supplied to the IMF by
the NBR and the MoPF as outlined in Table 1. The authorities will transmit promptly to the
IMF staff any data revisions as well as other information necessary to monitor the
arrangement with the IMF.

II. STRUCTURAL CONDITIONALITY: SPECIFICATIONS
A.

Public Wage Legislation

22.
Following the unified public wage law approved in October 2009, an implementing
legislation will be approved before end September 2010 that will abide by the following
principles:
a.

It will ensure the respect of the quantitative targets for the public wage bill
included in the unified public wage law and the proposed changes will be fully
costed.

b.

It will ensure that new salary grading structure is simplified and that pay will
be linked based on job responsibility and qualification. The established new pay
system will be benchmarked on private sector wages (through a salary survey) to
ensure that public pay is broadly aligned with actual labor market conditions,
within affordability constraints.

112
c.

The regulation would phase in a limit of 30% on non-wage personnel
expenditures and caps on individual bonuses for non-military personnel. For the
purpose of this law, “stimulus” payments will be treated as bonuses.
B. Broadening of the Tax Base

23.
The personal income tax base will be broadened to incorporate, at the least, meal
vouchers, interest income, capital gains, and severance payments. Social security
contribution exemptions will be eliminated for most “intellectual property” claimants.

Technical Assistance

The transition in Romania has been supported by substantial technical assistance from
multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. The Fund has provided support in a number of
areas with more than 40 technical assistance missions since 1990, although the authorities
have had a mixed record with regard to implementation. Expert Fund assistance has focused
on a number of key areas, including: fiscal reforms; modernization of the central bank and
the banking system; creating a market-oriented legal structure; training; improving the
collection and reporting of statistics, and AML/CFT. The implementation of a
comprehensive tax administration reform designed in line with the recommendations of
several technical assistance missions of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department started in
January 2003. A report on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC) on fiscal
transparency was completed on November 6, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/254). A
public debt management technical assistance (TA) was fielded in April 2006. In July 2009,
there were two FAD TA missions. The first assisted the authorities with the preparation of a
fiscal responsibility law (FRL). The other provided advice on revenue administration issues,
focusing on recommendations to improve service and compliance and strengthen the tax
administration’s organizational structure. There were follow-up missions in April 2010 on
the implementation of the FRL and the budget execution on central and local levels, and on
setting up a high net worth individuals unit in the tax administration.
In 2003 an FSAP was completed, and an FSAP Update was completed in May 2009.
Furthermore, technical assistance by the Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department
on stress testing is scheduled to take place in September 2010.
X.
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
Framework
The legislative framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) has been recently updated to bring Romania in line with international
standards and to fulfill the requirements set forth by the third EU directive on AML/CFT.
Obligations have been introduced for reporting entities to ascertain beneficial ownership of
client accounts and to carry out enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, such as in
the case of politically exposed persons. The supervisory framework has been extended to

4
cover certain non-financial businesses and professions. The level of AML supervision of the
banking sector has improved, and the NBR appears to be taking this issue seriously. The
authorities have also started to undertake more inspections of the financial sector at large and
on the non financial sector (including casinos, a sector that had been pointed out in the past
as particularly vulnerable to money laundering risks). Romania recently underwent an
AML/CFT mutual evaluation conducted by MONEYVAL, and the report was approved at
the MONEYVAL Plenary (July 2008). The authorities should ensure the effective
implementation of the new AML/CFT provisions and continue to focus on supervision of the
financial sector at large as well as of casinos and bureaus de change.
XI.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) was
subject to full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on
May 4, 2009. The assessment was completed on May 29, 2009 and concuded that the NBR
continues to have a relatively strong safeguards framework in place.
XII.

Resident Representative

The Fund has had a resident representative in Bucharest since 1991. Mr. Tonny Lybek
assumed the post of regional resident representative in March 2009.

ANNEX II. ROMANIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Romania’s Development Strategy
Romania’s objectives ahead remain two-fold: to deal with the crisis and mitigate its
adverse impact, while anchoring these measures in a medium-term structural reform
agenda that would support economic growth and resume progress towards convergence
with EU living standards, social cohesion and eventual entry into the Euro-zone. EU
assistance to Romania remains core for supporting the economic recovery in 2010-11, and
the relations with the EU will retain their priority.
The Bank’s Development Policy Loan (DPL) series, part of the Euro 19.9 billion
international support package to Romania involving the IMF, the European
Commission and the World Bank, supports the structural reforms needed to improve
fiscal sustainability, enhance the social protection systems and strengthen the
functioning of the financial sector. The World Bank also has several sector investment
operations, economic and sector work, and commitments through the International Finance
Company.
The Bank’s analysis is shared with the IMF and is used as an input to the fiscal
framework, including structural reform measures that have important fiscal
implications, such as pension reform and enhancing the fiscal efficiency of social
assistance programs.
Overall, the IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government’s reform program and are coordinating their policy advice
to the Romanian authorities.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Public sector reform. The Bank and the Fund are supporting measures to address the
weaknesses in public expenditure management that have been at the core of fiscal deficits.
The Bank’s DPL program supports the strengthening of the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework to improve the financial management and predictability of public spending as
well as the quality of public services. The DPL also supports public sector pay reform. The
public sector pay system is at variance with the rest of Europe: (i) non-wage compensation is
disproportionately large; (ii) there are wide disparities in pay between positions with similar
skills and responsibility; (iii) seniority is more important than performance; (iv) pay
decisions are not based on reliable information on private sector comparators; and (v)
political interference undermines competitive recruitment and pay. The government intends
to use analytical work provided by the Bank as a basis for reforming the pay system.

6
Financial sector reform. Following a jointly conducted FSAP in June 2003, the Bank and
the IMF completed an FSAP update for Romania in 2009. The FSAP and FSAP update have
provided a shared perspective on the potential risks in the financial sector, the development
agenda and the prioritization of reforms in that sector. Under the DPL series, the Bank is
supporting measures to strengthen the functioning and resilience of the financial sector. TA
was also provided to the Financial Sector authorities, and the Ministry of Justice of Romania,
in relation with the DPL series. The TA focused in particular on: a) assistance to the Ministry
of Justice in the preparation of Guidelines for Corporate Debt Restructuring and in amending
the Insolvency Law so as to remove obstacles to out-of-court corporate debt restructuring; b)
assistance to the National Bank of Romania (NBR) on the preparation of Guidelines for
Mortgage Debt Restructuring.
C. Areas Where the World Bank Leads and Its Analyses Serve as Inputs Into the
IMF Policy Formulation and Advice
Social Protection. Under the IMF-Bank partnership, the IMF has paid close attention to the
social dimension of the programs. For example, the fiscal deficit target allows for protecting
the poor and low-income earners from the impact of the global crisis, through higher social
spending and measures to increase the coverage of the best targeted program (Guaranteed
Minimum Income) and other Social Assistance programs targeting the elderly poor.
Pensions. The Bank supports the measures intended to secure the pension system
sustainability, including but not limited to the gradual linkage of benefit adjustments to
inflation and an increase in retirement ages for women to equalize women’s retirement ages
with that of men at 65. Pension reform is also a structural benchmark for the Fund’s SBA.
Education. The Bank has supported measures to increase the fiscal savings and improve the
quality and access to education services, namely the capita financing starting with school
year 2010/2011 (the measure is piloted in eight counties, accounting for 20 percent of total
student enrollment). In addition the Bank has supported the government program in
education through an investment operation targeting the rehabilitation of schools in rural
areas.
Health. The Bank supports the Government program in health through an investment
operation and the DPL program. The DPL focuses on strengthening the financial
sustainability of the national health insurance system through the introduction of copayments (referred to as "health moderating tickets"), complemented by an exemption
mechanisms for the poor. This measure will be complemented by a hospitalization strategy as
well as a technical position paper and roadmap for evidence-based transparent mechanisms
for inclusion of new technology and drugs in the benefit package.

7
D. IFC Program
IFC’s current committed portfolio is $607 million, the second highest in the Southern
Europe and Central Asia region after Turkey. IFC has played an active crisis response
role in Romania, investing over $260 million of its own funds and mobilizing an additional
$150 million in eight projects in various sectors of the economy. In addition, Romania will
also benefit from two recently committed crisis responses regional funds, which aim to raise
a total of €500 million to address bad debts and to assist local companies facing financing
difficulties.
Notwithstanding the crisis, IFC is investing in Romania on selective basis. IFC has
withdrawn from sectors and lines of business where the private sector is ready to take over.
IFC envisages a phased reduction of involvement over a period of three to five years –
depending on the market conditions and crisis impact. In the banking sector, as it is largely
dominated by foreign banks (approx 90% of banking assets), the strategy of IFC in financial
markets is to work with local banks and strengthen their capacity to provide loans to
underserved sectors and products such micro, small and medium enterprises, local currency,
housing finance, agribusiness, and energy efficiency. In the real sector, IFC will assist local
companies to become more competitive in domestic market and to expand in other countries
in the region, as well as promote South-South investments to/from Romania. IFC will also
continue to support high development impact projects such as in infrastructure, in frontier
regions and in climate change related projects.
E. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
The current IBRD and IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania, covering
the period 2009-2013, was presented to the Board on July 16 2009. anchors the World
Bank Group’s program around two pillars: i) helping the Government to implement structural
reforms to help mitigate the crisis by reducing social and economic vulnerabilities; and ii)
putting in place the basis for sustainable economic growth in the medium term. The DPL
series will constitute the bulk of new lending in the early years of the CPS. Given the severity
of the crisis and the exceptional need for large-scale budget support, almost all new lending
in the first year or two of the CPS will be concentrated on this DPL series. A large existing
portfolio of investment loans is being restructured to provide a better fit with the
Government’s priorities and absorption capacity. Selective, new investment lending could be
considered in the outer years. The CPS outlines a substantial Analytical and Advisory
Services program that supports the design of the DPL program.
The DPL has been the primary vehicle for discussions around mitigation of the crisis.
The FSAP was also critical in providing background analysis, while a program of Analytical
and Advisory work – including Technical Assistance on Health and Pensions– has
complemented this effort. In relation to laying the foundations for sustainable economic
growth, the Bank has a wide program of work in the structural reform area, including: in the

8
social sectors, agriculture, energy, and public administration reform (see Table 1 below). In
the area of public administration, the Bank is undertaking a functional review of several key
Ministries and agencies with the aim of helping them identify efficiencies and opportunities
for reform.

ANNEX III. ROMANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Romania—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of May 19, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The quality of the national accounts,
price, fiscal, and balance of payments data is adequate. The authorities have improved
economic and financial statistics with technical assistance, including from the Fund, over the
past several years. Romania began participating in the GDDS in February 2001 and
graduated to subscription to the SDDS in May 2005.
National accounts: Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the
National Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95).
Estimates are methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Provisional and semi-final
versions are disseminated in the Statistical Yearbook and other publications, as well as on the
web (www.insse.ro).
Inflation: The Consumer Price Index is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and is
considered reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the Producer Price
Index to include the domestic and export sectors.
Labor market: Labor market statistics are broadly adequate. The definition used for
employment is consistent with ESA 95.
Public finances: Annual GFS data are reported on an accrual basis derived from cash data
using various adjustment methods. Tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash
method; expense data are adjusted using due-for-payments data; and, interest payments are
calculated on an accrual basis. Beginning in 2002, the Special Fund for Development of the
Energy System, the Special Fund for Public Roads, the Special Fund “Romanian Agriculture
Development,” and the Special Fund “Romania” were included in the state budget, while the
Special Fund for Insured Protection was eliminated from general government accounts. The
reported data excluded data on the Agency for Recovery Bank Assets. 2 EUR receives
monthly cash budget execution data. Accrual data are available on a quarterly basis and with
a 55 day lag after the end of each quarter.
Consolidated data on central government operations are reported for inclusion in the GFS
2

Formerly, the Agency for Bank Asset Recovery and the Authority for Privatization and Management of State
Ownership.

10
Yearbook. Consolidated general government data were reported for the first time for
inclusion in the 2005 GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial data: The National Bank of Romania (NBR) reports monetary and
financial statistics on a regular and timely basis for publication in the IFS. Since
December 2004, the NBR reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). The data are being published in the IFS Supplement, beginning
September 2006. Romania’s data and metadata for financial soundness indicators are posted
on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/eng/cce/index.htm).
Balance of payments: The NBR routinely reports balance of payments statistics to the Fund
in a timely fashion. A 2003 STA mission undertook a detailed review of the NBR’s
compilation methodology for balance of payments and international investment position
statistics, developed in consultation with Eurostat, and concluded that the proposed system is
broadly appropriate. The STA mission supported implementation of this compilation system
in 2004, along with a new FDI survey.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Romania is subscriber to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
May 4, 2005.

IMF Reports on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) have been published as
Country Report No. 01/206, 02/254 and
03/389.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ROMANIA
Romania—Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation, Fourth Review Under the
Stand-By Arrangement, and Requests for Modification and Waivers of Nonobservance
of Performance Criteria – Supplementary Information, and Supplementary Letter of
Intent
Prepared by the Staff Representative for Romania
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and David Marston
June 29, 2010
1.
This statement provides an update on policy developments and implications for the
program since the issuance of the staff report. The additional information changes the staff
appraisal.
Fiscal developments
2.
On June 25, the Constitutional Court ruled on the package of expenditure cuts
agreed with staff and approved by the parliament. The Court accepted the legality of the
25 percent cut in public sector wages and the cuts of 15 percent in most social transfers, but
rejected the constitutionality of the 15 percent reduction in pensions. This decision created a
gap of 0.7 percent of GDP to achieve the agreed 6.8 percent of GDP deficit target. The
authorities responded quickly to implement compensatory measures. On June 26, the Cabinet
approved an emergency decree to increase in the standard VAT rate from 19 percent to
24 percent, effective immediately (revised prior action), and on June 29 parliament reapproved legislation to implement the wage cuts accepted by the Court.1 The VAT increase
is expected to yield RON 3.6 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) for the remainder of 2010 at
current revenue yields, effectively closing the gap created by the rejection of the pension cuts
(text table and revised Table 6).
3.
The government has taken other actions to fully implement the agreed fiscal
consolidation. The cabinet approved the revenue measures that formed part of the agreed
1

Under Romanian law, when the Constitutional Court rules part of a law unconstitutional, it returns the whole
law to parliament for action. Thus, the wage cuts (which were accepted) do not go into effect automatically.
For this reason, the parliament had to re-approve them as new legislation. Staff reached an understanding with
the authorities to require parliamentary approval of the wage cuts and of the decree increasing the VAT as an
end-September 2010 structural benchmark. Parliamentary approval of the wage cuts on June 29 partially met
the benchmark.

2
adjustment package (0.3 percent of GDP), although these were not part of the prior action.
These measures included broadening the tax base for the income tax and social security
contributions, and introducing a tax surcharge on owners of multiple properties. Separately, a
Ministerial order has been issued to implement the agreed cuts in transfer payments to local
governments. This action will be followed up next month by a budget revision law to make
the cuts permanent.

Macroeconomic developments
4.
Economic indicators available since the issuance of the staff report suggest a
weak economic recovery, but downside risks have risen. Industrial production and export
growth have remained positive, but demand-related indicators are weak and confidence and
economic sentiment indicators are sharply negative. Credit indicators also remain weak, with
interest rates affected by increased risk perception for Romania in international markets and
credit growth still negative.
5.
The VAT increase will have a significant one-off effect on inflation. While passthrough may initially be more subdued due to weak domestic demand, preliminary staff
estimates suggest the consumer prices will rise by 3½-4½ percentage points above staff’s
previous estimate of 3.7 percent at year-end (revised Table 3). Thus, the NBR will likely
miss its 2010 inflation target by a significant margin, but inflation should return to its
downward path in 2011.
Pension reform
6.
The lengthy debate in parliament on the confidence motion to approve the fiscal
package has contributed to a delay in approval of pension reform legislation. While
parliamentary committees have approved the draft law, last week the parliament postponed
the discussion of the bill to September, which will not allow the structural benchmark to be
met by end-June, as agreed (revised Table 2). Staff expects that the legislation will be
approved by Parliament by end-September 2010 (reset structural benchmark) and
implemented in 2011, as agreed. Therefore, the delay will not have a tangible impact on the
program. Moreover, many of the provisions of the legislation that have a short-term impact –

3
such as the elimination of the special noncontributory pensions and tightening disability
pension procedures – have been included in recently approved fiscal package, and will
actually be in force earlier than anticipated.
Revised proposed decision
7.
Staff supports the approval of the requested waivers of applicability of all endJune 2010 performance criteria (other than on the NFA target), as well as of the condition to
consult with the Fund based on inflation at end-June. These waivers are needed as data on the
end-June 2010 performance criteria and on inflation as of end-June 2010 are not available.
8.
A revised proposed decision, granting the requested waivers of applicability, is
attached. The net foreign asset targets adjustor for end-June 2010 is no longer proposed to
be modified, as data on this target has become available and the target has been met.
Modifications to the staff appraisal
9.
Staff continues to support Board approval of the review. The mix between
expenditure cuts and revenue measures is now more balanced than in the package originally
proposed by the government, and the protection of pensioners will further mitigate negative
social effects. Indeed, the proposal is closer to the measures that had been advocated by staff,
as discussed in paragraphs 20 and 49, of Country Report No.???. While implementation risks
remain notable (including the possibility that the VAT increases will not be ratified by the
parliament), the government’s legal authority to raise taxes makes such risks lower than
under the original package. Furthermore, the government’s willingness to implement
compensatory measures within hours of the adverse court decision demonstrates considerable
political resolve to achieve the objectives of the Fund supported program. Staff and the
authorities agreed that parliamentary ratification of the VAT decree will be an endSeptember 2010 structural benchmark.2
10.
Monetary policy will face additional challenges in bringing inflation under
control. The sharp short-term inflationary effect of the VAT increase will temporarily push
prices outside of the NBR’s desired disinflation path. In staff’s view, there is no immediate
need for a change in the monetary policy stance as a result of the direct effects of higher
taxation on prices. However, the authorities will have to be vigilant in not accommodating
possible second-round inflationary effects. The key will be to gear policy decisions to the
projected inflationary path 12–18 months ahead, once the immediate impact of the tax hikes
has dissipated.

2

In the unlikely event that the parliament rejected the measure, staff would negotiate a new mix of expenditure
and revenue measures to achieve the targeted adjustment.

1/ Coverage: general government. Gross public debt excluding guarantees is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX I
ROMANIA: SUPPLEMENTARY LETTER OF INTENT

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC, 20431
U.S.A.

Bucharest, June 29, 2010

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
This letter updates our Letter of Intent (LOI) of June 16, 2010. On June 25, the
Constitutional Court invalidated the 15 percent cut in pensions approved by parliament,
which formed part of the prior action (the cuts in wage and social transfers were not
affected). To close the financing gap opened by the Constitutional Court decision, we have
approved by emergency ordinance an increase in the VAT rate from 19 to 24 percent,
effective immediately. The publication of this ordinance in the official gazette, which enacts
the VAT increase, is a prior action for Board consideration of the fourth review. Moreover,
parliamentary ratification of the VAT increase and of the expenditure measures that had been
found constitutional will be a structural benchmark for end-September for 2010 (Table 2).
2.
The change in the composition of this year’s fiscal adjustment affects several targets
under the program. In particular: (i) the increase in the VAT will have a temporary but
significant impact on inflation, which we estimate at 3½-4½ percent and which will push
inflation outside of the NBR’s targeted path; (ii) the indicative target on general government
current primary spending will be affected by the invalidation of the pension cuts; and (iii) the
projected revenues used for the deficit target adjustor will be affected by the VAT increase.
We therefore propose that these targets and projections be modified as indicated in the
attached Table 1.
3.
The lengthy parliamentary debate on the fiscal adjustment package has contributed to
some delays in the approval of the pension reform legislation. The discussion of the bill was
postponed to September, which has not allowed the structural benchmark to be met by endJune. We expect the legislation to be approved by parliament by end-September 2010 (reset
of structural benchmark, see Table 2), with the reform implemented from 2011, as agreed
under the program. Moreover, some provisions of the legislation that have a short-term
impact, such as the elimination of the special noncontributory pensions and tightening of the
disability pension procedures, have been included in the fiscal package legislation and will be
in force earlier than anticipated.

4.
We request that a waiver of applicability be approved for all end-June 2010
performance criteria other than for the net foreign assets target, as information on these
criteria is not available. The net foreign assets target for end-June 2010, which has been
observed, remains as established at the completion of the second and third reviews. We also
request a waiver with respect to the inflation consultation band for end-June 2010 since
information on inflation as of end-June is also not yet available. Finally, we note that our LOI
of June 16, 2010 referred to a fiscal target of 6.8 percent for 2009 (paragraph 7) and we
wanted to clarify that this target is for 2010.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation and Fourth
Review of the Stand-By Agreement with Romania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Romania’s economic performance under 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
approved on May 4, 2009 and concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation with Romania.1 The
completion of this program review enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 768 million,
bringing total disbursements under the program to SDR 9.031 billion (about €9.32 billion or
about US$12.60 billion.
Background
Before the current crisis, the Romanian economy was characterized by high growth rates,
associated with the build-up of external and internal imbalances. Large capital inflows
stimulated domestic demand, while labor constraints and rising public sector wages generated
wage inflation. Fiscal policy was pro-cyclical, exacerbating the overheating of the economy
despite tight monetary policy to counteract price pressures. The rapid development of the
banking system came with vulnerabilities to outside liquidity shocks and foreign exchange
risks. The global economic and financial crisis hit Romania hard in late 2008 and 2009. Capital
inflows dried up, exports plunged, and country risk indicators skyrocketed. As a result of the
sharp contraction in domestic demand, GDP plummeted and the current account deficit fell
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

markedly. Although banks generally entered the crisis well capitalized, they faced rising NPLs,
a dried up interbank market and limited access to external sources of funds. The country’s
large fiscal deficit constrained the fiscal policy response to the crisis.
In early 2009 authorities put together a policy package supported by financing from the Fund,
the EU, and the World Bank. The program included (i) fiscal consolidation accompanied by
structural reforms to restore fiscal sustainability and boost market confidence, (ii) steps to
further strengthen the resilience of the financial sector and to obtain commitments from foreign
parent banks to maintain their Romanian subsidiaries capitalized and liquid, and (iii) prudent
monetary policy management to reduce inflation. The program has contributed to stabilizing
the economy and alleviating financing pressures. Economic activity remained weak throughout
2009 (declining by 7.1 percent), but exchange rate pressure eased, the country risk premium
narrowed significantly, and financial sector stress eased. While for 2010 as a whole growth is
forecast to be slightly negative, a gradually recovery is expected in the second half of the year.
Domestic demand will remain subdued, as unemployment continues to rise and real wages
adjust to the recession with a lag, while investment will pick up slowly. The contribution of net
exports is forecast to remain positive but limited in 2010. Beyond 2010, GDP should recover,
with growth forecast to rise to around 3½ percent in 2011 and to the range of 4-4½ percent per
year in the medium-term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that despite one of
the largest economic downturns in Europe, the Romanian authorities have made significant
strides toward restoring macroeconomic stability and achieving an orderly adjustment of precrisis imbalances. They noted, however, that important challenges remain in ensuring that the
economic and policy adjustments are sustainable. They encouraged the authorities to carry
through with planned structural reforms to secure a sustainable fiscal position, boost potential
growth, and reinforce the economy’s resilience to shocks.
Directors commended the authorities’ strong adjustment effort this year as an appropriate
response to the near-term challenges posed by the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position.
They agreed with the authorities’ approach of balancing the adjustment between expenditure
cuts and tax increases, by way of cushioning the social impact of the adjustment while
decisively tackling the large public wage bill. . Directors also supported the proposed relaxation
of the 2010 deficit target to accommodate the cyclical deterioration in the fiscal position since
the last review.
Directors stressed that the sustainability of the targeted fiscal adjustment can only be secured
if supported by structural reforms. They welcomed the recent approval of the fiscal
responsibility legislation, and encouraged the authorities to complete the reforms of the
pension and the public compensation systems. Other important reforms are the planned
reductions in public employment, reforms of the healthcare system and of the local
government finances, and efforts to boost tax collections. These reforms would ensure that the
deficit remains on a downward path in the medium term.

3

Directors also emphasized that structural reforms in other areas, such as labor and product
markets, are also crucial in building the economy’s competitiveness and resilience. They would
also help prepare Romania for an eventual euro adoption by ensuring that the economy can
handle shocks without the support of monetary and exchange rate policies.
Directors commended the authorities for vigilant monetary and financial sector policies. They
viewed the moderate pace of monetary easing as appropriate in striking a balance between
the need to support the economy and to contain exchange rate pressures. They agreed that,
while there may be room for further easing in the near future, a cautious approach remains
warranted given inflation risks and regional uncertainties. Directors welcomed the authorities’
proactive approach towards banking supervision and regulation, and called for continued
vigilance in view of the unsettled regional situation and the deteriorating quality of the loan
portfolio.

IMF Completes Fourth Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with
Romania and Approves US$1.146 Billion Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
fourth review of Romania’s economic performance under a program supported by a 24month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the review enables the
immediate disbursement of SDR 768 million (about €913.2 million or about US$1.1146
billion), bringing total disbursements under the program to SDR 9.031 billion (about
€10,738.8 million or about US$13.475 billion). In completing the review the Executive
Board also approved Romania’s request for a waiver of applicability of end-June 2010
performance criteria.
The SBA was approved on May 4, 2009 (Press Release No 09/148) in the amount of
SDR 11.443 billion (about €13.607 billion or about US$17.074 billion). The arrangement
entails exceptional access to IMF resources, amounting to 1,111 percent of Romania’s
quota.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Romania, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Against the background of the large downturn, the Romanian authorities have made
significant strides toward restoring macroeconomic stability and achieving an orderly
adjustment of pre-crisis imbalances. They are taking ambitious adjustment measures to
contain the weakening of the fiscal position and set the stage for a sustained
improvement in public finances. Balancing the fiscal adjustment between expenditure
cuts and tax increases will help cushion its social impact, while at the same time
reversing excessive past increases in public wages.
“The authorities are committed to the sustainability of this adjustment over the medium
term by buttressing it with comprehensive structural fiscal reforms. They plan to
complement the recent approval of the fiscal responsibility legislation with reforms of
the pension and public wage systems, reductions in public sector employment, reforms
of the healthcare system and local government finances, and efforts to boost tax
collection.

2

“The authorities’ monetary and financial sector policies are appropriately prudent and
proactive, helping preserve financial stability in the face of the global financial crisis.
While there is some room for further monetary easing going forward, the authorities are
exercising caution, which is warranted by the uncertainties related to the inflationary
impact of the VAT increase and regional developments. They will continue their
proactive approach toward banking supervision and regulation, and will remain vigilant
in view of the unsettled regional situation and the accompanied uncertainties regarding
the quality of the loan portfolio. ”

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Romania
and Mihai Nicolae Tanasescu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 2, 2010

My Romanian authorities would like to thank staff for the useful discussions held in
Bucharest last month. The amount of work done is reflected in the staff report for both the
2010 Article IV Consultation and the Fourth Review under the Stand- By Arrangement,
which provides a well-balanced assessment of the Romanian economy.
Like many countries in the region, Romania faces challenging times in the aftermath of the
crisis, and my authorities value the continued close cooperation with the Fund in order to
address these challenges.
The impact of the crisis
The global crisis has hit the Romanian economy through trade and financial channels, but
also through a decline in confidence that led to a sharp contraction in domestic demand. Real
GDP declined by 7.1 percent in 2009 and by a further 0.3 percent (qoq) in the first quarter of
2010. The sharp decline in domestic demand, together with the 15 percent depreciation of
the leu against the Euro from late 2008 to early 2009, helped adjust the current account
deficit from 13.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2009.
Weaker than expected economic performance has depressed revenue collections and boosted
spending on unemployment benefits. The fiscal deficit widened and, without further
adjustment, would climb to 9 percent of GDP in 2010. Monetary policy successfully focused
on keeping inflation within the target band and core inflation fell from 8.1 percent in mid2008 to 2.1 percent in May 2010 due to weak demand and receding exchange rate pressures.
The banking system remains well capitalized, but non-performing loans continue to increase.
Banks face pressures on asset quality and rising provisioning costs that are reducing profits.
To safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability, the authorities promptly put together a
comprehensive policy package supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement along with
funding from the EU and other multilateral institutions. The program greatly contributed to
stabilizing the economy and alleviating financing pressures.
The program implementation
Since May 2009, when the current SBA was approved, the Romanian authorities made
progress in implementing structural reforms to restore fiscal sustainability and have taken
important steps to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. However, weak revenues
and a build-up of spending pressures caused the government to miss the end-March fiscal
deficit target by a small margin, and to miss the target on domestic payments arrears. All
other quantitative performance criteria, and all structural benchmarks were met, and the

2
program remained on track. The government is committed to accelerating fiscal
consolidation. Even in the face of weaker GDP growth, they will continue to take additional
measures to reach end-year targets, and to reach a 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit by 2012.
Fiscal consolidation through strengthening structural reforms
Public finance has deteriorated over the last years, as all governments in place from 2005 to
2008 pursued pro-cyclical fiscal policies, approving large increases in public expenditures,
especially in pensions and wages. Fiscal policy remained strongly expansionary even in 2008
when the crisis already distressed international markets. As a result, the share of total public
expenditures increased from 33.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 40 percent of GDP in 2009,
while public revenues remained unchanged at around 32 percent of GDP.
In 2009 public revenues fell sharply, forcing the new government which came into power in
December 2008 to deal with an increased expenditure level resulting from previous
expansionary decisions. Under the SBA program strong fiscal adjustment measures were
implemented, including a freeze of wages and pensions and an increase of taxation. The
fiscal deficit reached 7.3 percent of GDP at end-2009. The continued deterioration in
economic conditions in early 2010 made it necessary to adopt new additional measures in
order to continue the fiscal consolidation process. It had become clear that without radical
measures on the expenditure or revenue side, the fiscal deficit would not be reduced much
further.
Staff has advocated a combination of lower public expenditures and increased taxation to
close the gap, but the authorities considered this to be suboptimal as tax increases at a time
of recession are not desirable. Moreover, increasing control over public spending and
reducing its share of GDP will correct the excesses that occurred during the boom years
rather than entrench them with higher taxes. It will also increase the likelihood that the fiscal
adjustment will be durable. The authorities decided to implement radical measures consisting
of expenditure cuts of roughly 2 percent of GDP, including a 25 percent cut in public sector
wages and a 15 percent reduction in pensions and transfer payments. The latter implies that
wages fall back to 2007/08 levels and pensions to the 2008 level. However, on June 25, 2010
the Constitutional Court accepted the legality of the 25 percent cut in public wages and the
cuts of 15 percent in most social transfers, but rejected the constitutionality of the 15 percent
reduction in pensions. The authorities responded quickly to implement compensatory
measures and approve an emergency decree to increase the VAT rate from 19 percent to 24
percent. The VAT increase will close the fiscal gap of 0.7 percent of GDP, created by the
rejection of the pension cuts. Further revenue-boosting measures of 0.3 percent of GDP
include widening of the tax base, improving tax enforcement and the introduction of a
turnover tax on medical suppliers. The measures add up to 2.3 percent of GDP and will lower
the budget deficit to a sustainable level of 6.8 percent of GDP in 2010. This decisive action
on the fiscal front is expected to raise the country’s credibility on external markets, which
can result in higher GDP growth rates in the long term.

3

The government considers the proposed cuts as only a first step, and they are determined to
accelerate public administration reform by reducing the number of public institutions and
increasing efficiency and accountability. In this context, they have already restructured 100
state agencies, and a functional review of major ministries is under way. They will
implement further public compensation reform by adopting new legislation by endSeptember. This reform will be supported by a further reduction in personnel of another
70,000 by January 2011 on top of a reduction of roughly 30,000 since late 2009.
The government is strongly committed to fiscal consolidation in the long run. Crucial for its
fiscal strategy is accelerating structural reforms to reduce unemployment, to restructure the
wage system and to increase efficiency in the finances of local governments and state-owned
enterprises. A major reform in the budget process was the approval of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The law will strengthen fiscal discipline by improving medium-term
fiscal planning, increasing transparency and accountability of the budget process.
To contain fiscal pressures over the medium term, the authorities will introduce several
institutional reforms to increase the efficiency of local governments. Standard costing norms
will be introduced and local governments seeking extra resources will need to sign
adjustment programs with the central government, stipulating measures to tackle overruns.
Another important step will be the approval of the new pension law by end-June. The new
bill envisages a gradual move to inflation indexation, and to an increase and unification of
the retirement age. At the same time contribution rates will be set annually in the budget
legislation. Finally, the authorities will further improve tax administration; reforms focus on
improved methodologies to identify and audit unreported income, especially of high
individual taxpayers, and on combating other forms of tax evasion.
Monetary policy and financial sector challenges
Over the past years Romania has taken important measures to bring down inflation to levels
similar to other emerging markets in the EU. End 2009 inflation stood at 4.7 percent, slightly
above the target band, due mainly to significant hikes in tobacco excises (which contributed
about 2 percentage points). For 2010 the inflation rate is projected to fall close to the central
bank’s target of 3.5 percent (with a tolerance band of plus/minus 1 percentage points). EndApril inflation reached 4.3 percent. Nevertheless, upward inflationary risks remain (energy
prices, regulated prices) and the central bank will remain prudent. Future reductions in
interest rates and reserve requirements will have to be carefully calibrated to avoid
disturbances in money and exchange rate markets.
Conservative prudential and regulatory policies, together with the maintenance of a stable
exchange rate, have proved to be of great value in safeguarding financial stability during the
crisis. The banking sector remains resilient, despite the fact that nonperforming loans are on
the rise. Profitability is declining, but is still above 6 percent, and the system is still

experiencing a rapid deterioration of loan portfolio quality in small and medium enterprise
sectors as bankruptcies are rising. Nevertheless, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio
increased further to 14.03 percent at end-2009 against 13.77 percent at end of 2008, well
above the required minimum level of 10 percent.
An important role has been played by the nine largest banks as a result of their full
commitment to maintain overall exposure to the country during the program period, which
has improved financial sector stability. However, the possibility of spillovers from market
volatility, especially from Greece, led the authorities to ask banks to have contingency plans
in place.
Romania has made further progress towards strengthening the financial sector through the
Deposit Guarantee Fund. The central bank will amend the legal framework to improve the
funding regime. This will enhance confidence in the system by increasing both the actual and
targeted coverage ratio and by eliminating contingent credit lines by banks.
The central bank continued to improve banking supervision by strengthening liquidity
requirements and governance rules applicable to banks. Banks are now required to report
asset and liability maturity breakdown by currency. The stress test methodology in different
risk areas was improved.
In conclusion, my authorities acknowledge that there are potential risks to program
implementation. At the same time, they consider that the strength present policy response
under the Stand-By Arrangement, even in the face of deterioration in economic activity,
underlines their continued commitment. They are confident that further acceleration of
structural reforms, including public administration reform, will address the current fiscal
imbalances and will put Romania on a path to sustained economic growth.
