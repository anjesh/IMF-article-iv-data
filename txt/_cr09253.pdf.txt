Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Malaysia
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Ranil Salgado
July 1, 2009

 Discussions: During May 21-June 2, 2009 with the Minister of Finance II Mr. Hanadzlah,
the Secretary General of the Treasury Mr. Wan Aziz, Governor Zeti and Deputy Governor
Ooi Sang Kuang of Bank Negara Malaysia, other senior officials, and private sector

 Team: Messrs. Zanello, Guimarães-Filho, Rozhkov, and Zebregs (all APD).
 Context of past surveillance: There has been broad agreement between the authorities and
the Fund on the policy desiderata—a prudent fiscal stance, reforms of government-linked
companies, efforts to improve the investment climate, flexibility in exchange rate
management and monetary conduct, and steps to further strengthen the stability and
efficiency of Malaysia’s financial system. Views have differed, however, on the pace of
reform. The authorities have favored a more gradual approach, perhaps better attuned to
political realities and implementation constraints.
 Exchange arrangement: Malaysia has accepted obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. Its exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions. The exchange rate arrangement is a floating regime
and remains appropriate.
 Data: Broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts to improve statistics for
the consolidated public sector are necessary.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook. Malaysia has been hit hard by the global downturn. The economy
is set to contract for the first time in ten years. However, Malaysia is coping with the crisis
from a position of strength. It has ample foreign exchange reserves; the balance sheets of
banks, corporates, and households are generally in good shape; trade has become more
diversified; and internal demand has gained importance as a driver of growth. The export-led
recession is expected to last through end-2009, with quarterly growth returning in early 2010.
Policy issues. The Article IV discussions focused on macroeconomic and financial policies
to cushion the impact of external shocks and on reforms to meet medium-term challenges.
Policymakers have responded vigorously to the deteriorating growth outlook. There was
broad agreement on the policy settings and the reform priorities.
Fiscal policy. The countercyclical fiscal response has been appropriately large, but room for
further maneuver is limited. To broaden the room for maneuver, fiscal decisions need to be
cast in a framework that includes consolidation plans further along the recovery path. The
staff and the authorities shared the view that a better articulation of the medium-term
evolution of the public finances would safeguard the credibility of fiscal plans and the
confidence effects of actions already taken.
Monetary policy. Bank Negara Malaysia has taken decisive action and there is now
considerable monetary support in the pipeline. There was agreement that, barring a
significant deterioration of the outlook for growth or inflation, monetary policy should stay
the course until a recovery is well established. However, Bank Negara still has ammunition
that could be used if tail risks materialize.
Financial sector policies. Reforms and proactive policies have helped the financial system
withstand the global crisis. Although banks are generally well capitalized and liquid, asset
quality will deteriorate as the recession drags on and regulators need to focus on further
preventive steps to ensure that banks’ capital positions are robust.
Beyond the current crisis. The authorities intend to continue to pursue policies and reforms
to strengthen long-term economic prospects and boost resilience. The staff and the authorities
agreed that priority should be given to bolstering the fiscal framework and rebalancing the
sources of growth toward domestic demand. The latter would be facilitated by accelerating
the implementation of structural reforms and allowing the ringgit to resume its trend
appreciation. According to staff estimates, the real effective ringgit is undervalued, but a
number of indicators suggest that the undervaluation is not extreme. Once the global turmoil
subsides, however, a pace of real appreciation faster than that experienced so far would be
desirable.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Malaysia has been hit hard by the global downturn. The impact has been mostly
through the trade channel but global financial market turbulence has also been felt. Exports
have plunged, capital inflows have reversed, and local financial markets have experienced
heightened volatility. The economy is now set to contract for the first time in ten years.
Continued weakness in export demand and investor confidence weighs on the outlook.
2.
Encouragingly, Malaysia is coping with the crisis from a position of strength. It
has ample foreign exchange reserves and a net international creditor position; financial
supervision has been proactive; and the balance sheets of banks, corporates, and households
are generally in good shape. Moreover, external trade has become more diversified with
respect to both products and markets, and internal demand has gained importance as a driver
of growth over the last decade.
3.
The 2009 Article IV discussions focused on macroeconomic and financial policies
to cushion the impact of external shocks and on reforms to meet medium-term
challenges. The recession has added urgency to outstanding structural issues—fiscal
consolidation and strengthening domestic-oriented activity. In fact, the crisis presents an
opportunity to revisit the development model that has served Malaysia well but may need
adjusting as the global economic landscape changes.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Background
4.

Since mid-2008, GDP growth and inflation have slowed sharply.



GDP contracted by 10½ percent (q/q saar) in 2009Q1, after a decline of about
12 percent in 2008Q4 (Figure 1 and Table 1). The drop in GDP was driven by
faltering external demand: exports—

Inflation reached a 26-year high in
mid-2008, but has since declined as
commodity prices have collapsed and
slack in demand has put a lid on pricing
power. Core inflation has also edged
down.

employment has fallen by 7¾ percent
y/y in the first quarter (compared with a contraction in industrial production of about
15 percent), and the overall unemployment rate has increased modestly to 3.2 percent
in the first quarter. Lags may still have to play out fully, but there is survey evidence
that foreign workers (not fully captured in labor market statistics) have borne the
brunt of the adjustment. Furthermore, unlike what happened during the Asian Crisis,
many export-oriented companies have reportedly been able to lessen the blow of
shrinking orders through shortened workweeks rather than labor-shedding. As a
result, consumer confidence has generally held up.

Global turbulence has spilled into the domestic financial markets.



The benchmark equity price index
declined by more than 30 percent
between mid-2008 and March 2009,
although it rebounded by some
25 percent in April-May. The market
rally has reflected renewed optimism
about near-term prospects and an
upturn in commodity prices.



Government bond yields have
remained broadly stable, but
sovereign spreads have declined with
the recent pickup in risk appetite. The
EMBI spread is now below 200 basis
points, just over one-third of its level
in October 2008. The spread on
sovereign credit default swaps
(CDS) and the CDS spread on
Maybank, Malaysia’s largest bank,
are also off last year’s peaks.

Despite capital reversals and the unwinding of the commodity boom, Malaysia’s
external position remains strong (Table 2).


The current account surplus reached 17 percent of GDP in 2008, as the trade balance
surged thanks to strong demand for commodities and a better-than-expected
performance of electronics through the third quarter (Figure 3 and Table 3).2 The
collapse of exports in 2008Q4 was accompanied by an equally strong import
compression, leaving the current account surplus (in relation to GDP) broadly
unchanged by year-end. With rising tourism receipts, the services account has



With capital flowing out rapidly, reserves shrunk by US$35 billion in the second half
of 2008. Reserves have continued to slip, albeit at a slower rate, through March 2009.
They stood at about US$87 billion (40 percent of GDP or four times short-term
debt) in June.

Outlook and Risks
7.

External developments will probably shape Malaysia’s recovery path.



Near-term: GDP is projected to contract by 4−5 percent in 2009 (Table 4). The
export-led recession is expected to last through end-2009, with quarterly growth
returning in early 2010. Private domestic demand will likely shrink this year, but the
public sector should provide some offset. The current account surplus is expected to
decline in 2009 relative to GDP as exports continue to weaken while import
compression slows. Inflation is projected to fall to about 1 percent (yearly average).
Risks to growth relate to the duration of the global recession (which could drag down
exports), the evolution of commodity prices (which influence disposable incomes in
rural areas), and adverse macro-financial interactions (which could crimp the
recovery of private demand or blunt policy effectiveness).3 Downside risks are
mitigated by Malaysia’s strong reserve position, well-capitalized and liquid banks,
and under-geared corporates. Inflation is unlikely to be a policy concern in the period

April 2008).

ahead. Entrenched deflation seems a remote possibility at present although, because
of base effects, Malaysia may experience a few months of negative headline inflation
in mid-year.


Medium term: GDP growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2010, in line with
global developments, but it would remain below trend for a few years. Furthermore,
shifts in the pattern of global demand and in the global financial landscape could
depress the return on capital and growth prospects over a long horizon. While staff’s
projections reflect a downward revision of potential growth, the extent of the
mark-down is for now speculative.4 This complicates estimates of the underlying
current account. In the baseline, the current account surplus estimated at the current
real exchange rate (REER) is projected to shrink to about 10 percent of GDP by 2014,
as investment activity remains hostage to uncertainty and national savings decline.

The authorities broadly concurred with these assessments. According to official
projections, GDP would contract by 4−5 percent in 2009 and recover somewhat in 2010 with
the global economy. Looking further ahead, there was agreement that the crisis underscored
the need for Malaysia to step up deregulation in product and labor markets with a view to
improving the resilience of the economy. The authorities noted that a revamped development
model for Malaysia has taken shape. This New Economic Model (NEM) is designed to meet
medium-term challenges that have so far received insufficient attention. In broad contour, the
NEM focuses policymaking on market liberalization, support of private investment, new
sources of growth, long-term fiscal sustainability, and human capital accumulation.5

Potential growth has been marked down from 6 percent to about 4¼ percent for the next 3 years.

This vision will likely be reflected in the upcoming Tenth Malaysia Plan (10MP). Background work is set to
start next year.

III. THE MACROECONOMIC RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS
A. Fiscal Policy
Background
9.
Budget consolidation was reversed in 2008. The central government deficit, which
had declined from 5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3¼ percent of GDP in 2007, rose back to
nearly 5 percent of GDP last year (Table 5).
Uses of Oil Revenue
On the whole, fiscal policy was pro-cyclical

in good times. Oil revenues increased on

deficit widened—and the non-oil deficit
surged to 11 percent of GDP. A subsidy reform in mid-2008 provided little budgetary relief
as savings were later spent when the cycle turned.7 Malaysia’s fiscal position is projected to
deteriorate further in 2009 as revenue begins to decline and countercyclical support comes
on-stream, pushing the headline deficit to nearly 8 percent of GDP.
10.

Two stimulus packages have been rolled out.



In early November 2008, the authorities announced a fiscal package of about
1 percent of GDP in new spending to support growth. The original 2009 budget (in
August 2008) envisaged a reduction in the deficit of the central government to
3¾ percent of GDP through sizeable cuts in current expenditure. The revised deficit
target (of about 5 percent of GDP) reflected lower projected revenues and broadly
unchanged outlays. However, spending priorities have shifted in favor of
“high-impact” projects financed by savings on fuel subsidies (i.e., public works,

6

Around 20 percent of the items in Malaysia’s CPI basket have administered prices, including fuel and energy,
certain foodstuff, and some construction materials. In mid-2008, the subsidized component accounted for about
12 percent of the CPI.
7

Among other things, retail prices for gasoline and diesel were raised toward international prices; the price of
gas for industrial use was more than doubled; and a price setting mechanism for gasoline was proposed. Offset
measures were also introduced to cushion the impact of the domestic fuel price hike on consumers. In
May 2009, subsidies for some foodstuff were also abolished. Notwithstanding progress, the reform remains
incomplete.

10
education programs, and some pro-business initiatives). Additional measures include
a temporary reduction in employees’ contributions to the pension fund.8


The second fiscal stabilization package, announced in March 2009, amounts to about
9 percent of GDP. The package includes loan guarantees (about 40 percent of the
total) and will be implemented over two years. The fiscal impulse is estimated at
about 2 percent of GDP in 2009. The second package aims at limiting the depth of the
recession and includes an array of expenditure and revenue measures. The former
account for the bulk of the package (excluding loan guarantees). They relate primarily
to infrastructure expenditure, worker training programs, and the recruitment of public
sector employees. Tax measures include exemptions for interest on housing loans and
some income tax deductions for laid-off workers.

Staff’s Views
11.
The fiscal easing has been appropriately large and diversified, but room for
further maneuver is limited. The non-oil primary balance is set to widen to a record
15 percent of GDP in 2009, and the

requirements without external financing,
market concerns about the size of the deficit
and the lack of a consolidation strategy have led to the first local currency downgrade since
the 1997 crisis. To broaden the room for maneuver, the authorities should start casting their
fiscal decisions (particularly on a new stimulus, if needed) in a framework that articulates
consolidation plans once a self-sustaining recovery is under way. Reassurances about the
medium-term evolution of the public finances would safeguard the credibility of fiscal plans
and the confidence effects of actions already taken.

Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
12.
The authorities noted that the global downturn had warranted vigorous fiscal
action, notwithstanding weaknesses in the fiscal position. Special procedures had been put

11
in place to accelerate execution of the budget and bolster accountability.9 Nonetheless, in
their view, the full impact of the package is unlikely to be felt until the second half of this
year or early the next. There was agreement that restoring the fiscal position to a sustainable
path is a paramount post-crisis priority. In fact, the authorities noted that this had been a
policy goal for some time, and some progress had been made until early 2008 when the
burden of soaring subsidies had forced the policymakers’ hand. The New Economic Model
has brought fiscal adjustment at the top of the medium-term policy agenda once again. The
emphasis in the stimulus packages on public spending to increase productivity and support
structural changes gives hope that faster growth down the line might help restore fiscal
sustainability sooner rather than later.
B. Monetary Policy
Background
13.

Monetary policy has been also loosened decisively.



Since November 2008, the BNM has slashed its policy rate by 150 basis points to
2 percent. Reserve requirements have also been cut to reduce the cost of financial
intermediation. Timely liquidity support in the interbank market has kept the
overnight interbank rate close to the policy rate, suggesting orderly market conditions
throughout. As elsewhere in the region, U.S. dollar funding pressures appeared late
last year, as indicated by widening cross-currency basis spreads and sporadic
evidence of more difficult access to trade credit. However, on the whole dollar
liquidity has remained adequate.



More broadly, the monetary transmission mechanism has not been undermined by the
global market turbulence. The base lending rate has declined, and broad money has
continued to grow (Table 6). Credit has expanded (y/y) although the rate of expansion
has decelerated (on a m/m basis) as banks tightened lending standards and loan
demand moderated in tandem with economic activity.

Staff’s Views
14.
The monetary easing has been appropriately proactive and there is now
considerable monetary support in the pipeline. Staff calculations show that interest rates
are lower than suggested by a Taylor rule. With risks to growth trumping inflation concerns,
the monetary settings are broadly on the mark. Barring a significant deterioration of the

outlook for growth or inflation, monetary policy should stay the course until a recovery is
well established. However, the BNM still has ammunition that could be used if tail risks
materialize.
Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
15.
BNM officials noted that decisive action was justified in light of the worsening
outlook for growth and receding inflation risks. The preference had been for a
front-loaded response to head off tail risks. Among other considerations, the policy response
had to strike a balance between reducing the costs of funds for households (to stimulate
aggregate demand) and supporting the interest income of savers.10 There was agreement that
policy could stay on hold for now. The BNM thought that further interest rates reductions
would be considered only if the economic situation deteriorates significantly. In the
meantime, ensuring a smooth flow of credit to the economy (inter alia through the BNM’s
management of facilities to broaden SMEs’ access to funds (¶17) and other guarantee
schemes) will take center stage in monetary policymaking.
C. Financial Sector Policies
Background
16.
Malaysia’s financial sector has faced the crisis from a position of strength and so
far has coped well.


Financial markets are relatively deep by regional standards. Total assets of the
financial sector (bank and nonbank) were about 350 percent of GDP in 2008.11 Within
ASEAN, stock market capitalization is the second largest and the bond market is the
largest. Although bank financing remains the predominant source of funding, the
corporate sector has increasingly tapped the debt market. Significant steps have been
taken to increase the openness of the financial sector, and most foreign exchange
controls introduced during the Asian crisis have been lifted.12

10

The BNM has introduced savings bonds with a guaranteed minimum rate of return that exceeds the yield on
the savings deposits to ensure an appropriate return for savers.
11

Malaysia has an offshore financial center in Labuan, where, as of end-2008, 59 banks operated with assets
totaling US$29 billion (about 4 percent of Malaysia’s financial sector asset). Labuan-based institutions are
supervised by the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority. The BNM can also conduct on-site
inspections as necessary.
12

Remaining restrictions concern financial account transactions financed with ringgit borrowing and the
offshore trading of the ringgit.

13






Banks (which account for the bulk of
financial sector assets) are well
capitalized, have low NPLs and
sufficient liquidity (Table 7). Reliance
on external funding is minimal, and
there are no material rollover risks.
Generally strong balance sheets of
Malaysian corporates and households
have also contributed to the strength of
the financial sector. Corporates have
low leverage and adequate liquidity,
despite sluggish profitability.13
Households’ debt is high relative to
regional peers, but is equal to about
50 percent of households’ liquid assets
and debt service appears to be
manageable.

Malaysia’s capital markets have been rattled by the international market turbulence,
but the impact has by and large been contained. Asset prices have plummeted and
spreads (sovereign, bank CDS, and cross-currency basis swap) have spiked during the
periods of most acute global strains. Nevertheless, Malaysia’s stock price correction
and increase in volatility have been among the least pronounced in the region.

As of end-2008, listed nonfinancial corporations had a debt-equity ratio of about 40 percent and an interest
coverage ratio of 7¼—both better than the corresponding averages for emerging Asia.

Islamic finance has grown rapidly. Assets
of Islamic banks have doubled since 2000, and accounted for about 17 percent of total banking sector
assets as of May 2009. Shariah-compliant stocks account for about 88 percent of stocks listed and
64 percent of total market capitalization of the Malaysian stock market. Takaful (Islamic insurance)
operators have a 7 percent share of total insurance and takaful assets, and about 13 percent of funds
managed by unit trust management companies are Islamic.

from about 78 percent during the same

and new licenses issued to foreign Islamic banks, Islamic fund management companies and takaful
operators.

Financial sector reforms and proactive policies have helped the financial system
withstand the global crisis.


Prudential oversight and the regulatory framework have kept up with—and
facilitated—changes in the financial landscape. A deposit insurance scheme was
introduced in 2005 and a credit-scoring database aids lenders’ decisions. Further
reforms to strengthen regulations and market infrastructure have been implemented in
recent years. These included steps to bolster risk management and monitoring
systems. Notably, Basel II was adopted in 2008, with little impact on capital
requirements and the majority of banks opting for the standardized approach.



In October last year, as a preventive measure amid heightened distress in mature
markets and similar moves in the region, the BNM extended a blanket guarantee on
all domestic and foreign currency deposits through 2010. At the same time, to
safeguard short-term funding, it announced the willingness to back interbank lending,
if needed. The BNM has also injected liquidity at times by drawing down official
foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, the authorities have introduced new
financing facilities for the SMEs to ensure that viable companies adversely affected
by the slowdown continue to have access to financing.14

Staff’s Views
18.
Looking ahead, the global crisis is likely to continue to have an impact on
Malaysia’s financial sector. Strains are expected to intensify as the recession drags on.
Financial institutions are exposed to credit risks (mostly related to mortgages and loans to
exporters) and a slowdown in activity will put pressure on the corporate and household
sectors’ ability to service their debt. As deleveraging continues in advanced markets, funding
through domestic securities and loans could become costlier and access to external funds
could become more difficult.
19.
The fluid situation puts a premium on crisis preparedness and proactive
supervision. With little fiscal space to repair balance sheets in a worst-case scenario,
regulators should focus on further preventive steps to ensure that banks’ capital positions are
robust. Rigorous stress tests encompassing multi-year scenarios, tail events, and correlated
shocks should remain a high priority for the BNM in the period ahead.15 More broadly, staff
14

The BNM has established an SME Assistance and Modernization facility (worth RM 2 billion) which
expands previously existing facilities. In addition, the government has introduced two schemes (the Working
Capital Guarantee and the Restructuring Loan Guarantee, each worth RM 5 billion) under which the
government’s risk-sharing is up to 80 percent of a bank loan.
15

The BNM is in fact engaged in a dialog with IMF staff of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department on
ways to enhance stress-testing.

16
noted the importance of: (i) reviewing the adequacy of emergency liquidity assistance,
including the triggers for resolving institutions before support is needed; (ii) ensuring that
risk management practices are robust to new channels of financial contagion;
(iii) strengthening oversight of systemically important institutions with cross-border
activities, including through enhanced regional cooperation; and (iv) adopting emerging best
practices in crisis management and prevention, as appropriate.
Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
20.
Although there was broad agreement on the policy priorities, the authorities
emphasized that financial sector risks were limited by a number of factors.


Household balance sheets are sound. In particular, aggregate liquid financial assets of
households continue to cover total liabilities, and debt service remains manageable.
Mechanisms to facilitate restructuring of household debt have also been in place for
some time.



Banks have pursued conservative business models since the Asian crisis, and have not
been allowed by regulators to have significant positions in complex structured
products. Their capital base is comfortable. Furthermore, the principles of profit and
risk sharing intrinsic to Islamic finance add stability to the system—and, post-crisis,
the appeal of Islamic finance is likely to grow. The implementation of Basel II has
also enhanced the risk management culture at banks.



Stress tests indicate that banks have sufficient capital buffers and would prove
resilient in circumstances even more dire than currently expected. The BNM has
conducted scenario-based tests that incorporate prolonged global financial market
instability and large spillovers to the real sector. The resulting shocks to the banking
system include corporate defaults and valuation losses on corporate debt, as well as
sharp increases in NPLs. Under the most adverse scenario, the aggregate riskweighted capital ratio would decrease by about 4½ percentage points, but remain
above the 8-percent minimum requirement.16



The BNM had been implementing for some time aspects of macroprudential
regulation by requiring progressively higher provisioning regardless of the value of
collateral, if NPL resolution is delayed. Furthermore, dividend pay-outs are subject to
BNM approval, unlike in many other jurisdictions. The fact that the BNM supervises
banking groups on a consolidated basis and the Malaysia Deposit Insurance
Corporation is empowered to intervene troubled banks underpins the institutional
capabilities for crisis prevention and management. Finally, through a variety of
international fora the BNM has established an extensive network of contacts with
supervisors in other jurisdictions.

16

These results appear consistent with those obtained by Fitch Ratings (see Banks in Asia: Outlook for 2009,
January 2009).

17
IV. POLICY CHALLENGES ALONG THE RECOVERY PATH
21.
Looking beyond the current crisis, the authorities should continue to pursue
policies and reforms to strengthen Malaysia’s long-term economic prospects and boost
resilience. The staff and the authorities agree that priority should be given to bolstering the
fiscal framework and restoring the sustainability of the fiscal position, as well as rebalancing
the sources of growth toward domestic demand.
A. Bolstering the Fiscal Policy Framework and Restoring Sustainability
The two main issues are: the dependence of the budget on oil revenues and the absence of
multi-year indicative budget targets. Tackling these issues should support consolidation and
improve public resource management.
Staff’s Views and Policy Issues
22.
Exposure of the budget to oil prices should be reduced over the medium term
through a combination of revenue and expenditure measures.


Improving non-oil revenue. The groundwork for the rollout of the goods and services
tax (GST) has been completed and implementation should not be delayed unduly.
Special tax incentives (which represent a large hidden cost to the budget) could also
be rationalized, in the context of a reform of corporate taxation.17



Phasing out oil and gas subsidies. Poorly targeted fuel subsidies, which at their peak
in 2008 amounted to about 2½ percent of GDP, remain a vulnerability to the public
finances. Recent steps to reform the scheme are welcome, but more could be done.
For example, lower energy prices provide an opportunity to move away from the
proposal to lock in a specific amount of subsidy, a proposal that would freeze the
costs to the budget and pass on to consumers all the benefits of falling prices. In fact,
as a first-best policy, universal fuel subsidies should be eliminated over time with due
consideration for the impact on the less well-off.18

23.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework could be enhanced by an
indicative consolidation path and a more explicit consideration of the drawdown of oil
wealth. Further along the recovery path, the macroeconomic policy mix will have to be
recalibrated with a view to facilitating needed budgetary consolidation. Early communication
of the direction of fiscal policy could allay concerns in volatile markets. From this
perspective, it would be useful that once a self-sustained recovery is in train, the authorities
articulate consolidation plans that could help anchor market expectations. The deterioration

17
18

Tax incentives have amounted to roughly half of total tax revenues, according to World Bank estimates.

Malaysia has several social programs in place, but lacks a comprehensive social safety net and targeted
measures to offset the impact of lower subsidies on the poor.

18
in the non-oil primary deficit suggests also a framework that could make more explicit how
budgetary decisions affect fiscal sustainability. Better informed budget decisions could be
achieved by an approach that links spending to an intergenerationally equitable management
of Malaysia’s oil wealth.19 This approach would strengthen the design and evaluation of
policies, and mitigate the impact of oil price volatility on fiscal decisions.
Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
24.
The authorities agreed on the need to reverse the erosion of the non-oil tax base
and reduce the deficit. As recognized in the New Economic Model, ensuring fiscal
sustainability is a medium-term goal. To that end, the following policies are being
considered:


GST and tax exemptions. Legislation has been drafted and the necessary
administrative infrastructure has been laid out. However, in the current uncertain
environment, no timetable for a rollout has been set. In the authorities’ view,
exemptions will remain important for certain sectors and regions. International tax
competition limits the extent to which incentives can be streamlined. Nonetheless, the
authorities are introducing sunset clauses when possible.



Subsidies. Rationalization remains high on the agenda, but changes will be
implemented gradually to fine-tune the modalities of reform. The adjustments put in
place in June 2008 have been a first step, and additional options are being considered
to better target subsidies going forward. In this context, the authorities also intend to
reassess the adequacy of Malaysia’s social safety net—a task in which input from
IMF staff would be welcome. The authorities noted that the overhaul of subsidy
schemes and social safety net are key tasks of a newly established, high-level
Economic Council chaired by the prime minister.



Medium-term fiscal framework. The authorities agreed that a multi-year budget
framework could be useful in guiding fiscal planning and safeguard oil wealth.
However, they stressed that oil revenue has been spent prudently to enhance
productive capacity (including human capital), which would benefit future
generations. There was also agreement that adopting an indicative consolidation path
for the non-oil primary deficit could bolster the credibility of fiscal plans.
B. Rebalancing Growth

Shifting the sources of growth toward domestic demand would be facilitated by accelerating
the implementation of structural reforms and allowing the ringgit to resume its trend
appreciation.

19

Malaysia’s proven reserves of hydrocarbons amount to 5½ billion barrels for oil and 88 trillion cubic feet for
natural gas. Oil is expected to be depleted in about 22 years, gas in about 35 years.

19
Staff’s Views and Policy Issues
25.
In spite of advances, the structural reform agenda remains challenging. Areas
where further efforts are necessary include competition policy and labor market
liberalization. The June 2008 Mid-Term Review of the Ninth Malaysia Plan (launched
in 2005) addressed some of the outstanding issues.20 The New Economic Model under
development by the authorities is also focusing on these areas.
26.

A priority is to support the revival of private investment demand:



The authorities are accelerating the pace of deregulation. The recent decision to
further liberalize segments of the manufacturing and service sectors, including the
financial sector, is a significant step in the right direction.21 It clearly signals the
government’s commitment to outward-oriented policies and its desire to modernize
Malaysia’s development model. However, more remains to be done to improve the
business climate and address long-standing structural impediments to investment.
Staff emphasized the need to address skills mismatches and push ahead with further
product market and legal reforms to promote competition.



The reform of government-linked companies (GLCs) appears to be paying off and
should continue apace.22 Care should be taken to strike a balance between exploiting
the catalytic role of GLCs and promoting a level playing field, for example, in the
area of procurement.

20

Background work for the resumption of negotiations of a free trade agreement with the United States also
tackles these issues.
21

In April, a 30-percent bumiputra (ethnic Malay) equity requirement in 27 services subsectors was eliminated
and foreign ownership limits for all nonbank domestic financial institution was raised to 70 percent. In
mid-June, it was announced that import restrictions in the iron and steel industries would be lifted. On June 30,
it was announced inter alia that: the Foreign Investment Committee regulations covering acquisition of equity
stakes, mergers, and takeovers have been repealed; the 30-percent bumiputra ownership requirement in publicly
listed companies has been abolished (although 50 percent of IPOs still need to be reserved for native Malays);
and the fund management industry has been wholly open to foreign competition. Most of these steps dilute
38-year old affirmative action guidelines and reflect the authorities’ intent to further transform Malaysia in line
with the New Economic Model.
22

Most GLCs are listed companies partly owned by Khazanah, the government holding company. They account
for 50 percent of stock market capitalization, about 10 percent of value added, and 3 percent of employment.
GLCs span sectors as diverse as rubber plantations, power generation, and car production. Although Khazanah
meets the definition of a sovereign wealth fund specified in the Santiago Principles, it does not receive
government funding nor manages official reserves (although in the context of the second stimulus package it
will benefit from a RM 1 billion government’s injection). Its operations do not appear to undercut the
formulation and conduct of domestic macroeconomic policies.

20


Additional measures to improve the business climate would also be beneficial. As
flagged in the World Bank’s latest Doing Business report, areas of focus include land
registration, contract enforcement (e.g., as regards NPL resolution), business
ownership restrictions, and labor skills mismatches.

27.
Rebalancing growth in the medium term would also be facilitated by a stronger
ringgit. According to staff estimates, the ringgit in real effective terms is weaker than the
level implied by medium-term fundamentals, but a number of indicators suggest that the
undervaluation is not extreme (Appendix I). In particular, core inflation has been low, there
have been no asset price bubbles, and—

an appreciation of the real exchange rate
over the medium term. In fact, given limited fiscal space, there is no obvious reorientation of
the policy mix that would help strengthen the ringgit in the short run without prejudice to
domestic stability.
28.
Once the global turmoil subsides, a pace of real appreciation faster than that
experienced to date would be desirable. From a domestic perspective, it would accelerate
progress toward the authorities’ goals of boosting domestic sources of growth. More
specifically, a faster real effective

lowering the cost of imported capital

appreciation would foster external stability by facilitating balance of payments adjustment
and reducing the burden on countries with more flexible currencies.

21
Box 2. Global Deleveraging and Foreign Exchange Intervention in Malaysia
In the face of massive capital outflows, the BNM has supported the external value of the ringgit
since mid-2008. Interventions have aimed at smoothing volatility and have not fully countered
depreciation pressures. The resulting drawdown in official reserve (including the forward position)
has been in excess of US$55 billion over the span of 10 months. Reserves remain nonetheless ample
at about US$87 billion.
Stabilization of foreign exchange market conditions is a key objective of Malaysia’s exchange
rate policies. Since the 2005 exit from the
U.S. dollar peg, the BNM has intervened in the

July-August 2007 and—on an unprecedented
scale—since April 2008. In other periods, intervention has leaned in the opposite direction, slowing
a trend appreciation of the ringgit in the presence of surges in capital inflows or increases in the
prices of key commodity exports (hydrocarbons and palm oil). Most notably, reserves have increased
during mid-2005 to early 2008, but over the long haul, intervention has been two-sided and
stabilizing. Furthermore, since the BNM targets an overnight interest rate, its foreign exchange
interventions are mostly sterilized: the growth in the monetary base induced by net foreign assets has
been largely offset by the decline in net domestic assets.
An estimated reaction function captures these trends. In the empirical model, estimated over the
July 2005-April 2009 period, intervention is proxied by the bi-weekly change in reserves.1/
According to the estimated equation, intervention is persistent, a ringgit depreciation is followed by
foreign currency sales, and an increase in volatility (relative to its moving average) leads to foreign
currency sales, although the effect of volatility is small.

rate.

22
The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
29.
The authorities are committed to push ahead with structural reforms, but noted
that the pace of implementation has to be tuned to political and economic realities.


They noted that the decision to liberalize some services, encouraging foreign entry in
the midst of a global downturn, exemplifies the government’s commitment to resist
protectionism.



The authorities view the role of the public sector as a facilitator of private sector’s
participation in the economy. In the implementation of regional development plans,
the public sector will only provide needed infrastructure in support of private
sector-led growth.23



The GLC transformation program is aimed at strengthening the underpinning for
private sector activity. The program, which will span a decade, is already paying
dividends in terms of the improved performance of several GLCs. During the current
phase (2007–2010) company-specific restructurings are being undertaken.

30.
There was broad agreement that improving the business climate will help
Malaysia move up the value chain. Lower costs of doing business remain key to a vigorous
investment recovery over the medium term. In order to boost competitiveness, import duties
on raw materials and intermediate goods used for domestic manufacturing and construction
activities have been abolished. Other steps underway include initiatives to improve public
service delivery and measures to address the labor skills mismatches through education
reforms and less regulation in labor markets.
31.
The authorities disagreed with staff’s assessment of the current level of the
exchange rate (Appendix I). They stressed that Malaysia’s exchange rate policies: (i) do not
target a particular exchange rate; (ii) have been informed by the need to prevent exchange
rate overshooting in both directions; and (iii) are consistent with a return to a gradual trend
appreciation of the currency once the crisis subsides, if fundamentals and other determinants
of the real exchange rate indeed point in this direction. In the authorities’ view, the models
used by staff to assess the exchange rate do not adequately capture Malaysia’s structural
changes. They believe that the current account surplus is driven by a number of factors in
addition to the exchange rate, including the recent commodity boom (which has inflated
exports revenues but does not represent increased competitiveness), structural rigidities (that

23

The authorities have long-term development plans for five regions or “corridors.” The plans identify
infrastructure requirements and industries that could spearhead private sector-led growth. The most ambitious
plan aims at supporting growth of services in the South Johor region in part through further product and labor
market deregulation.

23
have resulted in low investment), and high precautionary savings (related to underdeveloped
safety nets). Past reserve accumulation has provided self-insurance against the external
shocks and capital flow reversals at the heart of the global crisis of 2008.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Malaysia has been hit hard by the global crisis but is well placed to weather it.
Weaker export demand, worsened terms of trade, and volatile investor sentiment will test the
resilience of the economy in the period ahead. However, a strong external position, a more
flexible exchange rate regime, robust balance sheets, and a sound financial system should
lessen the blow from adverse external shocks. Policies should remain supportive and aim at
blunting the effects of the global downturn.
33.
Fiscal policymakers have risen to the challenge. The large stimulus for 2009−10
should mitigate the impact of the output contraction on households and businesses. As
recognized by the authorities, further measures could be considered if the economy’s
trajectory proves more fragile than expected. However, high prospective budget deficits and
a rising debt to GDP ratio point to risks to fiscal sustainability and adverse reactions in
financial markets, which could raise the cost of financing. To broaden the room for
maneuver, the authorities should cast any further stimulus (and fiscal decisions more
broadly) in a framework that includes consolidation plans once a self-sustaining recovery is
under way. Reassurances about the medium-term evolution of the public finances would
safeguard the credibility of fiscal plans and the confidence effects of actions taken.
34.
Monetary policy settings are appropriate. The BNM’s actions to shore up market
confidence and access to credit have supported bank intermediation and the transmission
mechanism of monetary policy in difficult circumstances. There is now considerable
monetary support in the pipeline. Credit growth is holding up and Taylor-rule calculations
show that interest rates provide cyclical support. Barring a significant deterioration of the
outlook for growth or inflation, monetary policy should stay the course until a recovery is
well established. The BNM still has ammunition that could be used if tail risks materialize.
Monetary policymaking needs to remain data-dependent and forward-looking, providing a
first line of defense against any deterioration of growth prospects, especially given limited
fiscal space. In a context of heightened market volatility, the BNM should also continue to
communicate clearly its assessment of risks—and give early indication of the direction of
policy.
35.
Financial policies are rightly focused on the challenges ahead. Although the
financial sector appears sound and is benefiting from the growth of Islamic finance, volatile
global markets put a premium on crisis preparedness and proactive supervision. The
authorities have rightly focused on preventive steps, including recent measures to reinforce
liquidity support and deposit insurance. Their efforts appear to be appropriately concentrated

24
on upgrading their stress testing framework; on reviewing the triggers for resolving
institutions; on ensuring effective risk management; and on strengthening supervisory
cooperation and oversight of institutions with cross-border activities.
36.
Further along the recovery path Malaysia’s resilience will be boosted by
strengthening fiscal frameworks. As the economy regains a solid footing, it will be
important to address outstanding issues that pose fiscal risks. The necessary steps include
broadening the non-oil tax base, moving ahead with subsidy reform, and putting fiscal policy
on an indicative consolidation path.
37.
Another key medium-term challenge is to shift the sources of growth toward
domestic demand. The authorities should continue to focus on promoting private investment
and deepening economic reforms in labor and product markets. The recent decision to open
up services, including in the financial sector, sends an important signal. However, more
remains to be done to enhance the business climate and address long-standing structural
impediments to investment. Staff recommendations include addressing skills mismatches,
pushing ahead with further product market reforms, and allowing the real exchange rate to
appreciate over the medium term.
38.
The ringgit in real effective terms remains weaker than its equilibrium level, but
Malaysia’s exchange rate policies are broadly appropriate. Recent foreign exchange
interventions by the BNM have been two-sided and have helped maintain orderly market
conditions, without unduly leaning against market trends. Although at present there is no
obvious reorientation of the policy that could help strengthen the ringgit without prejudice to
domestic stability, the ringgit is likely to return to a gradual trend appreciation once the
recovery is firmly established. A pace of real appreciation faster than that experienced so far
would then be desirable. This appreciation would facilitate the achievement of the
authorities’ goal of rebalancing the sources of growth toward domestic demand, thus
boosting resilience and reducing Malaysia’s vulnerability to external shocks.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I: MALAYSIA—EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
Staff’s Assessment
The IMF Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER) applies three approaches to
assess the level of the real effective ringgit in relation to the level implied by
medium-term fundamentals (see IMF Occasional Papers No. 167, 1998; and No. 261,
2008). According to the CGER, the ringgit is weaker than its equilibrium level.1 For example,
according to the macroeconomic balance approach, the current account norm is estimated to
be significantly below the projected medium-term current account (based on an unchanged
real exchange rate), pointing to a relatively large undervaluation by this metric. Other
methodologies give broadly similar results.
A number of qualitative indicators suggest, however, that the undervaluation is not extreme:
core inflation has been low, there have been no asset price bubbles, and intervention has been
two-sided. Nonetheless, Malaysia’s current account surplus has been large and protracted,
although a sizeable portion of its increase since 2001 can be traced to the commodity boom.
Risks to external stability are mitigated by two considerations: (i) established exchange rate
policies (as captured by the trend appreciation that prevailed before the crisis) would
probably eliminate the bulk of the undervaluation over the medium term, once downward
pressures on the currency unwind; and (ii) reforms in the works should reduce the
savings-investment balance over time.
Authorities’ Views
The authorities disagreed with the assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
weaker than the value implied by medium-term fundamentals. In the course of the
Article IV discussions, they noted that:


Malaysia’s current account surplus has reflected to a large extent a temporary
commodity boom rather than durable gains in competitiveness. Exports of raw
materials make up about two-thirds of the current account balance and have
accounted for nearly half of the 8 percentage point increase in the current account as a
share of GDP since 2001.



The current account surplus also has a large structural component. It reflects high
private saving because of demographics and underdeveloped social safety nets, and
relatively weak investment demand in a context of market imperfections and

This probably includes a temporary undervaluation since the nominal exchange rate has depreciated by
12 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since the onset of the crisis.

36
structural shifts. (Tellingly, Malaysia’s investment abroad exceeds inward foreign
investment.) Reforms to strengthen the social security system and address rigidities in
product and labor markets will take time to bear fruit.


Official intervention has been two-sided and in response to volatile capital flows. The
objective has been to smooth
volatility and avoid

intervention has provided a
buffer against past surges in capital inflows—and the war-chest to cope with their
reversal in recent months. Following the exit from the peg in July 2005, the BNM has
intervened by selling dollars in late 2005, May–June 2006, February 2007,
July-August 2007 and—on an unprecedented scale—since August 2008. In the
presence of open capital markets and financial deepening, intervention has thus
safeguarded financial stability.



Ample reserves are good policy in an open economy. Malaysia does not stand out by
some metrics of reserve adequacy (e.g., reserves to total trade). Reserve accumulation
has also proved far-sighted during a commodity upswing of uncertain duration.



There are no signs of instability or financial imbalances typically associated with an
undervalued currency. The absence of demand-push price and wage pressures, or
pockets of overinvestment, suggests that the exchange rate is basically in line with
fundamentals.



Model-based estimates are too imprecise to be useful for policy making. In addition,
they are marred by methodological shortcomings, such as the difficulty in accounting
for country-specific factors and structural changes. In fact, the Fund should be more
cautious in the application of these models—and more evenhanded in its exchange
rate assessments.

ANNEX I: MALAYSIA—MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
The public debt ratio is projected to increase over the medium term, while the
external debt would decline in relation to GDP. This reflects the challenging external
environment but still broadly favorable medium-term growth prospects, as well as a reversal
of the fiscal consolidation trend of the last few years. For the federal government, the debt
ratio would exceed 50 percent of GDP.
2.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt would increase sharply, reaching
about 72 percent of GDP by 2014. Ample domestic savings allow the government to meet
its borrowing requirements without external financing. Nevertheless, market concerns about
the size of public deficit and debt and the lack of a consolidation strategy have led to the first
local currency downgrade since the 1997 crisis. Bound tests indicate that public sector gross
debt would increase further in the event of shocks, with the most extreme shock (a decline in
growth) leaving debt at 90 percent of GDP.
3.
External debt is projected to decline to 19 percent of GDP by 2014, reflecting
mostly the large current account surpluses and a drawdown in private external debt.
Sustainability does not appear to be at risk. Bound tests indicate the external debt would
remain manageable under all shocks considered, including a one-time 30 percent
depreciation of the ringgit, which would leave it at about 37 percent of GDP.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation
(increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

VII. Exchange Arrangement:
On July 21, 2005, the BNM announced the adoption of a managed float with the exchange
rate of the ringgit to be monitored against an undisclosed trade-weighted basket of
currencies. Based on information on the exchange rate behavior, the de facto exchange rate
regime is classified as floating.
Malaysia maintains bilateral payments arrangements with 22 countries. The authorities have
indicated that these arrangements do not have restrictive features.
Capital control measures imposed in early 1994 and in 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis
have mostly been lifted, except for the internationalization of the ringgit. In particular, since
May 2001, nonresident portfolio investors are freely allowed to repatriate their principal
sums and profits out of the country at any time. Malaysia further liberalized exchange control
regulations during 2002−07. The main measures were a relaxation of regulations on
investment abroad by domestic institutions, an easing of regulations on domestic credit
facilities extended to nonresidents, abolition of overnight limits on all foreign currency
accounts maintained by residents and of the net open position limit imposed on a licensed
onshore bank, allowing residents to open and maintain joint foreign currency accounts for
any purpose, easing requirements on foreign currency and ringgit credit facilities from
nonresidents, relaxation of rules on the provision of financial guarantees, abolition of several
reporting requirements, allowing domestic institutions to enter into repo transactions with

6
non-residents, granting flexibility for domestic institutions to sell nonperforming loans to
external parties, and a relaxation of the conditions on residents to enter into foreign exchange
forward contracts to sell foreign currency receivables for ringgit for any purpose (prior to
April 2003, only export proceeds and services receivables—excluding interest receivables—
were allowed to be sold on a forward contract basis). The authorities also allowed local
investors to buy foreign-listed securities and foreign firms to sell shares in the local market.
In 2008, further measures were undertaken, including the lifting of limits on residents’
borrowing in foreign currency, and the easing of rules on borrowing in ringgit by residents
from nonresidents and lending in ringgit by residents to non-residents.
The Malaysian authorities view remaining exchange control regulations as prudential in
nature and necessary to ensure the availability of adequate information on the settlement of
payments and receipts as part of the monitoring mechanism on capital flows. These controls
do not contravene Malaysia’s obligations under Article VIII.
Malaysia maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions with respect to the Taliban and individuals and economic entities associated with
terrorism. These measures, taken in accordance with relevant UN Security Council
resolutions, are maintained for the reasons of national and international security and have
been notified to the Fund pursuant to the IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Malaysia also restricts current international transactions between Malaysian residents and
Israeli companies and individuals; however, since these restrictions affect the underlying
transactions themselves, they are not subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII,
Section 2(b).
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Malaysia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2009 Article IV

ANNEX III: MALAYSIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts
to improve statistics for the consolidated public sector are necessary. Malaysia subscribes to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). It is using a timeliness flexibility option
for general government operations (within six-quarter lags after the end of reference year).


National accounts: Currently, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM)
compiles and publishes annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by
expenditure at current and constant prices, and annual estimates for gross disposable
income, saving, and net lending for the economy based on the 1968 SNA. The
quarterly data are released about two months after the reference quarter. In addition,
DOSM has developed experimental institutional sector accounts in accordance with
the 1993 SNA. There are significant differences in the estimates for key aggregates,
particularly for GDP, final consumption expenditures (government, household,
NPISH, and gross capital formation) common to both the 1968 SNA-based GDP
compilation system and the 1993 SNA-based institutional sector accounts system.



Prices: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. A
revised CPI was introduced in January 2006; it covers all 14 states and features a
more disaggregated measure of the consumption basket and updated expenditure
weights based on a 2004/05 comprehensive household income and expenditure
survey. The PPI features a 2000 base year with weights derived from the
2000 Input-Output tables. The implicit GDP deflator does not appear to track well
changes in the prices of exported and imported products following the large exchange
rate fluctuations in 1997 and 1998.



Labor market statistics: Data on employment and unemployment are disseminated
quarterly, and wages/earnings data are disseminated monthly.



Monetary and financial statistics: The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are
reported on a timely and regular basis and are broadly in conformity with the Fund’s
data needs. There is a need to improve the institutional coverage of the financial
corporations, sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification and valuation
of financial instruments to ensure full adherence to the IMF’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). In addition, due to the growing importance of
insurance corporations, pension funds, and other financial intermediaries in Malaysia,
coverage of MFS should be expanded to include these institutions. The MFS missions
of January 2004 and 2005 developed an integrated monetary database to be used for
publication and operational needs of the BNM, STA, and APD. The Bank Negara
Malaysia (BNM) reports data in STA’s standardized report forms (SRFs) which
provide more detailed classification of certain items, fuller sectoral and instrument

9
breakdown, and currency aggregation. MFS based on the SRFs are published in the
quarterly IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.


Balance of payments (BOP): DOSM compiles and publishes quarterly BOP
estimates in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and
the SDDS. The quarterly data are released three months after the reference quarter.
No data are shown for the capital transfers or acquisition/sale of nonproduced
nonfinancial assets, and transactions in reserve assets are computed as differences in
amounts outstanding and thus include valuation changes. The international
investment position data on other investment—assets and liabilities—are reported
only in an aggregate form.



Fiscal accounts: There has been limited progress in improving the consolidation of
accounts across various levels of government, and broadening the coverage of major
nonfinancial public enterprises (NFPEs). With assistance from STA, the authorities
are working on improving the consolidation of the public sector accounts, particularly
the treatment of taxes and dividends paid by key nonfinancial public enterprises to the
central government. There is a need to improve the timeliness, detail, and availability
of data on NFPEs and the state and local governments, as well as for ensuring that
quasi-fiscal and off-budget operations are adequately recorded. Dissemination of
more detailed data on NFPEs’ assets and liabilities and domestic and foreign
financing by type of debt instrument and holder would be desirable; efforts in this
direction will require continued close collaboration among the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU), the Treasury, and BNM.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 14, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Malaysia
On July 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Malaysia.1
Background
Malaysia has been hit hard by the global downturn. The economy is set to contract for the first
time in ten years. GDP growth and inflation have slowed sharply since mid-2008. However, the
reduction in employment has been relatively small so far, and as a result, consumer confidence
has generally held up.
Malaysia’s financial sector has faced the crisis from a position of strength and so far has coped
well. Nevertheless, global turbulence has spilled into the domestic financial markets. Equity
prices fell sharply in late 2008 and early 2009, but rebounded more recently, reflecting renewed
optimism about near-term prospects and an upturn in commodity prices. Credit growth has
decelerated, but remained at a reasonable 10½ percent y/y in April 2009, well above nominal
GDP growth.
Despite capital reversals and the unwinding of the commodity boom, Malaysia’s external
position remains strong. The current account surplus reached 17 percent of GDP in 2008, as
the collapse of exports in late 2008 was accompanied by an equally strong import compression.
The ringgit has appreciated slightly vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since April, after experiencing
depreciation pressures last fall and early this year as capital outflows intensified.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Budget consolidation was reversed in 2008. The central government deficit rose to almost
5 percent of GDP and is set to reach nearly 8 percent of GDP in 2009. Two stimulus packages
have been announced in late 2008 and early 2009, totaling about 10 percent of GDP, to be
implemented over two years. The packages include an array of expenditure and revenue
measures, as well as loan guarantees.
Monetary policy has been loosened decisively. Bank Negara Malaysia has slashed its policy
rate by 150 basis points to 2 percent, and reserve requirements have also been cut to reduce
the cost of financial intermediation. On the whole, dollar liquidity has remained adequate, and
the monetary transmission mechanism has not been undermined by the global market
turbulence.
External developments will probably shape Malaysia’s recovery path. The export-led recession
is expected to last through end-2009, with quarterly growth returning in early 2010. Risks to
growth relate to the duration of the global recession, the evolution of commodity prices, and
adverse macro-financial interactions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Malaysian authorities for sound macroeconomic
management in difficult circumstances, and observed that Malaysia is well positioned to
weather the severe impact of the global downturn. A strong external position, robust balance
sheets of household and corporate sectors, and sound financial system should lessen the blow
from adverse external shocks.
Directors agreed that the countercyclical fiscal response has been appropriately large, and
should mitigate the impact of output contraction on households and businesses. They saw
some limited room for additional stimulus if the downturn proves longer or deeper than
expected. At the same time, noting the high prospective budget deficits and a rising debt to
GDP ratio, they strongly encouraged the authorities to cast any future fiscal decisions in a
medium-term framework. Directors highlighted that the necessary steps to reduce medium term
fiscal risks include broadening the non oil tax base, moving ahead with subsidy reform, and
putting fiscal policy on a credible consolidation path.
Directors considered monetary policy settings to be broadly appropriate. They suggested that
monetary policy should continue to provide the first line of defense against any deterioration of
growth prospects, especially in light of the limited fiscal space. Nevertheless, directors felt that,
unless the outlook for growth or inflation deteriorates significantly, monetary policy should stay
the course until a recovery is firmly underway.
Directors emphasized that, although the financial sector appears sound and benefited from the
growth of Islamic finance, volatile global markets put a premium on crisis preparedness and
proactive supervision. Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on further preventive steps,

3
including upgrading the stress-testing framework; ensuring effective risk management; and
strengthening supervisory cooperation and oversight of institutions with cross border activities.
Directors underscored that a key medium-term challenge will be strengthening domestic
demand as a source of growth. They encouraged the authorities to continue to focus on
promoting private investment and deepening reforms in labor and product markets. Directors
welcomed the recent decision to push ahead with further liberalization in selected sectors, but
stressed that more remains to be done to enhance the business climate and remove long
standing structural impediments to investment.
Most Directors generally considered that Malaysia’s current exchange rate policy is broadly
appropriate. They also noted the staff’s assessment that the ringgit appears to be weaker than
its equilibrium level in real effective terms. However, many Directors were unconvinced by the
exchange rate assessment, and underlined the uncertainty about fundamentals and transitory
factors related to Malaysia’s commodity exports and the global crisis. They concurred with the
authorities’ view that the exchange rate policy is consistent with a return to a gradual trend
appreciation of the currency once the crisis subsides. Some Directors supported the staff’s
position that, once the recovery is firmly established, a faster pace of real appreciation would
facilitate a rebalancing of sources of growth toward domestic demand.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Malaysia
and Seng Guan Toh, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 16, 2009
1.
On behalf of our Malaysian authorities, we would like to thank Mr. Zanello and his
team for the focused discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in
Malaysia. Indeed the discussions this year have been candid yet constructive, and our
authorities appreciate the good work and helpful advice provided by the team. In fact, there
is broad agreement on almost all the major policy thrusts. We are further encouraged by the
assessment that the policy mix is appropriate as Malaysia, like many other small open
economies around the world, is striving hard to counter the severe impact of the current
global crisis. This statement thus seeks mainly to provide an update on the latest economic
developments in Malaysia and elaborates on selected policy issues for emphasis and
clarification.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
On economic performance, the Malaysian economy averaged a growth rate of
4.6 percent in 2008, but the two halves of the year contrasted sharply. Growth remained
strong in the first half of 2008, with the economy expanding by 7.1 percent. This was
supported by strong domestic demand and the continued expansion in Asian intra-regional
trade together with buoyant commodity markets at that time, despite signs of softness already
emanating from the major advanced economies. However, as the global financial crisis
escalated to an unprecedented level in the second half of 2008, Malaysia, being among the
world’s most highly open economies with total trade exceeding 160 percent of GDP, was not
spared. Due to the steep contraction in external demand, the Malaysian economy barely
recorded year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2008, despite continued strong impetus
from domestic-oriented activities.
3.
In response to the weakness in the global economy, the Government announced its
first stimulus package of about 1 percent of GDP for implementation at the beginning of
2009. As the global downturn deepened even more than expected going into 2009, the
effects of the vicious external contraction spilled over into domestic demand. Economic
growth contracted by 6.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009, and latest indications are that
while less severe, the contraction in growth has persisted into the second quarter of the year.
In response, the Government announced its second stimulus package in March 2009, for
implementation over two years – 2009 and 2010. While the second stimulus package had
elements that would support growth, it further introduced elements to spur structural
transformation in the economy that would position Malaysia for the global recovery in the
medium term, as noted in the Staff Report under the theme of the New Economic Model.
4.
The effects of the two stimulus packages on growth are expected to be more strongly
felt beginning in the second half of 2009. However, despite some recent positive signs, our
authorities have remained conservative on the prospects for the global economy, and

2
consequently, the latest official forecast is for Malaysia’s economic growth to record a
contraction of between 4 to 5 percent in 2009, similar to what is envisaged in the Staff
Report.
5.
On inflation, during 2008 the Malaysian economy faced supply-driven inflationary
pressures from the sharp surge in global food and fuel prices. Inflation averaged a higherthan-usual 5.4 percent for the year, reflecting largely the effects of the government’s sharp
upward adjustment to fuel prices in conjunction with a reduction in fuel subsidies in June
2008. This caused inflation to spike to a peak of 8.5 percent in July, which for monetary
policy presented an acute challenge due to elevated risks to both inflation and growth.
6.
Notwithstanding the widespread trend to raise interest rates during that period, it was
assessed, however, that in the latter part of 2008 the balance of risks would shift from higher
inflation to slower growth. It was evident by then that the sharp rise in food and fuel prices
had eroded the purchasing power of consumers. There were few indications of second round
effects of inflation, with wage pressures remaining contained. Importantly, it was assessed
that the ongoing financial turmoil in the advanced economies had turned acute and would
affect economic activity going forward. Hence, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) decided to
stay the course in the third quarter of 2008, with policy rates kept unchanged at
accommodative levels.
7.
As it became clear by the fourth quarter of 2008 that the global economy was
decelerating even more sharply than expected, monetary policy action was frontloaded. In the
four months from November 2008 to February 2009, the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) was
brought down by a total of 150 basis points to a historical low of 2 percent. The Statutory
Reserve Requirement (SRR) was also lowered by 3 percentage points in conjunction with the
reductions in policy rates to reduce further the cost of intermediation and accelerate the
monetary transmission to retail interest rates. As anticipated, headline inflation has
moderated from its July 2008 peak to below 4 percent by end-2008 and to only 2.4 percent
by May 2009, and is expected to average less than 2 percent for 2009.
8.
Despite the strains on growth and inflation from global developments, the external
position of Malaysia remains strong. Supported in part by commodity prices, the current
account surplus recorded a larger surplus in 2008, and thus far in 2009 has continued to
remain in surplus in the first quarter of 2009 as the decline in exports has been more than
offset by import compression1 following the steep cutbacks in production due to falling
global demand. Meanwhile, external debt declined further to 35.1 percent of Gross National
Income (GNI) as at end-March 2009, with only about a third of that short-term debt. The
international reserves of BNM, which at its peak reached the equivalent of over
US$125 billion in March 2008, has stabilized since early 2009 following a period of the
1

Intermediate imports for processing and subsequent exports account for about 70 percent of total exports

3
unwinding of portfolio capital flows due to the global deleveraging process. As at 30 June
2009, reserves stood at the equivalent of US$91.5 billion, sufficient to finance 8.5 months of
retained imports and was 3.8 times the short-term external debt.
9.
The Malaysian financial sector has remained resilient in the current environment,
which has allowed sustained growth in credit flows. With negligible exposure to troubled
assets overseas, the soundness of the banking system combined with a situation of ample
domestic liquidity has facilitated the transmission of fiscal and monetary policy. Targeted
credit guarantee schemes have also been introduced as a mechanism to sustain and enhance
access to credit for viable firms, particularly for the small and medium-enterprise segment, as
well as to encourage industrial upgrading. The stronger position of the banking system is due
to both large liquidity and capital buffers built up over the past decade, as well as
strengthened institutional capacity, risk management and governance standards, and
supporting infrastructure, reflecting the lessons learnt during the Asian crisis of 1997-1998.
In particular, bank regulation and supervision have generally been counter-cyclical in the
past decade by encouraging banks to raise capital and provide for loans in better times. As a
result, the risk-weighted capital ratio (RWCR) and core capital ratio has increased to
14.2 percent and 12.3 percent respectively as of May 2009, while loan quality remained
sound with the net non-performing loans (NPL) ratio unchanged at a low of 2.2 percent since
end-2008, despite the significant deceleration in economic growth seen so far. Nonetheless,
my authorities concur with the Staff that some amount of deterioration in credit quality will
naturally occur if the global recession is prolonged, and both the authorities and the banks
will remain vigilant and proactive in managing the risks.
Policy Discussions
Monetary Policy
10.
Our authorities welcome Staff’s assessment that monetary policy action has been
decisive and appropriate. Indeed the forward-looking assessment by BNM has proven well
founded thus far, as BNM was one of the few central banks that did not raise interest rates in
2008. This was further reinforced by the aggressive reduction in interest rates to historical
lows shortly after it was assessed that the global economy would take a turn for the worse in
late 2008. Measures were also undertaken to affect the translation from policy rate cuts to
reductions in retail rates in order to increase the monetary impact on households and
businesses. Undertaken in collaboration with the banking community, these measures
included an automatic reduction of installment payments for housing loans and reductions in
credit card rates. Learning from their experiences during the Asian crisis, banks in Malaysia
have been proactive as early as mid-2008 to work with viable borrowers to restructure loans
where needed to overcome temporary cash flow constraints. As also noted in the Staff
Report, these measures were balanced by other measures, including floors on some fixed
deposit rates and issuance of savings bonds to safeguard the real rate of return to depositors.
These measures are particularly important since Malaysia is a high savings society, with the

4
household sector being net lenders in the economy. At this stage, the authorities judge that
there is adequate monetary stimulus in the pipeline to support the economy going forward.
The average lending rate of commercial banks is now at a historic low of 5 percent. The
focus of efforts now is directed at sustaining access to credit.
Fiscal Policy
11.
Our authorities are fully in agreement with Staff that, in view of the higher fiscal
deficit levels following the implementation of the two stimulus packages, there is the need
for a return to a fiscal consolidation path in the medium-term. It is also agreed that there is
the need to reduce reliance on oil-related revenue. In fact, the commitment and urgency for
medium-term consolidation was communicated to Staff in meetings with the fiscal
authorities. The authorities had been consolidating since 2000 when the fiscal deficit peaked
at 5.5 percent of GDP, and by 2007, the deficit was successfully reduced to 3.2 percent of
GDP. These efforts, however, were disrupted in 2008 because of the difficult global
environment. The authorities are fully committed to undertake fiscal consolidation as soon as
the economy recovers and is on a firmer footing.
12.
We also concur with Staff that the immediate priorities -- given the severity of the
global downturn and Malaysia’s still manageable level of public debt and low level of
external indebtedness -- are to implement forceful fiscal measures to act in a countercyclical,
yet targeted fashion. The focus of the measures in the first stimulus package has thus been
on fast-acting small projects with high multiplier effects. To date, over 30 percent of that
package has been spent and some impact on the economy has emerged in the first quarter of
2009 as the construction sector was the only sector to register positive growth. Meanwhile,
the scope of the second stimulus package is broader, encompassing assistance to vulnerable
groups and measures to encourage structural reforms for Malaysia’s competitiveness. As
significant portions of both stimulus packages comprise capital spending, this means that the
impact on the fiscal balance will be unwound as they are completed.
13.
The priority to consolidate the fiscal position in the medium-term is being articulated
through a key thrust for long-term sustainability as part of the aforementioned New
Economic Model which the authorities are working on. They envisage, among others, a
broadening of revenue collection, review of subsidies and Government procurement,
accelerating privatisation, monetizing Government assets and increasing efficiency in public
spending. Measures such as a goods and services tax (GST) are ready to be implemented,
but an early timing for a rollout is judged to be counter-productive in the present downturn.
The bulk of the reduction in subsidies has already taken place, progressively undertaken
since June 2008, for both fuel and for others forms of subsidies. Nonetheless, the authorities
remain determined to further rationalize subsidies going forward to streamline the fiscal
position and enhance economic efficiency.

Financial Sector Developments
14.
Our authorities thank Staff for their assessment that the Malaysian financial sector has
faced the global crisis from a position of strength and has shown a degree of resilience in the
current global turmoil. This achievement has been due significantly to the reforms and
determined measures put in place over the past decade, building on the lessons forged in the
depths of the Asian crisis. As a result, the Malaysian financial sector has been significantly
transformed, with a well-capitalized banking system, relatively deep capital markets
including a vibrant bond market – the largest in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, a new
dimension to the financial system has taken shape as Malaysia has become an international
centre for Islamic finance.
15.
Regulatory and supervisory frameworks and practices have not only kept pace with
global practices, but in some cases have gone beyond, by in effect encouraging countercyclical capital requirements and loan provisioning. Over the past ten years, the introduction
of an extensive credit-scoring database, deposit insurance scheme, and systems to strengthen
risk management, including the adoption of Basle II’s standardized approach last year, have
added strength to the system. The sustained growth of the Islamic financial system, in which
a key tenet of Islamic finance ensures the grounding of financing activities to underlying
economic transactions, has further added stability to the system as was acknowledged by
Staff. The relatively strong balance sheets of households and corporates have also added
resilience to the financial sector, notwithstanding the effects of slowing growth. The
corporate sector, broadly speaking, may even be somewhat under-leveraged relative to
norms, thus explaining why profitability has not been unusually high, as Staff have noted2,
but this has added an additional degree of comfort in the present environment.
16.
Nonetheless, the authorities have maintained their vigilance and have been active in
managing risks in the financial system through preemptive measures, several of which were
noted in the Staff Report, including the extension of a blanket guarantee in October 2008 on
all domestic and foreign currency deposits till 2010 and ready access to foreign exchange
liquidity to banks for trade financing if needed. These measures have contributed to
preserving a highly liquid funding market and ensured the smooth functioning of the
financial intermediation process. Stress testing activities, which have been a staple since the
Asian crisis, have been enhanced further in the past two years, including through a workshop
conducted in collaboration with the Fund. BNM’s scenario-based stress tests focus on
implications on both solvency (credit and market risks) and liquidity positions of the banks.

2

Thus far, sectors that are more defensive in nature have generally displayed more resilient earnings e.g.
retailers, packaged F&B, tobacco and liquor manufacturers, rubber glove producers, gaming operators, oil and
gas support service providers, toll road concessionaires and the independent power producers.

6
17.
Notably, in a global environment where protectionist tendencies are increasing in
influence, the authorities have pressed ahead with the third and final stage of the 10-year
Financial Sector Master Plan that began in 2001 to further liberalize the financial sector to
foreign ownership and increase further Malaysia’s integration with the international financial
system. While foreign presence in the Malaysian financial sector is already significant,
accounting for approximately 25 percent of banking assets and including the presence of
major global banks, the authorities have assessed that the domestic financial institutions had
achieved a greater state of readiness to compete in an even more liberalized environment.
The liberalization measures included the issuance of 5 new commercial banking licenses
(including 2 for specialized institutions), a further 2 new Islamic licenses with paid up capital
of at least US$1 billion, and 2 new family takaful licenses. Foreign equity limits for Islamic
financial institutions were further raised to 70 percent for domestic Islamic banks that have
paid up capital of at least US$1 billion to strengthen Malaysia’s role as an Islamic financial
hub. Foreign equity limits for investment banks, insurance companies and takaful operators
were also increased to 70 percent. Significant operational flexibilities were also granted to
foreign-owned banks, including on branching policies, employment, and offshore-onshore
presence. In bringing the country to the next phase of development, the liberalization plan
aims to pursue opportunities that would bring net benefits and contribute to the development
of the Malaysian financial sector and the economy as a whole, while ensuring that overall
financial stability and soundness is preserved.
Exchange Rate Developments
18.
Since the transition of the exchange rate arrangement in July 2005 from a peg to a
managed float regime, the ringgit has generally been on a path of appreciation. By end-2006,
the ringgit had risen by 7 percent against the US dollar. In 2007, a further 7 percent
appreciation was recorded, together with relatively wide trading fluctuations in the exchange
rate. By April 2008, the ringgit had appreciated a further 6 percent against the dollar in less
than four months. Clearly at that point, with a cumulative appreciation of over 21 percent
against the US dollar in less than 3 years, the authorities had demonstrated that they are not
averse to sustained appreciation when the market trend and fundamentals call for it.
Following these developments, with the massive reversal of portfolio capital flows amidst the
global deleveraging associated with the escalation of the global financial crisis in the latter
part of 2008, reversal in the capital flows caused the currency to weaken. It is during this
period that the central bank undertook intervention to counter the degree of depreciation,
with the result that international reserves declined from a peak of about US$125 billion to
about US$90 billion by early-2009, an almost 30 percent decline in reserves. This episode
should lay to rest the notion that intervention has been anything less than two-sided, as Staff
also clearly acknowledge in their analytical box (p. 21), and that the broad objective of
exchange rate management for a small highly open economy like Malaysia has been to
mitigate extreme volatility in the exchange rate, and not to target any particular level of the
exchange rate. Our authorities would like to reiterate that for a small and open economy, an

7
orderly exchange rate market is important for achieving sustainable growth with price
stability.
19.
Our authorities take note of Staff’s view that “the ringgit in real effective terms
remains weaker than its equilibrium level, but Malaysia’s exchange rate policies are broadly
appropriate” (p. 24), which is clearly the case when viewed in the larger context of the
overall counter-cyclical policy mix.
20.
First, we continue to assert, as we often have in our constituency, that equilibrium
exchange rate estimates yielded by models cannot be taken as definitive, and even more so at
the current juncture when the global crisis has introduced a unusually high degree of
uncertainty in the assessment. At best, they can be used as part of an overall assessment
process that should also take into account other factors which cannot be readily incorporated
into such models. While Staff have noted that “a number of qualitative indicators suggest
that the undervaluation is not extreme” (p. 35), our Malaysian authorities are firm with the
view that there is limited evidence of undervaluation in the economy, given the fact that core
inflation has been low, there has been no asset price bubble, and intervention has been twosided.
21.
Secondly, while the current account surplus is sizeable, Malaysia is a commodity
producer. Over two-thirds of the current account surplus can be attributed to commodities
including oil. It is fundamentally inappropriate to apply the 3-model CGER estimations
when an economy is a significant producer of non-renewable resources. A Fund working
paper by Thomas, Kim and Aslam (2008)3 estimated that by applying an alternative
methodology for assessing the external balance in countries with large stocks of nonrenewable resources, the non-oil current account position for Malaysia was in fact in
equilibrium, as oil resources can be expected to be depleted in the future. Our authorities
would also welcome accelerated work on the commodity-based CGER approaches that we
understand is being undertaken at the Fund.
22.
Thirdly, going forward, the surplus is expected to decline dramatically, roughly
halving this year compared to the levels in 2008, reflecting both lower commodity prices and
the effects of the global recession, and would thus yield a much different level of equilibrium
exchange rate.
23.
Finally, other structural factors are also at play in widening the savings-investment
gap as noted in the Staff report, including demographics, social safety net constraints, and
relatively limited investment opportunities for expansion in the small domestic economy,
which as Staff have also pointed out, is corroborated by the large flow of outward direct
investment that already exceeded the flow of inward direct investment last year.

Structural Reforms
24.
Our authorities concur with Staff that further structural reforms are critical for
Malaysia to ensure sustained long-term growth, and have initiated work on new approaches
to development under the umbrella of the New Economic Model. The Model is envisaged to
be a holistic approach to accelerating Malaysia’s development by emphasizing private sector
participation, with the aim of fostering a high income, high productivity and innovationdriven economy. The consultative work on the Model has already started as part of the
process of drafting the latest five-year development plan, the 10th Malaysia Plan. Further
economic liberalization will be a key component of the Model and the 10th Malaysia Plan.
Indeed, since the beginning of the crisis, the authorities have announced a number of bold
steps to further open up the Malaysian economy. Recent key measures, some of which have
been noted by Staff include:
significant equity liberalization announced in June, including the removal of affirmative
action ownership targets for publicly listed companies, abolishment of requirements to
receive approval for most types of foreign investments, and increasing the limits on
foreign participation in capital market players;
ownership liberalization in 27 services sub-sectors announced in April 2009, together
with the significant liberalization in financial services as mentioned above. This
liberalization includes new growth areas with significant potential such as health and
social services, transport and computer-related services; and
commitment to free up product markets, especially for intermediate products such as
steel, which would reduce costs for businesses.
With these actions, and a commitment to further liberalization, the authorities have
demonstrated that crises need not inevitably lead to less openness. Indeed, the current crisis
can also be an opportune time to build domestic consensus for bold reforms.
Conclusion
25.
Our authorities have welcomed the input contained in the Staff Report and found the
consultations useful. They wish to note that with a recovery in global growth far from
certain, the challenges to achieving a sustained recovery and navigating a successful
transformation to a new development model remain large and significant. Like many other
small open economies around the world, Malaysia is still facing the brunt of the crisis and is
doing its utmost, in concert with the regional and global authorities, to respond effectively
and mitigate its severity. The good support of the international community, including the
expertise of the Fund, will remain appreciated.
