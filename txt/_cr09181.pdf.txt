EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The global economic downturn has led to a significant decline in tourism, which worsened the
balance of payments position and, together with lower foreign direct investment (FDI) and construction
activity, led to a sharp output slowdown in 2008. Growth is expected to decline further in 2009. Although
liquidity is tight, the banking system remains sound. However, insurance and investment linkages with the
troubled Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group are creating uncertainties and could pose risks for
the financial system. The fiscal position strengthened in 2008, and solid progress has been made toward
social and poverty reduction goals.
Request for support under the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF): The authorities are requesting the rapidaccess component of the ESF (SDR 3.735 million, 45 percent of quota) to help the economy adjust to the
tourism and FDI shock. The full amount would become available upon approval.
Discussions focused on the key policy issues:
•

Restore growth through competitiveness gains. The main challenges are to address: (i) the effects of
the adverse global environment through steps to improve competitiveness, enhance the resilience of the
financial sector, and develop contingency financing plans; and (ii) the limited air transportation links
through construction of a new international airport without jeopardizing debt sustainability. Managing
bridge financing needs for the airport in 2009–10 is likely to be a challenge in an environment of tight
liquidity, and if so, a more flexible construction timetable, to the extent technically feasible, could help
alleviate the possible financing bottleneck.

•

Ensure fiscal and debt sustainability. While recent income tax reform should provide timely support to
growth, there is a need to reform the tax incentive system. Staff welcomed the establishment of a Tax
Reform Commission, which aims to make recommendations on a comprehensive income tax legislation
that could broaden the tax base. Sustained fiscal consolidation would help provide space for the
government’s goal to raise social spending, and accommodate the construction of the airport without
compromising debt sustainability. Key to this end will be further civil service reforms, continued
improvement in the prioritization of capital spending, and additional pension reforms.

•

Reduce vulnerabilities: Improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbank institutions is
a high priority. Staff welcomed the authorities’ renewed participation in the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk
Insurance Facility, and other enhancements to disaster preparedness and response plans.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK1
1.
Following two years of brisk growth, some key macroeconomic indicators
deteriorated in 2008, as global growth slowed.

Real output growth is estimated to have fallen from 7 percent in 2007 to around
1 percent in 2008, far below potential (estimated at around 4¼ percent). The tourism

A staff team comprising Ms. Pattillo (Head), Mr. Dehesa, and Ms. Sun (all WHD) visited Kingstown during
February 2–12, 2009. The mission met with the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Dr. Ralph Gonsalves,
the Director General of the Ministry of Finance, other senior government officials, opposition parliamentarians
and political leaders, representatives of the financial and business sectors, farmers, trade unions and civil
society. Staff of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) also
participated. Messrs. Cashin (WHD) and O’Sullivan (OED) joined the mission for the final discussions, which
overlapped with the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) Regional Discussions.

without significantly increased risk premia, even though oversubscription has declined
markedly.
•

Inflation declined to 8.7 percent by end-2008 after peaking at 11.6 percent in
September. The inflation path reflects the trajectory of global oil and food prices and the
dominant weight of these items in the consumer price index. Although declining,
inflation still remains far higher than its long-term average of about 3 percent.

•

The external current account deficit remained high at 33⅔ percent of GDP in 2008.
Foreign exchange revenues declined in tandem with tourism arrivals owing to the global
downturn. However, overall imports as a percent of GDP also declined due to the
weakness in economic activity, offsetting the larger food and fuel import bill and
resulting in a modest improvement in the external account balance. The currency
appreciated by around 3 percent in real effective terms.3

•

Private sector credit growth slowed to 3 percent through end-2008, compared to
15 percent in 2007, reflecting lower demand from the household sector for personal loans
due to a drop in real disposable income as well as tighter lending terms and conditions.
Growth of monetary aggregates also decelerated sharply.

•

The central government’s finances continued to strengthen during 2008, and the
overall deficit was reduced to 1.7 percent of GDP. Larger grants, efforts at tax arrears
collection and one-off non-tax revenue were complemented by solid VAT performance to
attain a primary surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP, the first since 2002. The VAT, which was
introduced in May 2007, exceeded expectations from both the revenue and the
compliance perspectives, surpassing replaced taxes by about 0.6 percent of GDP,
notwithstanding the growth slowdown. Total government spending declined marginally
as lower capital expenditure made room for higher non-wage, non-interest current
expenditure. The wage bill remained constant as a percent of GDP despite back pay
linked to a reclassification of the salary scale and a modest wage increase. A
US$16 million bond placement with a 10 year maturity helped finance the deficit,
lowering domestic borrowing requirements.4

•

Social safety nets were expanded to cushion the impact of rising food and fuel
prices. Specific initiatives included reduced import tariffs on a number of basic food
items, larger cost of living support payments to persons enrolled in the public assistance

3

The REER exhibited high volatility in 2008 owing to U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate fluctuations as the U.S.
and the European Union account for about 60 percent of the weights used to compute the REER. Nominal
exchange rate changes moderated the increase in the REER from inflation differentials.

program, a subsidy on the electricity surcharge and increased minimum pension
payments, among others.
2.
The global economic downturn and financial crisis have significantly weakened
growth prospects for 2009. Declining tourism-related receipts and remittances will
adversely affect output growth and banking sector liquidity. Foreign direct investment (FDI),
which supports tourism infrastructure expansion, is also likely to slow. However,
construction of the international airport is expected to continue as planned and support
domestic activity during 2009–11, albeit at the risk of significantly raising the public debt
burden should envisaged grants and concessional financing not fully materialize.
3.
Strains from the fallout of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group
have created uncertainty in the local financial system, and the international financial
services sector has also suffered shocks. The troubled CL Financial Group has linkages to the
local economy, including through insurance subsidiaries.5 Regional leaders, chaired by the
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ Prime Minister, have moved quickly to coordinate regional
information sharing and response planning. The prompt action of the ECCB to coordinate a
consortium of local banks (including National Commercial Bank of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines) to manage the operations of the Bank of Antigua in neighboring Antigua and
Barbuda following the Stanford International Bank crisis helped reassure depositors in the
ECCU of the stability of the banking system. St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ International
Financial Services Authority (IFSA) appointed a receiver for Millennium Bank in March 2009,
immediately following an emergency court action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) against the alleged Ponzi scheme. According to the SEC complaint, the
bank and its parent company were part of a scheme that raised and misappropriated around
$US68 million from investors.6
4.
The outlook for 2009 is especially challenging.7 Real GDP growth is projected to be
close to zero,8 with significant downside risks arising from a sharper downturn in U.S. and
global growth. The external current account deficit is expected to decline to about 29 percent
of GDP in 2009, as imports are projected to fall by more than the decline in tourism receipts
(owing to the domestic growth slowdown, lower costs of imported fuel, and lower FDI with

Total exposure to the CL Financial Group is estimated at around EC$350 million, or 22 percent of GDP.

6

The authorities had revoked Millennium Bank’s license in 2003, but the bank gained reinstatement through a
court action. In March 2009 IFSA also placed Union Bank under controllership.

7

In April 2009, St. Vincent and the Grenadines joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the People of Our America
(ALBA), an organization aiming at regional economic integration including mutual economic aid. It is expected
to help St. Vincent and the Grenadines diversify its trade and economic cooperation linkages, including through
increased aid flows from Venezuela.

average growth rate) is considered a recession.

high import content). Inflation is expected to ease in line with the fall in oil and food prices
(Box 2).
5.
The fiscal balance for 2009 will be affected by the adverse economic
environment. Total revenue and grants are expected to decline by 2.6 percent of GDP owing
to the ongoing income tax reform (see below) and lower collection of VAT and import duties
as well as lower grants. Total expenditure is projected to decline slightly owing to lower
expenditure on goods and services, while the wage bill is projected to remain broadly
unchanged in percent of GDP.
6.
The external current account deficit, while still high, is projected to decline over
the medium term. Notwithstanding lower banana exports, the current account deficit is
projected to fall below 21 percent of GDP by 2014 supported by the gradual recovery of the
global economy. Subsequently, current account imbalances will decline further as
construction of new tourism infrastructure tapers off and facilitates the switch in composition
of tourist arrivals toward stay-over arrivals. Staff analysis indicates that medium-term current
account deficits are broadly in line with equilibrium levels (Box 3). FDI flows into tourism
investment projects have a very high import content, suggesting a smooth current account
adjustment when such inflows decline. Nevertheless, the high external current account
deficits pose risks that need to be carefully monitored—particularly in the current
challenging global financing environment—and accompanied by further efforts at fiscal
consolidation.
7.
The real exchange rate appears broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals. The real effective exchange rate has depreciated in recent years, largely
reflecting the decline in the U.S. dollar against the currencies of its major trading partners.
Staff analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate is close to its medium-term
equilibrium value (Box 3).9 Still, external competitiveness remains a challenge, as regional
tourism market shares have deteriorated in recent years, and the real exchange rate measured
relative to tourism competitor- or customer-based markets has appreciated (Figure 3).
Though the projected debt profile is consistent with continued stability of the regional
currency board arrangement, rising external debt ratios signal the need for sustained efforts at
fiscal consolidation (see the companion Debt Sustainability Analysis paper).10 On risks, in the
event of a prolonged stagnation of the tourism sector, further real depreciation (some of
which is expected as inflation moves gradually back to historical levels), and other nonprice
measures would be necessary to maintain competitiveness.
9

Following the CGER procedure, time series models linking the REER to measures of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ fundamentals (productivity differentials, terms of trade, government consumption and net foreign
assets) suggest that there is little evidence of overvaluation of the EC dollar. For additional details, see
“Assessing Exchange Rate Competitiveness in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,” by E. Pineda,
P. Cashin, and Y. Sun, IMF Working Paper WP/09/78.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external debt distress rating is moderate.

Box 1. The Economic Impact of the Tourism and FDI Shock
The adverse shock to tourism and FDI in 2008–09 has weakened economic activity in
St. Vincent and the Grenadines and heightened balance of payments vulnerabilities. The
recession in the main tourism-source countries—the U.S. and the United Kingdom—has
sharply reduced tourism arrivals.1 The contribution of tourism to real GDP growth turned
negative in 2008 and is projected to reduce GDP growth by about 1.6 percent in 2009. Many
FDI projects are on hold, reflecting investor’s financing difficulties. Net tourism receipts and
FDI are projected to fall by EC$41 million (2.9 percentage points of GDP) and EC$99 million
(6.5 percentage points of GDP) in 2009, respectively. In addition, the global slowdown is
expected to lower remittances and to reduce demand for St. Vincent and the Grenadines’
exports. Imports are lower, due to both exogenous factors: lower food and fuel prices and
lower FDI-related imports; and endogenous compression associated with weak economic
activity. The exogenous reduction in imports will not fully offset the declines in tourism
receipts and FDI (together with lower exports and private transfers), contributing to a decline
of EC$14.2 million in net international reserves and a financing gap of EC$14.9 million. There
are significant downside risks of a potentially larger negative shock to tourism and FDI.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 11
8.
The discussions focused on managing near-term risks and implementing policies
to enhance the economy’s growth potential, while ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability. The relatively high debt ratios allow little room for counter-cyclical fiscal
policy in response to the global growth slowdown. The authorities agreed that they have
limited policy options, and that enhancing competitiveness will help build a foundation for a
growth recovery. They felt, however, that a balance had to be sought between the fiscal and
debt sustainability objectives and policies to support employment and income growth.
A. Managing Risks in the Near Term
9.
There is a need to enhance the resilience of the financial system, and develop
contingency financing plans. Though the banking sector remains fundamentally sound,
further strengthening the regulation and supervision of nonbank institutions is a priority.
• The global financial crisis underscores the need for stronger prudential supervision
of asset quality, including assets held abroad by banks operating in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines. There is a significant risk that slowing economic growth and
remittances after a period of rapid credit expansion would lead to a deterioration in banks’
asset quality. The declining trend in provisioning, particularly in foreign banks, points to
the need for heightened vigilance. Staff supported the prompt liaison of the authorities
with the ECCB to continue to strengthen on-site inspection, examine cross-border
transactions, and prioritize higher frequency monitoring of commercial banks’ liquidity
positions. Staff welcomed the work of a regional task force, chaired by the St. Vincent
and the Grenadines’ authorities, which is developing response plans for the exposure to
an insurance subsidiary of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group.
• Improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbank institutions is a high
priority, particularly in light of the recent shocks in the region’s offshore and insurance
sectors. Building societies have recently been placed under the authority of a domestic
nonbank unit in the Ministry of Finance, which is also expected to begin regulating and
supervising credit unions by mid-2009. Staff encouraged the authorities to pass legislation
to establish a single regulatory unit (SRU) for all nonbank financial institutions, as other

11

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), a regional
currency board arrangement with a fixed peg of the EC dollar to the U.S. dollar. The discussions were
complemented by the 2009 ECCU Common Policies Discussions (IMF Country Report No. 09/175), the report
for which covers common regional issues.

9
ECCU jurisdictions are aiming to do during 2009.12 The authorities are considering this,
which would involve merging the operations of the regulators of the international
financial services and domestic nonbank sectors to achieve efficiencies and a systemwide perspective. Work underway to update the Insurance Act, the Money Transfer
Services Act, and the Cooperatives Act will deliver legislation consistent with
international best practices. The government prepared well for a Fund AML/CFT
assessment, which was carried out in February–March 2009, and found need for
strengthening AML/CFT supervision, including of the offshore and nonbanking sectors.13
• A deeper and more prolonged global downturn and financial crisis than currently
envisaged poses severe risks that warrant development of contingency plans for
buffer financing. The risks include sharper-than-envisaged declines in tourism receipts,
remittances and FDI, and difficulties in borrowing in regional capital markets. Such a
scenario would have serious consequences for growth and the fiscal position. Staff
encouraged the authorities to develop contingency plans for access to buffer financing
from international financial institutions—in addition to the resources requested through
the Fund’s Exogenous Shocks Facility.
B. Improving Competitiveness and Enhancing Sustainable Growth
10.
Addressing the adverse impact of the current global downturn requires steps to
improve competitiveness and growth potential.
•

Recent income tax reforms should provide timely support to growth in 2009. The
income tax reform implemented in 2008 appropriately rewards effort and enhances the
competitiveness of St. Vincent and the Grenadines as a business location. Personal and
corporate tax rates were lowered from 37.5 percent to 35 percent, and the 2009 Budget
speech announced a further reduction to 32.5 percent. Staff welcomed the establishment
of a Tax Reform Commission, which will make recommendations by end-2009 on new
comprehensive income tax legislation to broaden the tax base. The Commission will
prioritize revamping the tax incentive system, which staff strongly supported,
recommending replacing inefficient and discretionary corporate tax concessions with
investment credits, accelerated depreciation and loss carry-forward provisions.

11.
The forward-looking public sector wage policy of increasing compensation by
12 percent over three years (2009–11) avoids entrenching high inflation and contributes
12

The nonbank financial institutions sector is comprised of: (i) 6 offshore banks, 12 international insurance
companies, 36 mutual funds, 169 trusts and over 9000 international business companies; (ii) 23 domestic
insurance companies and 12 brokers, 14 pension funds, 4 money service business, 9 credit unions and a building
society. Financial and prudential information on some of these entities is largely unavailable. A SRU would
establish reporting requirements and enforce timely provision of data for offsite monitoring.

10
to improving external competitiveness. This wage policy will allow for a gradual recovery
in real incomes, help limit second-round effects from the 2008 spike in global food and fuel
prices and moderate demands for private sector wage increases. These factors would support
external competitiveness by containing domestic pressures on the real exchange rate.
12.
Raising medium-term growth potential remains a key challenge. Diversifying the
economy away from the banana sector to the tourism and services sectors requires better air
transport links, enhancing the investment and business environment and boosting
productivity. The authorities are working to ease infrastructure bottlenecks and institutional
rigidities, including through:
• Construction of a new international airport. Diversifying and developing the tourism
industry will require a new airport. However, staff has concerns regarding the financing
challenges of the project, especially in the current juncture, and its potential impact on
debt sustainability. The authorities’ goal is to have the new airport completed by 2011.
The total cost is now estimated at about EC$608 million (37½ percent of GDP). Identified
grant and concessional financing (mostly in-kind from Venezuela and Cuba) falls short of
total funding requirements by approximately EC$185 million (11½ percent GDP). The
planned contribution of government land sales to the financing gap is progressing, albeit
at a slow pace, and could now be even more difficult in light of the global slowdown and
financial crisis. There is also a risk that the global financial turmoil could delay some of
the expected grants and concessional financing.
• To mitigate the above risks, the mission recommended that the authorities (i) adopt a
comprehensive fiscal reform package to help cover the airport financing gap without
compromising debt sustainability (see below) (ii) implement, to the extent technically
feasible, a more flexible construction timetable for the airport (which may also be more
realistic) to help minimize domestic bridge financing needs and avoid crowding out the
private sector; and (iii) continue efforts on seeking additional grant and concessional
financing. The authorities noted that continued fiscal reforms remain on the agenda, and
these could reduce recourse to commercial borrowing. However, they expressed their
intention to complete the project as scheduled to provide the foundation for tourism-led
growth, and noted that any commercial borrowing would be of a bridge finance nature, as
they remained optimistic about the sale of state-owned land.
• Reducing costs of doing business. Staff welcomed efforts to modernize customs
procedures to reduce the time and cost of importing, which has been identified as a key
impediment to private business. The authorities are simultaneously modernizing port
operations which they regard as a key to fostering competitiveness. Shortening the time
for business registration through developing a one-stop process is also underway.
However, the costs of registering property remain high, and procedures for closing a
business are cumbersome, hindering investment. The authorities are addressing these
areas through development of a land registry and a new bankruptcy law.

11
C. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
13.
The government has made solid progress in fiscal consolidation in recent years
but faces a challenging global environment. The adverse global conditions, and the
resulting slowdown in output growth have put downward pressure on revenues. Continuation
of current policies would imply relatively considerable overall deficits in the medium term
and, when potential borrowing for the new airport is included, lead to a significant increase
in public sector debt. To avoid such an outcome, staff recommended the prompt adoption of
comprehensive fiscal reforms to generate sustained primary surpluses over the medium term.
14.
The 2009 Budget envisages an increase in the fiscal deficit. The budget
communication prudently recognizes that the high debt-to-GDP ratio and tight global
financing conditions constrain fiscal policy options. The net impact of discretionary fiscal
measures is small; while the reduction in personal and corporate tax rates is expected to
reduce revenues by around 0.4 percent of GDP, current expenditure (excluding utilities) is
expected to decline by around 0.2 percent of GDP from 2008, including savings from
containment of the public sector wage bill. However, even after adjusting official budget
estimates with historical rates of capital spending and materialization of budgeted grants, the
primary deficit and the overall fiscal deficit would increase to 0.9 percent and 3.8 percent of
GDP, respectively, raising central government debt to about 56½ percent of GDP in 2009.
The authorities noted that attaining this fiscal target would require keeping current
expenditure some 2 percentage points of GDP below budgeted levels (Box 4).
15.
Debt dynamics are unfavorable in the
baseline scenario. Under current policies, which
would result in a small primary deficit in the
medium term, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
rise to nearly 87 percent by 2014 and unlikely to
reach the 60 percent mark by 2020 (the ECCB’s
target for the region). Expected borrowing for the
new international airport is the main reason for this
debt profile. In a worst-case scenario, where the
expected grants and concessional financing do not
materialize, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach
101 percent by 2014.

• Even if all the concessional financing
materializes, significant bridge financing from
domestic sources would be needed in the next
few years, which will increase considerably the

projected modest growth in bank deposits, banks

12
may have to reduce their net foreign assets to generate the bridge financing necessary for
the airport.
16.
The government’s welcome progress on fiscal reforms bodes well for sustained
fiscal consolidation. The mission recommended a set of fiscal measures to increase the
primary surplus to about 2.6 percent of GDP over the medium term, from a projected deficit
of 0.9 percent in 2009. On the revenue side, further tax policy and administrative reforms are
required to continue broadening the tax base, following the successful introduction of the
VAT and the planned introduction of a market-based property tax in mid-2011.14 In addition,
the ongoing income tax reform would need to go hand-in-hand with revamping the tax
incentive system to phase out discretionary concessions. Staff looks forward to the new Tax
Reform Commission’s recommendations on these areas. On the expenditure side, key
measures include deepening the civil service reform, and continued improvement in
prioritization of capital spending. During the current downturn, staff supported well-targeted
transfers to mitigate hardships faced by vulnerable groups, but emphasized that the public
sector should not become “the employer of last resort.”
17.

14

Other measures that would support medium-term fiscal consolidation include:
•

Customs reform. The mission supported a continued timely implementation
of the customs reform plan, including the adoption of risk management
practices and a post-clearance audit program, continued upgrade of
information technology, client services and public information, and
improvements in efficiency, especially in processing time.

•

Civil service reform. The recent job reclassification exercise—the first in the
ECCU—is a useful starting point for a wider reform to streamline pay and
career structures, provide performance incentives, better match qualifications
to job assignments, and improve the delivery of public services.

•

Medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). A MTEF would improve
the quality of the budget process, provide greater predictability to government
expenditure, and contribute to internalize the recurrent cost implications of
capital investment. The authorities are exploring CARTAC technical
assistance for public financial management reforms including MTEF
development.

•

Maintain automatic fuel pricing mechanism. The greater frequency of
domestic fuel price adjustments in 2008 has increased the pass-through of

licensing policies, the structure of trade taxes will have to be revisited and the revenue implication of these

13
international price changes, including with the adoption in August 2008 of a
three-month rolling average pricing rule to smooth price fluctuations, which
the staff welcomed. On PetroCaribe, the government needs to ensure timely
reporting from VINLEC, the state electricity company, on the resources
generated by the concessional financing from Venezuela.
18.
The fiscal consolidation program outlined
above would allow financing the new airport
without compromising debt sustainability, if
promised grants, concessional financing and land
sales materialize.15 Under the active scenario of
intensified fiscal reforms, public debt would rise
temporarily and then decline to around 69½ percent
of GDP by 2014. The 60 percent debt-to-GDP target
would be reached in 2017, ahead of the 2020 target
date for the ECCU region.

system, by resisting strong pressures for further
exemptions and concessions, which the staff welcomed. Staff recommended the
strengthening of audit, collections enforcement and information technology capabilities to
minimize the risk of an increase in VAT non-compliance, and the absorption of the VAT unit
into mainstream tax operations to ensure efficiency and coordination of tax administration.
The authorities welcomed continued CARTAC and Fund technical assistance in these areas.

20.
Meeting the needs of vulnerable groups more efficiently will help the
government continue its solid efforts at pursuing social and poverty reduction goals.
Staff welcomed the forthcoming poverty assessment report due in the first half of 2009,
which is expected to demonstrate substantial progress in poverty reduction, particularly in
tackling extreme poverty. The report and the planned poverty reduction action plan could be
used to develop a well-targeted social protection scheme. This could help strengthen the
impact of social programs, including the public assistance program, the children against
poverty, the rural development facility, home-help-for the elderly and the school feeding
programs.
15

As noted, however, there are substantial risks associated with the financing strategy for the new airport.

D. Reducing Vulnerabilities
21.
The uncertainties associated with the financing strategy for the new airport pose
risks to the sustainability of public debt. If there were significant delays in the expected
grants and concessional financing or in the land sales, it would be prudent to extend the
construction timetable for the airport to the extent technically feasible to avoid a major
increase in public debt.
22.
Fiscal risks associated with the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) also need to be
addressed. Staff welcomed the increase in NIS contribution rates from 6 to 8 percent in
January 2008 to help place the pension scheme on a sustainable footing. Nonetheless,
contribution rates remain low relative to international standards and to the large and growing
financing requirements of the pay-as-you-go pension system. Staff advised the early
implementation of a reform plan (based on the findings of the Seventh Actuarial Review and
the Fund technical assistance report) which would include further increases to the
contribution rate, increases to the retirement age, and reductions to the average replacement
rate. Staff encouraged the rationalization of the public pension system by integrating it with
the NIS.
23.
Resolving the difficulties in the insurance sector caused by the CL Financial
Group failure and subsequent intervention will be a challenge. The authorities have
determined exposure to the subsidiaries CLICO Life Insurance and British American
Insurance. The national and regional authorities are taking an appropriate regional approach

15
to assessing the liquidity and solvency positions of the companies, and to developing a
resolution plan that will contribute to maintaining confidence in the financial system.16
However, the region’s limited fiscal space and high debt burdens will most likely influence
the choice of resolution option.
24.
Natural disasters are a perennial threat to sustained growth. Supported by
International Development Agency (IDA) credits to pay insurance premia, St. Vincent and
the Grenadines renewed its participation in the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance
Facility in June 2008. The mission welcomed the prudent development of further disaster
contingency response plans, including through public safety programs.
25.
The European Union (EU) has committed funds to ameliorate the social impact
of the secular decline of the banana sector, but disbursements have been slow. The
authorities’ efforts to speed disbursements of EU commitments have not been successful and
they are requesting the EU to transform all commitments into budgetary support, which staff
supported.
E. Measures to Ameliorate the Shock to Tourism
26.
The broad policy framework discussed above would help address the tourism
shock through fiscal and structural policies to maintain competitiveness and support
the restoration of growth. Other measures being implemented to mitigate the impact of the
tourism shock on employment and growth and the balance of payments, with negligible
expected fiscal impact, include the following:
•

Special incentives for the tourism sector,17 including a reduction in corporate income tax
rates from 30 percent to 20 percent, and lower electricity charges by the state electricity
company. Staff agreed on the need to ensure that the incentives are time-bound, and are
linked to progress on enhancing efficiency in the tourism sector.

•

LIAT airline’s flight schedule was restructured to ease air travel;18 a Tourism Authority
was established to provide greater focus to marketing efforts; and the government
coordinated with hoteliers to develop special packages for visitors.

16

In April 2009 Ministers of Finance and central banks of the ECCU, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados
announced that a US$80 million Liquidity Support Fund will be established, designed to support the liquidity
position of British American Insurance operations in the ECCU.
17

A January 2009 communiqué of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States suggested that regional
governments use temporary incentives to help the tourism industry weather the global slowdown.
18

LIAT is an airline owned by a consortium of regional governments, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

16
III. REQUEST FOR AN ESF AND CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND
27.
Fund support under the rapid-access component of the ESF would contribute to
alleviate the financing burden of the shock. A disbursement of SDR 3.735 million
(45 percent of quota) from the ESF would close the external financing gap in 2009, assist the
authorities to adjust to the tourism and FDI shock, and could help catalyze donor budget
support.
28.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has adequate capacity to repay the Fund
(Table 10). St. Vincent and the Grenadines has no outstanding credit from the Fund and
future repayments to the Fund would be negligible in relation to exports of goods and
services (on average 0.2 percent of exports of goods and services over the 2014-19 period).
The ESF disbursement would not materially worsen the debt profile. A safeguards
assessment of the ECCB was conducted in 2007 and most of the recommendations of the
assessment have been implemented.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Following two years of record-high growth St. Vincent and the Grenadines has
been impacted severely by the global slowdown. Economic growth is estimated to have
fallen to around 1 percent in 2008, due to sharply weakened activities in the tourism and
agriculture sectors, and is projected to decline further in 2009. The global crisis also has
affected the balance of payments through declines in tourism receipts and FDI. Restoring
sustainable growth will be a challenge requiring continued reforms to improve
competitiveness, enhance the business and investment climate, and heighten the efficiency of
government spending. The new airport should also raise medium-term growth potential.
30.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for the rapid-access component of the
ESF. Tight global liquidity conditions and a sharp output slowdown make it difficult to close
external and fiscal financing gaps without additional external assistance. The authorities have
appropriately implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the external shock, including
time-bound special incentives for the tourism sector, and are committed to policies to
enhance competitiveness and support a growth recovery.
31.
Prudent management is needed to move forward with the international airport
project while also putting debt on a solid downward path. While construction of a new
airport is necessary to further develop the tourism industry, it needs to be accompanied by
sustained fiscal consolidation and timely availability of concessional financing to avoid
jeopardizing debt sustainability. Staff encourages the authorities to minimize the need to
undertake bridge domestic financing on commercial terms in 2009, including by continuing
efforts to mobilize grant and concessional resources and being flexible with the construction
timetable, to the extent technically feasible.

17
32.
Fiscal measures should be supportive of external competitiveness. The adjustment
needed to absorb the adverse shock should also be useful to address long standing challenges.
Staff welcomed reforms aimed at further reducing corporate tax rates and plans for
broadening of its base, and the prudent public sector wage policy. Sustained fiscal
consolidation will also increase the fiscal room to address poverty alleviation and social
needs.
33.
Building on the recent progress made on tax policy and tax administration, a
next phase of tax reforms is welcome. The authorities’ commitment to maintaining the
integrity and stability of the VAT supports a strong and stable source of revenue; to improve
the administration of this tax and minimize the risk of a deterioration in compliance, staff
recommends strengthening of audit and collections. Revamping the tax incentive system
would allow for further reductions in the corporate income tax, and introduction of a
market-based property tax will provide another revenue source.
34.
Further reforms to the social security system are necessary. The recent increase in
contribution rates is a positive initial step that needs to be supplemented by additional
parametric reforms. Staff also encourages the authorities to rationalize the public pension
system by transforming it into a complement to the NIS.
35.
Improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbanks is a high
priority. Staff welcomes the steps underway to improve the framework for building and loan
societies and credit unions. Establishment of a single regulatory unit for domestic nonbanks
and the international financial services sector would create efficiencies and allow a systemwide perspective. Improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for the insurance
sector has gained added urgency following the financial meltdown of the Trinidad and
Tobago-based CL Financial Group.
36.
Data provision has some shortcomings in terms of coverage and timeliness, but
is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular, improvements are needed in national
accounts (tourism and agriculture), fiscal data for public enterprises, fiscal financing, and
labor statistics.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

18

Box 2. The Impact of VAT and Global Commodity Prices on CPI Inflation
Inflation increased significantly since the end of 2006. During 2001–06 the CPI rose at
an annual (geometric) average rate of about 2.4 percent. By contrast, 12-month inflation
exceeded 8 percent in December 2007 and reached a peak of 12 percent in September 2008,
before it started falling (to 8.7 percent by December 2008). While real GDP growth in
excess of potential played a role in increasing price pressures in 2007–08, ‘one-off’ factors
were the main contributors.
Introduction of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) had a one-off effect on the price level,
contributing to the increase in measured inflation for 2007. The VAT was introduced in
May 2007 with a rate of 15 percent for goods and services and 10 percent for tourist
accommodation. A statistical decomposition of the movements in inflation into its long- and
short-run components identifies a spike in monthly inflation for April 2007 of approximately
3.7 percent (or 4½ times the standard deviation of inflation relative to its long-run average).
This result suggests that the VAT was anticipated and resulted in an increase in prices about
a month before the official commencement date, and that the inflationary impact tapered off
rather quickly.
Statistically significant spikes were detected in most components of the CPI. These
spikes account for nearly 95 percent of the total CPI basket. Interestingly, there is no
evidence of multiple spikes in any CPI category during 2007, confirming that the VAT had
the expected one-off “step” effect on the general price level. The fact that inflation was only
8 percent relative to its annual average of 3 percent reflects the large weight on the partially
exempt food component (53 percent).

Percentage

The increase in global fuel and food prices during 2008 was the main factor behind the
spike in inflation in 2008. A standard decomposition analysis of the movements in the CPI
shows that the food, fuel and light, and transportation categories together accounted for
approximately 97 percent

Box 3. Assessment of External Stability
In 2007, the external current account
deficit of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
deteriorated by more than 10 percentage
points of GDP, owing to lower receipts
from tourism-related services, and higher
imports. Total imports represent over
50 percent of GDP; food and fuel items
account for 40 percent of the total, while
FDI and tourism-related imports account for
50 percent.

imbalance. Adjusting for these elements,
the current account deficit for 2007 is estimated at around 10 percent of GDP. This deficit is
projected to fall to around 3.9 percent by 2014, in line with an expected decline in commodity
prices, FDI and grants.
The medium-term equilibrium current account is in line with estimates derived for
tourism-based economies. Using either (i) a CARICOM-only sample or (ii) an extended
sample of tourism-dependent countries (see IMF Working Paper WP/09/78), the equilibrium
current account deficit (or current account ‘norm’) for St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
estimated at around 20 percent of GDP. This suggests that the equilibrium exchange rate is
statistically aligned with its medium-term fundamentals.
A further widening of the
current account deficit
remains a key risk. The
construction of the new
international airport, for
example, is projected to cost
around 37½ percent of 2008
GDP, and will involve a
significant increase in
construction-related imports
during 2009–2011. It will be
important to ensure that the
financing of the project does
not turn a transitory
departure from the current
account equilibrium into a
disorderly external adjustment.

Box 4. The 2009 Budget
The budget introduced in December 2008 recognizes the effects of the global financial
turmoil. The central themes revolve around macro-economic stability, sharpened business
competitiveness, and socio-economic progress. Priorities include: (i) investment in education,
(ii) targeted social programs, (iii) further reductions in corporate and personal taxes,
(iv) prioritization of public sector investment in infrastructure, and (v) mobilization of private
investment including through regulatory reform.
As in previous years, the 2009 Budget communication includes an ambitious capital
expenditure program partly financed by expected grants. If fully implemented, the budget
will worsen the fiscal deficit and increase public debt to nearly 60 percent of GDP. However,
taking into account the historical rates of capital spending implementation and materialization
of grants, as well as financing constraints, the staff’s baseline scenario projects that the
primary deficit and the overall fiscal deficit will widen to 0.9 percent and 3.8 percent of GDP,
respectively, increasing the government debt to about 56½ percent of GDP.
Budgeted current spending would increase the overall fiscal balance. Relative to the
2008 outturn, the wage bill increases by 0.9 percent of GDP while spending on transfers and
goods and services rise by about 1.3 percent of GDP. In the staff’s view, there is room to
reduce current spending in line with the thrust of the Budget communication that emphasizes
public service reform and a more focused public assistance guided by the Country Poverty
Assessment that is underway and is consistent with the strong efforts observed in the last few
years to keep spending under control.
To bolster business competitiveness and reward effort the budget announces further
reductions in income tax rates. Continuing with the income tax reform introduced in 2008,
both the standard rate of company tax and the top marginal rate of the personal income tax are
projected to decline from 35 percent to 32.5 percent while the threshold for the personal
income tax will be raised. The estimated annual tax forgone amounts to about ½ percent of
GDP.

Annex I. Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative Fiscal Scenarios
The risk of current fiscal policies leading to an unsustainable level of public debt is
high, given the increasing pressure for higher capital and social spending. In the absence
of prioritization of expenditures, notably in capital spending, and a significant increase in
revenues, current debt dynamics remain unfavorable.
Two scenarios are considered—baseline and active. Under the baseline, the debt stock and
debt servicing costs continue to rise; under the active scenario, the stock of debt declines
gradually over the medium term. Under both scenarios, the airport is expected to be
completed by 2011.
Baseline Scenario. The authorities continue current expansionary policies with overall
deficits that are financed with commercial borrowing and some grants from nontraditional
donors, such as Venezuela, Cuba, Taiwan Province of China. Financing is assumed to
continue to be available. The current financing gap for the international airport—estimated at
around EC$185 million net of expected land sales—is assumed to be borrowed by the public
sector. In the medium term, growth remains lower (by about ½ percent) than under the active
scenario. On the revenue side, the maximum corporate income tax rate is reduced to
30 percent by 2010, reducing corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP by 0.5 percentage
points. On the expenditure side, after 2008 the wage bill as a share of GDP remains constant,
while capital expenditures remain at around 7½ percent of GDP. Overall, the primary balance
remains in deficit throughout the forecast horizon, and public debt reaches about 86¾ percent
of GDP by 2014.
Active Scenario. Over the medium term, revenue measures would focus on: (i) substituting
tax holidays and exemptions with investment credits, accelerated depreciation, and
improving loss carry-forward provisions (conservatively expected to yield, as a group,
1.9 percent of GDP), and (ii) efficiency gains in customs collections, estimated to yield
½ percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, to create room for planned additional social
spending, a civil service reform yields cost savings of 0.4 percent of GDP. Reforms to the
public service pension system are adopted gradually. Capital expenditure is reduced by the
elimination or postponement of low-priority projects, although it would remain above its
long-run average of 6.6 percent of GDP. With the impetus from public sector capital projects
and greater activity in the private sector, the underlying growth rate is expected to accelerate
to about 4⅔ percent over the medium term. Under this scenario, public debt would decline to
about 69½ percent of GDP by 2014.

Annex II. Summary of Appendices
Fund Relations
St. Vincent and the Grenadines does not have outstanding obligations to the Fund.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB),
which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The
common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the
rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 4, 2008
(IMF Country Report No. 09/118). Several missions from the Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Centre (CARTAC), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), the Legal Department
(LEG) have visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of 2006 to assist the
authorities. An updated safeguards assessment of the ECCB was undertaken in July 2007 and
did not note any new significant vulnerabilities.
Relations with the World Bank Group19
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for FY 2006–09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the
sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social
inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. There are four active World Bank
projects in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for a net commitment of approximately
US$14.44 million: OECS Catastrophe Insurance Project, Telecommunications &
ICT Development Project, Education Reform Project, and The HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Program.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank20
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has continued to receive financing from the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) mostly for infrastructure and human resource development. As of
February 28, 2009, CDB has approved loans totaling US$168 million, of which
US$26 million are undisbursed.

Statistical Issues
St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). While in areas central to surveillance—notably central government
accounts, indicators of the financial sector and external sector accounts—the data are
adequate for surveillance purposes, information on the rest of the public sector and nonbank
financial intermediaries is limited. Major improvements are needed to facilitate effective
surveillance, particularly in the coverage of national accounts (especially the tourism sector
and related services), and on data used to monitor labor markets.

Attachment. Letter of Intent

April 30, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The global economic downturn and financial crisis is exerting severe external pressures on the
economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The global downturn has led to large declines in
tourism receipts and foreign direct investment, with a severe adverse impact on our balance of
payments position and economic activity. Following two years of record-high growth, our
preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP growth in St. Vincent and the Grenadines could stall in
2009 following a serious slowdown in 2008. The shock, will also weaken our fiscal position,
threatening to undermine our recent progress toward fiscal consolidation.
The recession in our main tourism-source countries (the U.S. and the United Kingdom) has sharply
reduced tourism arrivals to St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Net foreign exchange receipts from
tourism declined by around US$16.6 million in 2008 (4.3 percentage points of GDP), which
contributed to the decline of US$3.3 million in our net international reserves. Tourism receipts are
projected to decline further in 2009 as the global environment worsens, taking the cumulative
decline in 2008–09 to US$31.8 million (7.2 percentage points of GDP). FDI, a traditionally stable
source of financing for our current account deficit, is also projected to decline by close to
7.9 percentage points of GDP in 2008-09.
Our government is committed to a framework that will help address the shock to tourism and FDI
through fiscal and structural policies to maintain competitiveness and support a growth recovery. As
outlined in my 2009 Budget speech, sharpened competitiveness, and continuing socio-economic
progress are the priorities in this period of international economic uncertainty. To support
competitiveness, we are enhancing the efficiency and technological capacity of customs and port
operations, maintaining a prudent public sector wage policy that will contribute to containing
inflation, and reducing corporate tax rates. The construction of a new international airport, and our
focus on improving the business environment, will help provide the foundation for growth of a
diversified tourism and service sector based economy.

43

We are implementing several specific measures to mitigate the impact of the tourism shock on
employment and growth and the balance of payments, including: (i) special time-bound incentives
for the tourism sector, namely a reduction in corporate income tax rates from 30 percent from
20 percent, and lower electricity charges by the state electricity company; (ii) working with the
regional airline on improved flight schedules, establishing a Tourism Authority to strengthen
marketing, and coordinating with hoteliers to develop special packages for visitors.
In light of the above, the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines requests a stand-alone
disbursement equivalent to SDR 3.74 million (45 percent of quota) under the Rapid-Access
Component of the Fund’s Exogenous Shocks Facility. The disbursement will help alleviate the
financing burden stemming from the shock to tourism and FDI, which will contribute to
maintaining confidence in our external position.
The government will continue to cooperate with the Fund in an effort to strengthen St. Vincent and
the Grenadines’ balance of payments situation and maintain economic stability. The government
does not intend to impose or intensify restrictions on trade or on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Sincerely yours,

_______/s/_____________

Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per
U.S. dollar. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. St. Vincent and the Grenadines maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfer for current international transactions.
VIII. Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a
participating government, is subject to a full safeguards assessment under a four-year cycle.
The most recent assessment was completed in July 2007, and concluded that the ECCB
continues to have appropriate control mechanisms in place, which have strengthened since
the first safeguards assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management places emphasis on
good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the bank’s transparency and
accountability since the last assessment, including the publications of financial statements
that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made some
recommendations to sustain the ECCB’s safeguards framework going forward.
IX. Last Article IV Consultation: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is currently on the
12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
February 4, 2008; the relevant documents are IMF Country Report No. 09/118.

3
X. Technical Assistance (January 2006– ): Several missions from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), and the
Legal Department (LEG) have visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of
2006 to assist the authorities.
In the area of public finance, CARTAC/LEG assisted with the introduction of the VAT and
excise taxes at all different stages. CARTAC also assisted to monitor the central
government’s fiscal performance relative to its annual targets presented in the budget.
CARTAC has provided technical assistance in statistics to develop export-import prices,
national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. CARTAC has also provided technical
assistance in the areas of collection enforcement and projections of public finance and GDP.
On the financial front CARTAC provided technical assistance to review and upgrade the
International Insurance Act, and to develop regulations for Credit Unions. CARTAC also
provided technical assistance in conducting off-site and on-site examinations on banks in
international financial services industry. FAD provided technical assistance in improving tax
administration, including reform and modernization of both inland revenue and customs and
excise tax. FAD also provided advice on selected tax policy issues.

Appendix II. St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Relations with the World Bank Group
(as at March 6, 2009)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY06–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS) countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities
will focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the recommendations of
the recently completed growth and competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA
support would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for interventions to
support the two main pillars. An indicative Base Case lending scenario consists of about
US$51.3 million in IDA resources for the four OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada,
St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). This amount includes the estimated IDA
country allocations for each of the four countries during FY06–09, and an IDA Regional
allocation of US$15.2 million for two regional projects: US$12 million for Catastrophe Risk
Insurance and US$3.2 million for Infrastructure and Utilities Reform.
I. PROJECTS
There are four active World Bank projects in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for a net
commitment of approximately US$14.44 million of which US$5.92 million has been
disbursed.
The OECS Catastrophe Insurance Project was approved in March 2007 for
US$0.7 million. The objective of the project is to reduce the participating OECS
governments' financial vulnerability to natural disasters through insurance coverage against
earthquakes and hurricanes. This will be achieved through the establishment of the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the financing of catastrophe insurance
coverage from the Facility. The project will include the following two components:
(a) payment of entrance fee; and (b) payment of annual insurance premium for the first three
years. The objective of the first component is to assist the participating OECS countries to
join the CCRIF through the financing of the entrance fee. This fee is equal to the first year’s
insurance premium. The aim of the second component is to assist the participating OECS
countries to purchase the catastrophe insurance coverage offered by the CCRIF during the
first three years.

5
The Telecommunications & ICT Development Project, approved in September 2005, aims
at improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve
socioeconomic development in the OECS. The project has the following four components:
Component (1) will strengthen the national and regional regulatory frameworks and promote
additional competition in the telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity
building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National
Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) by providing them with assistances
to revise the regional and national sector legislation, and develop a modem interconnection
regime. Component (2) will review current universal access policy, create related guidelines,
and provide financial support to establish a Universal Service Fund (USF).
Component (3)will improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through
utilization of broadband infrastructure. Component (4) will finance management and
administration of the overall project. The project will finance related technical assistance by
providing complementary resources.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Education Reform Project was approved in
June 2004 for US$6.2 million. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital
which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of the economy and more sustainable
growth. This objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary
education; (ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct
interventions at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning; and
(iii) strengthening management of the education sector and governance of schools.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, which was approved in July 2002, is
funded under the Multi-Country Adaptable Program Loan for the Caribbean Region, with the
following objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the
morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for
persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational
and institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term.
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank’s program in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is further supported by a
comprehensive series of completed, ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities
including the following: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth”—OECS growth and
competitiveness study (2005); An OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a
Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); and a regional study on Crime, Violence, and
Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007); an OECS Private
Sector Financing Study (2008); the OECS Tourism Backward Linkages Study (2008); the
report “Caribbean—Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth,
Job Creation and Poverty Reduction” (2008); a CARICOM study on Managing Nurse
Migration (ongoing) and a preparatory study aimed at developing a Caribbean-wide Regional
Energy Strategy (ongoing).

APPENDIX IV. ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 13, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Statistical databases remain weak in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness.
While in areas central to surveillance—notably central government accounts, indicators of the
financial sector and external sector accounts—the data are adequate for surveillance purposes,
information on the rest of the public sector and nonbank financial intermediaries is limited. Major
improvements are needed to facilitate effective surveillance, particularly in the coverage of
national accounts (especially the tourism sector and related services), and on data used to monitor
labor markets. Efforts to address the weaknesses in the statistical base have been hampered by
low response rates to surveys (less than 50 percent) and high turnover of staff.
National Accounts: GDP by industry is provided with a one-year lag, with inadequate coverage
of economic activity in the informal sector. There is a need to upgrade national accounting
methodology from the 1968 System of National Accounts to the 1993 System of National
Accounts. In addition, data on GDP broken down by type of expenditure are not available at
constant prices, while data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross
capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. CARTAC is
now finalizing a project for improving the national accounts through the development of Supply
and Use tables. Data generated will be used to revise and rebase the GDP series. In October 2007
CARTAC also launched a project for strengthening tourism statistics in the OECS, including
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project covers the core tourism datasets relating to visitor
arrivals, visitor expenditure, tourist accommodation and statistics for other key tourism-related
enterprises. The project will also seek to standardize and harmonize tourism concepts, definitions
and classification schemes across these countries.
Price statistics: CPI data are reported regularly with a one-month lag. CARTAC, as part of the
Fund-assisted program on Constructing Weights for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index in
the ECCU, has assisted in linking the 1981-based to the 2001-based CPI series. The Statistical
Office is currently undertaking a combined Country Poverty Assessment and Household
Budgetary Survey.
Government finance statistics: Due to delays in reporting capital expenditures by some
ministries, quarterly revenue and expenditure data for the central government are provided to the
Fund with some lag. Discrepancies exist between the fiscal and monetary accounts, between
above and below the line for budget data, and between financing and debt data. Although
domestic debt figures are now available following implementation of the Commonwealth
Secretariat—Debt Recording and Management System, the domestic debt amortization figures
are incomplete. The financial reports of public enterprises are not timely, with about a two-year
lag.

10

Monetary statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis and reported
regularly to the Fund. There is a need to improve the institutional coverage that currently only
comprises the ECCB and commercial banks. Full implementation of recommendations made by
the 2003 and 2005 monetary and financial statistics missions should ensure consistency with
international best practice.
While noting some recent improvements, the 2007 data ROSC mission identified the following
main shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics: (i) the methodological soundness of
monetary statistics can be improved by adopting internationally accepted concepts and
definitions, expanding institutional coverage, and revising the classifications of financial
instruments and the basis for recording; (ii) transparency can be improved, for example, by
releasing monetary data to all users at the same time and strengthening the validation of the
disseminated data; (iii) the timeliness of the dissemination of data on broad money and credit
aggregates can be improved to meet best international practices; and (iv) the access to officially
disseminated data and metadata can be improved.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments estimates are compiled on an annual basis by the
national statistical office, in collaboration with the ECCB. Quarterly estimates and the
international investment position statement are not compiled. The estimates lack sufficient detail
due to the unavailability of source data, and the statistical techniques used to estimates some
components are weak. In particular, no estimates are available on transportation services by type
or mode of transport and of travel by purpose. Further, a breakdown of portfolio and other
investment by instrument or sector is not available. There is a need to compile quarterly balance
of payments estimates and the annual international investment position statement; however,
developing these new statistics will have to be undertaken in conjunction with the ECCB, which
coordinates the compilation of the external sector statistics for all its member countries.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participates in the General Data Dissemination
System since September 2000.

The 2007 regional data ROSC on monetary
statistics provides an assessment of the
ECCB’s monetary statistics.

No data ROSC is available for other sectors.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
The International Financial Statistics page includes data on exchange rates, international
liquidity, monetary statistics, prices, balance of payments, national accounts, and population.
The ECCB provides the data to the IMF for publication in the Balance of Payments Yearbook.
The IMF publishes annual data for the consolidated general government in the GFS Yearbook,
with the 2008 edition showing annual data to 2004. No new data have been received for more
recent years. Only cash data are shown, with a detailed classification of revenue and a functional,
but not economic, classification of expenditure. No financing information is provided. The 2008
GFS Yearbook shows no balance sheet data but the 2004 edition published domestic and foreign
liabilities for 2001.

INTERNATIONAL MONTETARY FUND
ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
May 1, 2009
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ debt outlook is being adversely affected by the current
economic downturn, and there are significant downside risks to growth in the near term. The
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that public debt will trend upward in the medium
term if sizable commercial borrowing is used to finance the airport construction. A key
challenge is to continue progress toward achieving sound public finances over the medium
term. St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external debt distress rating is moderate.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Following a period of robust growth, macroeconomic outcomes were mixed in 2008.
Amid a global slowdown, real GDP growth decelerated from an annual average of almost
6 percent during 2004–07 to 0.9 percent in 2008, owing to sharply weakened activities in the
tourism, construction and agriculture sectors. Reflecting solid VAT performance, more
grants, and lower capital expenditures, the central government fiscal balance strengthened by
about 2 percent of GDP, achieving a primary surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP, the first since
2002. Due to strong growth and an agreement with Italy to write-off the Ottley Hall debt
obligation, the public sector debt in nominal terms declined to about 67½ percent of GDP at
end-2008 from 77½ percent in 2006.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The baseline scenario assumes continued declines in real growth for 2009–10,
reflecting the global economic slowdown and financial crisis. In the medium term, growth is
expected to return to its potential of around 4 percent, driven mostly by large-scale public
sector construction and a recovery in tourism. Notwithstanding the recent progress in fiscal
consolidation, sizeable overall fiscal deficits are expected to continue, financed commercially
and with some grants from the European Union and nontraditional donors, such as
Venezuela, Cuba, and Taiwan Province of China. Under this scenario, the central
government primary deficit is projected to stay close to around 0.9 percent of GDP during
2009–14. Compared to the projections in the DSA accompanying the 2007 Article IV
consultation, the current growth projections for 2009–10 have been marked down, given the
global slowdown and financial strains while projections for medium- to long-term are
similar. Overall public sector fiscal projections for 2009–14 are also more conservative,

2
reflecting the uncertainties surrounding the financing of the international airport as well as
the length and depth of the current economic downturn.1
Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2009–29)

1

a.

Real GDP growth is projected to average about 1.7 percent during 2009–11, well below the
historical average (around 4.2 percent during 1999–2008), and to return to its potential over
the medium term. Inflation, after sharply accelerating in 2007–08 with high world food and
fuel prices, is projected to return to low levels, consistent with historical averages and the
currency board arrangement.

b.

The primary balance of the central government is projected to deteriorate sizably in 2009 and
then remain broadly stable. On the revenue side, the maximum corporate income tax rate is
reduced to 30 percent by 2010, reducing corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP by
½ percentage points, while the property tax reform is expected to bring a revenue gain of
about ⅓ percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, after 2008 the wage bill as a share of GDP
remains constant, while capital expenditure remains at around 7½ percent of GDP. Under this
scenario, the public sector primary deficit would remain sizable (peaking at about 4.8 percent
of GDP by 2010).

c.

Annual disbursements of external capital grants are expected to be around 1½ percent of
GDP, consistent with the historical average.

d.

Given the ongoing repricing of risk and tight global liquidity conditions, it is assumed that
average nominal interest rates on foreign debt increase to around 6 percent in the medium
term.

e.

Amid the economic slowdown, the current account deficit is projected to decline moderately
from the elevated level during 2007–08, although it will remain high during the period when
the airport is constructed. It is expected to return to a more sustainable level, due to a pickup
in tourism receipts over the medium term. The expansion of tourist arrivals is underpinned by
an expansion of the hotel capacity over the medium term and the construction of the new
international airport.

f.

FDI, following a sharp decline in 2008–09, is assumed to return to its historical average of
around 15¾ percent of GDP over the medium term.

The authorities plan to complete the construction of a new international airport by 2011 with an estimated cost
of EC$608 million.

3
III. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
3.
At end-2008 the NPV of public debt was high at 66.8 percent of GDP (67½ percent in
nominal terms), albeit still among the lowest in the ECCU. Expansionary budgets in 2002–05
sharply raised the fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio. Fiscal imbalances remained high in
2006–07, owing to increased CWC-related capital expenditures. A large degree of fiscal
adjustment was achieved in 2008, thanks to higher tax revenue collection and lower capital
expenditure.
4.
The external debt stood at 35 percent of GDP, and domestic debt at 32½ percent of
GDP at end-2008. The largest share of the external debt stock is owed to multilateral
creditors (around 55½ percent), followed by commercial creditors (around 25½ percent). In
the future, most new external requirements are expected to be financed through the ECCU
Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM), although some financing from IFIs such
as the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) is expected. On the domestic front, commercial
banks are the most important lenders to the public sector.
Baseline Scenario
5.
Under the baseline scenario St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ NPV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to about 83 percent by 2014 (86¾ percent in nominal terms),
and increase further in the long term to around 102 percent of GDP by 2029 (106½ percent in
nominal terms). Similarly, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio increases from 183½ percent in
2009 to around 255 percent by 2014.
Alternative Scenarios
Active scenario
6.
Under this scenario, a fiscal adjustment would raise the primary surplus of the central
government to 2⅔ percent of GDP over the medium term. The adjustment would be
supported by revenue measures, including: (i) substituting tax holidays and exemptions with
investment credits, accelerated depreciation, and improving loss carry-forward provisions
(conservatively expected to yield 1.9 percent of GDP); (ii) efficiency gains in customs
collections, estimated to yield 0.5 percent of GDP; and (iii) the gradual reduction by 2012 of
the corporate income tax from 37.5 to 30 percent along with the gradual reduction of tax
concessions (revenue neutral). It is assumed that donors would support the reform strategy,
and additional grants would be provided by the European Union and Taiwan Province of
China. On the expenditure side, to create room for planned additional social spending, a civil
service reform yields cost savings of 0.4 percent of GDP. Reforms to the public service
pension system are adopted gradually. Capital expenditure is reduced by the elimination or
postponement of low-priority projects (yielding ⅓ percent of GDP), although it would remain
above its long-run average of 6.6 percent of GDP. With the impetus from public sector
capital projects and greater activity in the private sector, the underlying growth rate is
expected to accelerate to about 4⅔ percent over the medium term.

4
7.
Under this active scenario, St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ NPV of public debt-toGDP would decline to about 65 percent by 2014, and down further to 17 percent by 2029
(Table 2, Active Scenario).2 All other indicators of debt sustainability would register
continual improvements; particularly debt service as a share of current revenue, which would
fall to around 11 percent by 2029.
Lower growth and natural disasters
8.
The sensitivity analysis (which is applied to the baseline scenario) shows that lower
economic growth and a lower primary balance are the two key vulnerabilities for
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ debt dynamics. Assuming that growth remains at one
standard deviation below the level in the baseline scenario, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
reaches 154 percent of GDP by 2029 (Table 2, Scenario A3). If the primary deficit is
unchanged from the high level projected in 2009, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio reaches
157 percent of GDP by 2029 (Table 2, Scenario A2). The impact of a natural disaster on
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ debt dynamics is also very significant (Table 2,
Scenario A4). Under this scenario, the government incurs a fiscal cost of 9 percent of GDP
and real GDP growth is zero during 2010–12, reverting to the baseline levels thereafter.3 This
shock accelerates the deterioration of the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio which reaches
99 percent of GDP by 2014.
Borrowing for the Airport
9.
Sensitivity analysis (which is applied to the baseline scenario) shows the importance
of containing borrowing for the construction of the new international airport. In a worst-case
scenario, if the in-kind grants do not materialize, land sales are lower than expected, and the
government needs to borrow around 50 percent of the airport cost, then by 2014 the NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 95 percent (Table 2, Scenario A5).
IV. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external debt sustainability analysis covers only
public sector debt, since data on private sector external borrowing is not available. As a
result, debt dynamics in the external DSA follow a similar pattern to those of the public
sector DSA.
11.
Under the baseline scenario the NPV of external debt gradually increases up to nearly
42½ percent of GDP by 2017 (47 percent in nominal terms), before declining to 38½ percent
2

3

The nominal public debt-to-GDP ratio would fall below the 60 percent benchmark of the ECCB by 2017.

The actual impact of this shock could be lower given the participation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the
Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility—a regional insurance pool organized by the World Bank.

by 2029 (43 percent in nominal terms), but remains within the prudential threshold of
50 percent. 4 The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio remains below 125 percent throughout the
period, comfortably below the indicative threshold of 200 percent.
12.
Sensitivity analysis (which is applied to the baseline scenario) shows that the level of
external debt is very sensitive to a combination of negative shocks to output growth, export
growth, and FDI flows. In light of the current global environment, which is sharply lowering
tourism receipts, FDI and economic growth, this is a relevant shock scenario. Under this
scenario, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 59 percent by 2011,
breaching the debt-to-GDP threshold of 50 percent (Table 4, Scenario B5). If FDI were to
fall to one standard deviation below its historical average, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP
ratio would increase to 51 percent by 2011 (Table 4, Scenario B4). Similarly, with export
value growth at one standard deviation below its historical average, the NPV of external
debt-to-GDP ratio increases to 54 percent by 2011 (Table 4, Scenario B2). As the majority of
external debt is denominated in U.S. dollars, a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation in
2010 will raise the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio to 55 percent in 2010, breaching the
debt-to-GDP threshold (Table 4, Scenario B6).
V. CONCLUSION
13.
Sound public finances are key to achieving debt sustainability, particularly given the
uncertainties associated with the current economic slowdown and financing for the airport
project. Public sector imbalances would remain relatively high without continued fiscal
adjustment, leaving the ECCB’s public debt benchmark of 60 percent of GDP by 2020 out of
reach for St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Staff analysis shows that with a fiscal adjustment
that achieves a central government primary surplus (including grants) of around 2⅔ percent
of GDP by 2014, St. Vincent and the Grenadines would reach a nominal public debt-to-GDP
ratio below 60 percent—the ECCB benchmark—by 2017.
14.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines faces a moderate risk of external debt distress. The
debt trajectory under the baseline scenario does not breach the NPV of debt-to-GDP
indicative threshold; however, various stress tests underline the country’s vulnerabilities to
natural disasters, lower FDI, and lower output growth and suggest several breaches of the
NPV of debt-to-GDP threshold. As private external debt data are unavailable, some caution
should be used when interpreting these results, which cover public external debt only.
4

The DSA uses policy-dependent external debt-burden thresholds. Policy performance is measured by the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled annually by the World Bank. The CPIA
divides countries into three performance categories (strong, medium, and poor) based on the overall quality of
macroeconomic policies, with strong performers having higher prudential thresholds than poor performers.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is classified by the CPIA as a strong performer, implying prudential thresholds
on NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios of 50 and 200 percent, respectively.

Includes only public sector external debt.
Derived as [i - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with i = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate change
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in
the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assumingan offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 20, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
On May 15, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.1
Background
Following two years of strong growth, the economy has been negatively affected by the
global slowdown and financial turmoil. Real output growth is estimated to have fallen
from 7 percent in 2007 to around 1 percent in 2008, far below potential (estimated at
4½ percent). The tourism sector weakened owing to the U.S. and global growth
downturn, and construction lost some dynamism owing to the completion of major
phases in some public sector projects. Inflation, which peaked at 11.6 percent in
September, declined to 8.7 percent by end-2008, reflecting declines in world food and
fuel prices.
While still high, the external current account deficit improved modestly in 2008, as lower
imports, resulting from the weakness in economic activity, offset the lower foreign
exchange revenues from tourism and the larger food and fuel import bill. Private sector
credit growth slowed to 3 percent in 2008, compared to 15 percent in 2007, reflecting
the weakened economic activity, including lower demand from the household sector.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The banking sector has been largely unaffected by the global financial crisis and
remains well capitalized. The ratio of nonperforming to total loans remained low and
other financial indicators continue to point to banking soundness. However, strains from
the fallout of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group have created
uncertainty in the local financial system, and the international financial services sector
has also suffered shocks. An update of a 2004 Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) assessment took place in February–March 2009.
The fiscal position continued to strengthen in 2008 and the overall deficit was reduced to
1.7 percent of GDP. Larger grants, efforts at tax arrears collection and one-off non-tax
revenue were complemented by solid VAT performance to attain a primary surplus, the
first since 2002. The VAT exceeded expectations from both the revenue and the
compliance perspectives, surpassing replaced taxes, notwithstanding the growth
slowdown. Lower capital expenditure helped contain total government spending. The
public sector debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 67½ percent of GDP at end-2008.
The authorities have requested support under the Fund’s Exogenous Shocks Facility
(ESF) to help the economy adjust to the tourism and foreign direct investment (FDI)
shock. The authorities are requesting the rapid-access component of the ESF
(SDR 3.735 million, 45 percent of quota). Fund financing is expected to partly offset the
balance of payments impact as well as contribute toward the financing of the fiscal
deficit.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, following a period of brisk growth, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines has been impacted severely by the global slowdown, leading to a marked
decline in real GDP growth due to sharply weaker activity in the tourism and
construction sectors. The balance of payments is adversely affected by declines in
tourism receipts, foreign direct investment and remittances. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to mitigate the impact of the external shock, with Fund support
under the Exogenous Shock Facility, and to enhance the economy’s growth potential,
while ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability.
Directors commended recent steps toward fiscal consolidation and the solid progress on
social and poverty reduction goals. They welcomed the ongoing tax reform, including
the recent establishment of a Tax Reform Commission, and the authorities’ commitment
to maintain the integrity and stability of the VAT. Continued spending restraint through a
prudent public sector wage policy and prioritization of capital expenditure will be
important, particularly given the lower revenues due to the external shock. Directors
encouraged reforms to support medium-term fiscal consolidation, including tax and
customs reform, civil service reform, and adoption of a medium-term expenditure
framework.

Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate appears broadly in
line with macroeconomic fundamentals. Looking forward, they encouraged steps to
improve external competitiveness, including by easing infrastructure bottlenecks and
institutional rigidities, and lowering the cost of doing business.
Directors noted that the construction of a new international airport is necessary to further
develop the tourism industry and improve medium-term growth potential. They stressed
the importance of sustained fiscal consolidation and timely availability of concessional
financing to accommodate the airport project without compromising debt sustainability.
Directors also noted that a more flexible timetable for implementation of the project, to
the extent technically feasible, would help alleviate a possible financing bottleneck
in 2009, given the tight liquidity environment.
Directors emphasized that improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for
nonbanks is a high priority, particularly in light of the recent shocks to the region’s
offshore and insurance sectors. They encouraged the authorities to establish a single
regulatory unit for domestic nonbanks and the international financial service sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to coordinate with other regional
governments to address the regional financial turmoil resulting from the fallout of the
Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Approves US$5.7 Million Disbursement for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines Under the Exogenous Shock Facility
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today approved an SDR
3.735 million (about US$5.7 million) disbursement for St. Vincent and the Grenadines under
the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF).
The global economic slowdown has caused a significant decline in tourism to the country,
which has worsened the balance of payments. At the same time, a decline in Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) and construction activity has led to a sharp output slowdown in 2008.
Growth is expected to decline further in 2009, reflecting declining tourism receipts, FDI, and
remittances. The country’s authorities are requesting the rapid-access component of the ESF
to help the economy adjust to the tourism and FDI shock.
The Executive Board’s decision will enable the St. Vincent and the Grenadines to draw an
amount equivalent to SDR 3.735 million (about US$5.7 million) from the IMF immediately.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been impacted severely by the global slowdown, leading
to a marked decline in real GDP growth due to sharply weakened activities in the tourism and
construction sectors. The balance of payments has been negatively affected by declines in
tourism receipts, foreign direct investment and remittances. The St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ authorities are implementing appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of the
external shock and enhance the economy’s growth potential, while ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability. Fund support under the Exogenous Shocks Facility will help to alleviate the
balance of payments financing burden of the shock.
“The authorities have made good progress in fiscal consolidation as well as on social and
poverty reduction goals. They are demonstrating their commitment to maintain the integrity

2
and stability of the VAT and pursuing ongoing tax reform, including the recent establishment
of a Tax Reform Commission. Given the lower revenues due to the external shock, continued
spending restraint through a prudent public sector wage policy and prioritization of capital
expenditure will be necessary.
“The government is constructing a new international airport to further develop the tourism
industry and raise medium-term growth potential. Sustained fiscal consolidation and
additional concessional financing should accommodate the airport project without
compromising debt sustainability. A more flexible timetable for implementation of the
project, to the extent technically feasible, would help alleviate a possible financing bottleneck
in 2009, stemming from the tight liquidity environment,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Michael Horgan, Executive Director for St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and Shawn Ladd, Advisor to Executive Director
May 15, 2009

At the outset, my Vincentian authorities express their appreciation to the staff for a
well-balanced report and for pointing out the benefits of requesting support under the
Exogenous Shocks Facility (Rapid Access Component) as one element of tackling their
short-term financing challenge. All the Eastern Caribbean islands have common
vulnerabilities to global economic and financial conditions and natural shocks, and this
statement should be viewed in the context of today’s ECCU regional discussion, and the
related Buff statement.
Among the countries of the Eastern Caribbean, St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) is one
of the lower income, less developed economies. It has a large poor rural population, suffers
from difficult and expensive access and has been disproportionately impacted by the decline
of the banana industry. St. Vincent, home to the bulk of the population, has been an
agriculturally-based economy that is only now moving towards a tourism and services driven
economy. In doing so, it will have to surmount the internal transportation challenges posed
by its topography. The Grenadines are known for their small number of wealthy visitors.
These islands, their small size and ecological fragility notwithstanding, have potential for
further tourism development.
Economic Performance
Real GDP growth in 2008 declined dramatically from the rates of the previous two years,
which featured a construction boom. The long-term secular decline of the banana industry
was compounded in 2008 by disease. The authorities accept the Fund’s 2009 forecast of
0.1 percent growth in 2009, though all agree that the risks are to the downside. Although
considerable progress has recently been made in reducing the incidence of basic poverty,
very substantial challenges remain in tackling rural poverty and enhancing the skills of the
younger generation.
The strong peg of the EC dollar to the US dollar has always provided monetary stability, but
the combination of the pass-through of high oil prices, the introduction of VAT, rising global
food prices (which have a large weight in the CPI basket), and the weak US dollar combined
to push inflation above 8 percent at the end of 2007, peaking in 2008 at 10.1 percent, and
coming down only slowly. The current account deficit remained high and private-sector
credit grew only slowly.
The recession in the United States and the United Kingdom has sharply reduced tourist
arrivals. Net foreign exchange receipts from tourism declined by 4.3 percent of GDP in
2008, contributing to a US$3.3 million decline in net international reserves. The authorities
have to plan on the basis of at least one more bad season (2009-10) and a further decline in
net tourism receipts, but there is a major downside risk of a more protracted global recession
extending into additional seasons.

2
Notwithstanding the end of the construction boom and the unpleasant external environment,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines managed to post a primary surplus of 1.2 percent in 2008,
one of three primary surpluses in the ECCU. Measures to cope with the higher cost of food
and fuel in 2008 were “textbook” and affordable with increased tax effort and holding the
line on public sector pay (as a share of GDP). The December 2008 budget lays out an agenda
to preserve macro stability, improve the environment for business investment and enhance
critical social programs.
Fiscal Policy
As the staff acknowledges, the authorities have made steady progress on fiscal consolidation
in recent years. The cost of providing infrastructure and public services across a multi-island
country with a small population is always a major challenge. The progressive loss of
traditional donor support and trade preferences, and the cost of weather-related disasters have
added to fiscal pressures. At 67.5 percent of GDP, the public sector debt ratio is not
unsustainably high. Nonetheless, the authorities are concerned that total debt service
(amortization and interest) crowds out needed social spending. Accordingly, they have
reiterated their commitment to prudent fiscal policy, with a sharpened focus on
growth-enhancing public sector investment, including renewable energy and transportation
infrastructure.
Over the past few years, the authorities have tightened fiscal policy with action on both the
revenue and expenditure sides. While the authorities have not adopted a fully automatic
pricing mechanism for fuel products, oil price increases are passed through on a monthly
basis and the fiscal burden has been eliminated. The introduction of VAT in May 2007 was
effected very smoothly and the revenue results have been positive (for which the authorities
are grateful to CARTAC for invaluable technical assistance). While the 2008 budget
contained some adjustments to the VAT regime, its integrity has been maintained into the
2009 budget. For 2009, the top marginal rate of income tax will be reduced from 35 percent
to 32.5 percent, the threshold for personal income tax will be raised from EC$17,000 to
EC$18,000 and the corporate tax rate will also be reduced from 35 to 32.5 percent. The
authorities are contemplating further income tax reforms and will continue efforts to improve
collection and administration and tackle property tax reform.
The New International Airport
The staff report describes well the specific measures taken to mitigate the impact of the
short-term shock on tourism. However, there is considerable untapped tourism potential in
the medium term. There are many significant planned and proposed private-sector capital
projects contingent on improved air access to the islands. It is therefore critical that SVG be
served by a modern international airport. The Argyle International Airport project is indeed
massive relative to the GDP of the island, but it is almost fully financed with concessional
cash and in-kind resources. The authorities understand the staff’s concern about the project’s
risk to the debt dynamics in the baseline scenario, but they have been frank with the public
about the financial risk and offer assurances that the financing will be handled “cautiously,

3
skillfully and prudently.” It is fully expected that this public investment project will prove to
be growth-enhancing and more than sustainable. Moving ahead now, in an investment
downturn, would be more countercyclical and increase the probability that the project could
be completed in time for an extra tourism season.
The Domestic and International Financial Sectors
The staff rightly points out that the SVG banking sector continues to be well capitalized with
limited exposure to distressed assets or financial institutions. That said, the leadership of
SVG is playing a key role in coordinating the regional response to local and idiosyncratic
financial shocks, i.e. CL Financial Group and Bank of Antigua. The Vincentian authorities
continue to support the ECCB’s role as lender of last resort, while strengthening their own
regulatory framework for local non-banks and for international financial service providers.
The authorities have intervened strongly in two local institutions and their Financial
Intelligence Unit has been instrumental in successful prosecutions, convictions and asset
recoveries. Like other members in our Constituency with substantial and legitimate
international financial service activities, the SVG authorities are keenly aware of the risk that
advanced-country pursuit of non-cooperative jurisdictions could have negative unintended
consequences for countries that comply with international standards.
Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) Request
The Vincentian authorities pride themselves on having taken strong policy measures, as and
when required, without a Fund program. However, as one of four PRGF-eligible members in
our Constituency, St. Vincent is in a position to consider the ESF if conditions warrant.
Under the circumstances, the authorities recognize that ESF assistance would make an
important contribution to their efforts to contend with the transitory, but significant, shocks
to tourism receipts and FDI. The authorities would greatly appreciate a favorable response by
the Board to their request for rapid access to the ESF in the amount of 45 percent of their
quota.
