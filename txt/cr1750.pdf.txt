IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with People’s Republic of
China—Macao Special Administrative Region
On February 13, 2017 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation discussions1 with Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), and
considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
In the 15 years after the return to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, Macao SAR averaged real GDP
growth of 10.6 percent. The remarkable growth was due in large part to the de jure monopoly on
gaming within China and the rapid rise in the Mainland’s consumer spending power. However,
the economic boom came to an abrupt end in 2014 with gaming exports falling by a cumulative
50 percent. The main driver of the contraction was a sharp fall in the high-end or “VIP” casino
business. This development mirrored trends in luxury markets in Hong Kong SAR and came
amid a sustained anti-corruption campaign on the Mainland.
The sharp fall in exports led output to fall by one-third in cumulative terms but the spillovers to
the broader economy were surprisingly limited. Unemployment has remained below 2 percent,
median real wages have stabilized but remained up 7 percent over end-2014 levels, and
nonperforming loans in the financial sector continue to hover around zero. The primary source of
this resilience is that even though average spending per tourist fell sharply, the number of tourists
was basically stable keeping capacity utilization relatively high. As a result, most of the
contraction in revenues was absorbed in the form of lower extraordinary profits rather than
reduced employment.
The recent correction in exports has underscored the urgency of transitioning to a more
diversified economic model. Fortunately, Macao SAR enters this transition from a position of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

strength as there are significant buffers. First, due to high taxes on the gaming sector and
discipline on public spending, Macao SAR has zero gross public debt and fiscal reserves equal to
95 percent of GDP. And second, after 15 years of double-digit current account surpluses, foreign
exchange reserves are roughly US$ 19 billion or around 100 percent of pataca M2.
Real output is expected to contract for a third consecutive year in 2016. However, external
demand has begun to recover with gaming revenues posting six consecutive months of positive
annual growth. In 2017, a low base will help increase growth above 2 percent despite continued
weak domestic demand. Further out, Macao SAR is well-positioned to record sustainable growth
in the mid-single digits. In addition to its still highly valuable gaming monopoly within China,
Macao SAR is an established tourist destination with significant geographic proximity to—and
cultural affinity with—Mainland China. Moreover, Macao SAR is now investing aggressively in
non-gaming tourism and financial services.
Executive Board Assessment
The recent external shock underscores the importance of the authorities’ strategy to transition to
a more diversified economic model. The speed and size of the recent fall in external demand is a
reminder of how narrow the export base had become during the boom years. Though the nongaming economy was remarkably resilient, such volatility can undermine long-run growth
by increasing macroeconomic uncertainty. In this regard, the authorities’ strategy to diversify to
mass-market gaming, non-gaming tourism, and financial services is important.
Fortunately, Macao SAR enters this transition from a position of strength. Prudent fiscal policy
during the boom years has left the public sector with zero debt and almost 100 percent of GDP in
fiscal reserves. Meanwhile, the high national savings rate has helped Macao SAR recorded
repeated double digit current account surpluses and accumulate substantial foreign assets,
reinforcing the credibility of the currency board.
In the near term, there is no need for further discretionary fiscal loosening given the closing
output gap. Though the public sector has continued to record budget surpluses, the authorities
appropriately loosened fiscal policy substantially during the recent downturn. Partly as a result of
this approach, the output gap, measured by an array of methods is now closing. In this regard, the
authorities should avoid substantial further discretionary loosening in fiscal policy to avoid overstimulating the economy.
Looking further ahead, the authorities should establish a medium-term framework to anchor
fiscal policy and ensure long-run solvency. Taxing the economic rents of the gaming monopoly
has left Macao SAR with abundant fiscal reserves. This provides a substantial opportunity to
invest in human capital and close any infrastructure gaps. Though there is not an urgent concern,
the authorities should establish long-run projections to better understand how much of the fiscal
resources are accounted for, particularly with respect to future pension obligations.

With respect to the real estate market, there is no clear need to loosen macroprudential
regulations. Macroprudential regulations specific to the housing market should be relaxed when
there is a risk of a spiral of falling house prices, falling mortgage credit, and increased defaults.
Current information—including healthy bank balance sheets and recovering prices—suggests
this threshold has not been met. To the degree there is a social objective of increasing housing
accessibility, this is best addressed by increasing the supply of market-priced units and providing
targeted transfers to the most vulnerable.
The financial sector remains strong. Soundness indicators regarding asset quality, earnings, and
liquidity remain remarkably robust given the size of the fall in output. This reflects the nature of
the correction (which fell disproportionately on gaming operator profits) and the prudence of
regulations in recent years. The sheer size of the sector—particularly the supervisory challenge
of monitoring the liquidity and quality of foreign assets—does warrant ongoing attention. But the
nature of these—largely branches to related parties—suggests risks are contained.
The currency board regime continues to serve Macao SAR well, with price flexibility an
increasingly important supporting factor. The phenomenal growth in the export sector since the
return to Chinese sovereignty suggests that exchange rate competitiveness has not been a
limiting factor. However, during much of this period, Macao SAR was depreciating against the
RMB as a result of the peg, indirectly, to the U.S. dollar. With China now accounting for twothirds of tourists and balance of payments pressures raising the potential for depreciation,
external competitiveness may be more of an issue. In this regard, downward price flexibility, as
displayed recently by the hotel sector, will likely be increasingly important.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context. In recent years, the Macao SAR economy contracted by a cumulative 30 percent due
to a sharp fall in spending by gaming tourists from Mainland China. Spillovers to the rest of the
economy were relatively contained with unemployment staying under 2 percent and asset
quality in the financial sector unaffected. Nonetheless, the size and speed of the shock
underscored the need to transition to a more diversified economic model going forward.
Fortunately, Macao SAR is entering this transition from a position of strength with large fiscal and
external buffers.
Outlook. The economy has now bottomed out and should return to positive growth in 2017 for
the first time in four years. In the medium term, Macao SAR is well-positioned to record relatively
stable growth in the low to mid-single digits. This benign outlook primarily reflects its continuing
status as an established tourist destination with a monopoly on gaming within China. That said,
the narrow export base will leave Macao SAR vulnerable to shocks, particularly with respect to a
sharp slowdown in the Mainland or policy changes that affect Chinese resident’s ability to spend
money abroad.
Strategy. Macao SAR has substantial buffers as a result of the gaming monopoly and prudent
policymaking; the challenge will be to deploy them well going forward.


Phase out fiscal impulse in the near term. After large discretionary fiscal loosening, the output
gap is now closing, removing the need for an expansionary stance in 2017.



Establish long-run fiscal projections that take into account pensions. Despite currently large
fiscal buffers, long-run spending pressure for pensions necessitates a medium-term fiscal
framework.



Maintain current macroprudential stance. Public concerns about housing affordability are best
addressed through other policies targeted at improving access for the most vulnerable.



Continue to monitor large foreign financial sector exposures. Though asset quality, earnings,
and liquidity appear strong, the large size of the financial sector warrants close attention.



Ensure continuing flexibility of the economy. The currency board remains appropriate, with
continuing price flexibility key to facilitating adjustment to shocks and structural change.

Las Vegas, the gaming sector accounts for
48 percent of output and 77 percent of general government revenue (See Appendix III: Tourism
Sector). The gaming boom has also led to a rapid rise in the demand for labor, pushing the
unemployment rate below 2 percent and strongly increasing the role of migrant workers who now
account for 39 percent of the total employed (See Appendix II: Labor Market). With a population of
646,800 people and an area of 12 square miles, Macao SAR today is considered among the most
population-dense regions in the world.
2.
However, the decade-long boom in gaming revenues came to an abrupt end in 2014.
Relative to the peak in early 2014, gaming exports fell by 50 percent and the economy has now
contracted cumulatively by one third. The aggregate number of visitors remained broadly stable
but there was a sharp fall in spending per visitor due to a contraction in the high-end casino
business. High-roller “VIP” gaming revenue fell from US$30 billion in 2013 to US$16 billion in 2015.
The sharp fall broadly mirrored developments in

this mostly reflected the scheduled completion of
large integrated resort construction projects.
3.
Nonetheless, the spillovers of the shock to the rest of the economy have been
surprisingly limited. Unemployment is 1.9 percent, up only 0.2 percentage points from
the historical low in 2014. Median real wages have stabilized but remain up 7 percent over
end-2014 levels. Meanwhile, in the financial sector, nonperforming loans are unchanged at just

numbers during the global financial crisis, have
largely remained employed throughout this downturn. As a result, most of the contraction in
revenues was absorbed in the form of lower extraordinary profits rather than reduced employment.
This resilience in the tourism sector’s demand for labor helped contain the fall in domestic
consumption and deterioration in bank asset quality.

deterioration reflects the fall in gaming revenues,
which are taxed at roughly 40 percent. However, the non-gaming fiscal balance, a better measure of
the impact of fiscal policy on domestic demand, also widened materially, largely due to discretionary
changes rather than automatic stabilizers. In particular, the fiscal impulse was driven by higher
expenditures on investment and social benefits.

5.
There was no other material macroeconomic response to the output contraction. As a
result of the peg, the authorities do not control interest rate policy but they do use macroprudential
measures—loan to value ratios, debt servicing ratios, and a special stamp duty—to safeguard
financial stability from potential risks in the real estate market.1 Nonetheless, despite the sizable
correction in housing prices, the authorities considered there was no need to loosen these limits
given that price levels remained well above those in 2012 when the measures were last tightened.

There are three key macroprudential ratios aimed at residential real estate: 1) a debt service to income limit of 50 percent
(introduced September 2010); 2) a special stamp duty on properties sold within one year of purchase (20 percent of cost of
property ) or two years of purchase (10 percent) (introduced April 2011); and 3) a maximum loan-to-value ratio ranging from
50 to 90 percent depending on cost of property (more stringent levels apply to nonresidents) (introduced October 2012).

Moreover, the volume of transactions and level of prices have started to recover.
6.
Looking ahead, Macao SAR faces a difficult transition to a new economic model, but
fortunately does so from a position of strength. Even before the recent downturn, economic
growth was expected to moderate to single digits over the medium term as gaming started to face
constraints to land supply, government controls on the expansion of tables, and external
competition. However, the urgency to find a more diversified economic model has been sharpened
by the recent correction which is largely seen as permanent. To help with this transition, Macao SAR
can draw on deep buffers. First and foremost, Macao SAR has zero gross public debt and fiscal
reserves equal to 95 percent of GDP due historically to high taxes on gaming and a generally
prudent expenditure policy. Second, the high public and private savings have contributed to
14 years of double-digit current account surpluses. As a result, Macao SAR is a net foreign creditor
on the order of 280 percent of GDP; in addition to substantial private assets, foreign exchange
reserves, critical to the credibility of Macao SAR’s currency board linked to the Hong Kong dollar
(and thus, in turn, to the U.S. dollar), amount to US$18.9 billion, just under 100 percent of pataca M2.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Though the economy has bottomed and a nascent recovery has begun, 2016 will
record the third consecutive annual contraction in real output. In the third quarter, sequential
seasonally adjusted growth reached 8 percent, the first positive result in 10 quarters. Moreover, in
November, gaming revenue posted the fourth consecutive month of annual growth. Nonetheless,
the deceleration in domestic demand continued in 2016, contracting over 6 percent and putting a
break on the recovery. In particular, the drag on investment from the end of the tourism-related
building boom will continue and private consumption will moderate amid less wage growth, a sharp
decline in the pace of immigration, and weaker credit. In 2017, an export recovery on a low base will
lift growth above 2 percent despite continued weak domestic demand.

For the medium term, one can expect a moderation in growth, fiscal balances and
current account surpluses compared to historical averages. Going forward, Macao SAR is well
positioned to have sustainable growth in the low to mid-single digits. In addition to its still highly
valuable gaming monopoly within China, it is a known tourist brand with significant geographic

growth will gradually converge to the projected
growth of outbound tourists from China as non-gaming facilities are developed further; and
c) spending per visitor will resume a modest increase but remain at a much lower level
compared to the recent peak reflecting the permanent change in clientele.



Fiscal Accounts—Under unchanged policies, fiscal balances face two headwinds. First, tax
revenues on gaming, which account for about three-quarters of total revenues, will remain
permanently lower because gaming revenues are not expected to return to previous highs. In
addition, progress on diversification of growth will help reduce the volatility of output but will
also entail a less tax-rich composition given lower tax rates outside of gaming. And second,
spending on pensions will continue to rise due to demographic pressures. In this environment
fiscal surpluses will moderate in the medium term.



Balance of Payments—Public and private savings will moderate as a result of the weaker gaming
revenues. Meanwhile, investment may tick up amid pressing infrastructure needs but capital
outlays in the gaming sector are expected to moderate from the high pace of recent years. In
this environment, the current account surplus will remain large, allowing continued reserve
accumulation and private sector asset acquisition.

9.
Risks are broadly balanced around this baseline outlook. Domestically, the critical
parameter is whether infrastructure investment will remain adequate in terms of quality and quantity
to absorb further increases in external demand; the move from VIP to mass market tourism likely
requires a larger physical footprint to achieve the same amount of growth due to lower per capita
tourist spending and there are already material infrastructure bottlenecks. But as a small, open
economy that will remain primarily reliant on tourism even in the long term, the majority of risks to
Macao SAR’s outlook will be a function of external developments. The largest negative risk is
naturally a sharp slowdown in China, particularly if accompanied by a material depreciation in the
RMB against the dollar, which would directly affect external competitiveness. Given the dominant
share of tourists that are from the Mainland, a large contraction in China’s output would further
weigh on gaming revenue. While the recent shock could be absorbed via a reduction in the gaming

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

sector’s extraordinary profits, a further adjustment from current reduced revenue levels could be
more consequential for employment and the broader economy. But even outside such a scenario,
Macao SAR remains at risk to policy changes related to developments on the Mainland such as
measures aimed at managing capital outflows. An additional downside risk is a faster than expected
normalization of policy rates in the United States. Meanwhile, a key positive risk would be a further
relaxation in the Mainland’s still relatively strict visa policy for visits to Macao SAR: the Chinese
population eligible to visit Macao SAR under the Individual Visitor Scheme (IVS) remains only
47 percent of total of which 34 percent is concentrated in one neighboring province (Guangdong).
10.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities shared the view that much of the recent fall in VIP
gaming revenue was permanent and broadly agreed with staff’s medium-term growth estimate of
3‒4 percent. In the aftermath of significant volatility in output, they argued that lower but more
stable growth going forward would be a welcomed outcome. Nonetheless, they saw considerable
upside in both non-gaming tourism and financial services, particularly in light of ongoing high-level
support from the Mainland (see below). In terms of fiscal policy, the authorities emphasized the
strength of their balance sheet as a result of prudent policy during the boom years and argued that
it positioned them well to invest in the non-gaming economy, including through competitive tax
policy. On the external side, the authorities continued to view the ongoing credibility of the peg
combined with the large foreign exchange reserves and strong net creditor position of the
government and banking system as providing crucial buffers in the event of external shocks. In this
context, staff’s views on downside risks were generally viewed to be overly pessimistic—the
authorities pointed to the resilience of the banking sector and external accounts in the face of the
large dual shock to gaming demand and housing prices. They also did not see a loosening in the
Mainland’s visa policy as a priority: the goal is improving the length of stay and spending capacity of
existing visitors more than expanding to new cities that have lower average income.

POLICIES
A. Near-Term Issues
Short-Run Fiscal Policy

11.
Macao SAR would benefit from an
explicit counter-cyclical fiscal framework as part
of near-term budget preparation. As a small open
economy reliant primarily on external demand, the
economy faces substantial volatility in output. Over
time, progress on diversifying the economy will help
moderate but not eliminate such fluctuations. In this
context, and given Macao SAR’s substantial fiscal
space, there is scope for Macao SAR to pursue more
concerted counter-cyclical policy to help lean
against the wind, offsetting sharp changes in private

demand. Though looser fiscal policy will in part leak into higher imports, this channel is generally
less pronounced in a fixed exchange rate regime because there is no resulting currency
appreciation. At the same time, incorporating such a framework more explicitly into budget
preparation will help avoid excessive loosening that could put pressure on the external position. It is
important to note that for demand management via fiscal policy to work, the budget should better
predict final fiscal outcomes: in recent years, expenditure execution has repeatedly fallen materially
short of the budget (especially on capital spending), reducing its effectiveness as a macroeconomic
tool (see Box 1: Short-Run Demand Management with Fiscal Policy).

Measuring the Business Cycle). As a result, automatic
stabilizers, which are primarily gaming revenue in Macao SAR, will improve, boosting the fiscal result
going forward. In this context, there is not a strong case on cyclical grounds for continued fiscal
impulse in the non-gaming overall balance in 2017 as seen in recent years. In particular, the
authorities should ensure that any temporary expenditure increases introduced during the downturn
are allowed to expire as the economy recovers.
13.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities agreed that their prudent approach during the boom
years and currently ample fiscal space allowed them to accommodate, rather than offset, sharp falls
in tax revenue as a result of sudden downturns. They also agreed that the economy was recovering
and expenditure increases were likely to slow in the near-term. However, there was some doubt
about going further than automatic stabilizers, questioning whether demand management could be
effective in a small open economy like Macao SAR. The authorities also underscored the importance
of a cautious fiscal policy as critical to maintaining the credibility of the currency board.
Housing
14.
Risks in the housing market appear broadly contained. Housing in Macao SAR
experienced a remarkable boom: between end 2008 and mid-2014, prices rose by over 500 percent
(nearly 400 percent in real terms). To some degree, this asset appreciation can be explained by
fundamentals including rising real wages, financial deepening, and population growth amid a
relatively fixed supply of land. In the period since mid-2014, prices have partially corrected, falling by
over 30 percent, and are back at 2013 levels. However, only 0.1 percent of residential mortgage loans

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

have negative equity (and nonperforming loans are
roughly the same magnitude).2 This strength in asset
quality likely owes to three factors. First, for most
homeowners, prices are still above the purchase price
given the size of the initial boom and the short period
of the recent correction. Second, the average loan to
value remains well below regulatory maxima. And third,
average debt service to income has been consistently
low at 25 percent. According to the most recent data,
real estate prices and transactions have started to
increase again, suggesting that the correction may have
bottomed.

15.
In light of these dynamics, the current macroprudential stance appears appropriate. An
easing of macro prudential standards would be an appropriate response in the event of a rapid and
self-reinforcing decline in housing prices that posed risks to financial stability and the broader
economy.3 Current indications suggest, however, that existing standards remain appropriate,
including the loan-to-value ratio and debt service-to-income ratio applied in Macao SAR. While
house prices have fallen, the adjustment has been orderly and the market appears to be stabilizing
without any significant stress on balance sheets or financial stability.
16.
Current public concerns about housing affordability are best addressed through other
means. To the degree there are social goals of improving the accessibility of housing, fueling demand
via loosening macroprudential regulations amid tight supply may increase the price more than improve
affordability. Instead, it would be more effective to provide targeted (means-tested) transfers and ensure
that regulatory policy is adequate to support further private sector supply at market (rather than
subsidized) prices. In this regard, efficient execution of housing plans for reclaimed land and welltargeted public housing supply will be important. Nonetheless, if the impact of speculative demand on
real estate prices is a material concern, the authorities could consider more targeted macroprudential
measures such as tighter loan-to-value ratios on second-home purchases.
17.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities shared the view that a loosening in macroprudential
regulations was not necessary given current market fundamentals. They also shared the view that
loosening in measures might actually reduce affordability unless supported by improvements to housing
supply. The authorities were open to further exploration of some targeted measures at preventing
excessive speculation. However, they highlighted that concerns about affordability had not fallen
materially despite the price correction and there is already nascent evidence of a recovery in prices.

Residential mortgage currently accounts for 22 percent of bank loans (commercial real estate accounts for another
21 percent.)

Financial Sector
18.
Stepping back from the narrow housing issue, analysis of banking system balance
sheets suggests that the sector remains sound. The large size of the banking system—assets
of 375 percent of GDP at end-October 2016—suggests the need for supervisory caution (See
Appendix I: Banking Sector). Nonetheless, it is useful to look at the domestic and foreign parts of the
balance sheet separately as headline ratios can be misleading in Macao SAR.

unemployment is unchanged) and the fact that
private sector leverage is relatively moderate: domestic corporate and household debt are
50 and 57 percent of GDP, respectively. There is a large degree of direct or indirect exposure to
gaming but this is both somewhat inevitable given the structure of the economy and relatively
safe given the strength of gaming operator balance sheets.



The foreign side of bank balance sheets ( 231 percent of GDP in assets and 152 percent of GDP
in liabilities) is more opaque but risks also appear contained. An obvious risk is that foreign
liabilities are almost entirely deposits (99 percent of total) which are largely short term, raising
the risk of a sharp fall in funding. However, three factors mitigate this risk. First, the vast majority
of the foreign liabilities belong to branches of foreign banks suggesting it is difficult to view the
balance sheets on a stand-alone basis. Second, roughly 85 percent of the liabilities to foreign
banks (half of total foreign liabilities) are to related parties (parent or sister banks reflecting
Macao SAR’s role in corporate treasury management) which reduces the likelihood of a run. And
third, the foreign liabilities are entirely used to purchase foreign rather than domestic assets,
suggesting that in the event of a fall in funding, the banks can use their own foreign assets
(provided liquidity and quality is adequate) rather than needing foreign exchange reserves.
Nonetheless, particularly given the pegged exchange rate regime, supervisors should remain
vigilant about the nature of the foreign borrowing (maturity, type of counterpart) and foreign
investments (quality, liquidity).

19.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities emphasized that the strength of the banking system—
even after a dual shock to the gaming and housing sectors—was a testament to their supervision
and the banks’ own prudence. They recognized that the banks had aggressively sought out foreign
funding and investment opportunities but argued that this was an appropriate business model given

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

the limited size of the domestic market. In general, the authorities believed that risks to funding
were contained given the predominance of related-party exposures. Finally, they noted that they
had substantially increased transparency surrounding banks’ exposures to China (23 percent of
foreign assets in 2016:Q3, down from a peak of 38 percent in 2014:Q2) on the recommendation of
the last Article IV consultation.

B. Medium-Term Issues
Raising Medium-Term Growth
20.
The authorities have outlined an ambitious plan to diversify the sources of economic
growth over the medium term. In summary, the plan seeks three types of diversification: 1) from
high-end VIP gaming to mass-market gaming, 2) from gaming tourism to non-gaming tourism, and
3) from tourism to financial services. These three objectives made sense before the recent economic
correction, and have taken on a new urgency in the aftermath of the recent (largely structural)
contraction in output. While many of the specific micro-economic questions of such a growth
strategy are outside the scope of an Article IV, some considerations are worthy of note:


From VIP to mass-market gaming: This diversification has already made substantial progress with VIP
gaming falling from almost 70 percent to roughly 50 percent of total where it has recently stabilized.
Going forward, the mass market still has significant scope for growth reflecting the low penetration
into the eligible Mainland market. Effective management of the money laundering risks is critical to a
sustainable growth of gaming. However, supply-side bottlenecks may constrain Macao SAR’s ability
to accommodate the needed additional tourists. For this reason, execution of current infrastructure
plans is likely the single most important part of the growth strategy going forward. The fact that the
public sector’s capital investment budget is consistently and materially under-executed suggests
there is scope for improving public financial management.



INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR



From tourism to financial services—The authorities’ five-year plan highlights financial services—in
particular, RMB settlement of external trade, financial leasing, and global wealth management—as
the non-tourism export sector to develop further going forward. Given Macao SAR’s relatively
high median wage level, limited land supply, and small domestic market, financial services
exports are a logical area to explore. Moreover, Mainland China’s recent and high-level official
support for Macao SAR’s diversification into financial services is important. Nonetheless, further
work would be useful to establish both Macao SAR’s comparative advantage in these areas and the
potential cost-benefit of seeking this business. In an area like RMB settlement for trade between
China and Portuguese-speaking countries, Macao SAR’s niche stems naturally from the common
language and legal system as well as deep existing connections with those countries. However, the
comparative advantage of becoming a form of offshore financial center for leasing and wealth
management is less straight forward. It might require large cuts in the already low income tax rates to
attract the necessary nonresident investors and professionals, with potentially limited spill-over
benefits to local employment. Moreover, with lowering tax rates to attract nonresidents a core pillar of
the growth strategy, it will be important that Macao SAR ensures a high standard for transparency of
legal persons and trusts in line with international standards, in particular on the issue of beneficial
ownership. In this regard, it is welcomed that Macao SAR passed the peer review by the OECD’s
Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and committed to start
automatic exchange of information as of 2018.

21.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities broadly shared staff’s characterization of the growth strategy
but underscored the upside potential in several areas. In terms of the infrastructure necessary to
accommodate mass-market gaming and non-gaming tourism, the authorities recognized the concern but
emphasized that the government had taken note of the bottlenecks in capital spending and planned
greater focus on absorptive capacity going forward. They also agreed that financial services would take
time to have a material impact on headline growth given the low base. Nonetheless, they emphasized
that even small inroads into the RMB settlement of trade with Lusophone economies could have a large
impact given Macao SAR’s size. In addition, they felt that they could be competitive in areas like leasing
given i) the ability to afford a low tax rate, ii) the scope for business growth with Portuguese-speaking and
“One-Belt, One Road” countries and iii) the considerable infrastructure investment envisioned in the
nearby Mainland provinces. Finally, the authorities saw considerable scope for domestic employment
benefits from financial services on the grounds that the local education system could supply the necessary
higher-skilled labor force.
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
22.
Even though fiscal space is ample in the short-run, it is important that Macao SAR has a
medium-term fiscal framework to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability and intergenerational
equity. There are three key steps. The first is to develop long-term fiscal projections under current policies
to determine how much of the current stock of fiscal reserves is already committed to future spending. In
this regard, the projected rise in pension obligations (see below) and move away from the tax-rich gaming
sector are critical. Second, one must determine how much of the fiscal reserve is needed to finance
deficits that may arise from temporary shocks. This is a function of the expected volatility of the cycle

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

which may be high in Macao SAR given the narrow income base. And third, with the remaining “excess”
fiscal reserve, one must determine how much should be invested inside Macao SAR as opposed to
abroad. Though there are a variety of considerations, this hinges largely on the relative return from
investing in infrastructure domestically versus the financial return from investing abroad.
23.
A key long-term spending pressure stems

capital injection by the government (37 billion MOP or
roughly 10 percent of 2016 GDP) would not be adequate to cover long-term obligations, requiring further
resources from elsewhere in the government (e.g., fiscal reserve fund). In terms of parametric reform, three
of the options include linking the social contribution to the wage, indexing pension benefits to inflation,
and increasing the retirement age from the current statutory rate of 65. Given expected years in
retirement are similar to other advanced economies, priority should be given to the first two options,
especially on pension benefit indexation, which would significantly dampen the long-term spending
pressure by stabilizing the replacement rate (pension benefits in percent of per capita income).
24.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities emphasized that the fiscal position was strong with
continued budget surpluses even after a large contraction in the economy. Moreover, the fiscal reserve, at
95.2 percent of GDP in 2015, would be even larger once the 2015 and 2016 surpluses were transferred to
the fund. Nonetheless, they recognized that there was not an explicit medium-term framework in which to
ground budgeting decisions. Such a framework would be useful in light of major public sector obligations
including the investment needs of the new growth strategy, the social safety net expected by the public,
and the rising pension obligations. With respect to staff’s higher estimates of future spending obligations,
the authorities broadly agreed on the methodology and would seek to update their estimates based on
the latest available data.
Exchange Rate and Inflation

External Sector Stability
25.
The peg to the Hong Kong dollar continues
to serve Macao SAR well, providing a credible
nominal anchor. Though inflation reached a peak of
5.5 percent during the period of double-digit growth,
expectations have remained broadly anchored. The
success of the currency board is in large part due to
steady application of the necessary supportive policies:
adequate foreign exchange coverage, a liquid and

well-capitalized banking sector, prudent fiscal policy and flexible labor markets (particularly with respect
to nonresidents working in Macao SAR). In terms of valuation, the exchange rate remains broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies despite the recent real appreciation
(See Appendix IV: External Sector Assessment).
26.
Going forward, the importance of appropriate supportive policies may increase further
amid new challenges. With China now accounting for two-thirds of tourism arrivals (and a higher
share of tourist spending), the recent announcement by the PBC to move away from the dollar as a
reference for the RMB could become significant for Macao SAR. The pataca (like the Hong Kong
dollar) has appreciated 8 percent against the RMB since the second half of 2015. It is true that
exchange rate movements in the past may not have had an obvious impact on tourist receipts.
However, during the boom period, visits to Macao SAR were driven by high-net worth customers
whose demand was likely relatively inelastic to higher costs. With the move to a mass-market model,
price sensitivity will be greater going forward. In this regard, the gaming operators’ recent reduction
in non-gaming prices—the tourism price index has fallen by 13 percent due primarily to reductions
in hotel prices—illustrates an important flexibility.
27.
Authorities Views. The authorities continue to view the currency board as a critical part of
the stability of the Macao SAR economy. They felt that a robust policy framework, in particular with
respect to fiscal policy and strong external buffers, had provided the needed credibility for the
exchange rate regime to be a lasting nominal anchor. The authorities recognized recent
developments in the real exchange rate but emphasized the deflation in the tourism price index as
evidence that Macao SAR can maintain competitiveness in the face of external pressures.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The recent external shock underscores the importance of the authorities’ strategy to
transition to a more diversified economic model. The speed and size of the recent fall in external
demand is a reminder of how narrow the export base had become during the boom years. Though
the non-gaming economy was remarkably resilient, such volatility can undermine long-run growth
by increasing macroeconomic uncertainty. In this regard, the authorities’ strategy to diversify to
mass-market gaming, non-gaming tourism, and financial services is important.
29.
Fortunately, Macao SAR enters this transition from a position of strength. Prudent fiscal
policy during the boom years has left the public sector with zero debt and almost 100 percent of
GDP in fiscal reserves. Meanwhile, the high national savings rate has helped Macao SAR record
repeated double digit current account surpluses and accumulate substantial foreign assets,
reinforcing the credibility of the currency board.
30.
In the near term, there is no need for further discretionary fiscal loosening given the
closing output gap. Though the public sector has continued to record budget surpluses, the
authorities appropriately loosened fiscal policy substantially during the recent downturn. Partly as a
result of this approach, the output gap, measured by an array of methods is now closing. In this

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

regard, the authorities should avoid substantial further discretionary loosening in fiscal policy to
avoid over-stimulating the economy.
31.
Looking further ahead, the authorities should establish a medium-term framework to
anchor fiscal policy and ensure long-run solvency. Taxing the economic rents of the gaming
monopoly has left Macao SAR with abundant fiscal reserves. This provides a substantial opportunity
to invest in human capital and close any infrastructure gaps. Though there is not an urgent concern,
the authorities should establish long-run projections to better understand how much of the fiscal
resources are accounted for, particularly with respect to future pension obligations.
32.
With respect to the real estate market, there is no clear need to loosen
macroprudential regulations. Macroprudential regulations specific to the housing market should
be relaxed when there is a risk of a spiral of falling house prices, falling mortgage credit, and
increased defaults. Current information—including healthy bank balance sheets and recovering
prices—suggests this threshold has not been met. To the degree there is a social objective of
increasing housing accessibility, this is best addressed by increasing the supply of market-priced
units and providing targeted transfers to the most vulnerable.
33.
The financial sector remains strong. Soundness indicators regarding asset quality,
earnings, and liquidity remain remarkably robust given the size of the fall in output. This reflects the
nature of the correction (which were largely absorbed by a fall in extraordinary gaming operator
profits) and the prudence of regulations in recent years. The sheer size of the sector—particularly
the supervisory challenge of monitoring the large foreign component of balance sheets—does
warrant ongoing attention. But the nature of these exposures—largely branches to related parties—
suggests risks are contained.
34.
The currency board regime continues to serve Macao SAR well, though price flexibility
will be increasingly important going forward. The phenomenal growth in the export sector since
the return to Chinese sovereignty suggests that exchange rate competitiveness has not been a
limiting factor. However, during much of this period, Macao SAR was depreciating against the RMB
as a result of the peg, indirectly, to the U.S. dollar. With China now accounting for two-thirds of
tourists and balance of payments pressures raising the potential for depreciation in the RMB,
external competitiveness may be more of an issue going forward. In this regard, price flexibility, as
displayed recently by the hotel sector, will likely be increasingly important.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Macao SAR take place on the
standard 24-month cycle.

Box 1. Short-run Demand Management with Fiscal Policy
When left unchecked, substantial volatility in output can reduce long-run growth by increasing macroeconomic
uncertainty. Fiscal policy can be a useful tool to moderate such volatility, partially offsetting sharp swings in private
demand. To apply this approach to an economy like Macao SAR, several adjustments are needed to take into
account the large role of the gaming sector, much the way resource-rich economies account for the commodity
sector:



First, the goal of short-run fiscal policy should not be to reduce the volatility of total output (as in most economies)
but rather a subset more directly related to local welfare such as non-gaming GDP (effectively domestic
absorption). For example, to the degree that a sharp fall in gaming revenues primarily manifested itself in lower
profits for foreign owners of gaming operations, it is not clear that offsetting this with looser fiscal policy to
stimulate domestic demand would be appropriate. However, if a shock to gaming led to a rise in unemployment
and, as a result, a fall in private consumption or investment, fiscal loosening would be more appropriate.



Second, to determine the appropriate fiscal stance going forward (as well as to assess past policy), one should
focus on the best measure of the impact of fiscal policy on domestic absorption. In most economies, this would be
the change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance in percent of GDP. However, in Macao SAR, a useful indicator
would be the non-gaming cylically-adjusted primary balance in percent of non-gaming GDP. Including gaming in
the numerator and denominator would prevent one from knowing whether changes in the fiscal result were due
to fiscal policy or changes in external demand which are highly volatile and exogenous to fiscal policy.

In recent years, the non-gaming fiscal balance in Macao SAR has loosened substantially from a deficit of around
-10 percent of non-gaming GDP in 2013 to -30 percent in the 2016 budget. This has almost entirely been driven
by discretionary loosening in policy (fiscal impulse) rather than automatic stabilizers. With this loosening, the
non-gaming output gap has begun to close sharply in recent quarters.
The effectiveness of demand management via fiscal policy is not uniform across all economies but there is scope for
impact in Macao SAR. Admittedly, in an open economy like Macao SAR, there tends to be a greater risk that a looser
fiscal stance leaks into imports. However, this channel is generally less important in a fixed exchange rate regime. A
looser fiscal position puts upward pressure on the interest rate which increases foreign demand for the currency. To
maintain the fixed regime, the money supply must increase causing an additional increase in aggregate demand,
reinforcing the fiscal stance.

Box 2. Measuring the Business Cycle
With a cumulative 30 percent contraction in the economy, a key question is how much of the output
shock is temporary as this informs the appropriate size and nature of policy response. This box identifies
the cyclical position of Macao SAR using an array of methods, and finds that output gap is relatively
moderate—ranging from -3 percent to -5 percent—but closing quickly.
One can start with simple univariate HP filters.
1. Total Output: A simple HP filter of quarterly
GDP suggests the output gap in 2016:Q2 was
about 10 percent, only slightly less than the
2009 recession. However, looking at aggregate
output alone can be distorting, as HP filter

Output and hotel occupancy rate: Given the
outsized role of the tourism sector, hotel
occupancy rate is another barometer for slack in
the economy. Hotel occupancy rate has fallen
from a peak of 90 percent to a still high
80 percent, suggesting limited slack in the real
economy. The implied output gap based on
bivariate filter estimates is 4 percent as of
2016:Q2.

5.

Summary: In total, the various methods tell a
broadly consistent story on output gap dynamics
but the results differ in magnitude. One can
conclude that the output gap peaked at about
7 percent in 2016:Q1 but has since moderated to a
range of 2–4 percent. Though some of these
continue to suggest a material amount of slack,
this remains modest given the size of the
cumulative contraction in the economy. With the
expected recovery, the output gap is expected to
be closed by 2017.

Box 3. First Pillar Pension System
Macao SAR has a young population that is aging quickly. Such demographic pressures, combined with a large gap
between contributions and benefits, will weigh on the first pillar pension system.
Macao SAR’s first pillar pension is a mandatory pay-as-you-go system with relatively modest contributions
and benefits. The monthly contribution is 90 MOP (30 employees, 60 employers), an increase from 45 in January
2017. This rate is low at 0.5 percent of local workers’ median wage of 18000 MOP, versus an average of 20 percent
in advanced economies. Benefits are higher—maximum monthly benefit is 3450 MOP or 19 percent of median
salary and 4 percent of GDP per worker—but still low relative to other systems (30 percent in advanced economies).
The large gap between contributions and benefits requires additional funding. This includes a special
contribution from the gaming sector, a special fee paid by employers of migrant workers, and an earmarked
transfer from the government funded out of general tax revenue. Recently, government transfers have been
increased in excess of the funding deficit to allow social security surpluses designed to fund future obligations.
Under current assumptions, there is a large actuarial pension imbalance due primarily to aging. Projecting
future pension deficits is difficult because both contributions and benefits are adjusted on an ad hoc basis.
Nonetheless, the old-age dependency ratio is expected to rise rapidly from 11 to 45 by 2050. Under current
assumptions, this would result in a significant increase of pension spending, from 0.7 percent of GDP now to
6.5 percent by 2050. 1/ Assuming that contributions and government transfers stay constant in percent of GDP
terms (1.6 percent), Macao SAR’s pension system will face an actuarial imbalance of about 45 percent of GDP from
2015–2050 (including the fund’s 15 percent of GDP in assets).
To meet these obligations, the pension system will need additional government transfers or a change in
underlying parameters. The authorities could draw down ample fiscal reserves but this will reduce resources
available for other investments. Alternatively, they could address the gap within the pension system itself. Three
options are available:
1)

Link social contribution to wage. The current contribution is fixed and adjusted in an ad-hoc manner.
Specifying the contribution in percent of wages and increasing it from the current low level would help
contain the deficit and improve income inequality.

2)

Index pension benefit to inflation. In the past few years, the pension benefit has been adjusted frequently but
lacks an explicit mechanism. Indexing it to inflation could help protect the poor, avoid a rapid increase in the
future, and stabilize the replacement rate.

3) Increase the retirement age from 65. With rising life-expectancy, a corresponding adjustment in retirement
age may also be considered. But given expected years in retirement are similar to other advanced
economies, priority should be given to the first two options, especially on pension benefit indexation, which
would significantly dampen the long-term spending pressure as shown in the scenario analysis.

–––––––––––––––
1/ This estimate takes UN population projections, assumes a moderate increase in the replacement rate (average pension
over output per worker), a constant coverage ratio, and a constant labor participation rate.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—MACAO SAR

Appendix I. Banking Sector
Sector Structure—Banking sector assets are 375 percent of GDP as of end-October 2016; the rest of the
financial sector is small and is primarily composed of insurance funds (assets of 16 percent of GDP) and
pension funds (4 percent of GDP). There are 29 banks in Macao SAR, of which 19 are branches of foreign
banks, seven are subsidiaries of foreign banks, and three are local. The system is relatively concentrated
with the three largest banks—Bank of China Macau, ICBC Macau, and Banco Tai Fung—holding 64
percent of system assets: The Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) sits at 0.23 which is at the upper end of
moderate concentration.
Balance Sheet—The sector can be divided into a domestic traditional banking system dominated by
simple deposits and loans and a large foreign balance sheet reflecting primarily corporate treasury
management, trade finance and offshore services. Excess domestic funding allows the sector to be a net
foreign creditor (79 percent of GDP at end-October).




Domestic—The domestic side is self-funding with a private
sector deposit-loan ratio of 118 percent. Public sector
deposits are large, increasing local funding by another
43 percent of GDP. Roughly half of all domestic loans are to
individuals of which about 60 percent are mortgages. The
other half of domestic loans are to corporates
(20-25 percent go to each hotels and construction).
Foreign—Foreign liabilities are largely deposits (99 percent
of total), half of which are to foreign banks (primarily to
related parties and short term). Foreign assets are evenly
split between claims on banks and nonbanks. Banks claims
are primarily by branches and to related parties.

estimates.

Earnings—About three-quarters of bank income comes from interest margins (as opposed to 40 percent
in Hong Kong) . Despite stable U.S. rates, interest differentials have risen from 135 bps in 2014 to 167 bps
in 2015 largely due to rising foreign business where margins are higher. In 2013–16 period, average return
on assets has been 1.0 percent in Macao SAR vs 1.1 in Hong Kong SAR.
Foreign Currency: Roughly half of resident deposits and 60 percent of domestic loans are consistently in
Hong Kong dollars, reflecting inertia and transactional benefits rather than currency concerns. There has
been a rise in local currency relative to RMB deposits since 2014 following the change in appreciation
expectations on the Mainland.
Geographic exposure: Between end-2012 and mid-2015, the banking system increased its share of foreign
assets in Mainland China from 24 percent to 38 percent of total before falling to 23 percent by mid-2016.
External liabilities to the Mainland have a similar pattern, rising from 18 percent in 2012 to 26 percent by
end-2014 before falling to 18 percent in recent data. In both cases, the recent fall in Mainland exposure
has primarily benefitted Hong Kong SAR which now accounts for 38 percent of foreign assets and
52 percent of liabilities.

Appendix II. Labor Market
Macao SAR’s labor market developments have been remarkable. Between 1999 and 2013, Macao SAR’s
unemployment rate steadily fell from 6.3 percent to 1.8 percent. In the three years since, the
unemployment rate has continued to hover just under 2 percent despite an approximately 30 percent
cumulative contraction in real output. Meanwhile, over the course of the full 16 years since returning to
Chinese sovereignty, Macao SAR’s median real wage growth has averaged 7 percent even as exports of
goods and services have increased by 10 percent suggesting persistent external competitiveness. This
labor market strength reflects a combination of policy choices and structural features unique to the
Macao SAR economy.
Background: Macao SAR has a small population with
relatively high labor force participation (74 percent
compared to OECD average of 71 percent). The
unemployment rate is low at 1.9 percent and, by
construction, is entirely residents (migrants’
residency status is linked to employment). In
addition to the migrants living in Macao SAR, there are
61,000 migrants who live abroad (primarily in Mainland
China) and commute to work daily in Macao SAR but
are not included in the labor force. Thus, of the
458,000 employed in Macao SAR, 179,000 or
39 percent are migrants that either live there or
commute (see table).

Labor Market Strength: The sustained structural improvement and cyclical resilience of the labor
market reflect the following structural factors.


Nature of Labor Demand—The key employing sectors (gaming, hotels, restaurants) are resistant to
automation or outsourcing. They are also relatively moderate in skill requirements which eases ability
to absorb new entrants. The gaming boom has therefore benefited low-skill workers in particular,
resulting in a significant rise in labor participation and fall in unemployment.



Access to Migrants—Decade of gaming boom has driven up labor demand far above the size of the
local population. Thus, access to migrant labor supply both allowed Macao SAR to expand and
prevented excessive upward wage pressure. During downturns, migrants absorb the shock to labor
demand via emigration, keeping unemployment low.



Government Policies—Regulations help provide negotiating leverage to labor that is uncommon in
moderate skill sectors. For example, residents have employment priority over migrants and changes
in wages must be agreed by both parties.



Monopoly Profits—The gaming monopoly’s outsized profits makes capital less likely to leave despite
high taxation (39 percent of revenue) and strong regulatory requirements. It also provided buffer for
casino owners to absorb the recent shock while leaving labor relatively unscathed.

Appendix III. Tourism Sector
Macao SAR has a particularly concentrated economy. Tourism accounted for almost 90 percent of
GDP at the peak and is now down to a still high 67 percent. As comparison, the average share of
tourism in Caribbean economies is just 19 percent. Tourism is also large in absolute terms with
Macao SAR generating the tenth largest dollar receipts in the world (fourth in Asia), a particularly
impressive size given a population of just 647,000.
The large size of the tourism sector today has been driven by the sharp rise in visitors from
Mainland China who now account for 66 percent of total (up from 22 percent in 1999). The strong
Chinese tourism presence has been achieved despite a still controlled visa policy. Mainland Chinese
can only visit by applying through the Individual Visitor Scheme (IVS)—which is only available in
49 cities accounting for 353 million people—or via group visits.
Gaming
The gaming industry consistently accounts for 73–80 percent of total tourism according to the
national accounts and 94 percent of gaming operators’ revenues. The sector is closely regulated
with licenses granted to just six operators who run 38 casinos. There is not excessive market
concentration with the three largest operators each accounting for about 20 percent of total market
share.
Total gaming revenues were US$29 billion in 2015, down from US$45 billion at the 2013 peak.
Macao SAR surpassed Las Vegas in absolute gaming revenues in 2006 and was almost seven times
larger at the 2013 peak. The revenues can be broken down into those from VIP (high spending) and
mass-market customers. The former accounted for 66 percent of total gaming revenues at the peak
in 2013 but has since fallen to 55 in 2015 amid the broader fall in Chinese spending in the luxury
sector in recent years.
Costs, which were US$25 billion in 2015 (down from $38 billion in 2013), can be broken down into
taxes (40 percent), junket commissions (20 percent), nonlabor overhead (20 percent), and payroll
(15 percent). The sector accounts for about 20 percent of total employment in Macao SAR (including
migrants residing abroad), of which roughly one third are “dealers,” who by law must be hired
locally. The median real wage in the sector is currently 26 percent more than economy-wide level.
Non-gaming
Key sectors driving non-gaming tourism are hotels, restaurants, retail, entertainment, and
conventions. Diversification away from gaming is a core government priority: the recently published
five-year plan aims to increase the share of operators’ non-gaming revenue from 6 percent to
9 percent by 2020. The recent surge in hotel capacity from 27,300 rooms in 2014 to an estimated
36,300 in 2016 is considered critical (Las Vegas has 62,000) as supply constraints previously limited
the scope for hosting major events.

Appendix IV. External Sector Assessment
Staff assess Macao SAR’s external position to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policies. Macroeconomic policies are largely appropriate, though there is scope for
i) more domestic absorption in terms of infrastructure investment and ii) closer monitoring of the
quality/liquidity of external assets and the durability of foreign liabilities.

gross external position driven by the banking sector.
But the key drivers of the positive net creditor position are the public sector (fiscal and foreign
exchange reserves) and nonbank corporates (gaming sector profits). The large net foreign assets
suggest limited grounds for concern about medium-term external solvency but ongoing attention
is necessary to the quality and liquidity of foreign assets in the event of a sudden fall in external
liabilities.
Current Account—In 2015, Macao SAR had a current account surplus of 25 percent of GDP, down
from a peak of 41 percent in 2011 before the sharp contraction in tourism exports. Though the real
effective exchange rate has appreciated recently (see below), the fall in exports appears to largely
reflect external developments which significantly reduced spending by high net worth individuals
from the Mainland on luxury goods and services. This shock was similar to an oil price shock, where
the price of gaming rent has fallen, likely permanently. However, even after this shock, the current
account surplus remains exceptionally high. For the most part, this reflects the monopoly rent on
gaming and a small domestic market (limiting scope for re-investing those profits) rather than
external imbalances. However, there is scope to increase investment materially given infrastructure
bottlenecks that must be addressed to expand the scope of tourism. The EBA-lite current account
regression estimates that the current account gap is 7 percent. However, similar to commodity
exporters, the coefficient on fiscal balance in Macao should be much larger compared to an
average country (typically twice as large), as both fiscal and current account balances are
dominated by swings in the monopoly rent. After this coefficient adjustment, the current account
is only 1 percent higher than fundamentals, hence broadly in equilibrium. The 1 percent gap
reflects -1.1 percent residual, and 2.3 percent policy gap (fiscal policy 1.9 percent, reserve change
0.2 percent, and private credit 0.3 percent). The policy gap is not due to domestic policy, but driven
4

Such an estimate is imperfect as it excludes valuation changes but the large net creditor position is what one would
expect given Macao SAR’s average current account surplus of 30 percent of GDP over the 2002–15 period.

8 percent in real effective terms reflecting
dollar strength against both the euro and RMB. The fact that the Macao SAR exchange rate is
pegged to the Hong Kong dollar (and in turn the U.S. dollar) even though 66 percent of tourism
visitors are from Mainland China may pose competitiveness issues going forward if RMB
depreciation were to continue recent trends. That said, thus far, there is no evidence of
overvaluation. Macao SAR has lost some share of the Asian gaming market, falling from 77 percent
in 2013 to 70 percent in 2015 primarily due to some redirection of high-spending VIP gaming
tourists but this appears to reflect external factors (anti-corruption campaign, new gaming centers
opening) rather than price concerns. The EBA REER index regression suggests REER to be more than
30 percent weaker than levels warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies. However, the REER
model is in general not well suited for off-shore financial centers and does not reflecting the unique
feature of Macao SAR as a gaming sector. Consistent with the 1 percent current account gap, staff
assess REER gap to be around -2 percent, broadly in line with fundamentals.

relatively small net outflows. The size of gross
capital flows reflects in part the fact that the financial account is fully liberalized. Significant foreign
assets (including contingent support from Mainland parent banks) and prudent financial regulation
limit risks from potentially volatile capital flows.
FX intervention and reserves level—Because Macao SAR has a currency board arrangement,
international reserves have been built up in a nondiscretionary way. The stock of reserves is about
US$19 billion (44 percent of GDP) as of 3Q:2016. In September, reserves fell below 100 percent of
pataca M2 for the first time since 2000 but remain adequate for precautionary purposes. Macao SAR
also holds significant fiscal reserves (US$43 billion or 95 percent of GDP as of 2015) in foreign
exchange (of which about US$18 billion was funded out of reserves in 2012). These can be an
additional buffer but are primarily intended for investment (domestically and abroad) rather than
supporting the exchange rate regime.

Appendix V. External Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Macao SAR’s external debt is high at almost 200 percent of GDP. Risks related to external debt are mitigated
by Macao SAR’s positive net asset position and the fact that much of the liabilities are obligations of bank
branches to related parties. External debt as a percentage of GDP will moderate in near term as output
normalizes but foreign borrowing will continue to rise in nominal terms as Macao SAR expands its role as an
offshore financial center.
Background - As of end-2015, Macao SAR had an estimated US$90 billion in external debt (199 percent
of GDP). There is no public external debt. The private external obligations include US$76 billion in bank
liabilities and US$14 billion in nonbank liabilities (see table).


Bank—Commercial banks’ external liabilities are
dominated by nonresident deposits (99 percent
of total). Approximately half of the deposit liabilities
are to foreign banks, of which 85–90 percent
are to “related” parties reflecting foreign banks’
use of Macao SAR for corporate treasury
management. Bank and nonbank creditors are
primarily from Hong Kong SAR (52 percent) and
Mainland China (18 percent).

Macao SAR is far lower but as in the case with banks, a
significant portion reflects related party obligations: US$5.8 billion of the total is categorized as direct
investment (intracompany loans). A precise breakdown of the borrowers is not available but data from
Dealogic suggests the obligations are primarily held by gaming operators.
Projection—The underlying dynamics of Macao SAR’s external debt are healthy. First, structurally high
savings rates and limited domestic investment opportunities result in consistent double digit current
account surpluses and large foreign asset accumulation (banks have net foreign assets of 81 percent of
GDP). Second, despite the sharp recent contraction, potential growth remains on the order of 4 percent.
And third, the average de facto nominal interest rate according to the balance of payment is low at
roughly two percent reflecting the dominance of deposit liabilities. Gross external debt is nonetheless
expected to grow in nominal terms as Macao SAR seeks to expand its role as an international financial
center.
Risks—In general, headline debt levels likely overstate risks. Significant related-party lending reduces
probability of a run and significant foreign assets increases ability of banks to fund withdrawals without
relying on the monetary authority’s foreign exchange reserves. That said, it is important to get a better
sense of the maturity of nonresidents nonbank deposits in the banking system and the liquidity and
quality of the assets that back them.

FUND RELATIONS
Membership Status
As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Macao SAR is not a member of
the Fund. The first Article IV consultation discussions since the handover in 1999 took place during
April 22–29, 2014 and the Board discussion took place in July 2014. Its Article IV is in a 24-month cycle.
The latest discussion with the Authority was during a staff visit in November 2016. Outside of the Article
IV process, the Fund has maintained a relationship with Macao SAR, focused mainly on technical
assistance and training. STA provided technical assistance with compiling FSIs in 2013 and on the
balance of payments in 2008, MCM completed an FSAP in 2011, and LEG provided advice on AML/CFT
issues resulting in new legislation in 2006.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Since 1989, Macao SAR has been operating under a currency board arrangement. On April 7, 1977,
the exchange rate of Macao SAR’s currency, the pataca, was formally delinked from the Portuguese
escudo and linked to the Hong Kong dollar at a central rate of MOP 1.075/HK$, and the transaction
rates were allowed to deviate from this rate as long as they were within a band of +/-1 percent of
the central rate. Effective January 1979, the central rate of the pataca was set at MOP 1.038/HK$, and
in September 1983, was adjusted to MOP 1.03/HK$, and the transaction rates were to take place
within a narrow band on either side of the central rate. This arrangement continued through May
1987.
Since then, the pataca has been tied to the Hong Kong dollar at a rate of MOP1.03/HK$, and is
therefore also in effect linked to the US$, at around MOP8/US$. Notes are issued by two banks,
which deliver Hong Kong dollars to the AMCM in return for noninterest bearing certificates of
indebtedness, which serve as the backing for the banknote issue. The Hong Kong dollars are then
counted as part of the official foreign exchange reserves held at the AMCM. Under the currency
board arrangement, the pataca is 100 percent backed by foreign assets. There are no exchange
restrictions on current and capital account transactions. With capital freely mobile, monetary
conditions in MSAR are strongly influenced by conditions in Hong Kong SAR and the United States
market.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 18, 2017)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Macao SAR compiles quarterly and annual estimates of GDP by expenditure
category, at current prices and in volume terms. The volume measures are derived using annual
chain linking methods. The estimates by type of activity (production approach) are compiled in
current prices and in volume terms only at annual frequency, due to the unavailability of relevant
quarterly deflators. A major revision of the compilation process was undertaken in 2016. Macao SAR
reports annual and quarterly GDP to the IMF for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS);
latest data available: 2016: Q3. STA has not provided technical assistance in national accounts to
Macao SAR over the past ten years.
Price Statistics: Macao SAR compiles a monthly consumer price index (CPI) with a base period of
October 2013 to September 2014. The index is rebased every five years and has been available since
October 2009. The current weights were derived from the 2012/13 household income and
expenditure survey. Macao SAR releases a composite CPI, which reflects price changes for the
general population of households, CPI-A that covers households with an average monthly
expenditure of MOP 10,000 to MOP 29,999 (about 50 percent of households), and a CPI-B that
covers households with an average monthly expenditure of MOP 30,000 to MOP 54,999 (about
30 percent of households). Macao SAR submits CPI data to the IMF for publication in IFS.
Government Finance Statistics: Macao SAR reports detailed annual consolidated general
government accounts (budget, 39 extra budgetary units, and the social security fund) in the GFSM
2001 format for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, along with summary
quarterly general government accounts for publication in IFS. However, the GFS series could be
usefully augmented by the reporting of a financial balance sheet, as outlined in the 2010 Board
decision regarding government finance statistics to strengthen fiscal analysis.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) reports, on a timely
basis, monthly monetary data to STA for publication in IFS. These data are reported in the format of
the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for central bank (1SR) and other depository corporations
(2SR), monetary aggregates (5SR) and interest rates and share prices (6SR), which embody the
IMF-recommended methodology for compiling monetary statistics.
Financial sector surveillance: In the area of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the AMCM has
compiled selected time series of FSIs, which are published in its semi-annual publication Monetary
and Financial Stability Review. A statistics mission on FSIs visited AMCM in July 2013 and assisted the
authorities in establishing procedures for compiling FSIs in accordance with the IMF-recommended
framework. The authorities have, since May 2014, regularly reported FSIs to STA for dissemination on
the IMF website.
External sector statistics: The AMCM compiles and disseminates annual balance of payments
(BOP) statistics. The lack of published external debt data, in particular for the non-bank private

sector, is an impediment to the compilation of IIP statistics and the strengthening of the balance
sheet approach framework. Since 2012, the BOP of Macao SAR has been compiled following the
methodology and classification of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6). BOP data for 2002–11 were originally compiled under the
format of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) and converted to the BPM6
format. Although, external sector statistics are not yet compiled on a quarterly basis, Macao SAR
participates in major Fund Statistical Initiatives, such as the Enhanced General Data Dissemination
System (e-GDDS), the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and the Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS). Direct investment abroad by Macao SAR household sector is not covered
in external sector statistics. Household financial investment abroad (portfolio and other investments,
except deposits abroad that can be collected from the BIS data) only covers those transactions
going through local authorized financial institutions, and hence, transactions outside the local
financial channel are not recorded. In addition, compensation of Macao SAR employees earned
abroad is not covered in the BOP. Due to the implementation of the BPM6 methodology in 2012,
personal effects, financial assets, and liabilities of persons changing residence are no longer covered
by a capital transfer in the capital account.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Macao SAR has been participating in the
IMF’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since August 2007.
Macao joined the e-GDDS in August 2007.
The metadata for key macroeconomic
indicators, available on the country page on
the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board, were updated in early October 2016.
