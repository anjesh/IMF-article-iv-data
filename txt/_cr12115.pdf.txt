STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The recovery stalled in the second half of 2011 mainly because of
deteriorating external conditions. With the euro area recession constraining Czech
exports and affecting consumer and business sentiment, economic activity is expected
to remain flat in 2012 and gradually pick up in 2013. Risks are to the downside and
closely related to euro area developments.
Fiscal policy. The authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation and meeting the
headline deficit targets in 2012–13. They are planning additional procyclical measures
under the weakening growth outlook. With public debt at 41.5 percent of GDP, the
Czech Republic has the fiscal space to let automatic stabilizers work; in staff’s view, this
is a preferable policy option. After consistent progress in tackling medium-term fiscal
challenges during 2011, the authorities are revamping the fiscal framework and
planning to enshrine a fiscal rule in legislation.
Monetary policy. With the policy rate at 0.75 percent, monetary conditions are
appropriately supportive of economic activity. However, with inflation expected to be
at target next year, risks tilted to the downside, and fiscal policy constrained, there is
merit in adopting an easing bias.
Financial sector. Financial system stress in the euro area could spill over to otherwise
sound Czech banks via the extensive parent-subsidiary relationships, despite being, on
average, net creditors to their parents. To mitigate the spillover risks, the CNB has
enhanced bank reporting requirements, intensified monitoring of transactions, and
begun implementing recommendations of the recent FSAP mission.
Structural reforms. The government adopted a comprehensive strategy to boost
potential growth. It includes infrastructure development, strengthening institution and
governance, reforming education sector, increasing labor market flexibility, and
improving business climate. The challenge now is implementation.

CONTEXT
A. Recent Developments
1.
The post-crisis recovery stalled in the
second half of 2011 as exports lost
momentum. The expansion since the 2009
recession was almost exclusively driven by
exports, whereas domestic demand stagnated
and currently stands about 7 percent below its
peak. Labor market improvement has been
weak and a moderate output gap remains. As
export growth slowed, real GDP declined in the
last two quarters of 2011, albeit marginally. As
a result, GDP growth for the whole year
declined to 1.7 percent from 2.7 percent
in 2010.

Inflation has risen and was above the
target at end-2011, despite subdued
demand conditions. Inflation hovered slightly
below the 2 percent target during most
of 2011, but increased towards the end of the
year and spiked to 3.7 percent in early 2012,
buoyed by the one-off impact of the VAT
adjustment and food and energy prices. Real
wages increased by a modest ¼ percent
in 2011, implying largely stable unit labor costs.

3.
The external current account deficit
has remained contained. The combination of
robust export performance and restrained
imports kept the external deficit unchanged
from the previous year at 3 percent of GDP
in 2011. The trade surplus increased by about
1 percent of GDP. This was largely offset by an
increase in the income deficit, which reflects
mostly accrued profits on the existing stock of
inward direct investment and reached a record
7.3 percent of GDP. Financing of the current
account deficit has not been an issue, with two
thirds covered by direct investment, mainly
comprising retained earnings of foreign-owned
firms.
4.
The fiscal consolidation has
continued apace. The overall deficit in 2011 is
estimated at 3.8 percent of GDP, better than
previous year’s 4.8 percent. The structural
balance also improved by about
one percentage point, mainly reflecting
expenditure measures such as reductions in the
central government wage bill and better
targeting of social assistance. The public debt
to GDP ratio at 41.5 percent at end-2011
remains manageable and attests to a strong
fiscal position. Policies continue to be geared
towards additional structural consolidation with
a 0.8 percent of GDP improvement

during the fourth quarter of last year, before
recovering in 2012.

5.
Monetary conditions have been
appropriately supportive of economic
activity. The policy rate was cut aggressively
during the 2009 crisis, and has remained at
0.75 percent since May 2010. Despite the
recent spike in inflation, expectations remain
well-contained, while the yield curve is
consistent with a stable policy rate in the next
few months. The floating exchange rate
remains the main shock absorber. The koruna
traded in line with the currencies of
neighboring countries in 2011, albeit with lower
volatility, and depreciated moderately

6.
Heightened global risk aversion has
not led to dislocations in domestic markets.
The sovereign risk premium increased
somewhat in the second half of 2011, but
remained well below the highs seen during
the 2009 crisis, and compares favorably with
regional peers as well as most euro area
countries. Reflecting the strong fiscal position,
long-term government bond yields in local
currency have remained below 4.5 percent even
during the episode of global risk aversion in
late 2011, and have averaged 3.5 percent in
March.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
Economic activity is expected to
remain flat in 2012 and gradually gain
momentum in 2013. The projected recession
in the euro area will constrain exports in 2012.
Low confidence indicators, coupled with the
impact of fiscal consolidation, suggest that
domestic demand will remain anemic in the
short run. Unemployment is expected to
increase marginally, as the output gap widens
somewhat. As external conditions, in

particular in the euro area, improve from the
second half of 2012, activity is expected to
pick up, with a balanced composition.
Improving external demand will be
accompanied by better confidence which will
underpin a moderate domestic demand
recovery. Inflation is forecast to average
slightly above 3 percent in 2012, but below
the 2 percent target in 2013. The current
account deficit will remain well-contained.

8.
The main risks are spillovers from
the euro area. Thanks to sound policies and
strong fundamentals, the Czech economy
appears well positioned to withstand most
downside risks (Annex I, Risk Assessment
Matrix). However, the close integration with
the euro area implies a high risk of spillovers
via trade and bank channels. A deeper
recession in the euro area and a decline of
foreign demand would further depress the
export dependent economy (exports to the

EU accounted for about 83 percent of all
exports and 59 percent of Czech GDP in the
last two years). A potential intensification of
the sovereign debt crisis in Europe also entails
a risk of abrupt deleveraging by (or failures in)
euro area banks, which could adversely affect
domestic credit conditions and the health of
the banking sector at large through parentsubsidiary relationships. Other risks include
commodity price shocks and the real estate
market cycle.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on the appropriate policies to address medium-term fiscal challenges, to
ensure financial stability amid challenging external conditions, to safeguard the successful
monetary policy framework while keeping policy flexibility, and to enhance the growth potential
Box 1. The Authorities’ Policies and Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The policies implemented in 2011 were broadly consistent with previous IMF advice. In particular,
significant progress in reaching medium-term fiscal targets was achieved, while the pension
reform helped address longer-term challenges.
Key Recommendations
Define additional fiscal consolidation measures,
including structural savings in expenditures.

A. Fiscal Policy
9.
Since the last Article IV
consultation, significant progress has been
made in tackling medium-term fiscal
challenges and improving the structural
balance. During the crisis and its aftermath,
the Czech economy experienced a 2.7 percent
of GDP increase in the structural fiscal deficit
and a 13½ percent of GDP public debt spike
from admittedly low levels. Policies since 2010

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

have aimed to address these developments
through higher VAT and excise rates, social
assistance reforms, and changes to the
pension system, as well as restraint of current
expenditure (Box 2). With these policies, the
authorities achieved a sizable reduction of the
fiscal deficit in 2011, while they remain
committed to meeting the general

CZECH REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

government headline deficit target of below
3 percent of GDP in 2013, as agreed with the
European Commission (EC) in the context of
the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). As an
intermediate step towards this goal, the
authorities intend to reduce the headline
deficit to 3.5 percent in 2012.

Republic will still be able to meet the budget
target in 2012 without further expenditure
cuts. Staff recommended, and would have
preferred, letting the 2012 budget be
executed as is, even if this would result in
missing the target. Staff also argued that, if
the outlook worsens significantly, the
authorities should consider re-pacing the
structural consolidation. Of course, this would
depend on the continuation of benign
financing conditions and any changes should
be clearly communicated to the public and
carefully fitted into the context of the
European Union (EU) commitments.

10.
However, the economic outlook has
weakened, requiring additional measures
to counter deteriorating revenue
prospects. Since the 2012 budget was
formulated based on a more favorable
outlook, the authorities are increasingly
concerned about missing the fiscal target. In
order to make up for possible revenue
shortfalls, they announced an expenditure
freeze in late February, which would yield an
improvement of 0.6 percent of GDP in
the 2012 budget result. They intend to
reassess the necessary amounts later in the
year.

Staff argued that procyclical
tightening in addition to the already
ambitious consolidation would
unnecessarily undermine short-term
growth, and recommended letting
automatic stabilizers operate fully. Staff
agreed on the need for further gradual
structural consolidation, but argued that the
Czech Republic has the fiscal space to allow
automatic stabilizers to work around the
baseline outlined in the medium-term budget
framework. Under staff projections, the Czech

12.
While mindful of staff arguments,
the authorities disagreed and considered
adhering to preannounced targets as
necessary based on financial risks and
political commitments. They argued that the
fiscal multiplier is very small, given a large
demand leakage to imports—a view shared
by the staff. More importantly, they stressed
that reducing the fiscal deficit below 3 percent
in 2013 as originally agreed with EU to exit
the EDP, and therefore meeting the 2012
target midway, was critically important for
preserving market confidence and keeping
bond yields low in a challenging environment.
The authorities also noted that the current
government had been elected on a platform
of fiscal rectitude and the long-term
sustainability of public finances, and not
meeting the headline targets could be
construed as going against these
commitments.
13.
Consolidation is set to continue in
the medium term. The government policy
statement of 2010 envisaged a balanced
budget in 2016. In this context, the authorities
are considering new additional measures
in 2013 and 2014, mainly on the revenue side.
These include further adjustment of the VAT

rates and a personal income tax increase. Staff
considered that if the defined contribution
component of the pension system (the
second pillar) is introduced as planned
in 2013 with associated revenue shortfalls for
the budget (Box 2), the unchanged nominal
target defined by the EDP could imply an
overly tight fiscal stance that year constituting
a total structural adjustment of 0.5 percent of
GDP. Authorities took notice, but noted the
need to weigh the short-term impact against
the longer-term benefits of instituting the
second pillar, e.g. giving workers more control
over their retirement plans.

The authorities are revamping the
fiscal policy framework in the context of
the new Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
The authorities are considering various

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

options for a fiscal rule to be enshrined in the
constitution. Staff suggested a structural fiscal
balance rule for the general government with
a debt brake in the form of compensatory
corrections for ex post deviations from the
target. Such a rule would comprehensively
guide fiscal policy and be fully consistent with
the new SGP (Box 3). The proposal currently
under consideration by the government
would serve the same broad objectives,
though with additional complexity and
fragmentation that could complicate an
effective implementation of the rules. A fiscal
council, also under consideration, would
contribute to the transparency and
accountability of the framework. The
authorities’ strong commitment to long-term
fiscal sustainability does not conflict with what
is stipulated in the “Fiscal Compact”, which
the Czech Republic has not signed due to
legal considerations, specifically the reference
to EU institutions in a treaty outside the EU
framework.

CZECH REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Fiscal Implications of the Pension Reform
Parametric changes in the pension system have
improved its sustainability considerably. The
reform adopted in 2011 increased the statutory
retirement age, reduced disability pensions, curtailed
the rate of progressivity in the assessment of
contributions, and extended the insurance period
required for accessing a full pension. These and
other changes to the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system
have cut its long-term deficits from 4-5 percent to
around 2 percent of GDP in 2040-60, and to less
than 1 percent of GDP from 2070.
The reform will also introduce a voluntary
defined-contribution “second pillar” of the
pension system. For those who volunteer to
participate, 3 percentage points of the current public
social security contribution of 28 percent of wages
will be diverted to personal accounts, implying lower
budgetary revenues. Each insured person will have to
add to this an additional 2 percentage points from
his/her own funds. The fiscal impact of this

in terms of the PAYG deficit is estimated to be
CZK 10 billion in 2013 (about ¼ percent of GDP),
and additional CZK 5 billion for both 2014 and 2015,
although there is significant uncertainty around
these estimates as they depend on behavioral
assumptions.

CZECH REPUBLIC

Box 3. The Current Fiscal Framework of the Czech Republic and Options for a Fiscal Rule
The current fiscal framework contains several
standard elements necessary for effective
medium-term planning, but it also has some
weaknesses. The medium-term budget framework
(MTBF), which is a three-year rolling budget for the
general government, is the main source of guidance
for the annual budget preparation. Through the
MTBF, the nominal expenditure ceilings for the
central government budget and six state funds are
derived. While the expenditure ceilings do not cover
local governments and social security funds
explicitly, local governments are usually expected to
prepare a balanced budget. However, the framework
has important weaknesses, notably lack of a durable
fiscal anchor, weak enforcement and independent
monitoring, and limited coverage.
The authorities are in the process of revamping
the fiscal framework. The authorities’ ongoing
discussion on the overhaul of the fiscal framework,
which gained urgency from the new EC directive
regarding the public finances, provides a good
opportunity to introduce an effective mechanism to
safeguard fiscal sustainability, to mitigate the
procyclical bias of fiscal policy, and to ensure
compliance with the new EC fiscal framework.
Staff views a structural balance rule with a debt
brake and an escape clause as an appropriate
option for the Czech Republic. This rule would
help achieve the twin goals of fiscal policy by striking
a balance between fiscal sustainability and cyclical
flexibility. Under this rule, fiscal sustainability will be
ensured through a close alignment of the mediumterm fiscal target with the ultimate objective of debt
stabilization, as well as the automatic correction
mechanism (debt brake) for past unanticipated
deviations. The structural balance rule can also allow
full operation of automatic stabilizers, and it would
be fully in line with the supranational rules that the

Czech Republic is committed to. While estimating
the output gap in a transparent and robust manner
will be the key challenge in implementing this rule,
the strong institutional and analytical capacity of the
Czech government would support this.
The Ministry of Finance currently considers a
framework with multiple targets, all of which will
be enshrined in a constitutional act. The current
proposal under consideration envisages imposing
separate numerical constraints for general
government, central government, local government,
and health insurance funds. While these rules appear
to be sensible individually, there is a significant risk
of a budget fragmentation, by which rules could
complicate the annual budget process with mutually
inconsistent targets. The complexity of the proposal
would also be detrimental to the transparency and
accountability of the fiscal framework.
The effective implementation of the fiscal rule
will also depend on its transparency and
accountability. In this regard, broader reforms are
highly warranted, including to provide stronger
legislative support, effective monitoring and
enforcement mechanism, and clear understanding of
roles and responsibilities. Specifically, a
constitutional amendment to outline the principles
of debt stabilization, together with an introduction
of new ordinary laws that define the operational
details of the fiscal rule, would confer more stability
to the fiscal framework. A borrowing constraint on
local government budget would be useful to make
local fiscal policy fully in line with the overall national
goals. A fiscal council that monitors compliance with
the rule and produces independent forecasts would
also contribute to greater transparency and
accountability of the framework.

B. Monetary Policy
15.
Historically low rates remain
appropriate in the context of the forwardlooking inflation targeting framework and
the negative output gap, and an easing

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

bias may usefully complement this stance.
Inflation is projected to overshoot the
inflation target of 2 percent in 2012 and
reach 3.5 percent. However, this is mostly

CZECH REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

due to the VAT adjustment, which is beyond
monetary policy’s influence. Commodity
prices are the main source of inflation in the
period ahead. There are no signs of
demand-side inflation pressures, and wage
growth is subdued against still high
unemployment. Medium-run inflation
expectations have continued to converge
towards the target. Staff projects that inflation
will fall slightly below the target in 2013, and
euro area developments and fiscal tightening
highlight further downside risks. Against this
background staff sees merit in shifting to an
easing bias to sustain the benefits of a
strongly expansionary monetary policy.
16.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) sees
risks to inflation as broadly balanced and
maintains a neutral bias. The consensus view
of the CNB at the time of the discussions was
that the current high rate of inflation and the
koruna posed upside risks, while the negative
output gap posed downside risks. Individual
Board members saw the balance of risks in
slightly different shades. Since the discussions,
the koruna has appreciated and is no longer
seen as an upside risk for inflation, but
commodity prices have risen rapidly in the
same period to emerge as a short-term
inflationary factor. The authorities agreed that
there are no emerging macroprudential risks
associated with the low rates, as lending
remains subdued across categories and asset
prices remain within historical norms. The
authorities reiterated the benefits of a flexible
policy stance, including the possibility of
further easing if downside risks intensify.
17.
Given the low policy rate, staff
discussed with the authorities options for
unconventional policy measures in the
context of disinflationary adverse
scenarios. The options include a commitment
to keeping policy rates low for an extended

period, quantitative easing, and intervening in
the foreign exchange market. Staff argued
that the principal considerations in choosing
among the instruments are their effectiveness
and the ease of return to the standard
inflation targeting framework, which served
the economy very well. A systemic liquidity
surplus in the banking system and already low
long-term rates suggest that the first two
tools are likely to be limited in effectiveness.
Given the importance of the exchange rate
channel for the economy, staff suggested the
possible use of regular and preannounced
foreign exchange interventions, in particular,
in case the exchange rate fails to fully respond
to negative shocks. Reserves are adequate but
not high by the standard metrics and can
accommodate such interventions. Unsterilized
interventions can both expand the monetary
base and limit currency appreciation. The
authorities broadly agreed with these
considerations, while noting that they saw the
likelihood of such a disinflationary
environment rather low.
18.
The free floating exchange rate
regime continues to function as a factor of
support for macroeconomic stability. The
exchange rate has functioned as the main
absorber of external shocks, and together
with limited foreign exchange mismatches, it
has facilitated the implementation of an
independent and effective monetary policy.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the
koruna exchange rate is broadly in line with
its fundamentals. This is confirmed by a stable
market share in world markets, a moderate
current account deficit, a relative price level
that is consistent with the country’s income
level, as well as the estimates based on the
CGER methodology (Box 4). The government
has not announced a target date for euro
adoption.

Box 4. External Sector Assessment
 The koruna has continued on a long-term
appreciation trend. Following the large swing
in 2008-09, the koruna has sustained a moderate
appreciation trend in both nominal and real
terms, with fluctuations around this path coming
from global risk sentiment. ULC-based real
exchange rate growth has been more subdued
suggesting that a large part of the appreciation is
absorbed by favorable wage productivity
dynamics.

Following earlier robust gains, market share of
Czech exports has broadly stabilized in the last
three years.

Despite consistent trade surpluses, large income
transfers on the stock of direct investment lead to
a moderate current account deficit. In recent
years, NFA has deteriorated under the influence
of current account deficits, but not at a pace or
scale that would suggest competitiveness
problems. In addition, NFA excluding the direct
investment stocks is positive, which mitigates the
vulnerabilities associated with the external
position.

C. Financial Sector
19.
Czech banks are highly profitable
and self-financed with low loan-to-deposit
ratios and strong capital and liquidity
buffers. The banks can comfortably satisfy
current and future supervisory standards,
specifically Basel III and CRD4. Non-performing
loans have increased after the 2009 crisis, but
remain manageable at 5.5 percent. Subdued
credit growth is mostly due to prudence in
both demand and supply sides of the credit
market. Consumers and corporates are not
overly indebted by international comparison
and banks continue to expand in profitable
lending activities, all of which bodes well for
future deepening of the financial sector. Recent
events in the euro area financial system have

not changed this broad picture. Domestic
credit growth increased to about 5½ percent
in 2011, lending margins declined, and loan
growth outpaced deposit growth, suggesting
little deleveraging. Moreover, comfortable
liquidity and very limited currency mismatches
in final borrowers’ balance sheets suggest that
the system is robust. Sharp property price falls
could pose a risk, but the recent moderation of

price declines and the fact that a large part of
the increase in recent years is undone suggest
the likelihood of such an outcome is low. An
increase in new mortgage loan volumes is also
supportive of the real estate market.
20.
Despite solid fundamentals, the
Czech financial system is confronted with a
number of risks mainly from external
spillovers. With banks largely owned by euro
area parent groups, the main risks to the sector
stem from negative developments in the euro
area, which would affect the Czech subsidiaries.
The Czech banking system has a net external
creditor position, which reduces the risks of
rapid deleveraging1. Group-wide capital
scarcity could set a higher threshold for new
lending in terms of profitability and risk taking.
Funneling capital and liquidity out from the
Czech subsidiaries to parent group banks is
another plausible scenario, but only under
extreme stress and uncertainty, as the stakes in
the Czech subsidiaries carry significant value
on a stand-alone basis. The CNB is aware of
these risks, and has tightened the reporting
requirements on transactions between parents
and subsidiaries. A range of stress tests run
during the FSAP mission found that the system
would be resilient against these key risks, using
simulated shocks including a large drop in GDP
(about twice the magnitude of the 2009 crisis),
a protracted stagnation, and failures in parent
banks. Only when a large GDP drop and

The BIS statistics indicate that foreign banks have a
small net creditor position vis-a-vis the Czech banks of
about 3% of Czech banks’ balance sheet. However, this

CZECH REPUBLIC

parent bank failures2 are combined, does the
system-wide capitalization fall below the
regulatory limit—a shortfall of about 2 percent
of GDP.
21.
The authorities are aware of these
risks, and have adequate facilities to address
them. In the last few years, the CNB has
strengthened macroprudential supervision by
setting up a separate department and
allocating more resources as a first defense
against systemic risks, including external
spillovers. The authorities have strengthened
the liquidity provision framework since
the 2009 crisis with a standing collateralized
liquidity window, and stand ready to take
bank-specific prudential measures, should the
need arise.
22.
The FSAP exercise confirmed the
underlying soundness of the Czech financial
system and institutional framework, but
made several recommendations aimed at
further improvements. Staff found the CNB
to be an effective integrated supervisor overall,
but highlighted the need for more intensive
supervision.

The Czech banks have exposures to their parents
equivalent to about half of their capital. Stress tests
were run using an assumption of system-wide
write-offs of 40 percent on these exposures.

It also recommended operationalizing the bank
resolution framework, strengthening the
macro-prudential policy framework to ensure
that warning signals would be translated into
policy actions quickly, and broadening the
mandate of the CNB (Box 5).
23.
The authorities welcomed the
mission’s recommendations, and have
already begun implementation in many
areas. The amendments to the CNB Law
broadening the CNB’s mandate have been sent
to the parliament and are expected to be
adopted later in 2012. Legal amendments
regulating the activities of credit unions are
also under preparation. The limit on banks’
exposures to parent groups are planned to be
reduced from 100 percent to 50 percent of
bank capital from July 2012. Work is also
ongoing to strengthen the macro-prudential
policy framework and stress testing.

CZECH REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. FSAP Main Findings and Recommendations
While the Czech financial institutions were found resilient to the effects of ongoing global crisis, it was also
identified that several elements of the financial policy framework need strengthening.
CNB mandate. The legal setting for the CNB financial stability mandate should be strengthened. Elevating
the financial stability mandate beyond a supporting element of achieving the price stability will establish a
stronger accountability framework for all of these functions.
Prudential requirements. The decision of the CNB to introduce extraordinary reporting requirements of
liquidity position and exposures between Czech banks and their foreign parents was a welcome
development. In the event of a material deterioration in the condition of foreign parent banks, the CNB
should consider deploying firm-specific prudential measures, such as increased capital and liquidity
requirements, pre-approval of significant intra-group transactions, and reducing the intra-group limits.
Supervisory resources. The regulatory and supervisory framework was found generally sound. The
assessment of the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision noted that the regulation and
supervision of banks has been markedly strengthened since the 2001 FSAP. A few weaknesses that were
identified related mainly to inadequate resources of the CNB.
Macro-prudential policy framework. Several recommendations were made in order to strengthen the
macro-prudential policy framework, particularly by formalizing the decision-making mechanism on macroprudential policy issues.
Crisis management and bank resolution. Several elements of the crisis management and resolution
framework need strengthening. In particular, the deposit insurance fund should be enlarged, its payout
triggers should be clarified, and the use of public funds to provide exceptional support to banks should be
further operationalized.

D. Structural Issues
24.
Accelerating structural reforms is
critical for boosting potential growth.
Convergence of Czech per capita output
towards Germany, an appropriate benchmark,
has stalled in recent years. While it is difficult
to distinguish this phenomenon from the
cyclical factors at this stage, structural factors
could also be playing a role. Earlier rapid
convergence, underpinned by trade
integration, technology transfer, and an
inexpensive and skilled labor force, produced
a competitive economy with a strong exportoriented manufacturing sector. However, as
the economy nears the technology frontier
and labor costs converge to Western
European levels, it becomes more important

to be proactive in seeking new growth areas
while monitoring and addressing any growth
bottlenecks.
25.
Several areas emerge as the key
priorities in that regard. International
competitiveness surveys and OECD reports
highlight cumbersome business regulations,
problems with the education system and
human capital, persistent rigidities in the labor
market, technology and scientific
infrastructure weaknesses, low quality of
institutions and governance issues as the key
obstacles to growth.
26.
The government adopted a
comprehensive reform strategy to address

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CZECH REPUBLIC

these challenges. It sets an ambitious goal of
making the Czech economy one of the 20
most competitive economies in the world
by 2020. The strategy outlines concrete plans
for developing infrastructure, strengthening
institutions and governance, reforming the
education sector, further increasing labor
market flexibility, and improving the business
climate (Box 6).

27.
Implementation will be a challenge.
Many line ministries are involved in the
strategy, and enhancing cooperation among
the ministries and providing centralized
monitoring would be pivotal in implementing
the reform plans. The authorities also view
coordination with the corporate sector as well
as universities as critical for implementation.

Box 6. Structural Reform Strategy
The reform strategy adopted by the government
in September 2011 calls for result-oriented
reforms and empirical evaluation of government
policies. To guide the reforms, the strategy authors
developed concrete proposals (“scorecards”) for
more than 40 projects in the nine main areas
(“pillars”) of the strategy. These pillars are
innovation, financial markets, labor markets,
education, healthcare, macroeconomics,
infrastructure, institutions, and enterprise and the
market for goods and services. The scorecards set
time-tables and assign responsibilities for the key
reform measures. Their implementation will be
monitored by the inter-ministerial Competitiveness
Council.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

In late 2011, the government developed a new
export strategy targeting diversification of
products and markets. The new strategy aims to
reduce the reliance on the core European markets,
and limit concentration of exports in several key
products and large firms. Twelve priority markets for
exports have been selected, which comprise Brazil,
China, India, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia, Serbia,
Turkey, Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam. In
parallel, the strategy calls for strengthening the
export-financing institutions to support small and
medium-sized exporters.

CZECH REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Since the last Article IV
consultation, significant progress has been
made in tackling medium-term fiscal
challenges. Staff welcomes the authorities’
resolute implementation of the pension
reform, including the retirement age increase
and other parametric changes to the PAYG
system, which was accompanied by raising
the preferred VAT rate from 2012 as an
intermediate step towards the unification of
the two rates in 2013. Continuation of
pension, health, and tax reforms is important
for securing long-term sustainability of the
public sector.
29.
Short-run fiscal policy needs to
strike a balance between consolidation and
avoiding an overly contractionary stance.
Staff believes that letting automatic stabilizers
operate fully in 2012 to accommodate any
cyclically driven revenue shortfalls is
appropriate. Moreover, if the outlook worsens
significantly, the planned fiscal consolidation
could be repaced as well, particularly in 2013.
If the defined contribution component of the
pension system (the second pillar) is
introduced as planned in 2013 with associated
revenue shortfalls for the budget, the
unchanged nominal targets as defined by the
EDP could imply an overly tight fiscal stance.
30.
The government’s plan to introduce
a fiscal rule is a welcome step for
safeguarding long-term sustainability.
Given the current manageable level of public
debt and sound institutional capacity in the
Czech Republic, consideration could be given
to a structural balance rule for the general
government, augmented with a debt brake.
Such a rule would ensure fiscal sustainability
while avoiding unwarranted procyclicality, and
would be consistent with the new EU fiscal

framework. Other types of rules, including the
one currently under consideration, may
achieve the same broad objectives. However,
it is essential for any rule to have an
appropriately wide coverage, provide clear
guidance to the annual budgeting process,
and be consistent with supranational rules. An
independent fiscal council would foster an
effective implementation of the fiscal rule.
31.
Monetary policy is appropriate,
although an easing bias could be
considered. Consistent implementation of
the inflation targeting framework continues to
serve the economy well, and inflation
expectations remain well-anchored. The policy
rate at 0.75 percent for almost two years
coupled with market expectations for a
continuation of the low rates have provided
needed support to the economy without
excessive risk taking in any particular financial
market segment. Despite some upside risks
arising from commodity prices, in view of the
likely downside disinflationary effects and the
fiscal policy constraints, there is a case for an
easing bias.
32.
With the already low policy rate, it
is important to have strategies for coping
with the zero-bound constraint. Given the
limited room for conventional monetary
policy, the use of unconventional tools may
need to be contemplated for scenarios of
significant undershoot of the inflation target.
Key criteria in deciding among the potential
actions should include effectiveness against
disinflationary pressures, as well as the ease of
reversing them. Given the importance of the
exchange rate channel for the economy,
foreign exchange interventions may be
considered in this regard, in particular, in case

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT CZECH REPUBLIC

the exchange rate fails to fully respond to
negative shocks.
33.
The Czech financial system has
proved resilient to the effects of the global
crisis, but spillover risks remain elevated.
Despite slow GDP growth at home and
financial strains abroad, the banks show good
performance, with strong capitalization, solid
profits, and ample liquidity. This resilience,
which has been confirmed by the FSAP stress
tests, reflects to a large extent a relatively
conservative structure of bank balance sheets
(particularly low loan-to-deposit ratios) and
relatively low indebtedness of the corporate
and household sectors. Nevertheless, the
financial system is facing a number of risks,
particularly related to the macroeconomic and
financial developments in the euro area,
where the parents of major Czech banks are
based.
34.
The authorities’ efforts to
strengthen the financial stability policy
framework are encouraging. The CNB has

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

already started to improve bank reporting
requirements, to intensify monitoring of
transactions between parents and
subsidiaries, and to implement many of the
FSAP recommendations. It would be
important to implement all FSAP
recommendations, particularly in the areas of
bank supervision and crisis management.
35.
Steady implementation of the
structural reforms is critical to boost
potential growth. The government’s
comprehensive reform strategy is a welcome
first step for improving international
competitiveness. Reinvigorating the
“Competition Council” is another important
step in the right direction. Implementation of
these plans requires sustained efforts.
36.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with the Czech
Republic be held on the usual 12-month
cycle. The Czech Republic is an Article VIII
country, and its data provision is adequate for
surveillance (Informational Annex).

Low Property price declines subsided for the most part, but a
renewed decline is still possible, though not very likely. Unsold
inventory continue to pressure prices, but mortgages are performing
very well thanks to prudent LTV ratios and low interest rates.

High The financial system has high exposure to the real estate
market through mortgages as well as credit to developers.
Widespread losses on these portfolios could lead to financial
instability.

Safe-haven inflows to
Czech assets

Low The low indebtedness of the Czech Republic may make Czech
assets look attractive to those seeking stability. However, the real
economy is so tightly linked to the euro area that financial
decoupling is an unlikely prospect. In addition, the local asset
markets are quite small and not very liquid.

High A sharp appreciation would hurt Czech exports, and, under
current demand conditions, would lead to a severe disinflationary
environment.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Rodrigo Valdés and Vivek Arora

The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic published an update of the Convergence
Program on April 25. Earlier in April, the coalition partners in the government agreed on
new fiscal consolidation measures for 2013–15, which are incorporated in the program. 1
The new information does not affect the thrust of the staff appraisal.

The update of the Convergence Program provides a medium-term fiscal
projection where the general government deficit gradually declines through 2015.

1

The fiscal balance was better than expected in 2011. The general government
deficit in 2011 is now estimated to be 3.1 percent of GDP, significantly lower than
the budget target of 4.6 percent and the staff projection at the time of the mission

Since the agreement, the structure of the three party coalition (ODS - the Civic Democratic
Party, TOP09, and VV-Public Affairs) has changed. The smallest party (VV) was replaced by a
new group formed by its ex-members. The government of the new coalition won a vote of
confidence in the parliament on April 27.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION CZECH REPUBLIC

of 3.8 percent. Relative to the staff projection, the difference is mainly due to the
lower-than-expected public investment.


The authorities now plan to contain the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2012. At
the time of the mission discussions, the authorities expressed the concern that the
3.5 percent budget target could be missed in 2012, and announced a freeze of
expenditures equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP. The deficit figure in the program of
3.0 percent of GDP reflects this freeze.



The authorities intend to continue the fiscal consolidation in 2013 and
onwards. In the scenario described in the program, the general government deficit
will be brought below 3 percent in 2013 as required by the excess deficit procedure
(EDP), with further deficit reductions foreseen for 2014–15. Additional measures are
already envisaged to ensure this consolidation path.

2.
The coalition partners agreed on a package of consolidation measures to
achieve the fiscal targets. These measures are geared towards the revenue side. The
two VAT rates, which were to be unified at 17.5 percent in 2013, are now planned to be
increased by one percentage point each to 15 and 21 percent in 2013. The personal
income tax rate will be hiked by one percentage point to 20 percent, while several
exemptions and tax credits will be abolished. On the expenditure side, the bulk of
savings are expected to come from changing the pension indexation formula and
streamlining public expenditures.

3.
The thrust of the staff appraisal does not change. The authorities’ projection
suggests that the previous 3.5 percent budget deficit target in 2012 can be met without
further expenditure cuts. Staff remains of the view that short-run fiscal policy could let
automatic stabilizers operate fully to strike a better balance between consolidation and
avoiding overly contractionary stance.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Czech Republic
On May 4, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic. 1
Background
The post-crisis recovery stalled in the second half of 2011 as exports lost momentum. The
expansion since the 2009 recession was almost exclusively driven by exports, whereas
domestic demand stagnated and remains about 7 percent below its peak. Economic activity is
expected to remain flat in 2012 and gradually gain momentum as external conditions improve.
Inflation has risen, and is expected to overshoot the target in 2012 before coming down in 2013,
buoyed by the one-off impact of the VAT adjustment and food and energy prices. The
combination of robust export performance and restrained imports kept the external deficit
unchanged from the previous year at 3 percent of GDP in 2011 despite an increase in the
income deficit.
The fiscal consolidation has continued apace. The overall deficit in 2011 is estimated to be 3.1
percent of GDP, significantly better than the previous year. The structural balance also
improved by about one percentage point, mainly reflecting expenditure measures such as
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

reductions in the central government wage bill and better targeting of social assistance. The
public debt to GDP ratio at 41.2 percent at end-2011 remains manageable and attests to a
strong fiscal position.
Monetary conditions have been appropriately supportive of economic activity. The policy rate
was cut aggressively during the crisis, and remains at 0.75 percent since May 2010. Despite the
recent inflation spike, inflation expectations remain well-contained, while the yield curve is
consistent with a stable policy rate in the next several months. The floating exchange rate
remains the main shock absorber.
The Czech financial system has proved resilient to the effects of the global crisis. Czech banks
do not depend on wholesale or external funding (rather, the Czech banking sector is a net
external creditor); credit growth is funded mainly by domestic deposits with the loan-to-deposit
ratio of around 70 percent.
Heightened global risk aversion has not led to dislocations in domestic markets. The sovereign
risk premium increased somewhat in the second half of 2011, but remained well below the
highs seen during the 2009 crisis, and compares favorably with regional peers as well as most
euro area countries. Reflecting the strong fiscal position, long-term government bond yields in
local currency have remained below 4.5 percent even during the episode of global risk aversion
in late 2011, and have averaged 3.5 percent in March.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Czech economy is well positioned in the current global
economic climate, underpinned by prudent policies and strong fundamentals. Directors
commended the significant progress made in consolidating public finances and the authorities’
strong commitment to long-term fiscal sustainability. Against the backdrop of an uncertain
external environment, Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to the growth
outlook, continue to strengthen the policy framework for financial stability, and accelerate
structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and potential growth.
Directors discussed the appropriate fiscal policy stance in light of the weaker economic outlook
for 2012. A number of Directors emphasized the importance of adhering to the fiscal targets to
preserve the credibility of economic policies and market confidence, while not ruling out the role
of automatic stabilizers if the situation deteriorates further. Other Directors saw merit in allowing
automatic stabilizers to operate fully in 2012, and in the event that the growth outlook worsens
significantly, in repacing the fiscal consolidation path without jeopardizing the medium-term
objectives. Directors welcomed the government’s plan to improve the fiscal framework,
including through introducing a fiscal rule and an independent fiscal council. They encouraged
further efforts to reform the pension, health care, and tax systems, with a view to safeguarding
the long-term sustainability of public finances.

3
Directors broadly agreed that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and that the
inflation-targeting framework continues to serve the economy well. A number of Directors
considered that risks to inflation are broadly balanced, warranting a neutral bias. Directors
welcomed the monetary authorities’ intention to remain flexible. A few Directors, noting that
inflation expectations are well anchored, saw scope for adopting a more accommodative policy
stance in light of deteriorating growth prospects. Additional policy options could be explored to
prepare for a possible disinflationary scenario.
Directors observed that the Czech financial system remains profitable and resilient, reflecting a
conservative structure of bank balance sheets and the low indebtedness of the corporate and
household sectors. They welcomed recent steps to strengthen the macroprudential framework
and reporting requirements for banks’ liquidity positions and intra-group exposures. Directors
looked forward to further progress in implementing the FSAP recommendations, particularly on
bank supervision and crisis management.
Directors stressed that steady implementation of structural reforms is key to boost potential
growth. The government’s comprehensive reform strategy is a welcome step toward improving
international competitiveness. Key priorities include developing infrastructure, improving labor
market flexibility, and strengthening institutions and governance.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Czech Republic
and Miroslav Kollar, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 4, 2012

The Czech authorities thank the Article IV and the FSAP teams for constructive exchange of
views during their missions.
Economic development and outlook
Strong exports drove the economic recovery in 2010 and continued in 2011 when real GDP
growth reached 1.7 percent. However, towards the end of 2011, the Czech economy entered
into a mild recession in tune with similar developments in the euro area, which is the Czech
Republic’s main trading partner. Fiscal consolidation and the conservative and cautious
consumer behavior of Czech households contributed to the slowdown. As external demand
picks up, real GDP growth should resume in 2013. For this year, the Czech authorities expect
growth in the order of 0 - 0.2 percent of GDP and in the order of 1.3 - 1.9 percent in 2013,
when the loss in absolute real GDP due to the crisis is expected to be recovered.
Employment creation reflects sluggish growth and the uncertainty about developments in the
euro area. Unemployment may gradually rise from 6.7 percent in 2011 to 7.2 percent in
2013. This will be a drag on household consumption.
The current account deficit is projected to shrink by 0.6 percent of GDP to about 2.3 percent
in both 2012 and 2013. While the trade and services account is in surplus, the income
account contributes to the overall deficit mainly because of dividends on foreign direct
investments paid to non-residents (of which 1/3 is reinvested in the Czech Republic). The
current account deficit should remain at a sustainable level.
At the end of 2011, the net international investment position was -49 percent of GDP.
Foreign direct investment liabilities of the Czech Republic accounted for 56 percent of total
external liabilities. The Czech Republic’s external debt was 49.2 percent of GDP, equally
divided between public and private debt.
Monetary policy and exchange rate
Credible inflation-targeting monetary policy, flexible exchange rate as well as integrated
financial sector supervision within the CNB served the country well during the crisis. The
CNB did not have to rely on any unconventional monetary policy measures during this crisis
period.

2
The macro-financial panel established within the CNB to integrate monetary policy analysis,
supervision and macroprudential analysis ahead of each monetary-policy meeting of the
CNB Bank Board serves the policymakers well in informing them about broader financial
sector developments in the economy.
Annual changes in monthly headline inflation increased from close to zero levels at the end
2009 to 3.8 percent year-on-year in March 2012. Monetary-policy-relevant inflation, i.e.
inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, also rose slightly to
2.7 percent in March 2012 and is thus in the upper half of the tolerance band around the
inflation target (i.e. 2 percent headline inflation with tolerance band of ± 1 percent).
The main sources of inflation are administered prices (mostly natural gas prices) and food
prices – reflecting first-round effects of the hikes in VAT rates – as well as fuel prices and
the gradual pass-through of the depreciated exchange rate to prices. However, core inflation
remains slightly negative consistent with the disinflationary development of the domestic
economy.
The forecast assumes that headline inflation will be just above 3 percent for most of 2012
owing to the VAT increase and will fall below the CNB target (i.e. below 2 percent) in 2013.
Consistent with well-anchored inflation expectations, the CNB’s forecast expects stability of
market interest rates in the near future and a modest decline thereafter, and the exchange rate
to appreciate gradually against the euro from its currently weakened level.
The CNB considers the level of foreign exchange reserves as adequate, amounting to
22 percent of GDP, covering 43 percent of all external debt liabilities of domestic entities,
23 percent of total banking sector assets, and 3.6 months of imports.
Czech banking sector
The Czech banking sector proved highly resilient throughout both the U.S. subprime crisis
and the euro area crisis, mainly thanks to sound fundamentals prior to the crisis. Czech banks
follow a traditional banking model. Their assets do not include substantial amounts of
structured products. The share of foreign-exchange denominated loans is very low. Czech
banks are primarily funded from local deposits. The Czech banking sector operates in an
environment of excess liquidity. During this crisis, Czech banks – which are largely
subsidiaries of euro area banks – served as net creditors to their parent banks in euro area.
The loan-to-deposit ratio of the Czech banking sector is 73 percent, among the lowest in the
European Union. In recent years, the Czech banking sector has been the most profitable and
stable in the Central and Eastern Europe, with ROE above 20 percent, and CAR around
15 percent. The share of non-performing loans in total loans is leveling up at 6.4 percent.
Almost 60 percent of non-collateralized loans to households and corporations are
provisioned. The largest Czech banks substantially exceed the EBA 9 percent Tier 1 ratio

3
recommendation. There have been no signs of loan deleveraging driven by recapitalization
needs of the euro area parent banks.
The FSAP’s stress tests in November-December 2011 highlighted the resilience and
profitability of the Czech banking sector. Even in the scenario of a severe recession in
Europe accompanied by losses of the subsidiaries on their exposures to their euro area
parents, the banking sector as a whole would remain only slightly undercapitalized,
potentially requiring only a small amount of fiscal resources. Even in this scenario the banks
would recover these small capital losses in as soon as two years thanks to the profitable
business model.
The resilience of the Czech banking sector to severe stress was also confirmed by the most
recent February 2012 stress tests by the CNB. The capitalization of the entire sector would
remain above the regulatory minimum of 8 percent even in a significantly adverse stress
scenario combining negative developments in the domestic and external economy and
renewed uncertainty in financial markets caused by an escalation of the debt crisis in the
indebted euro area countries.
Since 2009, there is close cooperation between the CNB, the Ministry of Finance and the
Deposit Insurance Fund.
FSAP update
The Czech authorities welcome the positive assessment of the Czech regulatory and
supervisory framework. They acknowledge the extensive work done by the assessment team,
who delivered very well elaborated documents. Generally, the CNB appreciates the
recognition of the resilience and stability of the Czech financial system as well as the
statement that compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision
has improved markedly since the previous assessment and after the integration of the
supervision of the whole financial sector into the CNB. The CNB values the
recommendations provided by the FSAP team and works closely with the Ministry of
Finance on following-up on these recommendations.
Fiscal policy
The Czech Republic was one of the first European countries to start fiscal consolidation in
2010. The fiscal deficit trajectory is to reach 3.0 percent of GDP in 2012; 2.9 percent in 2013
and 1.9 in 2014. This will bring the general government deficit below 3 percent of GDP by
2013 as required by the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). The budget should be
balanced by 2016.

4
Given the low public debt ratio (gross general government debt in 2011 was 41.2 percent of
GDP, among the lowest in the EU), the medium-term budget objective for the Czech
Republic under the Stability and Growth Pact is a structural deficit not exceeding 1 percent
of GDP. This objective is likely to be reached by 2016.
The general government deficit improved significantly during the last 3 years and reached
3.1 percent of GDP in 2011. The bulk of the measures in 2011 consisted of expenditure cuts,
particularly of reduction in salaries of public sector employees (excluding teachers and
doctors), reduction of selected social benefits and non-mandatory current expenditures. With
fiscal revenues weakening due to the slowdown, additional measures are needed to reach a
deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP in 2012. To this end, the government intends to freeze the
budget expenditures by CZK 23.6 billion. The expenditures of the Ministry of Education are
expected to be cut by the least, in order to keep the focus on education, science and R&D
intact. Also, the government adjusted the value added tax rates since January 2012. The
reduced rate was increased by 4 percentage points from 10 percent to 14 percent.
Although the staff recommends allowing the automatic stabilizers to operate and to re-pace
the planned fiscal consolidation if economic outlook worsens significantly, the government’s
preferred fiscal policy stance is maintaining the trajectory of fiscal consolidation even in
temporary unfavorable economic conditions.
The trust of the market in the continuation of the fiscal consolidation is reflected in low
funding costs for the public debt. Government bond yields have been decoupling downwards
from its regional peers since the beginning of 2011. Standard & Poor’s upgraded the credit
rating of Czech Republic in August 2011 by two notches to AA- (stable outlook) based on
the authorities’ strong commitment to fiscal consolidation and a prudently managed
economy.
On April 11, 2012, the government approved a set of measures to secure the implementation
of the planned fiscal consolidation. The expenditure measures include rationalization of the
public administration, cuts in renewable energy subsidies, or temporary lowering of
indexation of pensions for the next three years. The revenue measures include a VAT hike by
1 percentage point for both rates to 21 percent and 15 percent for the next three years, a
1 percentage point increase in PIT for all income segments, a 7 percentage points additional
PIT surcharge for high-income earners, tax hikes on tobacco, introduction of tax on nonsparkling wine and a carbon tax, cancellation of oil tax subsidy for agriculture producers, a
1 percentage point increase in tax on real estate transfers, and the inclusion of the revenues of
the state-owned forestry to the general budget.
In order to smooth the impact of the fiscal consolidation on economic growth, the
government intends to come up with a package of growth-enhancing measures by mid May.
These could include more effective drawing of EU funds, lowering the administrative burden

5
for businesses, promotion of exports, support for innovations and more effective use of state
assets.
On April 11, 2012, the government outlined its plans for a constitutional fiscal responsibility
act to be adopted by the end of 2012. The act will (i) establish an independent fiscal council
which would assess the fiscal impact of new legislation, conduct debt-sustainability analysis
and monitor and evaluate how governments meet their fiscal goals, (ii) introduce a debt
ceiling and a list of measures to be initiated when the debt approaches the ceiling, (iii)
introduce fiscal rules for all levels of the government, including municipalities.
On April 25, 2012, the government coined the consolidation path and the changes to fiscal
institutions as approved on April 11, 2012 into its Convergence program for the period 20112015. The Convergence program is submitted to the European Commission and the Council
as a fulfillment of the commitments stemming from the European semester.
Structural reforms
Pension reform
The new pension system will be based on three pillars. The pay-as-you-go pillar will remain
the core of the pension system. The reform will introduce the second fully-funded definedcontribution pillar, which will involve the possibility to optionally transfer (opt-out) a part of
social contributions from the first pillar together with additional private contributions from
net income to chosen private pension fund(s). Investing in private funds will be optional, but
irreversible; workers can choose to continue heading full pension payments to the first pillar
only. The third pillar which enables additional contributions to private pension funds with
state subsidy will remain almost unchanged by the reform. The pension reform is primarily
aimed at people younger than 35, but older people can also voluntarily enter the second
pillar. The estimated shortfall of revenues from social security contribution stemming from
the introduction of the second pillar is already included in the fiscal outlook of the Ministry
of Finance. The pension reform is planned to take effect in 2013.
Health care reform
The first phase of the health care reform increases patients' participation in health care and
introduces so-called above-standard care. The reform came into effect on 1 December 2011.
The second phase of the health care reform regulates the rights and obligations of medical
personnel and patients and stipulates the conditions for providing emergency medical service.
The reform took effect on April 1, 2012.

6
The third phase of the health care reform will unify the conditions for health insurance and
improve the competition among health insurance companies as well as improve the
effectiveness of health care providers. Reform is currently being prepared.
The Social benefit reform simplifies the social security system, reduces administrative
burdens for users of services and improves the targeting and needs calculation of social
benefits. The reform came into effect on 1 January 2012.
Other
In March 2012, the government approved its 2020 export strategy to increase the share of
non-EU markets (currently only less than 20 percent of total exports) as well as improving
the state’s role as a partner for Czech exporters.
