EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recovery has commenced but is still frail. The upturn has been fueled by strong exports. Inflation
has remained muted, but is now picking up because of rising oil prices. External competitiveness is
adequate. Subdued continuation of the recovery is projected for 2011–12, with output remaining
below potential and somewhat higher inflation. Risks—primarily from external sources—appear
tilted downwards. The authorities broadly agreed. Their forecast is only slightly more optimistic.
The consensus was that housing market vulnerabilities must be addressed promptly and staff
urged deeper reforms. Authorities’ plans to limit the maximum LTV ratio and impose minimum
principal repayments are positive, but further tightening of LTV ratios and principal repayments and
setting greater risk weights on high LTV mortgages would be useful. Moreover, a credible statement
that mortgage interest deductibility (MID) will be gradually reduced would eliminate uncertainty.
The authorities noted that a coalition agreement prevented action on MID in the near future.
Following the FSAP update, officials are further buttressing effectiveness of supervision and
crisis resolution mechanisms. The authorities concurred that bank capital buffers appear adequate,
though progress toward meeting Basel III requirements is warranted. Areas for improvement include
rule-making authority and legal protection of supervisors; adequacy of data reporting requirements;
resource limitations; and the crisis resolution framework. Welcome efforts are being made to address
these issues as well as to develop macro-prudential instruments, but further action is needed.
The authorities agreed that flexible implementation of the planned fiscal adjustment was
desirable, but only for very severe shocks to the recovery. Staff maintained that, should the
recovery stall, functioning of automatic stabilizers ought to be unhindered and contingency plans
developed to moderate the discretionary adjustment. Officials considered automatic stabilizers on
revenues to be sufficiently large. Discretionary action would only be justified by clear danger of
another major recession. Staff noted however that, under existing rules, automatic stabilizers would
be capped if the deficit exceeded the plan by 1 percent of GDP. There was also agreement that
consolidation will need to continue beyond 2015 to ensure fiscal sustainability, including by
reassessment of pension fund benefits.
The authorities concurred that structural reforms would alleviate the adverse impacts of the
crisis and population aging on growth. Concrete new initiatives however appear limited.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
Despite robust fundamentals, the crisis hit the Netherlands hard, because of
adverse international spillovers, especially in the financial sector. Growth was above the
euro area average during most of the decade leading to the crisis, the external current account
exhibited sizable surpluses, and the fiscal position was strong, with low public debt. No
major bubbles were evident in domestic asset markets, but owing to a relatively large
financial sector and sizable foreign financial and trade exposures, economic activity took a
major blow. Several large financial institutions had to be rescued by the government through
nationalization, massive capital infusions, and other support (Figure 1; Boxes 1 and 2).
2.
Recovery has commenced, but significant vulnerabilities remain. Although
growth has resumed, it is significantly weaker than before the crisis. Moreover, spreading
unease in sovereign debt markets and the possibility of a worse-than-anticipated impact of
domestic and EU-wide fiscal tightening could darken prospects for a continuation of the
recovery and even threaten financial stability, if banks in major advanced countries are
affected. The housing market remains a notable domestic risk, while aging weighs on fiscal
sustainability and potential growth.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
The Netherlands emerged from a deep recession in mid-2009, as the world
economy gained strength, but the resurgence remains frail. Notwithstanding positive
quarterly growth from Q3 2009, real GDP fell by 4 percent overall in 2009. The recession
was spawned by collapsing exports, investment cutbacks, and massive destocking, amid
near-record declines in capacity utilization and confidence (Figures 2 and 3; Tables 1 and 2).
Domestic demand contracted much less, as still-substantial wage rises cushioned private
consumption. Conversely, the subsequent upturn, with growth of 1¾ percent in 2010, has
been stimulated by the recovery of international trade, leading to a strong pick-up of exports
and restocking.

Unemployment and Vacancies

4.
Unemployment has risen modestly, with
subdued price and wage inflation. Despite the
large output contraction, the unemployment rate
increased only marginally in 2009 and peaked in
2010 at 4½ percent, well below Okun’s law
predictions. Enterprises’ reluctance to shed labor,
sustained by ample profitability buffers, helped
suppress or delay unemployment buildup, while
government-subsidized temporary reduced-hours
schemes played a minor role.1 Inflation fell

sharply in mid-2009 with cuts in electricity and gas tariffs, and stayed low, at less than1
percent in 2010, as recession created economic slack. Accordingly, wage growth contracted
by more than half, to about 1¼ percent in 2010. However, in recent months inflation has
risen sharply to about 2 percent—as in much of Europe—reflecting largely buoyant oil and
commodity prices.
5.
Banking system soundness has improved significantly since 2008, but fragilities
persist (Table 3 and 4; Figures 6–9).

The foreign exposure (foreign loans to total

from its 71 percent peak before the crisis to
46 percent by end-2010.



Bank profitability has recovered slightly but
remains weak. Banks achieved a modest
operating profit in 2009–10, driven by
increased interest income, but hobbled by
higher operating expenses and persistently
large provisions due to servicing arrears.
Liquid assets more than cover short-term
liabilities; nevertheless funding risk remains
a challenge given Dutch banks’ reliance on
wholesale market funding.

Despite deterioration in asset quality in
2009, the NPL ratio remained at

Although, the (unweighted) capital-toasset ratio is still comparatively low, all
large banks maintain capital well above
minimum requirements, largely due to
government intervention. The banking
sector capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
stood at 13.9 percent as of end-2010,
comprised mostly of core Tier 1 capital.
Deleveraging helped raise the Tier 1
ratio above the average of major
European counterparts.

A strategy of gradual exit from extraordinary policy support is being
implemented, amid continued restructuring of the financial sector. At the beginning of
2011, the authorities ended access to the bank credit guarantee program. Three Dutch
financial institutions, AEGON, SNS Reaal and ING, have paid back part of the capital
support provided by the government in 2008–09. The state guarantee for the mortgage
portfolio of ABN Amro was terminated in October 2010, and ABN Amro is expected to
complete its merger with Fortis Bank Nederland by end-2011.

Coverage ratios of pension funds are low amid widespread uncertainty on
future benefits and insurers also face important challenges. After a temporary
improvement, the average coverage ratio dropped under 95 percent in Q3 of 2010 and has
since recovered to just above the statutory minimum of 105 percent—compressed by
increasing pension liabilities, both from

solvency ratios of life insurers have
decreased significantly and profitability
is also threatened, mainly because sales of individual life policies collapsed in 2009. Nonlife
insurers appear to have weathered the crisis better.
8.
Household balance sheets appear relatively comfortable, but vulnerabilities are
rising. Net financial assets of households have recovered from the lows of 2008–09.
However, household debt has risen steadily to over 270 percent of disposable income in
2010, among the highest in advanced economies. In addition, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio
of new mortgages has surged, exceeding 120 percent in 2010. Liberal mortgage interest tax
deductibility (MID) has put upward pressure on mortgage size, and also led to the
proliferation of interest-only non-amortizing mortgages—frequently with principal
accumulated in separate investment/insurance accounts—since the mid-1990s. Data on the
separately accumulated principal is unavailable, but the DNB believes such principal to be
relatively modest. With banks having first charge at default, and full recourse against
borrowers, mortgage default rates remain very low. However, fiscal consolidation and
increased unemployment could exert significant pressure on household disposable income.

Box 1. Netherlands: Cross-Border Spillovers1
Regional concentration of exports exposes the
Netherlands to correction in the external
position of developed countries. A comparatively
high 77 percent of Dutch exports are directed to
European countries. Only about 15 percent goes to
emerging markets and developing countries, with
less than 3 percent of total exports to Asia. Dutch
exports are thus more vulnerable to faltering
demand in advanced economies, particularly
European, than many other euro area member
countries.

Fiscal consolidation in trading partners could impact significantly export and GDP

The concentration of financial claims abroad and the high degree of openness render the
Netherlands quite susceptible to foreign default. Simulating the direct and indirect effects of
a default in one or more of the major partners indicates sizeable losses to Dutch lenders. For
example, a default on 10 percent of international claims on the US could generate a loss of
3.1 percent of GDP. Corresponding values for the UK, Germany or Spain are 1.6, 1 and
0.9 percent of GDP. While financial exposure remains high by international standard, the
decrease in claims abroad relative to GDP from 315 percent in 2007 before the crisis to
160 percent in mid-2010 has reduced potential default losses appreciably.

Contagion from default in the Netherlands would be essentially limited to
European countries. In case of Dutch default on a sizable fraction of its foreign
liabilities, the United Kingdom and Switzerland suffer the most, due to their high
overall financial openness, followed by Portugal, Belgium, France, Germany, Austria
and Ireland. With the exception of Portugal and Belgium, Dutch assets account for less
than 5 percent of any major economies’ total claims abroad (See AN2). Thus only a
high default rate would inflict significant losses on any given country.
Spillover from the Netherlands through International Banking Exposure

Box 2. Netherlands: Macro-Financial Linkages
Financial variables had a heavy negative impact on the broader economy during
the crisis. Staff estimates the cumulative contribution of deteriorating financial
conditions from 2008–09 to GDP growth at 2½–3 percentage points, based on a
Financial Conditions Index (FCI) approach.1 A depressed stock market and deteriorated
interbank market conditions have fuelled stress in the banking sector via lower asset
values and increased costs of refinancing.
Stress in the banking sector, deleveraging, and falling profitability of banks have
tightened credit supply conditions. A noticeable excess demand (“credit crunch”)
materialized during the financial crisis with an estimated peak of 6 percent in 2009Q2,
as credit supply fell faster than demand for credit.
The prevalence of excess demand seems to be over. While credit demand remained
subdued throughout 2009, credit supply recovered on the back of improved access to
capital and a moderation in banking sector stress. Also the initial tightening in credit
conditions was mitigated to some extent by an increase in financing via bond markets,
where large corporation had ease in obtaining credit.

Vulnerability to a severe contraction of real estate prices is of medium intensity.
Having contracted by 5 percent between mid-2008 and mid-2009, house prices steadied
through late 2010, but recently resumed a slow downward drift, amid indications of increased
unsold homes. Simple indicators of affordability, though still comparatively high, have
improved and stabilized (AN4). There are few signs of overvaluation from econometric
models, consistent with relatively modest house price rises compared with other euro area

10
economies. Also, the Dutch economy does not display the sort of imbalances that often
preceded house price busts, such as rapid credit growth, excessive shifts of expenditures into
residential investment, and external imbalances. Additionally, limited land availability
reduces downside risks. Commercial real estate prices fell significantly during the crisis, but
are stabilizing (Figure 10).
10.
Dutch firms entered the crisis with robust finances but saw a sharp decline in
profitability and are exposed to credit tightening. This is reflected in the still large—
though recently declining—number of bankruptcies. Credit growth for nonfinancial
corporations has decelerated markedly but remains positive (Box 2). Given comparatively
high dependence on bank lending, the Dutch business sector is quite susceptible to a drop in
corporate loans or tight credit conditions.

Sizable current account surpluses and a range of indicators suggest adequate
competitiveness (Box 3; Figures 4 and 5). The current account surplus increased
significantly to over 7 percent of GDP in 2010 as exports regained their momentum and
factor income bounced back from the 2009 lows. The surplus is expected to remain
significant over the medium term.


And relative profitability in manufacturing
has been broadly stable. Relative profitability is
proxied by the ratio of the CPI-based REER to the
unit labor cost in manufacturing (ULCM)-based
REER. This measure suggests limited trend changes
in relative profitability, with a dip in 2007–08
quickly reversed subsequently.

Export growth has been relatively high and
market share has perked up (Figure 4). With an
expansion of around 15½ percent during 2002–08,
export growth has exceeded the euro area average of less
than 12 percent. And following the global collapse in
trade of 2009, exports rebounded strongly in 2010.
However, re-exports (which account for around half of
Dutch exports by value) have been important in driving
growth of the overall market share.

REER measures—using CPI and unit labor

year, following appreciation between 2006–09.
Much of the drop has reflected the depreciation of the
euro, but decelerating wage and price pressures in the
aftermath of global recession have also contributed.

down in 2011, while inflation is to stay
somewhat elevated. The authorities’ projections are only slightly more optimistic.
Medium and long-term prospects
14.
The crisis may have inflicted a permanent output loss, and aging will weigh on
potential growth. The latter is likely running somewhat lower than before the downturn in
the near term, owing to the large contraction in investment. It could be hamstrung also by a
deceleration in total factor productivity if financing constraints and increased risk aversion
curb research and development. Potential growth is however expected to rise to 1¾ percent
over the medium term, around the pre-crisis rate, leaving a permanent decline in the level of
potential output of 6¾ percent by 2015 (AN5), when the output gap closes. In the longer run,
low and slowing population growth together with population aging will squeeze working-age
cohorts, while holding back trend productivity. Maintaining potential growth will therefore
require boosting labor force participation and reforms to enhance productivity (¶33–34).

Risks
15.
Risks to the outlook appear tilted
downwards, with heightened uncertainties.
Though house price misalignment is a possible
domestic vulnerability, risks stem primarily
from external sources, given the Netherlands’
extensive trade and financial links. On the
downside, they emanate from heightened
vulnerability to disruptions in sovereign debt
markets, simultaneous fiscal tightening in
several advanced European countries, and a lack
of progress in resolving global imbalances. On
the upside, they originate from unexpectedly
positive effects of policy relaxation measures

abroad or emerging market growth spurts, which could boost global demand. Specifically:


Unprecedented sovereign financing is needed globally over a 12–24 month horizon.
With investors already jittery, any new shocks in sovereign borrowing markets are
likely to prove highly disruptive for already weakened banks and the real economy.
Uncertainties could raise risk premia, with negative impact on government debt
finances and bank funding costs



Recent WEO analysis confirms that fiscal consolidation typically has a sizable
contractionary impact on growth. Moreover, when several countries in Europe
envisage significant simultaneous tightening, the contractionary effects are likely to
be sharper and might surpass current estimates. In addition, it may prove difficult to
reverse course quickly if the collective retrenchment proves excessive.



Lack of progress in resolving global imbalances may constrain the global trade
outlook and dampen export demand, ultimately depressing activity.



A larger-than-anticipated impact of the quantitative easing being implemented in the
US, not offset by US dollar depreciation, and stronger-than-expected growth in
emerging markets could stimulate Dutch exports beyond the central projection.
Further depreciation of the euro could have a similar effect.

For each of these factors deviations from the assumed baseline could occur in either direction
and impact our central projection for activity accordingly. Nevertheless, the probability of
downside occurrences is deemed prevalent—with uncommonly pronounced dispersion—as
reflected above. The authorities, though more sanguine on the impact of Europe-wide fiscal
retrenchment, broadly shared staff’s assessment of the risks.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Against this background, the Netherlands must secure the recovery, mitigate
lingering vulnerabilities, and start addressing long-term sustainability issues.


With monetary policy at the limits of its ability to shore up demand, fiscal policy
must strike a balance between support of economic activity and prevention of further
budget deterioration (¶s24–27). This argues for a relatively gradual pace of
consolidation, in order not to jeopardize the upturn.
Longer term policies should strengthen financial stability, ensure fiscal sustainability,
and advance structural reforms to boost potential output. In the financial sector, these
include proactive efforts to raise capital to the levels envisaged under Basel III (¶17),
implementation of recovery plans for pension funds together with a redefinition of
retirement benefits (¶18), strengthening supervisory standards, including by
redefinition of rulemaking authority, legal protections, and data reporting (¶19),

16
reinforcing macro-prudential supervision (¶s20–21), and refining crisis resolution
procedures and dispositions (¶22). Beyond the medium term objective of substantially
reducing the budget deficit, further fiscal adjustment is required to achieve long-term
sustainability (¶s28–32). Structural reforms would alleviate the adverse impacts of the
crisis and population aging on growth, and facilitate fiscal consolidation (¶s33–34).
A. Maintaining financial stability
Bank capitalization and pension fund solvency
17.
Officials concurred that bank capital buffers appear sufficient to withstand even
severe shocks, though further steps towards meeting Basel III are warranted. FSAP
update stress tests, conducted following the methodology used by the Committee of
European Bank Supervisors (CEBS) in 2010 for seven banks comprising more than
80 percent of the sector, indicated that no bank has Tier 1 capital falling below 6 percent.
Under a more extreme scenario with shocks twice the CEBS size, all banks remain above the
current regulatory minimum of 4 percent tier 1 capital and the CEBS 6 percent. Thus, banks
appear in a good position to meet the increasingly robust capital requirements under Basel
III; but proactive actions to fill any residual gaps—including restraint on dividend payments
and raising additional capital—are desirable, especially in light of comparatively high
leverage ratios. This will also be helpful to unwind the government’s substantial ownership
interests in some important financial institutions. Moreover, strong capital and liquidity
buffers will facilitate bank restructuring pursuant to EC competition directives.

18.
DNB appropriately ordered preparation of recovery plans for several pension
funds, but current proposals to reassess benefits are encountering difficulties. With
interest rates not expected to return to pre-crisis levels in the near- to medium-term and with
improved longevity, pension fund coverage ratios have declined markedly. The authorities

17
agreed that a reduction in retirement benefits (through lowering of the replacement rate or
further raising of the retirement age) is thus required to re-establish solvency, as they do not
consider desirable an increase in contributions. Nevertheless, tripartite discussions among
government, employers, and employees on ensuring solvency have been laborious and slowmoving. The opinion of the State Advocate in support of grandfathering existing risk-sharing
arrangement has cast further doubts on the proposal. Staff stressed that modifications in risksharing arrangements need to be transparent and communicated effectively to the public to
ensure broad social acceptance and suitable changes in household saving.
Supervision and regulation of financial institutions
19.
Supervisory standards are generally high and the authorities have begun taking
action in areas for improvement identified by the FSAP update (Table 6). Assessments
showed a high degree of compliance with the Basel and other international core principles.
Nonetheless, advances are possible in several fields.


Rulemaking authority is limited and should be enhanced. It presently constrains the
ability of supervisors to react swiftly to emerging risks. Both DNB and the AFM can
issue sector-wide rules only in areas explicitly mentioned in the law, usually on very
technical issues. DNB is also legally restricted from imposing broadly applicable
intra-group exposure limits to insurance groups, and its legal authority over financial
holding companies is significantly constrained. It also has limited powers to impose
resolution tools.



Concerns about the adequacy of legal protections may have induced DNB to rely
excessively on moral suasion for fear of increasing already rampant litigation. The
FSAP update recommended giving supervisors legal immunity, except in cases of
gross negligence or willful misconduct, in line with practice in neighboring countries.



Data routinely reported to supervisors no longer have sufficient granularity for full
monitoring of financial sector developments and risks—the result of initiatives to
reduce administrative burdens on industry. Supervisors are now reviewing data
needed for proper execution of their functions and to address identified deficiencies.
Greater data dissemination would strengthen market oversight.



The authorities have made plans for greater supervisory intrusiveness, including
thematic inspections of institutions. The FSAP update welcomed these important
steps, but emphasized that comprehensive oversight remains essential—not least by
on-site inspections and detailed off-site provision of data. Also, the DNB should
complement its work on large connected financial institutions (LCFIs) through the
Supervisory Colleges with heightened direct understanding of the activities of Dutch
financial institutions abroad. Additional resources are likely needed to this end.

18
While seeing merit in many of the proposals, the Ministry of Finance considers that the
present division between rule-making and implementation powers, and the right of the
Minister to take back delegated powers, are consistent with the independence of supervisors
and indeed necessary for democratic accountability.
Macro-prudential supervision
20.
The authorities are developing macro-prudential instruments to mitigate risks of
recurrence of financial turmoil. Work is underway to develop a comprehensive toolkit for
macro-prudential supervision. Instruments relating to the housing market will be key, given
the latter’s centrality in determining macro-prudential vulnerabilities.


In this regard, for new mortgages, DNB intends to limit the maximum LTV ratio to
110 percent and require that 50 percent of principal be amortized before expiration,
given that LTV ratios in the Netherlands are amongst the highest (Figure 10). In line
with the FSAP update, staff welcomed these plans as a useful first step, but noted that
they would permit new mortgages with LTV ratios of 110 percent indefinitely, a clear
anomaly. Thus, the mission encouraged the authorities to take additional measures,
including tighter conditions (closer to international practice) on LTV ratios and
minimum principal repayments, setting greater risk weights on high LTV mortgages,
and giving DNB the power to impose further LTV restrictions if macro-prudential
conditions signal this need.



The authorities concurred that a key distortion fueling housing market risks is the
generosity of MID, which artificially inflates housing prices and the balance sheets of
households and banks. Distributional concerns also exist, with MID favoring
wealthier borrowers disproportionately. However, abolishing MID in one fell swoop
could result in a steep house price decline, damaging aggregate demand through
perceptions of diminished wealth, especially if the fall of house prices is accelerated
by rising marginal loan rates as a result of deteriorating collateral values. Thus, staff
recommended lowering MID gradually, for example through capping it in nominal
terms, making a clear statement in this regard soon to eliminate uncertainty. Broader
regulatory reform to lessen distortions in the private rental market and in social
housing is important, together with reducing the house sales tax, high in international
comparison. These distortions severely hampered labor mobility and artificially limit
the size of the private rental market. In addition, social housing is not targeted
efficiently to low income groups. Although key officials saw merit in the proposals,
they noted that a coalition agreement prevented action on MID in the near future,
reflecting also concerns about the impact on housing prices.

21.
More generally, the FSAP update underscored that broad supervisory discretion
and enhanced legal protections should extend to macro-prudential instruments. It would

19
also be helpful to assign DNB an explicit objective of ensuring financial stability. In addition
DNB should further develop the capability and data for top-down stress testing.
Crisis resolution
22.
Crisis resolution arrangements proved effective during the crisis, and officials
are considering steps to strengthen them further. The FSAP update made several
proposals in this area. The authorities have already announced plans for upgrading the
Deposit Guarantee Scheme, which seem aligned with FSAP update recommendations and
were welcomed by staff. Proposals on crisis intervention tools, also broadly consistent with
FSAP update advice, have been circulated for discussion.

that support the rapid simultaneous transfer of deposits
and assets, and other essential functions (e.g., payment
services).

20
B. Fiscal Policy
Short-Term Fiscal Policy
23.
The authorities plan strong and distinctly front-loaded3 fiscal adjustment over
2011–15. Under staff’s macro projections, measures envisaged by the new government will
reduce the headline deficit to 3¾ percent of
90

GDP in 2011, and 1¼ percent of GDP by
General Government Accounts

24.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to consolidation, but advocated
flexible handling of the marked front-loading in case of a serious slowdown.


The conflicting objectives of reducing the output gap and making progress towards
fiscal sustainability (¶26) have to be balanced. For this reason, in the 2009 Article IV,
the Fund supported as prudent the authorities’ plan of a gradual structural adjustment
(about ½ percent of GDP in 2011 and ¾ percent of GDP thereafter),4 aimed at
bringing the headline deficit below the SGP ceiling by 2013, while not jeopardizing
the recovery (also reflecting the considerations outlined in ¶29).

3

The accentuated front-loading of the structural adjustment results from the combination of the discretionary
retrenchment over 2011–15 with the phasing out of the stimulus provided in 2009–10. The former alone is
roughly uniformly distributed over time.

4

Specifically, a structural retrenchment of ¾ percent of GDP per year (a bit less in 2011) was sought, until the
headline deficit fell below 3 percent of GDP in 2013. Beyond 2013, tightening would take place at a more
measured pace, with a view to close progressively the sustainability gap.

21
The tightening now envisaged is much more front-loaded than that previously
scheduled, and both the authorities and staff have correspondingly incorporated some
additional contractionary impact on short-term growth in their central projections. At
the same time, the accelerated adjustment is expected to benefit fiscal sustainability
considerably. Nevertheless,

been taken into account in the
baseline scenario, a significant
downside risk is that the contractionary impact of simultaneous fiscal tightening in
several advanced European countries could prove sharper than currently estimated.



In addition, despite a substantial sustainability gap, there is no immediate fiscal
credibility issue, and debt is lower than in many advanced economies; hence pressure
from markets with regard to Dutch financing requirements is negligible. Furthermore,
evidence of bubbles in fiscal revenues that could justify more substantive early
tightening is scant (AN6).



These considerations suggest that flexibility in the implementation of the planned
fiscal adjustment is both possible and desirable should economic outcomes be
significantly worse than anticipated, so as not to exacerbate downside risks for
growth prospects in the near-term. To moderate adverse impacts on aggregate
demand, in any case, it might be preferable to substitute part of the headline
tightening with structural measures (such as increasing further the retirement age),
which improve significantly fiscal sustainability, but impact only modestly the
government balance in the short-run.

25.
In particular, automatic stabilizers ought to be allowed to operate freely and
contingency plans developed to moderate the adjustment, should the recovery stall.
Staff argued that unhindered operation of automatic stabilizers would require excluding
unemployment benefits from expenditure ceilings. Moreover, unexpected serious setbacks to
the recovery that cause the headline deficit to rise substantially above targeted levels should
not trigger further discretionary retrenchment—as envisaged under the government program.
Staff also advised that contingency plans be prepared beforehand to ease the envisioned
fiscal tightening, so that prompt action would be possible, in the event that (i) domestic
growth falters markedly below envisaged rates; or (ii) high frequency indicators and adverse
developments in international financial markets and economic activity abroad suggest that
the recovery is coming to a standstill.
26.
The authorities generally concurred, but stressed that only a very severe shock
to the recovery would warrant relaxation of their fiscal adjustment plans. In their view,
automatic stabilizers on revenues were sufficiently large, limiting need for discretionary
action. Thus, discretionary action would only be justified by the clear and present danger of
another major recession. Staff noted however that, under existing fiscal rules, the operation
of automatic stabilizers would be capped, if the deficit exceeded the plan by 1 percent of
GDP. The authorities were also concerned that public articulation of contingency plans could
lead to a push for more spending even if the recovery continues.

23
Medium-Term Fiscal Policy and Sustainability
27.
The long-term GG position remains weak (AN7 and AN8), reflecting in part the
impact of the crisis. Staff estimates a fiscal sustainability gap of 7½ percent of GDP. 5, 6
Despite comparatively low initial debt, several crisis-related factors have inflated the
sustainability gap: (i) the marked structural fiscal relaxation in 2009–10; (ii) large operations
in support of the financial sector, which have not increased the deficit but added to public
debt; and (iii) weaker potential output. In addition, aging-related spending is expected to
increase by nine percent of GDP over 2011–60, on account of pensions, health- and old-age
care.
28.
Accordingly, there was agreement that consolidation will need to continue
beyond 2015 to ensure fiscal sustainability. Reasonable calibration of the tradeoff between
output stabilization and fiscal sustainability, broadly consistent with the Netherlands’
medium-term pledges under the SGP, suggests that adjustment of about ¾ percent of GDP
per annum would be desirable and close the sustainability gap by 2021. As noted above,
though, the authorities now aim for a notably more frontloaded consolidation in 2011–12,
albeit with a slower pace of tightening over the medium term. In any case, staff argued,
supporting measures beyond 2011 should be adopted promptly.

5

This is the improvement in the GG robust balance after 2011 compared with the no-measures path needed to
attain long-term stability of public debt as a share of GDP. The sustainability indicator used here is based on the
intertemporal budget constraint (see AN7), and is consistent with the S2 measure of the EC (Sustainability
Report 2009, pp148–49). The sustainability gap—evaluated as of 2012—has decreased from 8 percent of GDP
in IMF Country Report No. 10/34, primarily reflecting the strong consolidation of 2011. This estimate assumes
that the outlays for the financial sector bailout are fully recouped. Without recovery of these outlays the
sustainability gap increases to 7¾ percent of GDP.

6

The authorities’ latest estimates of the sustainability gap are significantly smaller because they incorporate the
corrective adjustment planned throughout 2015, although measures have been enacted only for 2011, and allow
for a putative long-term boost to consumption tax revenues from population aging (AN7).

1/ Plausible adjustment path 1 is somewhat less ambitious than authorities' adjustment path in the
short run, but envisages stronger consolidation thereaf ter such that the sustainability gap is closed in
2021. This also corresponds to the variable weights scenario in Table 7-1. Plausible adjustment path
2 is consistent with the authorities' adjustment path up to 2015, and f urther assumes that
consolidation continues at a pace of ½ percent of GDP until the sustainability gap is closed in 2025.

Source: IMF staf f calculations.
1/ Initial sustainability gap (given no consolidation f rom 2012 onward) = 7.5 percent of GDP; Initial output gap (in 2011) = -1.0 percent of GDP;
fiscal multiplier is taken to be 0.6; autoregressive parameter for output gap (lambda) is taken to be 0.5; nominal interest rate = 5 percent; nominal
GDP growth rate = 3.4 percent.
2/ Alpha is the weight on the output gap, while gamma is the weight on the sustainability gap.
3/ Alpha is assumed to decline over time f rom an initial value of 0.9 to zero over a 10-year period, while Beta rises at the same pace f rom an
initial value of 0.1. This scenario corresponds to "Plausible adjustment path 1" in the Netherlands: Fiscal Sustainability, 2012-60 textchart.
4/ The underlying output gap is not directly comparable with the output gap in staf f 's WEO projections, as the WEO projections assume that other
ef fects (including conf idence e.t.c) will provide some off set to the negative impact of f iscal tightening, such that the output gap closes in 2016.
These other ef f ects could be modeled by introducing an exogenous term into the equation governing the evolution of the underlying output gap.

Measures to Achieve Sustainability
29.
The consensus was that scope for increasing the tax burden is limited (Figure
11), thus expenditure retrenchment has to play a key role in adjustment. Expenditurebased consolidations have generally been more successful, based on international evidence.
Moreover, given international competition to lower corporate taxation and relatively large tax
wedges on earned income which discourage work, direct tax rates have little upward room.
The mission therefore advised that focus on the revenue side should be on base broadening—
for example curtailing generosity of MID (¶31)—and a shift from labor to less distortionary
taxation of consumption and property, including by reducing the number of items on reduced
VAT rates. Concerning outlays, the priority should be reducing the impact of aging on fiscal
expenditures, through increases in the effective retirement age and measures to restrain
growth in demand for health- and long-term care (Table 7).
30.
In this regard, the authorities considered that the fiscal correction’s focus on
outlays was apt, though staff expressed concern at its limited structural content. The
deep broad-ranging cuts in expenditure over 2011–15 envisage restraining growth of public
wages, curtailing the size of the civil service, slowing down health care costs, and reducing
grants and transfers. Staff stressed that the ambitious fiscal objectives throughout 2015
should not come at the expense of progress in structural reforms with beneficial budgetary

26
implications, which seem to have been given limited prominence in the new government’s
program.
31.
Staff argued that eliminating the costly MID scheme would benefit both growth
and the budget in the long run, but should be implemented gradually. The implicit
subsidy to homeowners represents around 7 percent of total revenues. Phasing out the
deduction could have considerable long-run benefits. A gradual reduction that allows
households time to adjust and does not affect existing mortgage contracts greatly is desirable.
Nonetheless, to realize the benefits of the reform quickly, a credible commitment to eventual
elimination or radical curtailment of the subsidy is needed (AN9 and ¶20). However, despite
much public discussion, the momentum to tighten the MID regime appears to have lost
steam.
C. Structural Reforms
32.
The authorities agreed that, with a stagnating population amid aging pressures,
policies need to encourage greater work effort to maintain potential growth (Table 8).


The participation rate of the elderly is relatively low by international standards and
the effective average retirement age is close to 4 years below the statutory rate of
65 years, while hours worked by women are low. Officials are considering steps to:
(i) increase the minimum age—together with steeper penalties—for early retirement;
and (ii) further curtail disincentives in taxation or social benefits to longer working
hours by females. It had been envisaged to lift the statutory retirement age by two
years to 67, but this has now been reduced to 66. The authorities noted that that a
majority in parliament—not coinciding with that supporting the government—could
vote for linking the retirement age to life expectancy, a measure in line with staff
recommendations.



Unemployment benefits are fairly generous and may discourage job search, lifting the
duration of unemployment. Lowering the benefits and limiting their length, however,
are not included in the government program.

33.
Similarly, fostering research and development (R&D) and combating traffic
congestion would enhance productivity and thus also growth.


Gross domestic expenditure on R&D, public and private, is fairly modest. More
support for R&D could not only fuel productivity through innovation, but also
improve incentives for higher education by building up demand for top-skilled
workers.



Various estimates put the Netherlands among the countries with the highest costs of
congestion. Stepped up investment in roads and railways, which would require some

27
relaxation of strict zoning regulations, road pricing, and opening the transportation
sector to more competition could alleviate congestion and thus spur productivity.
The authorities are considering options in these areas. In particular, their Europe 2020 plan
does focus on increasing efficiencies in current arrangements.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Dutch economy is on the mend, but the recovery still frail. The upturn has
been fueled by strong exports. Unemployment has risen only modestly and is the lowest in
Europe, mainly because strong pre-crisis profitability coupled with the fear of future labor
shortages from population aging have kindled labor hoarding by firms. With output still well
below potential, inflation has remained subdued, even if it is now picking up because of
rising oil and commodity prices. Wages though are under control and external
competitiveness is adequate. A subdued continuation of the recovery is projected for 2011–
12, with output remaining below potential and modest inflation. Risks—primarily from
external sources—appear tilted downwards. The crisis has also led to a permanent loss of
output aggravating the problems posed by aging, not least to fiscal sustainability.
35.
Lingering risks require continued vigilance on bank capital and liquidity, given
also increasingly robust regulatory requirements. FSAP update stress tests outcomes and
spillovers are benign, with banks’ capital and liquidity positions able to withstand even quite
severe scenarios. Nevertheless, with relatively high leverage ratios and tighter capital
standards to be phased in under Basel III, proactive measures are desirable to prevent
emergence of any capital or liquidity shortcomings. Such steps will also smooth the phasing
out of government equity from intervened banks and bank restructuring.
36.
It is crucial to address promptly housing market vulnerabilities and distortions.
Given heavy exposure of the financial system to the housing market, a determined response
to the buildup of vulnerabilities there is warranted. Authorities’ plans to limit the maximum
LTV ratio and impose a fractional minimum principal repayment are welcome, but
insufficient. Further tightening of LTV ratios and minimum principal repayments, setting
greater risk weights on high LTV mortgages, and giving DNB the authority to impose further

28
LTV restrictions if required would be useful. Moreover, a clear and credible statement that
MID will be gradually reduced should be made to eliminate uncertainty and minimize the
possible impact on the housing market. This should be accompanied by deep regulatory
reform of the housing sector and a cut of the house sales tax.
37.
Despite improved supervisory practices, the effectiveness of supervision and
crisis resolution mechanisms can be further buttressed. Concerns include rule-making
authority and legal protections of supervisors; adequacy of data reporting requirements;
banking supervision culture; resource limitations; and the crisis resolution framework. In
particular, DNB and the AFM should be provided with broad supervisory discretion over
macro-prudential instruments, in line with their respective responsibilities, and a single
regime created for resolving banks under official control. Welcome efforts are being made to
address these issues, but further early and sustained action in these areas is needed, with a
focus on intensifying and coordinating supervision of large international financial institutions
and improving reporting requirements. The insurance sector warrants careful monitoring too,
given its tarnished reputation, and the financial pressures under which it is operating.
38.
To restore pension fund viability, second-pillar pension benefits should be
recalibrated. Persistently low interest rates and rising longevity have put pressure on the
coverage ratios of many funds. Lower retirement benefits (including through further raises of
the retirement age) or higher contributions are thus required. The public should be made fully
aware of risk-sharing modifications, not least to induce fitting changes in saving behavior.
39.
The planned strong fiscal adjustment should be implemented flexibly in case of a
sharp and prolonged slowdown to prevent harming the recovery. While it remains
appropriate to close the fiscal sustainability gap within 10–15 years, the conflicting
objectives of reducing the output gap and making progress towards fiscal sustainability have
to be balanced in the short run. The front-loaded adjustment is expected to benefit fiscal
sustainability considerably, with potential positive effects on consumer and investor
confidence on the long-run prospects of the economy. Nevertheless, there are no immediate
concerns about Dutch fiscal credibility. Moreover, a significant downside risk is that the
contractionary impact of simultaneous fiscal tightening in several advanced European
countries could prove sharper than currently estimated, particularly since monetary policy is
at the limit of its ability to provide stimulus. Thus, if the recovery were to stall, automatic
stabilizers ought to function unhindered and contingency plans developed to moderate the
adjustment.
40.
Measures that directly reduce the impact of aging on public expenditures or
broaden the tax base must be a key plank of adjustment. Expenditure-based
consolidations have generally been more successful than tax-centered ones and there is not
much scope to raise tax rates. Therefore, revenues could only be augmented by expanding the
base—for example by limiting MID, a large tax expenditure—and a further move away from
labor to less distortionary indirect taxation. Concerning fiscal outlays, the priority is to

29
increase the effective retirement age and to restrain growth in demand for and costs of healthand long-term care, also by raising co-payments and user fees. In general, renewed emphasis
should be placed on structural fiscal reform efforts.
41.
To maintain potential growth amid a stagnating population and aging
pressures, policies should encourage greater work effort and productivity. Apart from
increasing the retirement age, labor market reforms should overhaul tax and benefit systems
to curtail disincentives to full-time female and elderly work. Excessive generosity of
unemployment benefits should be pared down not to discourage job search and prolong
unemployment spells. Fostering research and development (R&D) expenditure, which is
quite limited, would enhance productivity. Less strict zoning regulations, more competition
in the transport sector together with an upgrade of its infrastructure, and extension of road
pricing could counter congestion and also stimulate productivity.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The introduction of the new health insurance scheme in 2006 caused a signif icant shif t in health care expenditure f rom private to
public consumption, thereby lowering private and raising public consumption growth without changing overall GDP. In a related vein,
government revenues rose and private disposable income f all, without af f ecting the f inancial position of the public sector or households
net terms. This is because public expenditure f or health care also rose, while the f all in private disposable income was of f set by a similar
f all in private health consumption, which is now taken care of in the public domain.
2/ Contribution to GDP growth.

4/ In percent of potential GDP.

Restructuring

Background

ABN
AMRO/Fortis

(i) Acquisition of Fortis’
Dutch operations,
including Fortis’ share of
ABN AMRO for
€16.9 billion; (ii) a short
term bridge loan to Fortis
of €34 billion, (iii) a long
term bridge loan to Fortis
of €16 billion, (iv) a state
guarantee of €5 billion
bond issue by Fortis, (v)
assumption of credit risk
in a mortgage portfolio of
€19 billion, which under
Basel 1 rules translated to
capital release instrument
of €1.7 billion and
mandatory convertible
note of €0.8 billion, (v)
additional capital
strengthening actions of
€4.4 billion, of which
€1.4 billion was a debt to
equity swap.

Restrictions on
dividends, bonuses.
Certain decisions by
the Managing Board
of ABN Amro/Fortis
are likely to require
approval by the
State in her capacity
as shareholder.

The restructuring involves
consolidating the Dutch banking and
insurance operations of former Fortis
and ABN AMRO, divestment of most
insurance activities, and
reconstructing remaining banking
operations under a new state-owned
bank called ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
Legal separation of original ABN
AMRO parts to be owned by the
Dutch state and RBS has been
completed. The authorities intend to
divest ABN AMRO Bank N.V. The
creation of the envisaged merger of
ABN Amro and Fortis required the
prior completion of the so-called EC
Remedies transaction i.e. a sale of a
sizeable Dutch SME portfolio to a
third party (Deutsche Bank). The
capital consequences of this
transaction were taken into account
during the assessment of the
sufficiency of the additional
€4.4 billion capital strengthening.
Fortis Corporate Insurance NV was
sold to Lloyds of London.

ABN AMRO was in the process of
being acquired by a consortium
including Royal Bank of Scotland,
Fortis, and Santander. In October
2008, Fortis experienced financial
problems and was rescued,
divided and nationalized by the
Benelux states. The Dutch
authorities separated Fortis’ Dutch
banking and insurance operations
from the rest of Fortis, separated
Fortis’ share of ABN AMRO, and
are well advanced in integrating
the two operations, with a view to
eventually privatize it.

Of the roughly €50 billion
in bridge loans,
€39.8 billion has since
been repaid, including all
the short term loans.

Restructuring

Background

ING Bank

(i) A capital infusion of €10
billion through 8.5 percent
nonvoting preferred
shares; (ii) a facility under
which 80 percent of profits
or losses on ING’s illiquid
Alt-A MBS portfolio would
be passed to the state for
a fee; (iii) ING can issue
up to €10 billion in
government-guaranteed
bonds (€2 billion placed in
March 2009).

(i) Two Board
members with veto
rights over
fundamental
decisions on
acquisitions,
investments, capital
raising and
remuneration; (ii)
scrap the final 2008
dividend; (iii) grant
additional credits of
€25 billion to the
private sector; (iv)
restrict bonuses; (v)
pay a step-up
coupon if it declares
ordinary dividends.

Restructuring is based on the final
restructuring plan filed with EC
(published 26 October 2009). Besides
the Back to Basics programme to
streamline the company and reduce
risk, costs and leverage, ING will
divest all insurance and management
activities over time. ING will eliminate
double leverage and significantly
reduce balance sheet. ING will also
divest ING Direct USA. ING will
create a new company in the Dutch
retail market out of part of its current
operations, by combining the
Interadvies banking division (including
Westland Utrecht and the mortgage
activities of Nationale-Nederlanden)
and the existing consumer lending
portfolio of ING Retail. All
restructuring will take place over the
years 2010–13.

ING faced significant financial
problems stemming from global
crisis, valuation losses, an overextended business empire. Unlike
ABN AMRO/Fortis transaction,
ING remains a principally privately
owned and managed bank.

ING repurchased €5
billion of Core tier 1
securities in December
2009, in line with its plans
for early repayment of the
capital injection, and has
announced plans to
repurchase another
€2 billion by May 2011.
The timing for full
redemption is dependent
on the resolution of a
dispute with the EC on
rules governing early
redemption.

equity-like features. Of
this injection, €185 million
was repaid in December

(i) Restrictions on
executive

Aegon NV

Indirect capital infusion.
The state lent €3 billion to
AEGON's largest
shareholder, Association
AEGON, which has 34
percent voting rights
through common and
preference
shares. Association
AEGON purchased from
AEGON 750 million
nonvoting securities at €4
per security, with the
option to repurchase
250 million before the end
of 2009 at 100 percent
instead of 150 percent
penalty (for repurchase
after 2009).
AEGON has since repaid
€1.5 billion of the capital
infusion, and plans to fully
repay by mid-2011.

Table 6. Netherlands: Main FSAP Update Recommendations
Recommendations
Macroprudential Management
Assign priority to developing macro-prudential instruments.
Announce maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for new lending, and consider linking
higher LTVs to higher capital ratios.
Provide supervisors with powers to vary the level of designated macroprudential
instruments in response to developments.
Announce plans to reduce mortgage interest deductibility

Twin Peaks
Afford legal protection to DNB and the AFM as institutions, for their official actions,
except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, in line with practice in
many neighboring countries.
Provide the DNB and AFM greater discretion to put in place enforceable rules. The
lack of sufficient rule making authority leads to ad hoc approaches that risk
becoming arbitrary and subject to legal challenge.
Continue integration of DNB staff across banking, insurance, and pensions
functions, so as to draw the synergies of having a single regulator.
Microprudential Bank and Insurance Supervision
Establish routine reporting requirements to strengthen monitoring and risk modeling.
Intensify supervision of large international financial institutions, with greater
emphasis on group supervision and soundness of business models. Greater
international cooperation, beyond participation in colleges of supervisors, is
warranted.
Adopt more proactive and decisive approach, including timely off-site inspection and
corrective actions that rely less on moral suasion.
Securities market
Strengthen the AFM’s ability to enforce issuers’ compliance with financial reporting
standards.
Strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for management companies
of collective investment schemes (CIS).
Pensions
Develop a communication plan on recent and prospective changes in payouts to
stakeholders.
Require incorporation of professional Board members for pension funds beyond a
minimum size, and provide legal authority that allows direct supervision of core
pension activities independently of the entity performing them.
Crisis management and bank resolution
Reform the Deposit Guarantee Scheme so that it is: (i) ex ante funded, (ii)
authorized to fund bank resolution operations, and (iii) enjoys depositor preference.
Strengthen the institutional framework for crisis management by: (i) shifting
decision-making power from the Judiciary to DNB in the context of bank resolution,
and (ii) specifying more clearly the respective roles of the MoF and DNB in bank
resolution.
Improve the framework for official financial support by establishing a standing
budgetary authorization for the Government to fund solvency support in a manner
that avoids risk of moral hazard.
Improve the framework for bank resolution by establishing a single regime for
resolving banks under official control; such regime should set appropriate objectives
(including financial stability), as well as tasks and powers for the official
administrators.

Table 7. Netherlands: Proposed Structural Fiscal Measures
Measure

Rationale

Authorities’ view

The state pension has not been changed
since it was set up in 1957, even as life
expectancy has increased by more than 6
years and a strong second-pillar pension
system has been built up. Also, it is
relatively generous by international
standards, at about 31 percent of average
earnings compared to an average 22
percent for neighboring countries.

The authorities do not dispute the need for
such measures. They have already moved in
this area by abolishing tax incentives for early
retirement. However, plans to raise the
statutory retirement age by two years to 67 by
2025 have been scaled back and an increase
to 66 years is now envisaged, with ongoing
discussion on linking the retirement age to
longevity thereafter.

Savings in health and long-term care:

Increase in user fees.

Tightening entitlements to long
term care.

Productivity increases

Benchmarking.

Health-care spending and long-term care
expenditure are projected to rise by one
percent and 4 percent of GDP by 2060,
respectively with population aging, due in
part to expensive advances in medical
technology and real income growth, given
high income elasticity of health-services
demand. Thus, an increase in user fees
could moderate demand growth, although
care should be taken to prevent
overburdening the chronically ill.
Tightening entitlements in long-term care
could spawn savings in an area where
aging pressures in Netherlands are the
highest in the EU. Productivity increases
in health- and long-term care of ½ percent
a year (which has been achieved in some
OECD countries) would lower significantly
projected rises in spending. Domestic and
international benchmarking to identify
best practices would also be beneficial.

Major health care reforms in 2006 have
increased competition and dampened the rise
of costs. Further modest savings are envisaged
as part of the new government’s fiscal
adjustment measures. They are also
considering increases in user fees and tighter
entitlements in long term care, but emphasize
the need to keep extensive availability of social
services given societal preferences.

40

Further pension reform:

Raising retirement age.

Lowering accrual rate for
pension benefits.

Tightening early retirement.

Table 7. Netherlands: Proposed Structural Fiscal Measures (concluded)
Measure

Rationale

Substantial reduction in mortgage
interest tax deductibility.

Prompt announcement with an
appropriately long phase in
period to avoid disruptions in the
housing market.

Very liberal deductibility has helped put
upward pressure on house prices,
mortgage size, and mortgage loan to
value ratios, thus raising household
indebtedness and vulnerabilities in the
housing market. Moreover, it constitutes a
large tax expenditure (about 7 percent of
fiscal revenues).

Authorities’ view
Political pressures imply that this cannot be
implemented at least in the short run.

1/ The consumption growth in 2006 is adjusted for the health care reform. The reform of the health care system at the
beginning of 2006 resulted in a shift of health care expenditures of about euro 8.0 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) from private to
public consumption, distorting private consumption downward by about 3 percentage points in 2006.

ANNEX III. NETHERLANDS: PAST FUND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation

Fiscal Policy: Staff endorsed the substantial structural fiscal relaxation of the
authorities during the global crisis in 2009-10, but also encouraged the
authorities to embark on strong consolidation from 2011 onward as economic
recovery commenced, given an estimated sustainability gap of 8 percent of
GDP in 2011. Other recommendations include closer coordination between the
central government and the local governments, and refinements to enhance
the transparency and reduce the procyclicality of the fiscal framework (e.g.,
reporting of tax expenditures in the budget and their inclusion in the
expenditures ceiling, and exclusion of unemployment benefits from the
expenditure ceiling).

Fiscal consolidation of some 3½ percentage points of GDP, in structural terms,
is planned for 2011–15. The authorities have also improved coordination
between various levels of government, excluded the windfalls in interest
payments from the expenditures ceiling, and integrated the FES fund into the
central government budget. However, after removing unemployment benefits
from the expenditure ceilings during the crisis, they have since put them back
under the ceilings.

Labor Market: Past recommendations included tightening unemployment
benefits, abolishing fiscal incentives for early retirement, reducing inactivity
traps, reassessing disability entitlements, and liberalizing employment
protection legislation.

Maximum duration of unemployment benefits was lowered to 38 months—
which however remains high in international comparison. Tax/benefit
incentives for early retirement were reduced, inactivity traps attenuated,
marginal tax rates on second earners reduced, and disability rights tightened.
Key recommendations not yet taken on board include (i) further improve the
design of the unemployment benefits system to encourage search effort, and
(ii) further easing the dismissal system and aligning the rate of accumulation of
severance payments for workers aged 50 and over with that of other workers.

Product Market: The Fund has generally supported the authorities’ own
liberalization program, including the regional unbundling of the energy market,
the reduction in required licenses and permits, and, more generally, the efforts
to increase competition and reduce the cost of doing business.

The stringency of product market regulation has gradually decreased,
reflecting continued simplification in barriers to entrepreneurship. However,
retail distribution should be further liberalized by phasing-out the restriction on
shop-opening hours, easing zoning regulations and facilitating the entry of
large retail stores.

Financial Sector: the 2004 Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) and
subsequent Article IV consultations have recommended passage of a new
Financial Supervision Act, clarifying the framework for financial sector
supervision and the authority of the minister, improvements in security
settlement systems, introduction of the new regulatory framework for pension
funds, expanding stress testing models, strengthening the AML-CFT
framework, reducing mortgage interest deductibility, introducing a mortgage
code of conduct to help contain high LTV mortgages.

The authorities have implemented most of these recommendations. Prudential
supervision is consolidated at DNB, while market conduct supervision is
entrusted to AFM. A Financial Stability Division has been established at DNB
and pension regulation has been overhauled. DNB has been conducting
stress tests regularly as well as improving the stress test framework. There is
still only limited progress regarding mortgage interest deductibility, which
remains very generous. Similarly, the mortgage code of conduct has been
strengthened, but it has not been very effective in reducing the high LTV ratio.
An explicit LTV ratio guideline has been introduced in 2011.

ANNEX IV. NETHERLANDS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 16, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: As a one-off matter, a number of institutional reforms had a significant
impact on national account and other data in 2006. Most importantly, the reform of health
care insurance caused a significant reclassification of private consumption into public
consumption. This shift had a big impact on the growth rates of the components concerned,
but overall GDP was not affected.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands
Executive Board Meeting
June 10, 2011
1.
This statement summarizes developments in the Netherlands since the issuance
of the staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Staff have raised the projections for GDP growth in 2011–12. This reflects recent
information showing stronger than expected growth in 2011:Q1 in the Netherlands and also
better-than-anticipated economic activity for important trading partners, leading to a
corresponding upgrade of their rates of GDP expansion for 2011–12. Specifically:


The latest Dutch data indicate that GDP y-o-y growth in 2011:Q1 was 2.7 percent
(0.9 percent with respect to the previous quarter), with investment surprising strongly
on the upside. On this basis, we have revised our 2011 GDP growth projection to
1.9 percent, from 1.5 percent previously.



GDP growth for 2012 is expected at 1.7 percent (compared to 1.5 percent before).

3.
As a result of the faster cyclical upturn, projections for the headline fiscal
balance have improved modestly. In particular, the deficit for 2011 is now estimated at
3½ percent of GDP (3¾ percent of GDP earlier), and a balanced budget is now expected for
2016 (against a deficit of ½ percent of GDP earlier). The projected pace of annual structural
fiscal tightening, however, remains broadly unchanged.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands–Netherlands
On June 10, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands.1
Background
The Netherlands emerged from a deep recession in mid-2009, but the recovery is still frail. The
slump was caused by adverse trade and financial spillovers from the global crisis, which also
forced large public intervention in the financial sector. Conversely, the subsequent upturn has
been stimulated by strong exports. Despite a somewhat slower pace of recovery in the second
half of the year, GDP grew 1¾ percent in 2010. Unemployment has risen only modestly, in part
because of labor hoarding, and has been slightly declining since mid-2010. With output still well
below potential, inflation has remained subdued until recently, though it is now picking up, also
because of rising oil prices. Several indicators suggest that external competitiveness is
adequate.
Banking system soundness has improved significantly, though fragilities remain in the financial
sector. Banks’ regulatory capital adequacy has risen markedly since 2008, largely reflecting
government intervention, but equity relative to (unweighted) assets is still comparatively low,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

with regulatory capital reflecting the low risk-weighting of mortgages. Nonperforming loans
remain manageable at less than 3 percent of total loans. Bank profitability, though still weak,
has recovered slightly. However, the coverage ratio for many pension funds is under pressure,
owing to extended longevity and persistent low interest rates. The insurance industry is also
under strain. A well-designed strategy of gradual exit from the extraordinary public support is
being implemented, amid continued restructuring of the financial sector.
The housing and mortgage markets are relatively stable, although vulnerabilities to household
balance sheets are rising. House prices steadied from mid-2009 to mid-2010, but seem to have
resumed a slow downward drift since then. Affordability-based indicators of house price
sustainability remain elevated, albeit having stabilized and slightly improved from two years ago.
On the other hand, econometric models do not indicate that house prices are misaligned with
fundamentals. However, household debt has grown substantially in relation to disposable
income, to over 270 percent in 2010, among the highest in advanced economies. In addition,
the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new mortgages has continued to rise from its already unusually
elevated levels, and exceeded 120 percent in 2010 according to some measures.
The fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2009, but is already improving. The general
government balance weakened considerably in 2009, reaching a deficit of 5½ percent of GDP,
on account of substantial stimulus measures and free operation of automatic stabilizers to help
stem the impact of the global crisis. However, unexpectedly strong tax receipts in 2010 helped
reduce the deficit slightly to 5¼ percent of GDP. Public debt has risen to almost 64 percent of
GDP at end-2010, owing also to financial sector assistance not reflected in the deficit. Together
with the impact of long-run aging pressures, the fiscal sustainability gap is estimated at about
7½ percent of GDP. Strong consolidation plans are being implemented with a view to
substantially reduce the deficit by 2015.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the ongoing export-led recovery and noted that remaining slack
is dampening inflationary pressures from international commodity prices. Notwithstanding
encouraging near-term prospects, Directors considered that the risks to the economic outlook
remain skewed to the downside. Over the longer term, fiscal risks could also mount as supplyside dislocations created by the global financial crisis and population aging weigh on potential
growth.
Directors supported the authorities’ ambitious and frontloaded fiscal consolidation plans,
intended to reconstitute policy space and prepare for future increases in age-related spending.
Many Directors, however, stressed that fiscal adjustment should be implemented more flexibly
than currently allowed by the authorities’ fiscal framework, if adverse external shocks slowed
significantly the pace of economic activity. In particular, automatic stabilizers should be allowed
to operate freely to shore up domestic demand and discretionary support should be considered.

3
Directors observed that measures that reduce the impact of population aging on public
expenditures or broaden the tax base must be key elements of the authorities’ adjustment
strategy. Concerning expenditures, Directors agreed that efforts should be addressed at
increasing the effective retirement age and restraining growth in costs of health and long-term
care.
Directors noted that the soundness of the financial sector has improved, but fragilities remain.
They welcomed the results of stress tests in the context of the FSAP update, which show
resilience of bank capital and liquidity buffers under extreme scenarios. Nonetheless, Directors
saw merit in further strengthening capital or liquidity buffers given high leverage ratios and the
upcoming shift to tighter capital standards under Basel III.
Directors agreed that the buildup of vulnerabilities in the housing market warrants close
attention in light of the heavy exposure of the financial system to that market, although a few
Directors noted the risk-mitigating factors. They encouraged the authorities to consider a further
tightening of prudential regulation and granting the Netherlands Central Bank the authority to
impose additional restrictions, if necessary.
Directors considered that additional improvements are needed in the areas of rule-making
authority and legal protection of supervisors; adequacy of data reporting requirements; resource
constraints; and the crisis resolution framework. Directors remarked that efforts should also
focus on strengthening the supervision of large international financial institutions.
Directors agreed that low interest rates and rising longevity have put pressure on the coverage
ratios of many pension funds. A reform of the pension system is thus needed. In this regard,
Directors welcomed the recent agreement between the authorities and social partners, and
stressed the need for a transparent communication of any risk-sharing modifications to the
current system to induce fitting changes in saving behavior.
Directors agreed that structural reforms continue to be key to lifting the Netherlands’s long-term
growth prospects. In particular, further reforms of the tax and benefit systems are needed to
boost labor participation of women and older workers and facilitate job search.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for the Kingdom of Netherlands—Netherlands
and Ester Barendregt, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 10, 2011
Introduction
The Dutch authorities thank staff for the constructive meetings during the article IV and FSAP update
missions and for their appraisals. The authorities are very appreciative of the analysis and broadly
share the assessments.
Economic outlook
Staff has revised its forecasts for real GDP upward, as explained in the staff statement, from 1½
percent in 2011 and 2012 to 1.9 and 1.7 percent respectively. In view of recent data, this upward
revision seems justified. Indeed, outcomes so far have surprised on the upside. According to Statistics
Netherlands (CBS), the Dutch economy grew by 3.2 percent in the first quarter of this year on an
annualised basis, the highest recorded in the last three years. Quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.9
percent, a better result than the average growth figure over the six preceding quarters.
Risks to the outlook
Staff rightly points to external risks, given the Netherlands’ extensive trade and financial links.
Disruptions in sovereign debt markets, simultaneous fiscal tightening in several advanced European
countries and lack of progress in resolving global imbalances indeed pose threats to the recovery. That
is why the government in multiple international settings has persistently emphasized the need for
international policy coordination.
Housing market
Staff rightfully points to domestic risks related to high mortgage debt. The authorities have already
taken action to strike a balance between mitigating financial risks and ensuring stability in the housing
market: in addition to strengthening regulation with regard to mortgage lending, LTV-ratios for new
mortgages will be capped at 110% combined with a requirement to build up savings to pay off at least
50 percent of the mortgage loan at maturity. Although a maximum LTV of 110 percent is still high in
international perspective, several country-specific circumstances mitigate risks: the Netherlands
traditionally has very low default rates, reflecting inter alia that banks have full recourse against
borrowers. Low unemployment (4¼ percent in 2011 and 4 percent in 2012) provides a secure basis for
household income. For low income households, risks are mitigated through the National Mortgage
Guarantee. And in contrast to many other countries, there is no excess supply of housing. The CPB
expects an increase in the number of households in the coming years, while housing production
currently is far lower than the long-term need. As is also noted by staff, house prices seem to be in line
with fundamentals.
Macro-financial linkages
Staff finds that as a result of deleveraging, stress in the banking sector and falling profitability, banks
tightened credit supply during the crisis. The authorities express some caution about the conclusion in
box 2, that the Netherlands has experienced a ‘credit crunch’ in 2009. This could be misinterpreted as
negative credit growth, while de facto credit growth did slow down from the pre-crisis peaks, but
remained positive (end 2009 ca 3% year-on-year). They emphasize that a slowdown in credit demand
has also played a role in the weakening of credit growth. Recent research of DNB shows that a

majority of banks has recently relaxed policies for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. This
is a positive sign that credit supply conditions are improving.
Fiscal policy
In line with staff´s previous recommendations, the government has started to withdraw stimulus
measures in 2011 and has made fiscal consolidation one of its main priorities. Consolidation measures
are taken to ensure a total reduction of the budget deficit of €18 billion (nearly 3% of GDP) by 2015.
Staff welcomes the commitment to consolidate, but argues for flexible handling of these measures
should the recovery stall. In particular, staff calls for enhanced working of the automatic stabilizers.
Although the authorities agree that a very severe shock (as in 2008-2009) could warrant relaxation of
fiscal adjustment, they believe that debt levels and deficits have reached such heights that fiscal
adjustment should have priority over flexibility. The debt level has to be brought back to pre-crisis
levels to ensure that government finances can absorb future shocks without raising market tensions.
Moreover, age-related spending (pensions and health care) is expected to increase significantly over
the coming decades, putting further pressure on the government budget balance. Therefore the
government feels strongly that consolidation should be undertaken straight away. As for the automatic
stabilizers, according to estimates of the Ministry of Finance, they can function freely without
reaching their ceilings (as set in the coalition-agreement) even in a protracted period of zero-growth.
Pension reform
The IMF rightly points to the low interest rate environment and increased longevity as major causes of
the current low coverage ratios of Dutch pension funds. The Dutch authorities agree with the IMF
recommendation to recalibrate the second-pillar pensions. Tripartite consultation between unions,
employers and the government are ongoing, and aim to link the pension age to life expectancy. The
nature of the pension contracts has also been subject of debate, in particular the possibility to transfer
more investment risks to the participants. The government has already submitted a bill to raise the
retirement age to 66 in 2020 and to tighten the fiscal stimulation of second-pillar pensions. In case the
social partners are unable to reach agreement, further measures may be taken, depending on whether a
majority in parliament can be formed on this issue. The authorities fully agree with staff’s
recommendation to communicate clearly to the public any such changes.
Other reforms
The Dutch authorities agree with staff that further reforms are needed to ensure fiscal sustainability.
The aging population in particular poses important challenges. The authorities embrace staff’s
recommendation that participation in the labor market should be increased and are already undertaking
action: participation is being strengthened through education policies and fiscal measures that
encourage job search. This could lead to long-term employment increases of 1.1% in structural terms,
according to the CPB’s medium-term forecast.
FSAP
The FSAP update has been a comprehensive exercise, performed by a professional and dedicated
team. It was well-timed and very useful for the authorities. The FSAP shows a high level of
observance with the BCP, IAIS and IOSCO standards. It confirms the high quality of the supervisory
framework and the improvements that have been realized in the Netherlands since the FSAP mission
of 2003/2004. The financial sector in the Netherlands has recovered after the financial crisis. In the

context of the vulnerable international environment, the authorities are comforted by the results of the
stress tests performed as part of the FSAP. The stress tests show that the financial sector currently
seems to be robust, even under extremely difficult conditions. All banks are able to withstand even the
most severe test that is included in the FSAP. Notwithstanding these findings, the authorities remain
vigilant of risks.
New initiatives
Looking forward, supervisors and regulators must continue to adapt to lessons learned and constant
changes in the financial markets. The recommendations of the IMF are therefore welcome and are
considered carefully. Several initiatives have already been taken and after the Board meeting,
Parliament will be informed of the planned course of action to address the recommendations made by
the IMF. Highlights are:
- DNB’s Action Plan
DNB has embarked on a reform program to make its supervision more intrusive and conclusive. This
includes the creation of a new supervisory division within DNB since January 2011 that comprises
several expertise centers and a separate department with a focus on early intervention.
- Strengthening the Crisis Management Framework
Draft legislation proposes to extend the powers of DNB to organize a timely and orderly restructuring
of a troubled financial institution. It also enables the Minister of Finance to take immediate action
regarding a financial institution in case the stability of the financial system is under serious and
immediate threat. In addition, it aims to resolve the problem of so-called trigger events, where the
measures of the supervisor or the Minister of Finance unintentionally lead to immediate fulfillment or
termination of existing contracts. The aimed date of entry into force is mid 2012. In addition to this
framework, the deposit guarantee scheme will be reformed to an ex-ante funded risk-based scheme.
- Introduction of Solvency II
This will bring supervisory practice of the insurance sector further in line with the IAIS core
principles and important recommendations of the IMF: capital adequacy standards will be more robust
and risk-sensitive. The quarterly reports that are now received from the institutions on an informal
basis, will then be formally required. DNB’s ability for group-wide supervision will be strengthened,
including more stringent rules on intragroup transactions. In addition to the Solvency II framework,
the AFM has also strengthened the supervision of intermediaries.
- Strengthening International Supervision
The authorities will continue to contribute to strengthening international cooperation, including in
colleges of supervisors and crisis management groups. Supervisory resources will be increased and the
scope of supervision will be strengthened under Solvency II and the review of the financial
conglomerates directive.
- Macro-prudential analysis and policy
DNB is developing a macroprudential framework and is working on the design and implementation of
macroprudential instruments. The extent to which a formal mandate for macroprudential policy would
be needed is under investigation. Furthermore, DNB supports implementation of a framework for

systemically important financial institutions and has publicly announced that it will roll out this
framework proportionately to all Dutch SIFIs, whether domestic or global.
- Other FSAP recommendations
Data availability - both for micro- and macroprudential purposes - will also be improved. This has
been identified as a specific supervisory theme of DNB for 2011. The Minister has recently
announced proposals with regard to the institutional framework and the division of responsibilities
between the Ministry of Finance and the supervisors. In reaction to the staff’s recommendations on
regulatory powers, the authorities will consider whether the scope for supervisors to set technical rules
should be widened. Also, in line with the recommendation of the IMF, the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Justice have recently announced legislation to limit the liability of the financial
supervisors. Supervisors have welcomed this initiative.
Other lessons
The FSAP-team made an analysis of the Twin Peaks supervisory model in the Netherlands and
concludes that the case for the model remains strong. Nevertheless, the authorities’ experiences in the
crisis have revealed areas for further strengthening: prudential supervision can benefit from synergies
in a cross-sectoral supervisory approach. More flexible and risk-based use of resources would enable
DNB to better focus activities on that part of the financial sector that is most susceptible to systemic
risk. In addition, the Twin Peaks model provides opportunities to further combine financial stability
analysis into micro-prudential supervision and vice versa. Finally, recent experience has shown that
conduct-of-business problems can easily turn into prudential problems. Coordination between the two
supervisors therefore remains important.
On a final note, the authorities attach great importance to European and international cooperation
to enhance the regulatory system and practice. They therefore look forward to continue discussions
with the IMF and other regulators and supervisors worldwide to take on the challenge to build a
stronger and more robust framework for the financial sector.
