IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On September 21, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
The economy of Belize is facing multiple challenges. GDP growth slowed to 1 percent in
2015 due to falling oil production and reduced output in the primary commodity sectors, and
turned to negative 1.5 percent in the first half of 2016 relative to the same period in 2015.
The decline in oil and other commodity prices led to deflation in 2015, but the inflation rate
turned positive in early 2016 owing to higher food prices and the hike in the fuel tax. The
effective exchange rate appreciated sharply both in nominal and real terms, driven mostly by
the strengthening of the US dollar to which the currency is pegged, reducing
competitiveness. The shocks in the export sector have widened the current account deficit to
9.8 percent of GDP in 2015. Further decline in exports in the first half of 2016, combined
with settling liabilities related to the two nationalized companies, reduced international
reserves to 4.4 months of imports in late August 2016. Hurricane Earl, which hit Belize in
early August, compounded the challenging economic environment. On the positive side, the
performance of the tourism sector in the first half of 2016 has been strong, and the
unemployment rate declined from 10.1 percent in April 2015 to 8 percent in April 2016.
The fiscal position has weakened, pushing the public debt higher. The overall fiscal
deficit expanded to 8 percent of GDP in 2015. The sharp deterioration was explained by a
one-off payment related to the settlement of liabilities for one of the nationalized companies
(2.8 percent of GDP), although the structural deficit, which excludes one-off and cyclical
factors, worsened as well on account of an increase in public sector wages and transfers and a
large overrun in capital expenditure. This deficit and partial settlement of liabilities related to
the nationalized companies pushed the public sector debt to 82 percent of GDP in 2015. As a
fiscal measure, the authorities have increased their fuel tax, which is expected to increase
revenues by close to 1½ percent of GDP.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Banking system’s weaknesses appear to have somewhat diminished, although the loss of
correspondent banking relationships experienced by the largest banks is posing
significant challenges for the economy. The system’s ratio of non-performing loans to total
loans fell to 15.8 percent (5.7 percent net of provisions) at end-March 2016, and the reported
capital adequacy ratio increased to 25 percent. However, important vulnerabilities continue
to linger. The banks have lost a significant number of correspondent banking relationships
(CBRs), which has led to significant increase in transactions costs and a winding down of
deposits in international banks.
The economic outlook has worsened further since the 2015 Article IV. GDP is projected
to decline by 1.5 percent in 2016, in part due to the damage inflicted by hurricane Earl, and
average less than 2 percent in the medium-term, reflecting declining productivity,
competitiveness and public investment. In the absence of a radical change in policies, rigid
current fiscal spending, particularly the public sector wage bill, would fuel high fiscal deficits
and add to the already high debt burden. Financing constraints would reduce public
investment. The current account deficit would slowly improve due to a gradual recovery in
major commodity exports, but would remain high, indicating a weak external position. This
deficit, combined with remaining payments for nationalized companies and increased debt
service, would reduce international reserves to uncomfortable levels.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors noted that Belize continues to face significant vulnerabilities and
challenges driven by high public debt, large fiscal and external deficits, and declining
international reserves. Adverse weather conditions have also posed difficulties. Directors
emphasized that decisive policies are urgently needed to ensure macroeconomic stability and
improve growth performance.
Directors stressed that placing public debt on a downward path is a key priority. While noting
that fiscal adjustment could initially impact growth, they emphasized that rigorous and
sustained efforts, including both revenue and expenditure measures, are critical to ensuring
fiscal sustainability and building investor confidence. Directors welcomed the important
steps taken by the authorities to contain public expenditures and increase revenue, but
highlighted that additional measures, particularly raising the GST rate, reducing the public
wage bill, reforming the pension plan for civil servants, and strengthening public financial
management, will be important going forward.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors noted the improvements in the financial sector and called for sustained efforts to
tighten supervision and reduce vulnerabilities. They underscored the importance of continued
careful assessment and monitoring financial sector risks and agreed that an asset quality
review of all banks would dispel possible uncertainties about the size of their capital buffers.
Timely completion of financial stability reports, including stress tests that adjust banks’
capital buffers for shortfalls in provisioning, would further strengthen the financial sector
supervision toolkit.
Directors noted that the loss of remaining Correspondent Banking Relationships (CBRs)
could have a negative impact on the financial sector and the wider economy and will require
action on multiple fronts, both domestically and internationally. They also highlighted that
stronger implementation of the AML/CFT framework and improved transparency in the
offshore sector, with technical assistance where needed, would help further improve
compliance with international standards and understanding of money laundering and terrorist
financing risks, and help address the withdrawal of CBRs.
Directors emphasized that broad-based structural reforms aimed at improving the business
climate, boosting productivity, and increasing competitiveness are critical to reducing
vulnerabilities and promoting growth. They welcomed the adoption of the Growth and
Sustainable Development Strategy and called for its vigorous implementation, using
non-debt-creating financing options, such as well-designed public-private partnerships. Labor
market reforms will also be important going forward.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 15, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to average less than 2 percent in the mediumterm. The envisaged fiscal adjustment would remain insufficient to significantly reduce
the very high public debt. Large external imbalances, driven by large current account
deficits, repayment of the super bond and remaining payments for the nationalized
telecommunication company (BTL), would reduce international reserves to uncomfortable
levels. The further withdrawal by global banks of correspondent relationships with
Belizean banks and low capital buffers in some banks are key threats to financial stability.
Insufficient fiscal adjustment and weaknesses in the banking system are significant risks.
Focus of the Consultation. Discussions focused on policies that would reduce the
likelihood of a disorderly fiscal and external adjustment, preserve financial stability, and
boost competitiveness.
Key policy advice:


Urgently implement the fiscal measures (widening the tax base, strengthening revenue
administration, and containing spending on wages, transfers, pensions, and goods and
services) necessary to improve the primary fiscal balance to about 4½ percent of GDP
in the medium term.



Address public financial management (PFM) weaknesses, including internal and
external controls as well as procurement practices, to contain low-quality spending.



Continue to address banking sector vulnerabilities, especially weak capital buffers, by
maintaining restrictions on lending and distribution of dividends.



Continue to monitor and contain the impact of the loss of correspondent banking
relationships by strengthening and vigorously implementing the AML/CFT framework,
including by enhancing supervision and bolstering entity transparency.



Develop a financing strategy for the recently adopted Growth and Sustainable
Development Strategy (GSDS) and consider growth-enhancing measures that can be
implemented at no financial cost, including submitting the draft credit bureau law to
parliament and allowing for greater flexibility on employment hours in labor markets.

Implementation of staff advice. The authorities are considering widening the tax base
by streamlining exemptions. Restrictions on banks with weak capital buffers remain.
Implementation of the growth strategy still awaits a realistic plan for its financing.

BACKGROUND
1.
The ruling United Democratic Party (UDP) of Prime Minister Dean Barrow retained
parliamentary majority in early general elections on November 4, 2015. The UDP increased the
number of seats it holds in the 31-seat parliament from 17 to 22, and PM Barrow was sworn in for an
unprecedented third term in the office.
2.
The authorities still have some rapidly-shrinking policy space to reduce the likelihood
of a disorderly fiscal and external adjustment that would jeopardize the currency peg. Belize is
grappling with large fiscal and external deficits, which are fueled by large wage increases for public
workers (about 25 percent during FY2014/15-FY2016/17) and the very slow pace of structural
reforms, which are needed to enhance public financial management (PFM) and competitiveness. The
forthcoming compensation payments for the nationalized Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL) and the
higher debt service on the super bond will further weaken fiscal and external accounts. Social
challenges remain as discussed during the 2015 Article IV Consultation, with high unemployment
and delicate security environment that would make orderly macroeconomic adjustment increasingly
difficult if not undertaken promptly. Very few of the recommendations of the 2015 Article IV
Consultation have so far been implemented and the rising fiscal and external vulnerabilities in the
context of worsening macroeconomic prospects only highlight the urgency of strong action to
address them (figure below and Box 1).

2015 Article IV Recommendations

Implementation Status

Fiscal consolidation

Marginal

Improve the primary fiscal balance to about
4.5 percent of GDP in the medium term
using a combination of revenue and
expenditure measures, including
broadening of the tax base and reducing
mandatory expenditure. Address public
financial management weaknesses,
including internal and external controls as
well as procurement practices to contain
low-quality spending.

The fiscal outcome for 2015/16 was worse than expected
during 2015 Article IV. In order to improve the fiscal stance,
the authorities increased the fuel tax, which is expected to
improve fiscal revenue by about 1½ percent of GDP and
acknowledged the need for further fiscal measures. However,
other recommended revenue and expenditure reforms have
not yet committed to any specific set of measures.

Financial sector reform

Broadly consistent

Continue to address banking sector
vulnerabilities, including by raising capital
buffers and tightening restrictions on the
distribution of dividends and lending for
banks with the lowest capital buffers.

The authorities continue to advance financial sector reforms,
including key projects (e.g. the national payment system) that
would improve the financial system infrastructure.
Restrictions on the banks (including the systemic bank) that
have not met prudential requirements, remain in place. The
Central Bank of Belize (CBB) continues to conduct onsite fullscope and AML/CFT examinations of banks and credit unions.
In March 2016, the CBB published the first financial stability
report covering 2014.

Structural reform

Moderate

Implement a comprehensive medium-term
growth strategy, including clear foreign
exchange regulations and policies to boost
the financial system’s role in financing the
economy.

Progress with the Growth and Sustainable Development
Strategy (GSDS) has been delayed by the 2015 elections. The
new government endorsed the strategy in April 2016. Given
the limited fiscal space, implementation would hinge upon
careful prioritization and costing of projects and ensuring
adequate financing. Progress is needed in establishing a
credit bureau and a credit registry to further strengthen the
role of the financial system in financing the economy.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.


The economy is slowing and fiscal and external vulnerabilities are rising. (Figures 1–5):
Real GDP growth slowed down to 1 percent in 2015 from 4.1 percent in 2014 mainly because of
falling oil production and reduced output in the fishing, citrus and banana sectors, which offset
the good performance of tourism. Diseases and falling prices have significantly affected the
fishing and citrus sectors, and banana production has suffered from flooding and financing
difficulties faced by a large farm (15 percent of production). The unemployment rate declined to
10.2 percent in September 2015, from 12.1 percent a year earlier, due to a moderate expansion in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

tourism and public investment in infrastructure. The decline in oil and other commodity prices
led to deflation in 2015, with end-of-period inflation at -0.6 percent, but the increases in food
prices and fuel taxes restored positive inflation, at 0.2 percent in April 2016 (y/y).


The current account deficit widened to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2015 from 7.4 percent in 2014
driven by a contraction in exports of goods of about 9 percent (mainly oil and marine products),
and increases in imports of machinery, manufactured goods and fertilizers, which are partly
related to investment projects. This deficit combined with partial compensation and loan
settlement payments for the two nationalized companies (BEL and BTL) in late 2015 significantly
reduced gross international reserves (4.6 months of imports at end-March 2016). The effective
exchange rate appreciated sharply both in nominal and real terms in 2015, driven mostly by the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar to which the currency is pegged. Exports of goods declined by
nearly 30 percent during January ─April 2016 compared with the same period last year, while
imports of goods declined by 2.4 percent. The sharp drop in exports of goods reflects deepening
contraction in oil production and in the fishing, banana and citrus sectors.



According to preliminary estimates, the overall fiscal deficit for FY2015/16 (April-March)
increased to 8 percent of GDP from 2.4 percent of GDP in FY2014/15. The sharp deterioration
was explained by a one-off payment related to the settlement of BTL liabilities (2.8 percent of
GDP), an increase in public sector wages and transfers, and a large overrun in capital expenditure.
The deficit in FY2015/16 was financed through borrowing from the Central Bank of Belize (CBB)
and a drawdown of PetroCaribe deposits.



Broad money grew by 7.6 percent in 2015 and by 8.3 percent at end-March 2016 (y/y), supported
by credit expansion to the government. Private sector credit grew by 4.8 percent in 2015 and was
flat at end-March 2016. Abundant liquidity in the banking system has driven T-bills interest rates
to near zero and lending rates continue to fall.

The resilience of the banking system has improved since the last Article IV, although important
vulnerabilities continue to linger (see Selected Issues Paper). The banking system’s ratio of gross
non–performing loans (NPLs) to total loans fell to 15.8 percent (5.7 percent net of provisions) at
end-March 2016, from end-March 2015 (16.1 percent gross or 6.1 percent net of provisions),
while provisioning continued to increase. The reported capital adequacy ratio (CAR) increased by
about 1.3 percentage points to 25 percent, due primarily to capital injection by two domestic
banks, sale of a valuable asset by an international bank and improving profitability of the
banking system. Return on assets for the banking system was 0.4 percent at end-March 2016,
unchanged from end-March 2015. A major bank’s NPL ratio rose to 28.6 percent (13.5 percent
net of provisions) at end-March 2016 from 23 percent at end-March 2015 (9.3 percent net of
provisions), due to a recent classification of a legacy loan as NPL (US$14 million or one-third of
capital). Its CAR was 15.1 percent at end-March 2016 (13.2 at end-March 2015), but it could fall
below the regulatory minimum of 9 percent if the above-mentioned legacy loan is fully
provisioned or written off. The bank has applied to the CBB for approval to restructure this loan.
If this request is granted, the bank’s CAR, excluding the disputed government asset on its
balance sheet (US$21.5 million), would fall to 9.6 percent.



The challenges posed by global financial institutions’ withdrawal of correspondent banking
relationships (CBRs) with banks in Belize and elsewhere have increased since the 2015 Article IV
Consultation (see Selected Issues Paper). In Belize, only two of the ten domestic and international
banks currently have CBRs with full banking services. The systemic bank and its international
subsidiary can process only non-US-dollar wire transfers. Other banks have also managed to
maintain wire transfer arrangements, including with non-bank providers of payment services.
Four banks, including the systemic bank, have also lost their credit card settlement accounts with
a small bank in New York, and proceeds from their credit card transactions can only be used
through their accounts with a major credit card company or through restricted accounts such as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

BELIZE

brokerage accounts. The CBB has lost three of its five CBRs in the last two years. On aggregate,
the impact of the loss of CBRs on volumes of international transactions is not yet noticeable on
available data as most CBRs were actually lost in late 2015 or early 2016, but there are indications
that transaction costs are increasing. For example, the systemic bank indicated having increased
wire transfer fees from about US$ 100 to US$ 300. Most wire transfers in Belize are now done
through a reduced number of arrangements and their processing times have also increased from
“within twenty-four hours” to “several days.” Some customers of the affected banks moved to the
two banks that still have CBRs with full banking services. The growth rate of deposits in the
banking system has fallen, driven by a significant decrease in deposits in international banks,
partially offset by an increase of deposits in domestic banks.


Global financial institutions’ decisions to withdraw CBRs are driven by a number of
considerations that go beyond Belize (see Selected Issues Paper). These include: (i) more rigorous
global prudential regulatory requirements; (ii) higher compliance costs; (iii) the evolving
regulatory and enforcement landscape, notably with respect to economic and trade sanctions,
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and tax
transparency, which also inform banks’ cost-benefit analysis as well as their risk and reputational
costs perceptions; and (iv) cross-border legal impediments to the implementation of
international standards. Further pressures to withdraw CBRs may arise where regulatory
expectations are unclear, and risks cannot be mitigated.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
The near-to-medium-term macroeconomic outlook is worse than the already weak
prospects at the time of the 2015 Article IV Consultation (Tables 1─5). Growth is projected to
decline further to about 0.5 percent in 2016 and average less than 2 percent in the medium-term,
reflecting declining productivity, competitiveness and public investment, as well as some import
compression stemming from the projected precarious levels of foreign exchange (FX) reserves.
Inflation is expected to remain moderate due to projected low international oil prices and subdued
inflation in major trading partners. The current account deficit would slowly improve due to a gradual
recovery in major commodity exports, but would remain high, indicating overvaluation of the real
effective exchange rate (Annex I). This deficit, combined with the repatriation of part of remaining
payments for the nationalized BTL (Annex II) and the repayment of super bond (US$ 526.5 million at
end-2015, payable over 2020-38) would reduce international reserves to uncomfortable levels. Staff
projections assume that the government will sell a part of shares of the two nationalized companies
in excess of 51 percent ownership and use the proceeds (US$ 100 million or 5.5 percent of GDP) to
reduce public debt and support international reserves. Moving toward a WTO-compliant tax system
would initially reduce fiscal revenue (Table 6). Financing constraints would reduce public investment,
dampening some of the deterioration in the fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, the fiscal adjustment
projected in the baseline scenario, which assumes no measures beyond those announced, will remain
insufficient even to stabilize the very high level of public debt or reduce the likelihood of a disorderly
fiscal and external adjustment (Annex II).

The baseline scenario is subject to substantial downside risks (Annex III). The public
debt path is subject to significant risks, including shocks to fiscal balance, GDP growth and other
macroeconomic variables. The twin deficits and potentially large contingent liabilities could lead to

performance. These vulnerabilities could be
exacerbated by external risks, including the strengthening of the US dollar, or a protracted period of
weak growth in advanced and emerging economies, which would further hamper the already weak
export performance, the end of PetroCaribe financing, the expected decline in sugar prices after the
EU sugar reform takes full effect in 2017, and the loss of tourism market share to Cuba. The abovementioned risks and their potential impact on the overall economy could also affect borrowers’
ability to repay their debt, which would further weaken banks and reduce their ability to lend, and
thus create a vicious circle that amplifies threats to the stability of the financial system and the rest of
the economy (see Selected Issues Paper). On the upside, low international oil prices and a successful
implementation of the Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS), which is not yet fully
reflected in the baseline scenario, could help mitigate the above-mentioned risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Staff emphasized the need to promptly take measures to reduce the likelihood of a disorderly fiscal and
external adjustment. In particular, the authorities should: (i) raise the primary fiscal balance to levels
that would credibly place public debt on a downward path and help rebuild investor confidence;
(ii) reduce banking sector vulnerabilities and strengthen the AML/CFT framework, especially in the
offshore sector; and (iii) given the limited fiscal space, design a credible financing strategy for the GSDS
and consider growth-enhancing measures that can be implemented at no financial cost.

A. Rebuilding Investor Confidence with Strong Fiscal Policy Action
6.
Staff urged the authorities to rebuild investor confidence by announcing and quickly
implementing a package of measures that would credibly put public debt on a sustainable
path and reduce the likelihood of a disorderly macroeconomic adjustment (Text Tables). This
package of measures should gradually raise the primary balance to 4-5 percent of GDP by 2021. Even
in this scenario, public debt would still remain high in 2021, and primary surpluses of 4-5 percent of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BELIZE

GDP would have to be maintained beyond 2021 to reduce public debt to the more sustainable level
of about 60 percent of GDP by 2030. Stronger upfront fiscal adjustment beyond this level would
imply that the pressure would not need to be maintained for so long. Such a fiscal consolidation
could initially have some negative impact on growth, which could be offset by vigorous growthenhancing structural reforms (section C). These strong actions would help rebuild investor
confidence in the authorities’ commitment to sound macroeconomic management and reduce the
likelihood of a disorderly adjustment that would put the currency peg at risk. In the medium term,
lower government borrowing needs would support a reduction in interest rates which, combined
with greater investor confidence, would boost private investment and growth.
7.
The fiscal component of the reform package should include measures that would
durably strengthen revenue collection and contain expenditure, including through enhanced
PFM (Table 6):


Strengthening revenue collection. As discussed during the 2015 Article IV Consultation, widening
the tax base, including by streamlining exemptions and zero-ratings on the General Sales Tax
(GST), could improve the revenue collection significantly. In addition, the standard GST rate
(12.5 percent) should be increased at least to the regional average of 15 percent. Electronic tax
filing and payment should be enhanced, especially in the GST and Income Tax Departments
where less than 10 percent of registered tax payers file or pay their taxes electronically.
Improving collection of import duties, including through enhanced customs administration,
raising the social duty on imports by Commercial Free Zones (CFZs) and introducing a cap on
discretionary import duty exemptions would mitigate the revenue loss from bringing the import
duties into line with commitments to the WTO. Effective use of revenue administration
monitoring reports should help make revenue administration more accountable.



Containing expenditure. Freezing wages, replacing only two out of five workers who retire, and
training and redeploying civil servants where they are the most needed are necessary to offset
the unsustainably high growth of the wage bill in the past years. Stronger monitoring of
government-supported entities, especially their payroll, could generate savings on transfers. The
public sector pension plan should become contributory and the retirement age needs to be
gradually increased to 62 years from the currently low 55. Any increase in overall spending
beyond ceilings approved by parliament should require another parliamentary approval in a
context of a revised budget. Strong internal and external controls and more transparent and
efficient procurement practices could restrain outlays on goods and services. Timely production
of audited government financial statements and their timely approval by parliament in the
context of budget review laws will strengthen accountability in the use of public funds. More
transparent classification of spending items in budget documents such as provisions for wage
payments―that were classified as capital spending in the FY2016/17 budget―would facilitate
parliamentary debate on the direction of fiscal policy and raise awareness on its sustainability.

8.
Staff emphasized that vigorous growth-enhancing structural reforms can no longer
substitute for strong fiscal consolidation, as the “plan B” discussed during the 2015 Article IV
Consultation is no longer viable. Such a “Plan B”, which allowed for stronger structural reforms in
exchange for weaker fiscal adjustment, is now unlikely to work because: (i) the fiscal position has
deteriorated further; (ii) the sizable increase in the super bond debt service is closer (increasing by
1.7 percent of revenue in 2017 and reaching 11.2 percent of revenue by 2020); and (iii) investor
confidence further weakened (Belize’s super bond currently trades at only 50-60 cents per dollar) and
remains crucial for the success of any adjustment plan that relies on growth. Moreover, the impact of
structural reforms takes time to materialize, even when they are well implemented, and the lack of a
financing strategy for the GSDS remains a major hurdle.
9.
Staff stressed that a weaker fiscal adjustment will very likely cause a disorderly
macroeconomic adjustment in the future and endanger the currency peg. In the absence of
policy adjustment, the sustainability of both the fiscal and external positions is in doubt (Annexes I
and II). In addition to the high public debt, most of which is in foreign currency, rigid current fiscal
expenditures now absorb almost all fiscal revenue, leaving virtually no fiscal space for significant
domestically-financed public investment. Even if the impact of the loss of CBRs is contained, Belize’s
challenges in generating the FX needed for its economic development will remain daunting. Good
tourism receipts and the small level of transfers will not offset the widening external trade deficit,
which has worsened by almost 12 percentage points of GDP since 2012 as lower oil exports and loss

of market shares reduced exports by about 9 percentage points of GDP. Private inflows require
investor confidence, which in turn requires strong and durable policy action. Securing external
support from official partners would most likely require strong policy adjustment as well. Absent any
strong policy action that enhances investor confidence, boosts competitiveness and attracts foreign
inflows, maintaining the current currency peg will require strong private demand compression, which
would further undermine growth and usher in a disorderly external and fiscal adjustment.

Staff also encouraged the authorities to phase out the practice of financing
government spending with CBB borrowing and to develop securities markets with appropriate
safeguards, which will greatly support other economic sectors (sections B and C). The share of
domestic public debt held by the CBB expanded to about a half. Financing government spending
from the CBB brings excessive liquidity into the market, which, if not sterilized, can put additional
pressure on the exchange rate. More active debt management and more frequent auctions of
government paper in active securities markets could also generate sizeable savings on interest

payments. In this context, staff advised the authorities to submit the draft Public Debt Management
Bill to parliament.
Authorities’ views
11.
The authorities are fully aware of the mounting challenges and the need to take action,
but they maintained that the nature, timing and extent of the policy measures, including staff
recommendations, will be decided after consultation with stakeholders. Increasing the fuel tax
in late 2015 was the first step toward fiscal consolidation. They are considering further enhancing
collection of revenues, including by moving zero-rated items under the GST either to an exempt
status (which would prevent refund of GST paid on inputs) or to the standard GST rate of
12.5 percent. This measure could improve revenues by about 1 percent of GDP. They are also
considering raising the standard GST rate to the regional average of 15 percent, yielding about
1.1 percentage points of GDP, although they would use it as a last resort measure. If successfully
implemented, the GST-related measures would improve the primary fiscal balance to about
1 percent of GDP in the medium term (Text Table). The authorities noted that staff’s real GDP growth
assumptions are more pessimistic than theirs (para. 26). Moreover, they project that the interest rate
associated with compensation for the nationalization of BTL, which is yet to be decided by the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, will be closer to the US dollar Libor at the time of the nationalization
(1─2 percent), much lower than staff’s assumption (8 percent), which reflected interest rates in Belize
at that time. This could reduce the path of the public-debt-to-GDP ratio by several percentage
points. They also insisted that there are options to further reduce public debt by many percentage
points of GDP, including a Petrocaribe debt buyback at a discount. The draft Public Debt
Management Bill is still being reviewed by Cabinet. The authorities acknowledged that the 2013
wage agreement resulted in a sharp increase in the public wage bill and agreed that it should be
contained going forward. They noted that a wage freeze will not fundamentally change the fiscal
problem but will nonetheless be considered.

B. Improving the Resilience of the Financial System
12.
Staff supported the authorities’ determination to keep the financial system under
tight supervision as significant vulnerabilities to improving bank capital buffers remain (see
Selected Issues Paper). The completion of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) for 2015 has been
delayed because the limited human resources available are still updating the FSR database. It advised
the authorities to allocate the resources necessary for the timely completion of FSRs, including
macro-prudential indicators and measures of systemic risk that were developed with CARTAC
technical assistance (TA). Staff also welcomed the authorities’ plan to use the soon-to-be completed
consolidated supervision framework to effectively monitor group risk, group capital adequacy, group
governance and regulatory arbitrage.
13.
Staff also supported the authorities’ decision to maintain restrictions on the systemic
bank and other banks that were granted an extension on provisioning requirements, but also
noted that development of capital markets with appropriate safeguards could help strengthen

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BELIZE

banks' balance sheets more rapidly. No profit distribution should be allowed until the authorities
are fully confident that these banks are in a sound financial position. The systemic bank has until
April 2018 to meet its provisioning requirements, but the recent increase in the bank’s NPLs could
further increase its provisioning expenses. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue to ensure
that the systemic institution’s Tier I capital remains well above minimum prudential requirements,
including through recapitalization, in order to minimize the risk of contagion to the economy and the
rest of the financial system. In this context, staff noted that the abundant liquidity in the financial
system could be used more effectively to support financial stability and economic growth. More
developed capital markets should be considered, with safeguards that ensure transparency and
disclosures, including on beneficial ownership, and guarantee that any investor who acquires a
significant stake in financial institutions fully meet tests of fitness and propriety. Such capital markets
could potentially allow banks to tap into the current liquidity to raise capital and promptly bring
provisioning to the required prudential levels or else dispose of non-performing assets, including
through asset management companies (para.14). The CBB could also impose recapitalization of
banks more easily, including by diluting existing shareholders. This would also eliminate the
possibility of forbearance on prudential rules as recently illustrated by the systemic bank’s request to
restructure a large loan that was classified as NPL (para. 3). Corporations could expand their sources
of funds, thus reducing risks to the financial system. In this context, staff welcomed the authorities’
plan to finalize the National Payment System bill, and launch the Automated Clearing House later
this year.
14.
Provisioning requirements should be raised to 100 percent on loan losses (secured or
not) given uncertainties on the values of collaterals, most of which have a very limited loss
absorption capacity in the current context of illiquid real estate markets. As discussed during
the 2015 Article IV Consultation, loan losses that are neither written off nor fully provisioned should
be gradually provisioned to 100 percent during a transition period through which profit distribution
should be prohibited and management fees contained. An asset quality review of all banks during
this period would also help assess the real strength of their capital buffers. This transition period
could be shorter if capital markets were developed as discussed above. In addition to capital
markets, staff also encouraged the authorities to facilitate the creation of asset management
companies, including through legislative reform if need be, that could purchase non-performing
assets from banks and help clean up banks’ balance sheets more rapidly. Staff advised the authorities
to request IMF TA if needed.
15.
Staff noted that the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks related to
the misuse of legal persons and arrangements (e.g. companies, trusts, and foundations), the
service providers licensed by the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC), and
offshore banks could be significant. The IFSC offers, through a high number of registered agents
(around 150) and their intermediaries abroad, the services of establishing complex entities without a
proper mechanism to have the related beneficial ownership information available, accessed, and
disseminated in a timely manner. It also licenses service providers (e.g. FX, trading) without the
requirement to have a presence in Belize. While these services generate relatively low fiscal revenues,

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

their lack of transparency and the possibility for them to hold accounts in offshore banks seem to
create significant reputational risks for Belize.
16.
Therefore, staff strongly encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the
effectiveness of the AML/CFT framework and enhance entity transparency, especially in the
offshore sector. The dialogue with the US Treasury (UST), which conducted a preliminary
assessment of TA needs, should continue. Staff also continued to highlight the importance of riskbased supervision of banks and imposing corrective actions and sanctions when relevant. Staff
considered that IFSC’s registered agents and service providers should be subject to proper licensing
requirements and be monitored for compliance with the AML/CFT requirements on a risk basis. In
addition, the authorities should develop mechanisms (e.g. public registry for beneficial ownership)
that would allow timely access to adequate, accurate, and current information on beneficial
ownership of all types of entities created in Belize. Furthermore, entities’ registers should
immediately publish basic information related to entities created in Belize. Effective and dissuasive
sanctions should apply against those that do not comply with the information requirements. The
authorities should also step up their efforts in accessing and sharing beneficial ownership
information with relevant foreign authorities in a timely manner. Finally, the authorities should
identify, assess, and understand, among others, the vulnerabilities and the extent to which legal
persons and arrangements created in Belize could be misused for ML/TF.
17.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to continue to contribute to regional efforts
aimed at finding a long-term solution to the challenges posed by the withdrawal of
correspondent banking relationships by global banks (see Selected Issues Paper). Against the
backdrop of low profitability and rising costs associated with weak global macroeconomic
conditions, strengthened regulatory standards and enhanced enforcement, it may be rational for an
individual bank to cut some CBRs or to increase the price charged for this service based on a costbenefit analysis. However, simultaneous actions by many banks to withdraw from CBRs could have
negative externalities for financial stability, inclusion and growth. Overcoming the coordination and
collective action problems associated with such negative externalities justifies concerted measures by
public and private sector players. Therefore, staff welcomed the authorities’ engagement with
regional stakeholders and analyzed the feasibility and effectiveness of the potential solutions
currently being discussed in the region, including: (i) collective action to increase the business
volume brought to a smaller number of correspondent banks; (ii) introduction of a scheme to
purchase CBR insurance policies; (iii) creation of a US-licensed special purpose vehicle (SPV) to
process international transactions; and (iv) payment of higher CBR service fees. With the exception of
the SPV, all these potential solutions require strong private sector collaboration in the US, which may
require that private financial institutions shift the perceived internal cost-benefit balance in favor of
CBRs with the affected banks. However, high estimates for the risk-adjusted cost of CBR activity or
CBR insurance could imply prohibitive prices for Caribbean banks. Beside temporary use of the CBB’s
own CBRs, staff advised the authorities to start exploring, in conjunction with regional partners, the
possibility of a fast-track establishment or acquisition of a US-licensed financial institution that would
provide CBRs while ensuring effective implementation of AML/CFT standards. Staff noted that some

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

local banks confirmed that they were considering acquiring small US-licensed banks, though none
indicated to have already initiated such an acquisition process.
Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities remain of the view that their current provisioning policy is adequate.
They noted that restrictions on the systemic bank will remain until they are fully confident that the
bank is in a sound financial position. They will continue to ensure that, as a systemic institution, its
tier I capital remains well above prudential requirements. They agreed with staff on the need for
capital market development. However, they noted that private businesses in Belize are reluctant to
use the capital market because of the disclosure requirements. Another reason is reluctance by
business owners to relinquish control of their businesses through capital dilution. The authorities
noted that corporate bond markets could be successful, though they did not commit to their
development.
19.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to further strengthen the AML/CFT
framework, but insisted that implementing staff recommendations will not reverse the loss of
Belizean banks’ CBRs. In their view, global banks have not provided any reasons for the progressive
withdrawal of CBRs from Belize’s indigenous banks, including the CBB. However, the authorities are
committed to further improving their AML/CFT framework, which would further mitigate any ML/TF
risks. They will continue the dialogue with bilateral partners such as the US to better address the
challenge posed by the withdrawal of CBRs. In collaboration with Belize Bankers Association, they will
continue to sensitize all stakeholders, including foreign banks, on progress made in improving the
AML/CFT framework and Belize’s implementation of international agreements to combat tax evasion.
They have already passed a Statutory Instrument which aims to increase the licensing fees and
capital requirements for higher risk licenses for entities operating in the offshore sector (the changes
are scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2016), and they plan to improve the capacity of the IFSC to
properly supervise licensed entities and impose sanctions when necessary. They noted that acquiring
a US bank is not a practical solution as the required due diligence for such foreign acquisitions
usually takes a long time.
20.
The authorities are of the view that the progressive withdrawal of CBRs constitutes a
market failure that could be an unintended consequence of the US regulatory stance with
respect to its own banking institutions. Given the existential nature of the threat of CBRs
withdrawal not only to Belize but also to a number of very small economies in the Caribbean, the IMF
in their view, should address the situation aggressively as an integral part of its role in promoting
international trade and payments.

C. Implementing the Medium-term National Growth and Development
Strategy
21.
Growth remains a major challenge in Belize as discussed during the 2015 Article IV
Consultation. Staff analysis suggests that the weak growth is mainly driven by a decline in total

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

factor productivity (TFP), which itself stems from deficiencies in infrastructure, human capital and the
business environment. This suggests that reforms must aim at raising productivity (Table 7).
22.
The Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS), which has been recently
endorsed by the new government, would help raise productivity if it is financed and well
implemented. The GSDS will guide policies for sustainable and inclusive growth during 2016─20.
The strategy rests on several pillars, notably penetrating export markets, attracting foreign
investment, conducting effective industrial policy, enhancing market efficiency, and putting in place
adequate infrastructure and human capital. The strategy envisages a set of initiatives aimed at
alleviating key infrastructure bottlenecks with a view to strengthening export competitiveness by
reducing transportation costs. Major infrastructure projects being considered include new port
facilities and an upgrade of key transportation links. Export competitiveness would be also
strengthened by aligning with WTO requirements, through new legislation, the status of the export
processing zone and the commercial free zone, which will be completed later in 2016. The GSDS also
places special emphasis on developing priority sectors (agriculture, agro-processing, tourism and
energy) and diversifying into new products and services. The strategy envisages broadening access
to education and healthcare through investment in new schools and hospitals in rural areas and
improvements in the quality of these services. The strategy’s cost has not been estimated and
financing remains to be identified for the most part.
23.
Staff advised the authorities to prioritize GSDS projects, estimate their cost, and design
realistic project financing strategies, taking into account the limited fiscal space and the need
to maintain overall macroeconomic stability. In this connection, the modest fiscal space created
by fiscal adjustment measures discussed in section A will likely be insufficient to finance the GSDS.
More developed capital markets could expand financing sources in general. Development partners
could help improve project prioritization and costing, and design a strategy to mobilize concessional
external financing and private investment, including through well-designed public private
partnerships that safeguard public finances. Project prioritization and implementation would also be
strengthened by upgrading the regulatory framework for project appraisal, selection and
procurement. Given the deteriorating export performance and the widening of current account
deficits, addressing Belize’s weak competitiveness will have to be an important project selection
criterion.
Doing Business Indicators, 2011 and 2016 1/

24.
The authorities should also consider
growth-enhancing measures that can be
implemented at no financial cost (Table 7).
According to the 2016 World Bank Doing Business
Report, Belize ranks 120 out of 189 countries in terms
of ease of doing business. Passing the draft credit
bureau law, which has been with cabinet since 2014,
could help with developing financial markets. More
efficient financial markets in general, including the FX
market, would facilitate better resource allocation

(para. 25). Labor market reforms, especially greater flexibility on the hours of employment, could
boost job creation and productivity, particularly in the outsourcing and tourism industries, where
such flexibility is needed. There could also be room for improvement in other areas, including
starting a business, getting credit, trading across borders, improving timeliness of the resolution of
contract disputes, and strengthening small businesses.
25.
Staff has conducted an assessment of Belize’s FX regime, focusing on the compliance
of the FX regime with the member’s obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Belize maintains an FX system that is generally liberal with regard to
payments and transfers for current international transactions. While the authorization of the CBB is
required for many transactions, in practice, such authorization is routinely granted for bona fide
transactions upon presentation of requisite documentation. Most market participants have sufficient
access to FX; however, occasional delays have been reported, especially for large transactions.1 Staff
has found that Belize maintains an exchange restriction arising from the requirement of a tax
clearance certificate to obtain FX for transfer of interest payments and management fees to nonresidents. This restriction is subject to the Fund’s approval, and staff does not recommend approval
of the exchange restriction. Staff will continue monitoring the developments with the accessibility of
FX.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities noted that the structural reforms envisaged under the GSDS will
support growth over the medium term. They expect growth to pick up in the agriculture sector in
the next couple of years owing to vigorous industry efforts to cope with the diseases affecting
shrimp and citrus industries and further reforms of the sugar industry in line with its strategic
development plan. The authorities stressed the potential of the livestock industry, which is benefiting
from favorable market prices, and new crops, notably beans and corn. They plan to expand trade
agreements with neighboring countries in order to further bolster the agriculture industry’s growth
prospects and reduce informality in the sector.
27.
The authorities broadly agreed with structural reforms proposed by staff, noting that
projects would be carefully selected and judiciously implemented. The GSDS projects will be
selected and implemented mainly in cooperation with international financial institutions. They noted
that improvements in the transportation infrastructure will be guided by the transportation master
plan, which will be developed in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank. Their
financing is expected to mainly come from concessional funding from international donors and
public private partnerships, including the UK government’s recently announced program to support
regional infrastructure projects.
28.
The authorities noted that the FX system has functioned well and served the needs of
the largely import-dependent economy, and insisted that the recently reported occasional
delays arise from the FX market microstructure and the loss of CBRs. FX inflows are unevenly
1

The recently reported delays in obtaining FX appear to result from the loss of CBRs.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

distributed between domestic banks as a result of banks’ client structure and the shallow interbank
market. More importantly, general FX availability and interbank trading have been further
constrained by the loss of the CBRs of two of the major banks, which also face constraints in
accessing their FX funds. The authorities are considering stepping in and intermediating FX funds
between the domestic banks to alleviate the pressure on the banks with CBRs.

OTHER
29.
Staff updated its assessment of spillover risks from other countries (see Selected Issues
Paper). The impact of the loss of CBRs from banks in North America and Europe could have a
significant impact on credit, growth and external stability if not addressed. Belizean banks’ financial
exposure to a bank in Antigua and Barbuda, which is currently under receivership, amounted to
about US$6.8million at end-March 2016. The authorities continue to monitor the situation. They
insist that if these assets are written off, Belizean banks’ CAR will remain well above the prudential
requirement. Spillover risks from trade can be contained through greater export diversification.
30.
Finally, staff encouraged the authorities to address remaining statistical weaknesses,
including in the compilation of the international investment position and statistics for the
consolidated public sector. Timeliness of compiling final fiscal outcomes should be improved.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economy of Belize is facing multiple challenges. Growth slowed to 1 percent in 2015
due to several shocks to the primary sector, and the expansion of the current account deficit has
continued, indicating that under current policies, the external position is unsustainable with an
overvalued real effective exchange rate. The fiscal deficit reached 8 percent of GDP, pushing the
public debt stock to 82 percent of GDP. The loss of CBRs experienced by the largest banks is posing
potential significant challenges for the economy.
32.
The baseline outlook has worsened since the last Article IV Consultation and is subject
to significant downside risks. Growth is projected to be below 2 percent in the medium term. In
the absence of fiscal adjustment, rigid current fiscal spending, particularly the public sector wage bill,
would fuel high fiscal deficits and add to the already high debt burden. The current account deficit
would slowly decrease due to recovery of exports, but would still remain high, exerting downward
pressure on international reserves. This baseline outlook could be further weakened by unfavorable
developments, including lower-than-expected proceeds from the planned sale of some shares of BEL
and BTL, additional loss of CBRs or wire transfer arrangements, failure to cope with the shocks
affecting the shrimp and citrus sectors, or a protracted period of weak growth in trading partners.
33.
Strong action is needed to reduce the likelihood of a disorderly macroeconomic
adjustment. There has been very little implementation of the advice from the 2015 Article IV
Consultation. Unless a decisive adjustment package is implemented, the twin fiscal and external
current account deficits could accelerate the depletion of reserves and put the exchange rate peg at

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BELIZE

risk. In the absence of nominal exchange rate flexibility, adjustment would have to be done through
tighter domestic policies, particularly fiscal policy, and strong structural reforms to address the weak
external competitiveness. Such policies will have to lower production costs and improve efficiency
and productivity, thus bolstering competitiveness and facilitating the adjustment to global
headwinds from lower commodity prices. Without decisive action on fiscal and structural policies, the
policy gap will need to be filled by nominal exchange rate adjustment.
34.
Sustained fiscal consolidation is required to put public finances on a more sustainable
footing. Placing public debt on a downward path is the foremost priority, which requires raising the
primary fiscal balance to 4–5 percent of GDP by 2021. This adjustment can be achieved by a
combination of strong revenue and expenditure measures, including broadening the tax base, raising
the GST rate, improving tax compliance, reducing the public wage bill, initiating a parametric reform
of the pension plan for civil servants and strengthening public financial management.
35.
Tight supervision of the financial sector should continue. Uncertainties related to
collateral valuation in the context of illiquid markets justify raising provisioning requirements to
100 percent on loan losses regardless of whether they are secured or not. Restrictions on the banks
that were granted an extension on provisioning requirements should continue. An asset quality
review of all banks during this period would dispel uncertainty about the true size of the capital
buffers. Nonetheless, well-developed capital markets will allow banks to tap into the current
abundant liquidity to strengthen their balance sheets at a much faster pace.
36.
There appears to be no single factor that can explain the loss of CBRs and the
challenge should be tackled on multiple fronts. The CBR challenge requires closer regional and
global coordination to ensure that home authorities of global banks proactively clarify and
communicate their regulatory expectations, and affected countries continue to strengthen their
regulatory and supervisory frameworks to meet relevant international standards, with the help of
technical assistance where needed. In extreme circumstances, the public sector may consider the
feasibility of temporary mechanisms to prevent the complete loss of access to the global financial
system. In this context, stronger AML/CFT regulation and supervision in Belize, as well as mechanisms
to ensure entity transparency would improve compliance with international standards and
understanding of ML/TF risks. In particular, the IFSC offers, through a high number of registered
agents and their intermediaries abroad, the services of establishing complex entities without a
proper mechanism to have the related beneficial ownership information available in a timely manner.
It also licenses service providers without the requirement to have a presence in Belize. While these
services generate relatively low fiscal revenues, their lack of transparency and the possibility for them
to hold accounts in Belize’s international banks seem to create significant reputational risks for
Belize. Proper mitigation and reduction of these risks could help reverse the loss of CBRs. Support to
regional efforts to find a long-term solution to the challenges posed by the withdrawal of CBRs
should continue, including the possibility of a fast-track establishment or acquisition of a US-licensed
financial institution that would provide CBRs while ensuring effective implementation of AML/CFT
standards.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

37.
Broad-based structural reform would enhance Belize’s growth potential, reduce
vulnerabilities and strengthen the exchange rate peg. Adoption of the GSDS is a welcome step
forward, and should be followed by its vigorous implementation, using the available fiscal space and
non-debt-creating financing options, such as well-designed public-private partnerships. The strategy
should be complemented with greater labor market flexibility, further development of financial
markets, and progress in such areas as starting a business, access to credit, cross-border trade, and
timeliness of resolution of contract disputes.
38.
An assessment of Belize’s foreign exchange regime found that Belize maintains an
exchange restriction arising from the requirement of a tax clearance certificate to obtain
foreign exchange for transfer of interest payments and management fees to non-residents.
This restriction is subject to Fund’s approval, and staff does not recommend approval of the
exchange restriction.
39.

It is recommended that the next Article IV be held on the standard twelve-month cycle.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
The external stability assessment indicates that the real effective exchange rate is overvalued. The
overvaluation appears largely related to fiscal and structural policy gaps and contributes to widening
current account deficits and increasing external indebtedness. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar, to
which the domestic currency is pegged, has also contributed to nominal and real appreciation vis-à-vis
other trading partners and declining export market shares. The compensation payments to the former
BTL owners, as well as the expected increase in the debt service burden from 2017 onward and a
potential end of PetroCaribe financing are projected to reduce net external inflows. International
reserves are presently above standard thresholds but could decline to very uncomfortable levels over
the medium term without significant policy adjustment.
1.
External stability was assessed through three different approaches: external stability
(ES), external balance (EBA-lite) and export market shares (MS).
2.
The ES approach points to significant weakening of the external position. The ES
approach assumes strengthening of the NFA position from -123 percent of GDP at end-2015 to
-100 percent of GDP by 2025 in the baseline scenario and to -90 percent by 2025 in the alternative
scenario. These NFA levels, which appear to stabilize the public debt, imply maintaining current
account deficits of 2.7 percent of GDP per annum in the baseline and 1.8 percent of GDP in the
alternative scenario (Text Table).1 The results indicate a current account gap of 7.1 percent in the
baseline and 8 percent in the alternative scenario. These estimates imply average REER gaps of
16 percent in the baseline and 18.5 percent in the alternative scenario under the projected path for
the current account deficit and the estimated elasticity of – 0.39 percent.2
3.
The external balance approach broadly confirms results from the ES approach. The EBAlite results also point to a substantial weakening of the external position. This methodology helps
identify policy gaps that contribute to the external imbalances. The EBA-lite results indicate a current
account gap of 6.5 percent and a REER gap of 16.7 percent, which are mainly attributable to fiscal
policy gaps (2.5 percent of GDP). The residual (4.4 percent of GDP) could be related to structural
policies gaps. The fiscal policy adjustment recommended by staff would close the gap related to
fiscal policy while the structural reforms discussed in the main text would help reduce the structural
policy gap, bringing the current account closer to levels consistent with external stability (about
3 percent of GDP or less).

The ES approach is based on the GDP growth rates assumed in the baseline.

The average is calculated based on the minimum and maximum REER adjustment needed to bring the current
account in line with the norm over the medium term.

partners.3 Conversely, some small states with smaller REER appreciation during this period have
maintained or increased their market share.4
5.
Expected shocks to the financial account would also put pressure on reserves. The
financial account could deteriorate markedly from 2017 onward due to a further decline and
potential end of PetroCaribe financing, the increase in external debt service and the repatriation of
payments for the nationalized telecommunication company. Widening current account deficits and
increased outflows pose risks to external stability, especially given Belize’s limited access to external
borrowing.
6.
Both traditional and risk-weighted metrics suggest that reserves may decline to very
uncomfortable levels without policy adjustment. Standard non-risk weighted adequacy metrics
indicate that reserves will fall below 3 months of imports and below 20 percent cover of broad
money by 2018 (see Text Figure and Text
Gross International Reserves and Adequacy Metrics
(US$ millions)
Table below). The two risk-weighted

3

This is evident also from the 11 percent appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) in 2015.

The decline in export market shares is also attributable to the diseases affecting the shrimp and citrus industries and
other sector-specific shocks.

7.
The authorities should tighten fiscal policy and implement structural reforms in view of
rising external vulnerabilities and the strong indication of real exchange rate overvaluation. In
the absence of nominal exchange rate flexibility, adjustment will have to be done through tighter
domestic policies, particularly fiscal policy, and strong structural reforms to address the weak
external competitiveness. Such policies will have to lower production costs and improve efficiency
and productivity, thus bolstering competitiveness and facilitating the adjustment to global
headwinds from lower commodity prices. Without decisive action on fiscal and structural policies, the
policy gap will have to be filled by nominal exchange rate adjustment. Given the high external debt,
such a nominal exchange rate adjustment could significantly increase the debt burden and require
an even larger tightening of fiscal policies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Despite the cash flow relief provided by the March 2013 debt restructuring, Belize’s public debt is
projected to remain high, and its sustainability subject to risks (Figure A2.1 heat map). Lack of fiscal
adjustment in the baseline scenario increases public debt to over 100 percent of GDP, and the path is
subject to further risks including shocks to GDP growth, the exchange rate and the primary balance.
Belize is expected to rely extensively on domestic financing and reserves drawdown to meet its gross
financing requirements in the medium term as access to external financial markets is limited. As a
result, external debt is projected to gradually decline (Table A2.1). Refinancing risks are expected also
to increase with rising gross financing requirements. The public debt burden underlines the need for
ambitious fiscal consolidation, a more robust debt management, and the development of the domestic
debt market.
Macroeconomic Framework
1.
The macroeconomic outlook is worse than the assessment made during the 2015
Article IV consultation. GDP growth is projected to be below 2 percent in the medium term,
reflecting the contraction of oil production and the decline in public investment driven by financing
constraints. The current account deficit is expected to remain elevated, which, together with the
expected repatriation of remaining payments for nationalized telecom company (BTL), would reduce
international reserves to an uncomfortable level. The reduction in public capital expenditure over the
medium term would reduce the primary fiscal deficit to below one percent of GDP, which is
insufficient to stabilize the debt path. Elevated fiscal deficits, recognition of contingent liabilities and
the scheduled increase in the external debt service would lead to high gross financing requirement
over the medium term (22½ percent of GDP).
2.
Belize is expected to rely mainly on domestic financing as well as asset reductions to
meet its gross financing requirements in the medium term. The DSA has assumed no new
issuance of new external bonds given the uncertainties regarding the demand for these bonds. As a
result, the bulk of projected financing is assumed to be covered by domestic borrowing, as official
external disbursements are projected to be limited and external commercial borrowing is not
feasible. Nominal interest rates on domestic borrowing are expected to increase (assumed between
5 and 8 percent) as public debt rises, increasing the nominal debt service burden. In order to satisfy
the external financing requirements, the government will use its assets, mainly international reserves,
bringing them to an uncomfortably low level in the medium term.
3.
There appears to be no systematic bias in the macro projections (Figure A2.2). The
median forecast errors (MFE) for GDP and inflation projections were -0.07 and -0.56 percentage
points respectively (corresponding to 69th and 26th percentiles), with recent projections being close
to the outcomes. The MFE for the primary fiscal balance was -0.31 (57th percentile), although recent
projections were optimistic.

Public Debt
4.
Despite the 2013 external bond exchange, public sector debt in Belize remains high.
The debt stock increased to 82.1 percent of GDP in 2015, driven by the large fiscal deficit and
payments for settling liabilities related to the nationalized companies. The share of domestic debt
increased to 17 percent, largely on account of financing from the central bank, which now holds
about a half of central government domestic debt. The external debt has increased mainly on
account of bilateral PetroCaribe financing from Venezuela.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, Belize’s public debt will remain high due to recognition of
liabilities and a weak fiscal stance (Figures A2.3 and A2.4). Public debt is projected to increase to
94 percent of GDP in 2016, mainly driven by recognition of contingent liabilities. In the medium
term, public debt is projected to increase to more than 100 percent of GDP due to persistent fiscal
deficits and weak GDP growth. Financing conditions would gradually deteriorate, as public sector
gross financing needs would increase to 22.5 percent of GDP by 2021 mainly due to the maturing
principal of the additional liabilities from the nationalizations and high interest rates charged on
domestic financing and the amortization of the external bond beginning in 2019.
6.
The authorities informed staff that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) has
communicated its preliminary valuation of BTL, which would reduce uncertainty on the size of
contingent liabilities going forward (Table A2.2). The price per BTL share would be US$2.8,
compared with US$3.7 assumed during the 2015 Article IV Consultation. Excluding interest and
other costs, the value of BTL would be US$ 126.5 million (7.1 percent of GDP), compared with the
value of US$ 168 million (9.4 percent of GDP) assumed during the 2015 Article IV Consultation.
Interest and other costs have not yet been set by the PCA, but staff continues to assume that they
will annually amount to about 8.3 percent of the stock of liability at the end of the previous year.
Adding interest and other costs, compensation for BTL would amount to US$148 million (8.3 percent
of GDP), compared with US$211 million (11.8 percent of GDP) during the 2015 Article IV
Consultation. As per the agreement signed in 2015 between the authorities and the former owners
of BTL, half of the compensation will be paid the day after the PCA ruling, which is expected this
year. The other half will be paid twelve months after the ruling. The portion of compensation
attributed to the “Accommodation Agreement”, essentially a tax exemption that the former owners
of the BTL enjoyed, will be paid in local currency. The rest will be paid in US dollars. At end 2016,
BTL-related liabilities would amount to US$ 73.9 million (4.1 percent of GDP), compared with US$
105.6 million (5.9 percent of GDP) projected during the 2015 Article IV Consultation. They would be
paid off by end-2017. Other contingent liabilities (mostly compensation for land expropriations),
would remain sizeable (about 2.5 percent of GDP at end-2016).
7.
The risks to debt sustainability remain high (heat map on Figure A2.1). Subjecting the
baseline scenario to stress testing indicate that Belize’s debt burden exceeds the benchmark for
emerging markets. The heat map highlights significant risks to debt sustainability, including market
perceptions (high spreads), external financing requirements, the residency of debt holders, and the
currency composition of Belize’s debt. Contingent liabilities are also a source of risks for the level of
debt and the financing needs. The increasing share of short-term debt in total debt is not yet a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

major source of concern as its level is relatively low, although this could change quickly given the
tight financing conditions. The fan charts indicate the possible evolution of debt over the medium
term under both symmetric and asymmetric distributions of risk. The asymmetric fan chart shows
that public debt could exceed 140 percent of GDP in the medium term.
8.
Stress tests highlight the fact that the public debt trajectory is highly vulnerable to
various shocks (Figure A2.5). As 83 percent of total public debt was denominated in foreign
currency at end of 2015, the debt trajectory is particularly sensitive to an exchange rate shock. A
10 percent real depreciation in 2017 would boost total public debt to 107 percent of GDP in 2017. A
financial sector contingent liability shock that increases public spending by the equivalent of
10 percent of banking sector’s assets associated with recapitalization needs of a few banks would
raise total public debt to 110 percent of GDP in 2017. The debt-to-GDP ratio is also highly sensitive
to shocks in growth, interest rate, and the primary balance.
External Debt
9.
The external debt ratio1 is projected to gradually decline over the medium term to
about 50 percent of GDP by 2021 mainly because external financing needs are met by
drawing down international reserves (Figure A2.6 and Table A2.1). Bound tests suggest that
external debt is mostly sensitive to nominal exchange rate devaluation and current account shocks.
In particular, under a 30 percent depreciation of national currency, external debt would surge to
98 percent of GDP in 2017 and remain elevated at close to 77 percent of GDP in 2021. Further
vulnerability stems from a non-interest current account shock that would increase the external debt
to 62 percent of GDP over the medium-term horizon. In light of limited options for external
financing, high gross external financing needs—about 11 percent of GDP on average annually
during the period from 2016 to 2021—pose additional risk to the debt outlook.
Summary Assessment
10.
Under the baseline scenario, Belize’s public debt will remain high and vulnerable to
shocks mainly because of recognition of liabilities and a weak fiscal stance. Debt reduction is
projected to be slow, owing to weak fiscal efforts under the baseline, mediocre GDP growth, and
high interest rates. Liquidity conditions would gradually deteriorate, as public sector gross financing
needs would increase mainly due to maturing principal of the additional liabilities, including the
restructured super bond and high interest rate charged on domestic financing. Belize is expected to
rely extensively on domestic financing as well as asset reductions to meet its gross financing
requirements in the medium term as official external disbursement is projected to gradually decline
and external commercial borrowing is expected to be very limited within the projection horizon.
Refinancing risks are expected also to increase with rising gross financing requirements. External
debt would gradually decline over the medium term mainly because of non-debt creating inflows
and asset reductions (mostly reserves). Bound tests highlight that the public debt trajectory is highly

vulnerable to various shocks, especially on the exchange rate and contingent liabilities, including the
remaining compensation for BTL and potential recapitalization needs of a few banks.
11.
Strong fiscal consolidation efforts are essential to bringing public debt back to a
sustainable path. Recurrent debt restructuring episodes suggests that the country’s current debt
level is excessive and it would be prudent to adopt an objective of reducing debt to around
60 percent of GDP for the medium to long term. In addition to fiscal adjustment, supporting policies
to improve growth, deepen domestic financial market, and improve public debt management will
also be essential to improve the debt outlook.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0),
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at
their levels of the last projection year.

1/ This was estimated as a mid-point between authorities and claimants' valuations of the company.
2/ At the end of 2015, this stock includes valuation of BTL shares and capitalized interest and other payments, less the "good faith"
payment towards the compensation made in 2015. This stock will be recognized (included in the public sector debt) when the court
delivers final ruling (expected in 2016).
3/ Capitalized interest and other costs are estimated using 8.3 percent interest rate accrued on the entire value of shares during
August 2009-October 2011, and on the difference between final valuation and the authorities' initial offer during November 2011December 2016. Interest is assumed to be payable in foreign exchange.
4/ 2015 values show "good faith" payments toward the compensation. The interest and other costs up to 2016 are capitalized using
an interest rate of 8.34 percent.
5/ Interest cost on the remaining outstanding liability is computed at the rate of 8.3 percent.
6/ This valuation, provided by the authorities in April 2016, takes into account preliminary valuation given by the Permanent Court of
Arbitration to lawyers representing the authorities. It incorporates the significant component of the valuation of BTL that is
attributable to the Accommodation Agreement (a tax exemption that BTL had under its previous owners).

growth in key advanced

High/Medium
 Euro area could face an extended period
of low growth, reflecting weak domestic
demand due to high real interest rates
and inadequate structural reforms

High
 Stagnation in tourism and exports. A
weak recovery in advanced
economies, especially in Europe,
could significantly undermine
growth in Belize, restrain public
finances, and put pressures on the
BOP and reserves. Belize’s share of
exports to Europe is very high.

High
 As the currency is pegged to the U.S.
dollar, the real exchange rate would
appreciate, eroding Belize’s external
competitiveness.
 With imperfect capital controls, domestic
interest rates could increase, thus further
raising the debt service burden.

High
 Export of goods and services would
decline, and the external current
account deficit would widen.
 There would be less fiscal space for
public investment and the low
investor confidence would further
reduce private investment and
growth.

High
 Major Belizean banks have already lost
correspondent banking relationships with
global/regional banks and finding
replacement correspondents is very
difficult.

 Strengthen resilience to external demand

 Build fiscal and external buffers to offset a
potential shock.
 Broaden the sources of growth by
diversifying into economic sectors that are
less vulnerable to cyclical external shocks.
 Carry out fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms to increase fiscal space,
boost external competitiveness and curb
real exchange appreciation through
external price competitiveness measures.

 Support regional efforts to address
challenges posed by withdrawal of CBRs.
 Temporarily allow banks to use the central
bank platforms to process international
transactions, while ensuring that
appropriate AML/CFT due diligence
measures are effectively implemented for
these transactions by the banking sector
as a whole.

 The external current account deficit

Medium
 A sustained decline in oil prices would
lower the oil import bill, but the
positive impact on BOP would be
partially offset by lower PetroCaribe

 Use savings from lower oil prices to

lower international oil prices to
domestic prices to stimulate demand
and enhance competitiveness while
collecting some additional revenue to
rebuild fiscal buffers.

High
 Debt will continue to increase in an
unsustainable manner. Gross financing
needs would rise sharply over the
medium term. Securing such financing
would be a challenge due to
undeveloped domestic market and
limited external market access.

High
 While declining, non-performing loans
remain high, and while improving,
provisioning remains relatively low.
Some domestic banks, including the
largest bank, which is of systemic
proportions, still have low capital
buffers, and raising new capital to avoid
a deterioration of their capital adequacy

High
 Financial intermediation could be
damaged and seriously disrupt
economic activity.
 Absorption of the financial cost of
recapitalizing distressed banks by the
government could entail significant
fiscal costs, putting additional
pressure on public finances.

 Carry out fiscal consolidation gradually
raising the fiscal primary balance to 45 percent of GDP by cutting nonessential spending, improving PFM,
and raising more revenue by reducing
exemptions and strengthening
revenue administration.

 Order undercapitalized banks to raise
more capital, and maintain tight
supervision.

Distress in the banking

High
 Declining petroleum revenue, the
increases in compensations for civil
servants, and the rolling out of the
national health insurance scheme and
other spending pressures stemming
from the political environment have
reduced the likelihood of a significant
improvement in the primary balance.
Moreover, the authorities are of the
view that deteriorating social,
infrastructure, and security conditions
constrain Belize from tightening the
fiscal stance beyond the primary surplus
target of 1 percent of GDP.

ratios could be a challenge, increasing
the risk of public sector intervention.

Risk Assessment Matrix (concluded)
Surge in contingent
liabilities.

High
 Courts still have to rule on the size of
the compensation the government has
to pay to the former owners of the
nationalized telecommunication
company. In the worst case scenario,
payments could turn out to be closer to
the claimants’ (upper) valuation of
about 12 percent of GDP. Moreover,
nonresidents, who account for a
significant portion of the compensation
claims, would likely not roll over their
debt holdings.
 In addition to a possible intervention for
the financial sector, the government
may have to incur more external
liabilities, just to build up reserves and
support the current exchange rate peg
should BOP pressures become more
severe than envisaged.

High
 Debt could increase significantly
because of the compensation for the
nationalized companies, further
threatening debt sustainability and
aggravating refinancing risks as
nonresident debt holders pull out.
 Even though additional external
borrowing was envisaged at the time
of the 2013 debt restructuring, new
external lending to Belize will likely be
very costly. It will also further weaken
debt sustainability and undermine
investors’ confidence in the Belizean
economy and the currency peg.
 Higher-than-projected compensation
would exert significant drain on
reserves.

 Create fiscal buffers through fiscal
consolidation (see point 1).
 Support external stability by
strengthening the competitiveness of
key export sectors (sugar, banana,
citrus, marine products) and further
diversify exports.
 Strengthen the business environment
and improve physical infrastructure to
attract greater domestic and foreign
investment and support the
development of small-and-mediumsized enterprises.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: Since 1976, the Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar, the
intervention currency, at the rate of BZ$2 per U.S. dollar. Belize has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Belize maintains an exchange restriction arising from the requirement
of a tax clearance certificate to obtain FX for transfer of interest payments and management fees to
nonresidents. Because the tax clearance requirement is used to confirm that outstanding taxes
unrelated to the underlying transaction have been paid, before residents can obtain foreign
exchange to make payments to non-residents for current transactions, it gives rise to an exchange
restriction subject to Fund approval. Staff advised the authorities to remove the exchange restriction
by limiting the scope of the tax clearance to taxes directly related to the funds transferred.
Last Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on September 16, 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 16/92). Belize is on the standard 12-month
consultation cycle.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP AND
RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK2
(As of May 2016)

A. World Bank support to Belize
1.
The World Bank’s program in Belize is expected to grow and a new strategy is currently
under preparation. In April 2016, the World Bank disseminated the first Systematic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) for Belize. The SCD analyzed the constraints and opportunities faced by Belize to
return to a path of sustainable growth that would support the country in making greater strides to
reduce extreme poverty and improve the wellbeing of the most vulnerable population. A new
Country Partnership Framework is currently under preparation and will guide the World Bank Group’s
support to Belize in the medium-term.
2.
The overall size of the envelope during the CPS period was around US$45 million.
Current activities under implementation are guided by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY1215 that focused on assisting Belize to achieve inclusive and sustainable natural resource-based
growth and enhanced climate resilience. Activities include a US$15 million municipal development
loan and a US$30 million climate resilient infrastructure loan, approved by the World Bank Board on
September 16, 2010 and August 27, 2014 respectively. In addition, the current portfolio and pipeline
also include non-lending activities aimed at supporting energy resilience and enhancing agricultural
productivity.
3.
The IMF and World Bank teams agree that Belize’s main macroeconomic challenges are
to strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks and stresses, as well as to make progress on
the inclusiveness of development. In particular, enhancing the stability of the banking system is on
the top of the agenda. Other priorities include bringing debt and fiscal balances back to a
sustainable path, strengthening the policy framework, while reinforcing the implementation capacity
of national civil servants.

the Bank supports road infrastructure resilience against flood risk and impacts of climate change,
as well as Belize’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively to eligible crises.


Environment. The Bank’s Marine Conservation and Climate Adaptation project supports the
implementation of priority ecosystem-based marine conservation and climate adaptation
measures, which are meant to strengthen the climate resilience of the Belize barrier reef system.



Natural Resource Management. The Bank will continue to support Belize in adopting a
sustainable natural resources based economic model while enhancing its resilience to climate
change and natural hazards. A range of activities include: i) policies and strategies for the
mainstreaming of natural resources and climate resilience; ii) institutional capacity strengthening
for natural resource management and climate change; iii) investments to strengthen climate
resilience; (iv) promotion of viable and sustainable natural resource-based livelihoods for
participating communities; and (v) strengthening of natural resource management and
biodiversity conservation in Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) of Belize.

Country Strategy with Belize (2013–2017). The Country Strategy aims to support the
Government of Belize in improving public expenditure efficiency and effectiveness and promoting
private sector development and sustainable export-led growth, by concentrating on four priority
areas: (i) education; (ii) tourism; (iii) transport; and (iv) trade and tax policy. There have been four
approvals to date under this strategy: (i) Education Quality Improvement Program for US$10 million;
(ii) George Price Highway Rehabilitation Program for US$27 million; (iii) Sustainable Tourism Program
II for US$15 million and (iv) Solid Waste Management Program II for US$10 million. Another
operation “Community Action for Public Safety II for US$5.0 million is in the 2016 pipeline.
2.
Technical cooperation operations (grants) in execution include efforts to advance the
implementation of the Tourism Master Plan, to finance feasibility studies for several transportation
and solid waste projects, to develop a Crime Information System for Belize, to support trade and tax
policy reform and to support teacher training and improved education governance, credit unions,
cocoa farmers, competitiveness and investment promotion, and natural disaster risk management.
3.
Strategy results: The strategy is in the fourth year of implementation; most of the results are
expected in the coming year.

B. Economic and Sector Work
7.
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has continued to support the government of
Belize (GOB) in pursuing its development goals within the context of the Bank’s country
strategy for Belize for the period 2011 to 2015. New loan and grant approvals during this period
closely mirrored the indicative project pipeline identified in the country strategy. In addition, net loan
flows to Belize, which had been negative since the start of the CSP period, turned positive in 2015, as
progress was made in implementing the projects in the portfolio.
8.
The bulk of this portfolio reflects CDB’s efforts to expand, rehabilitate or reconstruct
critical transportation and water infrastructure. In terms of transportation, work has progressed
on the reconstruction of the Kendall (Sittee River) and Mullins River bridges, which were destroyed
by floods generated from the passage of tropical storm Arthur. Work has already been completed on
the Kendall Bridge, with the Mullins River Bridge set for completion in July 2016. Meanwhile,
completion of the Fourth Road project, which commenced construction in 2012, has been delayed
until early 2017. The Fifth Road loan for upgrading of the Philip S. W. Goldson (formerly Northern)
Highway was approved in May 2014 and work commenced in the first quarter of 2016. The
intervention seeks to reduce congestion and climate change vulnerability and improve road safety
on this economically important road, while also enhancing the capacity of GOB and Belizean
contractors to address gender equality and social inclusion in current and future projects.
Complementing its investments in transportation infrastructure, CDB approved a loan in 2012 to
assist GOB in enhancing road safety along a demonstration corridor on the Western Highway from
Belize City to Belmopan. With positive initial results from implementation to date, an additional loan
was approved in October 2014 to expand the scope of the project.
9.
With respect to water sector infrastructure, construction activity is complete on a
potable water supply system to serve nine villages in the Belize River Valley and final
disbursement on the project should be made in 2016. In addition, a loan was approved in 2012 to
finance detailed designs for the expansion of water and sewerage on Ambergris Caye, building on an
earlier feasibility study. The designs should be completed in the third quarter of 2016, when appraisal
of the capital project is scheduled to begin. This project is viewed as important to sustain and boost
tourism activity in the area and to protect the sensitive environment.
10.
CDB’s support for private sector development in Belize is mainly through lines of credit
managed by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which on-lends the funds to the
agriculture, industry, housing, and education sectors. The sixth such line of credit was fully
committed as at end-2013. Consequently, a seventh was approved in July 2014, which included a
small grant for a pilot project to support renewable energy/energy efficiency initiatives by private
sector entities. Additionally, a small TA grant was provided for institutional strengthening of DFC in
2014, and implementation of the consultant’s report is ongoing. CDB also supports the private sector
in Belize through its Caribbean Technological Consultancy Services (CTCS) network, under which
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) benefit from grant-funded technical assistance.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

11.
CDB has also provided significant levels of concessional lending and grant funding for
social programs aimed at poverty reduction. The Belize Social Investment Fund (BSIF) was
established by legislation in 1996, to appraise, finance, and supervise small and medium-sized subprojects in underserved poor communities. CDB has made US$15 million available to BSIF through a
second loan approved in 2010, following on from a loan of US$7 million approved in 2003. Grant
funding has been provided through the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) currently in its 8th cycle.
Belize’s allocation under the 7th cycle of US$6.1 million is still under implementation and the 8th cycle
allocation of US$1.6 million is currently being programmed. Interventions under the BSIF and the
BNTF are community-based, and are usually concentrated in the areas of water and sanitation,
education, health, and infrastructure to facilitate community access. The CDB funds also allow for the
development of a comprehensive results-based monitoring and evaluation system.
12.
With grant assistance provided by CDB in 2010, GOB formulated a comprehensive
Education Sector Strategy. Based on this work, in 2012, CDB approved a Technical Assistance loan
for Education Sector Reform, which sought to underpin the success of the strategy in enhancing
learning outcomes across all levels of the education sector through institutional strengthening.
Under this project, a comprehensive school location plan was developed, which then informed the
Belize Education Sector Reform Programme II approved in May 2015. This capital loan aims to
significantly expand the school plant in Belize and provide other supporting services in order to
increase access to quality education, in line with the objectives of the Education Sector Strategy.
13.
The Youth and Community Transformation Project was approved in 2012 based on a
previous CDB-financed feasibility study. In accordance with the priority that GOB has given to
strategies to reduce crime and improve citizen security, the aim of the project is to contribute toward
building human capital, particularly among youth and children from poor communities in Belize City,
as part of an attempt to reduce socially deviant behavior. Project implementation is scheduled for
completion by the end of 2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 31, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Real sector: The Statistical Institute of Belize (SIB) publishes on its website a variety of real sector statistics
(GDP, CPI, population and labor force/employment statistics, social indicators). The timeliness and
frequency of the statistics is generally adequate for surveillance with the exception of social indicators,
particularly those related to poverty and literacy, which are available with large lags. This is largely due to
human and financial limitations at the SIB, which constrain the process of undertaking surveys and
processing the data. There is room to further strengthen the compilation of GDP on expenditure basis,
which is currently available only at annual frequency and with a significant lag.
Fiscal accounts: Data on the consolidated operations of the public sector are unavailable. Priorities for
the period ahead include preparing a comprehensive list of institutions that comprise the central
government, general government, and the public sector including extra budgetary units. The Social
Security Board (SSB) is not treated as part of the general government. Instead, the Central Bank classifies
the entity as other non-financial public corporation, and includes its claims (deposits) on the banking
system as part of broad money. Also, difficulties persist in the compilation of capital expenditure as a
number of Capital II (government-funded capital and project expenditures) items that started life as fixedterm project contributions have become permanent funding allocations. Authorities are aware of this
shortcoming and are advising ministries to examine the continuing need and authority for such
expenditures. In addition, the current accounting practices follow neither a cash basis nor an accrual basis
of accounting, which contributes to an inconsistent accounting and reporting of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. Finally, domestic debt data recording needs to be improved.
Monetary and financial statistics: Data on financial soundness indicators of individual banks are
available on quarterly basis. However, there is very limited data on non-bank financial institutions,
especially the offshore sector, while the information on the activities of domestic insurance companies are
not publicly available. The authorities are developing a financial statistics database.
Balance of payments: The SIB publishes merchandise trade data at monthly frequency on its website
with a one month lag and monthly press releases, which discuss key trends and driving factors. The data
however does not cover services, which constrains the assessment of the overall current account position
as tourism services represent a large share of total exports. The usefulness of the data for surveillance
could be improved if the merchandise trade statistics are expanded to cover also trade in services and the
international investment position.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Charles Enoch and Jacques Bouhga-Hagbe

This note updates staff’s assessment of Belize’s medium-term outlook, taking into
account additional information that has become available since the Staff Report
(SM/16/164) was circulated to the Executive Board. It does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.

Recent Developments and Prospects
1.
On June 28, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) issued a final
ruling on the amount of compensation for Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL), which
was nationalized in 2009. The total amount of compensation amounted to an
equivalent of US$ 221 million (12.2 percent of GDP), which is about 2 percentage points
of GDP higher than staff’s projections in the staff report (Table 1). On July 13, the
government paid the equivalent of US$98 million about (about 5.5 percent of GDP) to
the former owners of BTL, in addition to “good faith” payments made toward
compensation in late 2015. The remaining balance (about 4.8 percent of GDP) must be
paid by July 2017. Nevertheless, a disagreement arose about the currency composition
of the total compensation. The authorities are of the view that only about 30 percent of
the compensation must be in US dollars, with the rest in local currency. The former
owners of BTL are asking that 50 percent of compensation payments be made in US
dollars. The dispute has been taken to the Caribbean Court of Justice. Staff’s revised
baseline assumes that only about 30 percent of the compensation is paid in US dollars
and the rest is in local currency. The full impact of the PCA ruling on international
reserves in 2016-17 would be close to US$60 million, which would reduce the reserve
cover by 0.5 months of imports. Repatriation of the compensation payable in the local
currency may increase the impact on reserves further. Compensation payments were
made by issuing domestic debt. Staff’s revised projections now assume that the sale of
minority stakes in BTL and Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) would take place in 2017 rather
than this year, thereby increasing financing needs in 2016. As a result, the debt stock is
expected to climb to nearly 100 percent of GDP in 2016, 6.5 percentage points higher
than in the staff report.

BELIZE

2.
Macroeconomic outcomes for the first half of the year are mixed. Despite the good
performance of services, especially tourism, and construction, real GDP contracted by 1.5 percent in
the first half of 2016 relative to the same period in 2015, driven by continued decline in agriculture,
fisheries, and petroleum extraction. The 12-month inflation rate edged up to 1 percent in July (y/y)
due to higher international petroleum prices, which, combined with the increase in the fuel tax,
pushed up average inflation for the first seven months of 2016 to 0.6 percent. The shocks to key
commodity exports continued to weigh on the external sector. Exports of goods decreased by nearly
29 percent during the first seven months of 2016 relative to the same period last year, dragged
down by agriculture, fisheries and petroleum sectors, while imports declined only by 3.4 percent. On
the positive side, the performance of the tourism sector has been strong, with stop-over tourist
arrivals increasing by 16.6 percent during this period. Despite the payment to the former BTL
owners, gross international reserves in late August stood US$ 432 million (4.4 months of imports),
close to their end-2015 level. Unemployment eased to 8 percent in April 2016, down 2 percentage
points from April 2015, mainly owing to employment gains in construction and services.
3.
The impact of hurricane Earl is expected to be temporary. This first-category hurricane
struck Belize on August 3. No loss of life was reported, but the hurricane inflicted significant damage
to key productive sectors, housing, and physical infrastructure. The Preliminary Assessment Report
by the National Emergency Management Organization estimates total losses at about BLZ$140
million (about 4 percent of GDP). Nearly half of the loss is in agriculture. Combined with the mixed
macroeconomic performance in the first half of 2016, the damage from hurricane Earl is expected to
reduce real GDP growth to -1.5 percent in 2016 and increase the current account deficit to
14 percent of GDP (Table 2). Given that the impact of the hurricane will likely be transitory, staff’s
medium-term projections are broadly similar to those in the staff report.
4.
Staff recommendations remain as in the staff report. The authorities should rebuild
investor confidence by announcing without delay and quickly implementing a package of measures
that would credibly put public debt on a sustainable path. The recent decision to defer the public
wage increase scheduled for FY2016/17 to the next fiscal year is a step in the right direction. It
should be promptly followed by an implementation of a credible package of measures that would
gradually raise the primary balance to 4–5 percent of GDP by 2021 (Table 3). Primary surpluses of
4–5 percent of GDP would have to be maintained beyond 2021 to reduce public debt to the more
sustainable level of about 60 percent of GDP by 2030. Vigorous growth-enhancing structural
reforms would help offset any negative impact of fiscal consolidation and enhance competitiveness.
This would help rebuild investor confidence in the authorities’ commitment to sound
macroeconomic management and reduce the likelihood of a disorderly adjustment that would put
the currency peg at risk. In the medium term, lower government borrowing needs would support a
reduction in interest rates which, combined with greater investor confidence, would boost private
investment and growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
FURTHER SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Charles Enoch

This note updates staff’s assessment of the foreign exchange regime of Belize,
taking into account additional information that has become available to staff since
the Staff Report (SM/16/164) was circulated to the Executive Board. It does not
alter the overall thrust of the staff appraisal.

Recent Developments
1.
Based on discussions with the authorities in Belize, staff concluded that
Belize maintained an exchange restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article
VIII, Section 2(a) of the Articles of Agreement. In particular, the requirement of a tax
clearance certificate to obtain FX for transfer of interest payments, rental income,
management fees and royalties to non-residents was considered to give rise to an
exchange restriction in Belize. This is because information provided to the mission
suggested that the tax clearance requirement was used to confirm that outstanding
taxes unrelated to the underlying transaction were paid before residents could obtain
foreign exchange to make payments to non-residents for current transactions.
2.
The Central Bank of Belize has subsequently provided additional
information on the operational aspects of the tax clearance certificate, which
resulted in the assessment that this requirement does not give rise to an exchange
restriction. According to the Central Bank, the Income Tax office does not withhold the
issuance of tax clearance certificates in circumstances where the applicant owes taxes
unrelated to the underlying transactions mentioned above. The tax clearance certificate
is used to ensure the determination of the respective net income and the withholding of
the income tax due on the amounts to be paid or transferred abroad. The authorities
further clarified that the tax office separately pursues remedies against tax debtors for
outstanding taxes unrelated to the above-mentioned transactions. Based on this
additional information, staff concludes that the tax clearance requirement does not give
rise to an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a).

Staff Report and the exchange arrangement section of the Informational Annex.

Statement by Michael McGrath, Alternate Executive Director for Belize
And David Hart, Advisor
September 21, 2016
Our Belizean authorities welcome staff’s analysis of the main challenges facing the
economy. The candid and frank exchanges with staff form a useful ongoing dialogue that is
highly valued by our authorities. We agree with staff on the main policy issues facing Belize,
including implementing a robust development strategy, ensuring financial stability and
access to global financial markets, and maintaining debt sustainability by appropriately
sequencing a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy. However, as we have previously
emphasized, the design and implementation of a significant upfront fiscal consolidation must
take adequate regard for the negative impact on economic growth as well as the potential to
undermine the existing social and political consensus. Taking these opening remarks into
account, we would like to draw particular attention to the following specific points.
Economic Outlook and Recent Developments
Recent data on the economic performance is mixed, but tilted to the downside, as noted
succinctly by staff in their supplement (SM/16/164). Available data point to a robust and
growing tourism sector, which is welcome news given the significance of that sector to the
overall economy. Combined with positive activity in the construction sector, the
unemployment rate has declined by about 2 percent since 2015. However, the agriculture,
fisheries and petroleum extraction sectors have performed poorly. Overall, GDP rose by 1
percent in 2015 but there was a decline of 2.4 percent in GDP per capita. During the first half
of this year, GDP contracted by 1.5 percent, and it is likely that a further decline in GDP per
capita was also experienced.
Compounding the challenging economic environment was Hurricane Earl, which hit
Belize City and the surrounding areas in early August. Thankfully, there was no loss of
life, but the housing, infrastructure and agriculture sectors suffered significant damage. The
government of Belize has allocated some $10m BzD (about 0.3 percent of GDP) for
immediate relief efforts, but the full cost of the hurricane on economic output is expected to
be much greater, albeit temporary. The government has sought independent analysis from the
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to assess the damage,
with a report expected later in September. At this early stage, the authorities’ preliminary
estimate suggests that the cost could be in the range of 3-4 percent of GDP. The authorities
are continuing to assess the economic and budgetary impacts of Hurricane Earl and are
actively considering all available options at this time.
Final Ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)

2
In June, the PCA ruling awarded total compensation of US$ 221 million (12.2 percent
of GDP) for the nationalized Belize Telemedia Company (BTL), slightly higher than
staff’s earlier estimate. In accordance with the agreement, our authorities made the first half
of the payment in July 2016, financed through the issuance of domestic debt. The remaining
balance, equivalent to about 4.8 percent of GDP, will be paid in July 2017. As noted in the
staff supplement, there remains a dispute over the currency composition of the payments,
which has been taken to the Caribbean Court of Justice for a final decision. Our authorities
believe that they have a strong case for their interpretation of the agreement, and a ruling is
expected later in 2016.
The PCA ruling, which is at the upper end of the anticipated range, represents a
significant one-off negative impact on Belize’s public debt stock and international
reserves. As a result of this decision and other shocks, public debt is now expected to reach
nearly 100 percent of GDP by the end of 2016, before declining in 2017-19 and rising again
thereafter if no further action is taken. While the Court’s findings were both unexpected and
unwelcome, they do provide a clear picture of the challenges ahead and reduce the
uncertainty over the size of contingent liabilities that were hanging over Belize’s economy.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Court’s findings and the payment of the first half of
the award in July have not resulted in any market disruption.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
Our authorities are fully aware of the need to take action in the face of a challenging
environment, and have already taken important steps to reduce public expenditures
and increase revenue, recognizing that still more needs to be done. The fuel tax was
increased in late 2015, and the government has proposed a deferment by one year of a public
sector wage increase that was due to take effect in April 2016. This latter action, which is
still under consideration by labor groups, would generate an estimated savings of some $15
million BzD for the current year (about 0.5 percent of GDP). Looking ahead, Belize’s Prime
Minister (who is also the Minister of Finance) appointed a new Minister of State to focus on
preparations for the upcoming Budget, keeping economic and fiscal performance under
review and strengthening fiscal reporting to the Cabinet and Parliament, as required by the
recently enacted Fiscal Transparency and Responsibility Regulations legislation.
In addition, the Prime Minister established an Economic Policy Coordinating Team
(the Team) to identify measures to reduce current and capital expenditures, enhance
revenue, and address debt management issues. The Team will be composed of senior
public sector managers in the critical areas of economic and social sector policy and will
include both the Financial Secretary and the Governor of the Central Bank. The consultative
process of the budget for fiscal year 2017/18 commenced this month, with plans for its
submission to Parliament in mid-March 2017. The Team will consider the policy
recommendations from the Fund and Belize’s other development partners, including a

3
possible increase to the goods and services tax (GST) and a further increase in the fuel tax.
These measures will be developed in close consultation with the business and labor
communities to ensure buy-in from key stakeholders.
The Team is seeking to ensure that public sector decision-making, particularly at the
senior political level, is informed by the best possible technical analysis, with the overall
objective of a sustained improvement in the quality of life of the Belizean people. Therefore,
while there will be substantial emphasis on economic and financial considerations, the social
impact will also be a central feature of policy recommendations.
The Belizean authorities intend to target a primary balance that places debt firmly on a
declining path. However, while the primary balance would certainly need to be above the
debt-stabilizing target of 1.2 percent of GDP estimated in the staff’s DSA, our authorities
continue to question the feasibility of staff’s recommendation to increase the primary balance
to 4-5 percent of GDP by 2021 and sustain it at this level for an extended period of time. This
recommendation appears to be out of line with the lessons from the Fund’s recent crisis
program lending experience. Indeed, one of the main findings of the recent Crisis Program
Review was the persistent challenge of internal devaluation in the context of a fixed
exchange rate regime, with the anticipated recovery in growth and exports often failing to
materialize. It is difficult to reconcile this with staff’s revised active scenario in table 2 of the
staff supplement (SM/16/164), which requires a primary balance adjustment of nearly 9
percent of GDP from 2015 to 2018 but only allows for a relatively small impact on growth.
Without downplaying the clear need to maintain debt on a sustainable path, our
authorities remain concerned about the considerable opportunity costs of staff’s
recommended approach. The need for the Government of Belize to invest in physical and
human capital, and find fiscal space to finance the various aspects of its development strategy
are essential to increasing competitiveness and diversifying the export base. These
requirements ought to be weighed against the expected gains in investor confidence, which
are inherently hard to quantify but upon which staff’s recommendations rest.
Financial Sustainability and Correspondent Banking Relationships (CBRs)
Our authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the financial sector is in better health
than last year, with improved capital adequacy ratios, declining non-performing loans
(NPLs), ample liquidity, and stronger regulatory frameworks. The overall resiliency of
the banking sector has improved since 2015, and the authorities continue to make
improvements to the financial sector infrastructure, including through modernizing the
National Payment System. Later this year, the Automated Payments and Securities
Settlement System will be launched, which is comprised of a Real Time Gross Settlement
System, Automated Clearing House, and Central Securities Depository. However, there
remains a disagreement over whether provisioning should be raised to 100 percent, as

4
suggested by staff. Our authorities continue to believe this would be inconsistent with
international best practice, resulting in an inefficient tying up of bank capital that could have
the unintended consequence of delaying the resolution of the affected NPLs.
The Belizean authorities are committed to further improving their AML/CFT
framework and ongoing implementation of international agreements to combat tax
evasion. Belize has signed on to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax
Maters and is in the process of establishing an Automatic Exchange of Information Unit in
the Income Tax Department to provide finance account information to other participating
jurisdictions based on Common Reporting Standards. It is expected that the Unit will be fully
functioning by January 2017.
The continued challenge posed by CBRs for some financial institutions operating in
Belize presents an immediate threat to the financial system and, through macrofinancial linkages, the wider Belizean economy. For a small open economy like Belize, in
which exporters rely on domestic banks to make and receive payments, CBRs are the lifeline
for the functioning of the broader economy. However, our authorities remain of the view that
the progressive withdrawal of CBRs constitutes a market failure stemming the unintended
consequences of the regulations in systemically important members of the global financial
system. In this regard, staff’s ‘fear of the fine’ analysis in the Selected Issues paper (e.g.
expected risk-adjusted cost of CBR) most closely resembles the authorities’ view of what is
causing global banks to withdraw from traditional services.
Notwithstanding these broader challenges, there has been some positive developments
on this front in recent months. Notably, three domestic banks in Belize have recently
established a new correspondent banking relationship with a bank based in the United
Kingdom. While this is a positive and welcome development, it does not diminish the
challenges facing the Belizean financial sector overall, particularly as Belize’s largest
domestic bank no longer has a CBR.
Efforts by Fund’s Management to increase the profile of this issue are welcome as many
of the affected jurisdictions are small states that do not normally have the ability to garner
sufficient international attention to this macro-critical issue. Our authorities continue to
encourage the Fund to play an assertive role in coordinating and convening major
stakeholders and to advocate for feasible solutions to this growing problem. In that context,
the upcoming Fund-hosted conference on CBRs at the Annual Meetings is welcome, and we
look forward to an emphasis on the development of practical, near-term solutions. In
addition, we welcome the recent efforts by systemically important enforcing jurisdictions to
reduce uncertainty regarding the scope of regulatory requirements in this area.
Growth and Prosperity

5
The Growth and Sustainability Development Strategy (GSDS) continues to be the
guiding medium-term framework for Belize’s development plans. Endorsed by the new
Government in April 2016, the implementation of the strategy continues to take priority. The
authorities plan to boost trade by developing the potential of new crops and the livestock
industry, as well as expanding trade agreements with neighboring countries to bolster the
prospects of the agriculture industry.
Efforts to identify financing for the various aspects of the GSDS are underway as part
of the Government of Belize’s budget cycle and discussion with multilateral and
bilateral development partners. While identifying ex ante financing for all the endeavors in
the GSDS, as recommended by staff, has a natural appeal, our authorities would underscore
that fungibility of funds for GSDS and other fiscal pressures, as well as the sequential
approach taken by most of Belize’s development partners. In this regard, clarity in financing
the GSDS will evolve naturally from decisions on the fiscal stance, pace of fiscal
consolidation, and total amount of fiscal space.
Conclusion
Our authorities welcome the ongoing engagement with the Fund and the regular policy
advice. While there are disagreements in terms of the scale and speed of the needed fiscal
correction, our authorities are in broad agreement with the overall findings of staff. As such,
our authorities will continue to engage with staff and take advice on a range of policy matters
as they work towards the Budget and the necessary adjustments that will be required to
ensure that debt is put on a downward trajectory.
Finally, we would like to inform the Board of our authorities’ intention to publish the staff
report and all related documents.
