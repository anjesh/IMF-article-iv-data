EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
In recent years, Lesotho has made good progress toward macroeconomic stability. Its fiscal
and external positions have improved markedly. However, economic activity has remained
sluggish and poverty is widespread. With an anticipated large increase in receipts from the
South African Customs Union, public expenditure is projected to rise sharply in 2006/07.
Lesotho’s medium-term outlook is clouded by several downside risks, including a further
loss of trade preferences for the export sector and a decline in SACU receipts relative to
GDP.
Key Policy Issues
Discussions focused on the key policy challenges facing Lesotho:
•

Achieving more rapid and broad-based economic growth to reduce poverty, through
acceleration of structural reforms. Lesotho also needs to strengthen its trade and
investment links with the regional market;

•

Strengthening the medium-term fiscal position to maintain macroeconomic stability,
given the uncertainty about future SACU inflows and Lesotho’s vulnerability to
exogenous shocks.

Surveillance and Technical Assistance
The authorities appreciated the Fund’s role in providing policy advice through surveillance.
They intend to continue strengthening institutions and policy implementation capacity and
noted that the international community, including the Fund, can make important
contributions through timely provision of technical assistance and capacity building support.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Lesotho is a small, landlocked, low-income country, with limited natural
resources and a narrow production and export base.1 Aside from subsistence agriculture,
the garment sector plays a critical role in generating employment, output, and exports. The
economy is highly open, with imports amounting to about 90 percent of GDP, and depends
heavily on inflows of workers’ remittances and receipts from the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU).2 Lesotho is also a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The
Lesotho loti is pegged at par to the South African rand, which is also legal tender in the
country. The country is ranked 149th out of 177 countries on the 2005 UN Human
Development Index.
2.
The political situation is relatively stable. Local government elections were held for
the first time in April 2005. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for May 2007.
3.
In recent Article IV consultations, staff has emphasized the importance of
ensuring that increases in outlays for poverty reduction are consistent with fiscal
sustainability and absorptive capacity. They also noted that a comprehensive structural
reform agenda should be implemented without delay. The authorities have increased poverty
reduction spending but implementation of structural reforms has proven more difficult.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
In recent years, Lesotho has made good progress toward macroeconomic
stability. Its fiscal balance has been in surplus since 2003/04 (April-March), owing mainly to
rapidly rising SACU receipts and improved domestic revenue collection following the launch
of the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA) in 2003. Reflecting the sizable SACU receipts and
fiscal surpluses, the external current account deficit has narrowed and gross international
reserves increased to the equivalent of about five months of imports of goods and nonfactor
services by the end of 2005/06. In line with price trends in South Africa, the inflation rate fell
in 2003-05 despite rising oil import prices. The spread on treasury bills relative to South
Africa has fallen to almost zero due to the strengthened fiscal position. The government used
part of the SACU windfalls to retire nonconcessional debt, reducing the net present value of
public external debt to levels significantly below the relevant indicative debt sustainability
threshold.3
1

Less than 10 percent of the land area is suitable for crop cultivation and water is abundant only in nonpopulated areas. Other natural resources include clay and sandstone.
2

The SACU revenue sharing agreement gives the small member countries (Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and
Botswana) a majority share in the customs revenue pool, to which South Africa is the predominant contributor.

5.
However, economic activity has remained sluggish, reflecting the adverse impact
of exogenous shocks. Agricultural production was hit in 2002-05 by droughts and in early
2006 by excessive rainfalls that also damaged roads and bridges in the rural areas where
about 70 percent of the population lives.4 In the last few years, the World Food Program
provided food aid to about 15 percent of the population. The manufacturing sector was
adversely affected by a substantial real effective appreciation of the loti in 2002-2004 and the
removal of textile quotas by industrial countries in early 2005, which led to the loss of about
a quarter of jobs in the garment sector.5 The garment sector saw a moderate recovery recently
with the entry of new investors following a halt of the loti appreciation and the signing of a
bilateral agreement that restrains exports from China to the U.S. market. The number of
Lesotho miners in South Africa continued to decline in 2005 as mining became more capital
intensive.
6.
Fiscal management is becoming more challenging. In the context of the 2006/07
budget, the authorities have reduced the company income tax rate to attract foreign
investment.6 With SACU receipts projected to reach record levels, spending pressures are
intense. The government has resisted pressure from various groups for subsidies and
spending that are inconsistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). Nevertheless, total
spending is budgeted to increase sharply. A supplementary budget raises expenditure further
and largely eliminates the initially targeted budget surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP. While the
budget includes prepayment of nonconcessional external debt7 and a significant increase in
capital expenditure (4.8 percent of GDP), the wage bill and other noninterest current outlays
are also projected to increase relative to GDP (by 0.6 and 3.8 percent of GDP respectively).
7.
The authorities are making efforts to implement their Poverty Reduction
Strategy. Budgetary allocations for the AIDS Commission, free elementary education, and
other social programs have been significantly increased for 2006/07. However, the execution
rate for donor-funded investment projects was low in the past year. A national census was
conducted in April 2006, which is expected to assist in the preparation of the first annual
PRS progress report. The authorities plan to hold a donor conference in late 2006 to seek
further assistance.

4

Foreign investment has revived a diamond mine, which contributed to GDP and exports in the last two years
but has had limited impact on employment.
5

Garment exports, which are mostly to the U.S., have benefited since 2000 from preferences under the U.S.
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
6

The tax rate has been cut across the board from 35 percent to 25 percent, below the rate prevailing in South
Africa and Swaziland, and from 15 percent to 10 percent for manufacturing with a zero rate for companies
exporting to non-SACU markets.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Economic Outlook and Key Challenges
8.
Lesotho’s medium-term economic prospects are clouded by several downside
risks:
•

SACU receipts, while remaining buoyant in 2007/08, are expected to decrease in
subsequent years (Box 1).

•

Trade preferences for garment exports are expected to be further reduced when the
AGOA third-country provision and the bilateral agreement restricting China’s exports
to the U.S. expire in 2007/08.8

•

The export sector would be adversely affected in the event of a sustained appreciation
of the rand, to which the loti is pegged.

•

Workers’ remittances are likely to decline with a further tightening of the
employment conditions for unskilled workers in South African mines.

•

Finally, the high HIV prevalence rate could cause further losses in productivity and
real income.

9.
The authorities agreed that the key policy challenges facing Lesotho are to
achieve more rapid and broad-based economic growth and strengthen the mediumterm fiscal position. They acknowledged that under the exchange rate parity arrangement,
the burden of safeguarding macroeconomic stability would fall on fiscal policy and structural
reforms. The authorities raised questions, however, about Lesotho’s long-term sources of
growth, given the precarious outlook for its garment sector. In the staff’s view, a strategy for
long-term growth will have to be based on Lesotho’s endowments (mainly labor) and driven
by private initiatives. The core elements of such a strategy should include increasing the
efficiency of using public resources, given the large size of the budget relative to GDP, and
attracting private investment through enhancing labor skills, infrastructure, and institutions.
Efforts to diversify products and markets would help reduce vulnerability to external shocks.

8

The third-country provision allows Lesotho garment exporters to import fabric from the cheapest available
suppliers while enjoying duty-free access to the U.S. market.

12

Box 1. Are Recent Increases in SACU Receipts Permanent?
The recent increase in SACU receipts appears to be transitory on account of: (i) a deceleration of
South African imports (South Africa has been the predominant contributor to both the customs and

raises further question marks about the future of the SACU revenue sharing arrangements.*

To illustrate potential adverse developments and policy choices, the staff
discussed with the authorities three medium-term scenarios:

term.

•

The adverse scenario illustrates the country’s vulnerabilities. It combines a
significant appreciation of the rand, a sharper drop in SACU receipts and workers’
remittances from South Africa, and inclement weather. Prolonged economic
stagnation would seriously hold back progress toward the MDGs.

•

The reform scenario assumes strengthened fiscal management that will help keep
recurrent expenditure at sustainable levels and speed up donor disbursements for
growth-enhancing projects. Strong implementation of structural reforms (Box 2)
would accelerate growth through higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI)
and more private initiatives to broaden the production and export bases.
B. Strengthening the Medium-Term Fiscal Position

11.
The authorities agreed that a prudent fiscal strategy is needed in view of the high
uncertainty regarding future SACU receipts and Lesotho’s vulnerability to external
shocks. Noting the country’s large expenditure needs, the authorities emphasized that they
would work closely with other SACU members to enhance the predictability of SACU
receipts and strive to improve the composition of expenditures in order to make progress
toward the MDGs. Staff supported the use of exceptional SACU receipts to reduce debt and
increase poverty reducing spending, but argued strongly against ramping up recurrent
expenditure because, given the limited scope to increase domestic revenue, this would
undermine fiscal sustainability. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to contain the fiscal
deficit over the medium term to levels that can be financed by external grants and highly
concessional loans.

14
12.
For 2006/07, staff stressed the need to contain the wage bill and other recurrent
expenditures. It encouraged the authorities to meet justifiable additional spending within the
existing budget envelope, not to spend the savings if the amount negotiated to settle LHDA
debt is lower than the budget appropriation, and strengthen tax administration to offset over
time the revenue impact of the company tax cut.9 While receptive to these recommendations,
the authorities explained that the 2006/07 budget includes large one-off items (e.g., for the
elections) and that the supplementary 60

expensive domestic bonds and proposed
additional measures to reduce current
expenditure.10 In this context, staff noted
that wages for both central and local
governments plus pensions and other
entitlement programs (18 percent of
GDP in the 2006/07 budget) are relatively high by international standards.11

Key measures include keeping the wage bill constant in real terms, a reduction of subsidies to parastatals, and
partial cost recovery of the scholarship scheme. The authorities’ earlier projections for 2007/08, which did not
take into account adjustment of SACU receipts based on actual collections in 2005/06, show a small budget
surplus. They planned to update the projections in late 2006 based on discussions with the staff.

medical aid scheme for civil servants could further increase personnel-related expenditure.12
While supporting the pension reform in principle, staff advised against its introduction and of
the medical aid scheme without a thorough analysis of their costs. Staff underscored the need
to put personnel-related budgetary expenditure on a sustainable path through a civil service
reform. The authorities broadly agreed with the approach, but noted that they were under
pressure because medical assistance schemes had been introduced in neighboring countries.
14.
The authorities are taking steps to improve public financial management. These
include applying the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) more widely, introducing the
Integrated Financial Management Information System, and improving public service delivery
at the local level. Regarding the latter, staff expressed concern that while resource transfers
were budgeted for 2006/07, and about 45 percent of civil servants are to be transferred to
newly elected local governments, the functions and expenditure responsibilities of the local
governments are yet to be clearly specified. Furthermore, the legal and operational
frameworks for taxation and borrowing by local governments have not been clarified. The
authorities made clear that they do not intend to decentralize borrowing authority and will
intensify efforts to ensure that expenditure devolution is commensurate with revenue
transfers.
15.
The authorities and staff agreed that increasing the execution rate of capital
expenditure, particularly concerning donor-funded projects, would contribute to higher
growth, and help absorb more aid. To this end, the newly established Cabinet Budget
Committee would, in addition to other mandates, monitor aid disbursements and project
implementation. To reduce red tape, the authorities are reforming the procurement system,
improving project cycle management, and streamlining project reviews as agreed with
donors. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to restructure and realign
expenditure priorities in line with the PRS and work with donors to increase investment in
areas that are important for growth, particularly infrastructure and agriculture.
16.
To maintain debt sustainability, the authorities intend to rely on grants and highly
concessional loans to finance development projects, including the Metolong Dam.13 Staff
advised the authorities to carefully analyze projects funded by public-private partnerships to
avoid incurring future liabilities that would be inconsistent with the repayment capacity of
the budget.
12

The pension reform aims to replace the current unfunded defined benefits scheme for civil servants with a
funded defined benefit or defined contribution scheme. The unfunded civil servant pension liabilities were
estimated at 29 percent of GDP, based on an actuarial evaluation in 2005. As reform plans are still being
developed, no reliable cost estimates are available.

13

The project is expected to provide water for the Lowlands. The authorities are seeking grant financing from
the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation and have reached preliminary agreements with some bilateral and
multilateral creditors on concessional loans.

16
C. Facilitating Adjustment to Shocks Under the CMA
17.
The authorities continued to be of the view that Lesotho has benefited from the
exchange rate peg under the CMA. They noted that such an arrangement has helped
maintain price stability and lowered the costs of cross-border trade and investment. However,
with a flexible exchange rate of the rand, maintaining competitiveness in the face of
asymmetric shocks is a serious challenge for Lesotho as its exports are largely to markets
outside the CMA. They shared the staff’s view that strengthening fiscal policy, accelerating
structural reforms, and increasing labor market flexibility would help maintain external
competitiveness.
18.
The CBL has conducted a study on reserve adequacy. Currently, the CBL’s
international reserves are more than adequate to back the total amount of loti it issued, or to
cover three months of imports or 100 percent of short-term debt. Noting the pressures to
spend, staff pointed out that the reserves have served the role of a stabilization fund in recent
years as SACU windfalls were deposited into government accounts at the CBL. Because
SACU inflows are highly volatile and uncertain, staff encouraged the CBL to maintain and
prudently manage its reserves.
19.
Lesotho’s trade policies are largely shaped by its membership in SACU. In that
context, Lesotho is actively pursuing free trade arrangements and trade partnerships,
including with the European Union, the United States, and within SADC. While the
negotiations for a SACU-U.S. free trade agreement are ongoing, Lesotho and its SACU
partners are striving to conclude an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European
Union by the end of 2007.
D. Promoting Private Sector-Led Growth
20.
The authorities recognized the need to reduce the cost of investing and doing
business in Lesotho. The government has set up the Trade and Investment Facilitation
Center, a one-stop shop as part of its reforms to reduce the regulatory impediments and red
tape. This center, which has been handling customs clearance since April 2006, is expected
to also cover company registration and licensing. In addition, the LRA has made some
progress in shortening the time for processing corporate and value-added tax returns. Staff
urged the authorities to further improve the investment climate by implementing without
delay other regulatory reforms as agreed with the World Bank and bilateral donors (Box 2).
21.
Staff encouraged the authorities to accelerate financial sector reforms to
improve access of the private sector to bank credit. Lesotho’s banking sector, dominated
by three South African banks, is well capitalized but much less developed in terms of
infrastructure, credit culture, and legal framework, as evidenced from the low lending-todeposit ratio. The CBL has embarked on a reform program to remove legal and informational

17
impediments. It is also taking steps to modernize the payments system. In addition, the AntiMoney Laundering bill is expected to be enacted in September 2006.14 To safeguard the
stability of the financial system, the authorities are also working to strengthen the regulatory
framework for the nonbank financial sector.
22.
The authorities intend to buttress workers’ training, upgrade infrastructure, and
strengthen product and market diversification to reduce Lesotho’s vulnerability to shocks and
to achieve higher long-term growth. They would build on progress already made in skills
development.15 To improve competitiveness and attract labor-intensive industries, staff
encouraged the parties to wage negotiations to take into account developments in labor
productivity and terms of trade so as to increase downward flexibility in real wages. It also
supported the authorities’ efforts to diversify the country’s production and export base by
providing an enabling environment that would be conducive to the development of key
sectors, including horticulture, mining, and tourism.
23.
The authorities pointed out that there are issues that are important for longterm growth, which will have to be tackled jointly with regional partners. As a landlocked country with a long history of cross-border trade and labor movements, Lesotho
depends on neighboring countries for access to world markets. Keeping qualified civil
servants, health workers, and university graduates, many of whom leave for higher pay in
neighboring countries, is increasingly a challenge. Priorities include development of
infrastructure and agriculture, retaining skilled labor, and the fight against HIV/AIDS. The
revenue impact of a SADC customs union would also need to be addressed.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Lesotho has made commendable progress in strengthening its fiscal and external
positions but economic growth has remained low. The authorities’ policy response to the
large SACU receipts in the last two fiscal years—saving some and using the rest to reduce
nonconcessional debt—has been broadly appropriate and has contributed to a narrowing
external current account deficit and higher international reserves. However, as a result of
several shocks that adversely affected output and exports and the high HIV prevalence, a
sizable number of people still need food aid and poverty remains widespread.

14
15

Lesotho’s Anti-Money Laundering regime was evaluated by ESAAMLG in 2004.

The training programs supported by donors and the LNDC have raised labor productivity of textile workers
by an average of 25 percent for the 34 participating companies.

18

Box 2. Key Structural Measures
Key elements of the reform program developed jointly with the World Bank and bilateral donors
include:
Removing Regulatory Impediments
•

Restructure and consolidate company registration processes to reduce the time it takes to
register a company to under one week;

•

Convert mandatory trade licensing to a reporting requirement, eliminate the Licensing Boards
and the Pioneer Industries Board to significantly reduce the time and costs of obtaining both
trade and industrial licenses;

•

Simplify and streamline immigration, customs and work permit procedures;

•

Reduce the compliance costs to tax payers; and

•

Make the commercial court functioning.

Improving the Private Sector’s Access to Bank Credit
•

Put in place a comprehensive and easily accessible property registry;

•

Introduce a national identification system;

•

Establish a credit information registry;

•

Amend the Matrimonial Act to allow married women access to bank credit without their
husbands’ permission;

•

Simplify and streamline land transfer procedures; and

•

Develop leasing facilities.

Assisting Adjustment of Private Investors
•

Develop a strategy for a competitive textile sector—emphasizing product and market
diversification—in the context of the “Multi-Fiber Agreement Forum”;

•

Attract new FDI through public-private cooperation in the inter-ministerial task force;

•

Improve labor productivity through industry-led, demand-driven skills development
programs;

•

Invest in utilities, roads, and solid waste and waste water facilities; and

•

Launch outreach marketing programs to secure and improve market access.

19
25.
Key policy challenges facing the authorities are to raise economic growth and to
strengthen the medium-term fiscal position. Lesotho is facing several permanent shocks.
Although there is considerable uncertainty about the timing and extent of the decline in
SACU receipts, the downside risks are high. An adverse scenario, combining a fall in SACU
revenue, shocks to the export sector, falling workers’ remittances, and inclement weather,
while not a high probability at present, is not inconceivable and serves to highlight the need
to strengthen economic policies and reform.
26.
A conservative fiscal strategy is needed. Under the exchange rate parity
arrangement, the burden of safeguarding macroeconomic stability falls on fiscal policy and
structural reforms. Large spending increases based on temporary revenue windfalls pose
serious risks to fiscal sustainability. Staff call on the authorities to resist pressures to further
increase total expenditure and strictly contain the wage bill and other recurrent outlays for the
rest of this fiscal year. Locking in a prudent fiscal framework for 2007/08 before the
elections is going to be challenging and will require measures to reduce recurrent
expenditure. The pension reform and a medical aid scheme should not be introduced unless
they are part of a broader civil service reform that would set total budgetary personnel costs
(wages plus pension and medical aid contributions) on a sustainable path. The recent cut in
company income tax would help attract private investment but the revenue impact needs to
be offset through sustained improvement in tax administration.
27.
Staff strongly support the authorities’ efforts to improve public financial
management and increase the execution rate of capital expenditure. As public
expenditure amounts to over half of GDP, improving the efficiency of the use of these
resources can make a key contribution to raising growth. Staff support the objective of
improving public service delivery at the local level and encourage the authorities to take
prompt actions to ensure that the implementation is broadly budget-neutral. Significant
progress should be made to accelerate the execution rate of capital expenditure, especially
concerning donor-funded projects, as it would help strengthen the growth orientation of the
budget and increase aid absorption.
28.
To raise economic growth and broaden its base, structural reforms need to be
accelerated to make Lesotho one of the most competitive places in the region for private
investment. The exchange rate peg under the CMA has provided important benefits to
Lesotho, but in light of the real effective appreciation of the loti in recent years, Lesotho
needs to redouble its efforts to improve the investment climate, reduce structural
impediments to private sector development, and increase competitiveness by enhancing labor
productivity, infrastructure, and institutions. In this regard, Lesotho also needs to work with
its regional partners on cross-country issues that are important for growth. Staff support the
CBL’s efforts to improve the private sector access to bank credit and to strengthen the
regulatory framework for the nonbank financial sector.

20
29.
To make progress toward the MDGs, Lesotho will continue to need international
support, both financial resources and technical assistance. The recent national census
should provide valuable information for economic and poverty analysis and help prepare the
first annual PRS progress report. Significant progress in improving fiscal management and
aid absorption capacity is needed to mobilize more support for implementing the PRS.
30.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Article IV Consultation:

The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation (EBM/05/81; 09/19/05) on
September 19, 2005. Executive Directors welcomed the marked improvement in the
economic performance of Lesotho, with the overall fiscal deficit turning from deficit into
surplus, a stronger external current account position, a further decline in inflation, and an
increase in net international reserves. Directors noted however, that persistent drought
conditions, weakened external competitiveness, a continued worsening of the terms of trade,
and job losses from the phasing out of textile quotas by industrial countries had caused real
GDP growth to slow in 2004/5. Directors considered that finding the basis for consistent high
growth over the medium term, to help address widespread poverty, achieve the Millennium
Development Goals, and confront the high incidence of HIV/AIDS, will be the primary
challenge for the authorities in the period ahead.
Directors observed that the further loss of trade preferences, declining revenues from the
South African Customs Union (SACU), and contraction of inward remittances from migrant
workers were likely to be durable economic shocks. They considered that faster economic
growth in the future is therefore likely to depend on raising efficiency and broadening the
production and export base. In that light, Directors urged the authorities to implement
ambitious structural reforms aimed at restoring competitiveness and fostering private sector
development.

APPENDIX II. LESOTHO: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A.

Partnership in Lesotho’s Development Strategy

1.
Lesotho’s strategy for poverty reduction is laid out in the government’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS), which was finalized in 2005 following an extensive nationwide
participatory consultation process. The PRS builds on a number of government documents
and initiatives, including the I-PRSP, National Vision 2020, National Goals, and the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The PRS has three interconnected goals: (i) create
jobs through the establishment of an environment that facilitates private sector-led economic
growth; (ii) empower the poor and the vulnerable and improve their access to health care and
education; and (iii) deepen democracy and improve public sector performance to ensure that
policies and legal frameworks facilitate the full implementation of priorities.
2.
Implementation of the PRS faces several limitations and risks related to its translation
into actual work plans, possible further shocks to the economy, weak governance, and a lack
of political will. The development of a comprehensive medium-term macroeconomic
framework, taking into account Lesotho’s external vulnerability and competitiveness, and
improving the monitoring and evaluation framework would facilitate PRS implementation.
B.

Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas

3.
The World Bank and the IMF continue to cooperate closely in assisting the
Government of Lesotho to implement its poverty reduction and development strategy, with
each institution taking the lead in the policy dialogue in its areas of expertise. The IMF leads
on macroeconomic policy (fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies) and on the following
areas of structural reforms: fiscal management and tax administration reform. The Bank will
continue to lead the policy dialogue on sectoral reforms, including public expenditure
management, employment generation through private sector development, infrastructure
development, education, health, combating HIV/AIDS, and poverty monitoring and
evaluation. Areas of close collaboration include the PRS, public sector reform, financial
sector reform and trade. The Bank and Fund staffs routinely exchange views on these and
other issues.
The Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy
4.
The Bank Group’s assistance strategy (CAS) for Lesotho for FY 06-09 was approved
in April 2006 and is guided by the government’s PRS and the MDGs. The CAS proposes
four key strategic objectives which will frame the Bank Group’s assistance over the coming
years: (i) fighting HIV/AIDS; (ii) employment and income generation through higher
economic growth; (iii) improving human development outcomes; and (iv) decentralization,
public service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation. To achieve enhanced impact, the
CAS proposes a results framework that sets out desired outcomes and defines key
intermediate indicators. In terms of instruments, the Bank will continue to invest in high
quality analytic work to underpin a strategic IDA lending program. The proposed program
draws on the lessons of the last CAS and is designed to mitigate risks that could hinder the
effectiveness of Bank support.

33
Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation
5.
The Bank recently concluded a review of monitoring and evaluation in Lesotho. The
review includes an assessment on the national M&E system linked to the PRS. It identifies
three major issues that will have to be addressed to establish a well-functioning national
M&E system: (a) donors must agree among themselves and with the government on a
harmonized, unified support effort for a national M&E system; (b) the government must
create a coordinated and transparent system that includes key data users and data generators;
and (c) the government and donors must make a long-term commitment to enhance statistical
capacity. The Bank is supporting the establishment of a national M&E system under a trust
fund for the support of the PRS.
6.
A Poverty, Gender and Social Assessment is being initiated with the objective of
providing an analysis of the key opportunities, constraints, and risks to sustainable poverty
reduction from the perspective of households, communities, the government and institutions
by analyzing the past and present and drawing lessons for the future. The assessment will
provide policy and program recommendations on how to achieve more inclusive and
accountable institutions and sustainable poverty reduction. During a recent mission the
assessment was introduced and preliminary discussions were held with major donors and the
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. The poverty assessment was welcomed by
all parties as current poverty analytics are weak and outdated. The findings from the report
will feed into the annual PRS progress report.
Public Sector Reform and Public Expenditure Management
7.
The government of Lesotho recognizes that strengthening public expenditure
management is critical to improving service delivery and make progress towards attaining its
development goals. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of public services, the
government has launched an ambitious public sector improvement reform program (PSIRP)
to be implemented over the next 3–5 years. The program is being supported by Lesotho’s key
development partners and its successful implementation is expected to provide a sound basis
for future budget support to Lesotho’s PRS.
8.
The Bank is finalizing work on the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR), in close collaboration with the Government, to inform
and guide the reforms needed to improve the efficiency and quality of public expenditures.
The PEMFAR aims to strengthen the analytical base for making decisions about the size and
composition of public expenditure to have maximum impact on growth and poverty
reduction. The PEMFAR also includes an assessment using the approach developed under
the multi-donor Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) program. The
PEFA assessment confirms that progress has been made in the planning and formulation
aspects of budgeting, but also confirms persistent problems relating to long-standing
weakness in internal control, accounting delays, audit backlogs and poor fiscal reporting.

34
Private Sector Development (PSD)
9.
To support the government’s efforts on the PSD front, the World Bank has prepared a
Private Sector Competitiveness project. The key objective of the project is to increase private
sector participation in the economy by increasing its productivity and competitiveness. The
project will consist of three components aimed at: (i) improving the business environment
through reducing cost of doing business and strengthening legal framework; (ii) supporting
economic diversification through development of skills, institutions and market linkages; and
(iii) improving MSMEs’ access to finance. The task team expects to present it to the Bank’s
Board in November 2006.
Integrated Framework (IF)
10.
Recognizing the importance of the expansion of trade with other countries–especially
in the region–for achieving economic growth, the government seeks to better integrate trade
issues in the poverty reduction program. The framework for this integration is provided in the
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) for Lesotho. The goal is to lower the cost of
trading with South Africa and other Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners and
the rest of the world by removing barriers to trade and to the movement of capital and labor.
Priority actions for the achievement of this goal, mostly structural policies, are set out in the
DTIS matrix. The DTIS has been carried out in close consultation with the Government and
core agencies and donors and has benefited from several ongoing projects, including the
Bank’s growth and employment options study, UNCTAD’s Investment Policy Review, and
the Government’s PRSP and National Vision documents. Background papers for the IF study
were prepared by the IMF, ITC, UNCTAD and WTO. Several donors, including the Bank,
are supporting pilot projects in the agro-industry sector.
Infrastructure
11.
Bank support to the infrastructure sector is directed to institutional strengthening as
well as physical works. The Bank contributed to the financing of the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project. In addition to its ongoing portfolio in the water and utilities sectors, the Bank
has prepared an Integrated Transport Project (ITP) in collaboration with other development
partners. In that context, the Bank will take a leadership role in supporting ongoing road
sector reforms, capacity building and commitments for developing the road network and
addressing isolation problems. In addition, the ITP will support the formulation of policies
and strategies for air, rail, and intermediate means of transport (IMT) and water transport
subsectors with a view towards more integrated and coordinated transport sector
management.
HIV/AIDS
12.
In response to the high adult HIV prevalence rate in Lesotho, the Government
adopted the multi-sectoral National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and the National AIDS Policy
Framework in 2000. To support the Government’s efforts in fighting HIV/AIDS and in
effectively using the resources made available by other donors, including the Global Fund,
the Bank is providing a technical assistance grant to increase the capacity of government and

35
nongovernmental institutions responsible for the national response to HIV/AIDS. Political
commitment in the fight against HIV/AIDS has increased and legislation to create a National
AIDS Commission has been enacted. Several other development partners and agencies are
active in supporting the HIV/AIDS program, including Development Corporation Ireland, the
Clinton Foundation, and Bristol Myers Squibb.
Human Development
13.
The Bank is supporting a Health Sector Reform Program with the objective of
achieving a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative
health care services. The Bank’s support to the health sector is structured in three Phases of
an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). Currently in Phase II, the focus is on improving access
to quality health services through strengthening decentralized service delivery and improving
human resources management in the sector. The education sector is supported through an
APL which began in 1999 and extends to 2011. Its broad objective is to assist the
Government of Lesotho in its efforts to increase access to quality education and the
efficiency of the education system. In that context, it aims to: (a) increase enrollment in and
completion of primary education; (b) improve learning achievement in primary education;
(c) increase enrollment in secondary education; (d) build capacity in the education sector,
including for early childhood care and development, technical and vocational education and
training, higher education, Non-Formal Education, and Ministry of Education and Training
core functions.
C.

Bank Group Assistance Summary

14.
The World Bank’s first operation in Lesotho was approved in February, 1966. As of
May 31, 2006, IDA had approved 33 credits amounting to US$ 362.9 million, of which
US$ 222.1 was disbursed; US$77.1 million was canceled; and US$ 63.7 million remains
undisbursed. To date, the World Bank has financed six projects in education; five in roads
and road rehabilitation and maintenance; four in agriculture; three in industry; three in water
supply (including support to the Lesotho Highlands Water Project); three in urban
development; five in health, two in privatization; and one in community development.
15.
The World Bank has six ongoing IDA projects, as well as a Global Environment
Facility (GEF) project and the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Active projects include the
Health Sector Reform Project, the HIV/AIDS Capacity Building and Technical Assistance
Project; Phase 2 of the Education Sector Development Project the Utilities Sector Reform
Project; the Lesotho Highlands Water Project – Phase 1B and the Water Sector Improvement
Project. Planned credits during FY07 are the Integrated Transport Project and the Private
Sector Competitiveness Project, expected to be US$ 23.5 million and US$ 8.0 million,
respectively. In addition, the World Bank will be working with other donors over the next
several years to assess the possibility of and to prepare Government systems for budget
support for Lesotho’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.
16.
Currently, the IFC has no outstanding investments in Lesotho. However, IFC is
advising the Government of Lesotho on the structure and implementation of a public-private

36
partnership for the replacement of the Queen Elizabeth II hospital. The project has been
undertaken in cooperation with the World Bank’s ongoing health sector reform project.

37
APPENDIX III. LESOTHO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Lesotho’s statistical database is adequate for surveillance, although there are some
deficiencies in the quality of core surveillance data.
As one of fifteen countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Lesotho has undertaken to use the
GDDS as a framework for the development of national statistical systems. The Anglophone
Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)) aims
to assist participating countries to implement plans for improvement identified in the
metadata, to meet GDDS recommended statistical practices. GDDS metadata for Lesotho
have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since August
25, 2003. Since the original posting the metadata have not been updated by the authorities,
except for the metadata on the fiscal sector, which were updated in November 2004.
National accounts
GDP may be underestimated. Incomplete information about external flows and value added
in the Lesotho Highland Water Project (LHWP) has affected estimates of GDP since 1998. In
theory, the value added of the water sector should include the full value of water exported,
but current estimates only include royalties received by LHWP. There are also concerns that
data on manufacturing activity from the Bureau of Statistics of Lesotho (BSL) are
underestimated, when compared to customs data on manufactured exports.
BSL is responsible for the national accounts and compiles annual current price estimates
of GDP economic activity, expenditure, and income. Annual estimates of GDP at
constant (1995) prices are compiled by economic activity and expenditure. Annual estimates
are published on their web site for 1993 to 2004. Fund missions prepare estimates of current
year national accounts and sometimes adjust historical data. Other macroeconomic
indicators, such as industrial production indices, are used to monitor developments during the
year.
Since late 2003, a peripatetic expert has been assigned under the DFID project for
Anglophone Africa to advice on strengthening the national accounts. The principal reason
for limited progress has been the lack of resources and issues with the quality of source data.
In particular, the December 2003 mission noted that, except in the case of agriculture
statistics, there was no regular annual survey program for economic statistics. Particular note
was made of the need for, and resources to be devoted to, an up-to-date business register. The
absence of easily tapped administrative data compounded the problem arising from the lack
of survey data. A Household Budget Survey was conducted in 2002/3 though the results are
not available/used for compiling economic statistics. A November 2004 mission reiterated
the lack of timely and relevant source data to be the major obstacle in implementing the
System of National Accounts 1993. A September 2005 mission reported continuing severe
staffing problems in national accounts and concomitant problems with source data. The
mission also noted the need to re-benchmark and rebase the GDP estimates, but emphasized
that shortcomings in source data may preclude this from being done effectively.

38
Prices
Since January 2001, BSL produces a monthly consumer price index (CPI) that covers
Maseru, the capital city, and six urban towns. With effect from December 2006 the coverage
is to be increased by three additional urban towns. While the index has a reference period of
April 1997 = 100, the weights are still based on the 1994/95 Household Budget Survey
(HBS). In addition, a separate CPI is compiled and published for Maseru City. A HBS was
conducted for 2002/3 though the results have yet to be used to derive new weights.
Government finance statistics
Data on government revenue and grants, current and capital expenditure, and
financing are now provided by the Ministry of Finance to AFR on a monthly basis,
although timeliness of reports remains problematic. There is scope for further
improvement in the reporting of these data. Current and capital expenditure would benefit
from more disaggregated reporting, including for health and education; revenues should be
classified according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001); and
the reporting lag of about one year for the production of the functional breakdown of
expenditure should be reduced. It is also necessary to distinguish clearly between current and
capital (project) grants and external loan disbursements.
A GDDS fiscal sector mission in December 2003 was followed by a technical assistance
mission in 2004, which assisted the authorities in implementing the reporting
framework of GFSM 2001. The mission identified several shortcomings in the data.
Underreporting of recurrent revenue and expenditure occurs as ministries net revenue against
unreported expenditure. Reporting of acquisition of nonfinancial assets is incomplete as
ministries do not fully report donor project outlays. These data are also insufficiently detailed
to allow appropriate economic classifications. The mission assisted the authorities in
compiling a bridge table to reclassify data according to GFSM 2001. The mission also
established that the data coverage did not include the activities of the National University of
Lesotho, the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Fund and the Petroleum Fund. The
mission recommended that the university be treated as an extra-budgetary fund and that the
other funds be adequately sectorized and classified to further enhance the coverage of the
general government.
Another GFS mission that visited Maseru in March 2006 found that progress with the
implementation of the previous missions’ recommendations had been impeded by lack of
resources and high turnover of staff. More specifically, no progress has been observed in
implementing the recommendation to expand coverage of the fiscal statistics to include
extrabudgetary units of government, or in aligning the classification of transactions in the
source accounting systems with GFSM 2001 classifications. A revision of the chart of
accounts was envisaged with the introduction of the Integrated Financial Management
Information System.
Annual cash data to 2004 have been published in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook 2005. Revenue and expenses are classified by limited GFSM 2001 economic type
classifications, and outlays by a limited Classification of the Functions of Government

39
(COFOG). Only annual government finance data to 2003 have been published in
International Finance Statistics.
Monetary statistics
Most TA recommendations have been adopted. Monthly reporting of data for IFS
publication is timely and has improved in terms of classification of instruments, sectorization
of the domestic economy, and compilation of the monetary aggregates. Lesotho started
compiling monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which
provide improved classification and sectorization of the accounts, and reported these data to
STA beginning in December 2004. However, the recommendations to expand the
institutional coverage of the other depository corporation sector and to value all financial
instruments at market value are yet to be implemented.
Balance of payments and external debt
The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) compiles quarterly balance of payments statistics,
usually with a lag of three months. However, these data are not reported to AFR or STA on a
timely basis for surveillance and for dissemination in the Fund’s statistical publications.
A STA mission in July-August 2002 concluded that the quality of Lesotho’s balance of
payments data was inadequate for policy purposes. The methodology underlying the
compilation of the balance of payments data suffers from the use of outdated benchmark
surveys and deterioration in the coverage and timeliness of some of data sources. The main
recommendations of the mission were as follows:
•

It is urgent to resolve both the inadequate coverage and the delayed reporting of
data on exports and imports of goods. The Department of Customs and Excise (DCE)
does not provide data in a timely fashion. The CBL, therefore, generates its own
estimates and there are significant differences between these estimates and DCE’s data.
For example, CBL believes that DCE is underreporting total imports and has been
adjusting the level of imports upward by 30 percent. There are also differences between
the trade data compiled by the CBL and the BSL.

•

Closer cooperation and new statistical surveys are needed to improve the quality of
data on exports and imports of services. Most of the data on exports of services are
based on outdated benchmark estimates adjusted for movements in the consumer price
index. Data available at the ministries and other organizations could also be of better use
for estimates of balance of payments variables. Government ministries and the CBL
should cooperate more and make better use of data sources in organizations like the
Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, the Lesotho National Development
Corporation, the South African Reserve Bank, and the Employment Bureau of South
Africa.

Progress in implementation of these recommendations is unclear.
In general, the authorities need to strengthen their institutional capacity. The CBL
should be given formal institutional responsibility for the compilation of balance of payments

40
statistics. This work is currently undertaken by the CBL but there is no legislation or official
decree that designates this responsibility. Together with other members of the Common
Monetary Area (CMA), Lesotho’s authorities also need to consider measures to harmonize
concepts, methodology, and data collection for regional balance of payments data.
Under the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa, Lesotho has participated in a series of
regional workshops to plan and implement surveys for the recording of private capital flows
and stocks. Currently, the authorities are in the process of preparing to run a full-scale survey
in respect of calendar year 2005.

APPENDIX IV. LESOTHO: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS16
In the view of Fund and IDA staffs, Lesotho presents a moderate risk of debt distress.
External debt in NPV terms is projected to remain well below 40 percent of GDP, both in the
baseline scenario and under a set of adverse shocks. However, the DSA also highlights the
country’s vulnerability to exchange rate changes and other shocks, given the country’s
narrow export base.
Lesotho’s nominal external debt declined from 82 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to
47 percent of GDP (US$694 million) at the end of 2005/06, as a result of the combined
effects of limited new borrowing, an appreciation of the exchange rate, and the early
repayment of nonconcessional loans in 2005. The NPV of external debt stood at 31 percent
of GDP at end-March 2006. About 85 percent of the debt is owed to multilateral creditors,
mainly IDA (75 percent). The remainder is split between bilateral and commercial creditors
(10 percent and 3 percent, respectively). Virtually all public and publicly-guaranteed external
debt is held by the central government, which has taken over the debt incurred by other
public entities. For private sector debt, only obligations towards countries outside the
Common Monetary Area are recorded. At end-March 2006, these obligations were estimated
at US$2.2 million.
Macroeconomic projections and financing terms are summarized below in Box 1.
Compared to the 2005 DSA (see CR05/437), the current account balance is significantly
improved, on account of larger than previously expected SACU revenues to 2009/10 and
stronger export performance in the non-garment sector, primarily due to diamonds. Real
GDP growth is projected to average about 2 percent to 2011 and to increase to 4.5 percent
over the long term, driven by growth in non-traditional exports and reflecting the effects of
the implementation of the PRS and other planned structural reforms.
The baseline scenario assumes that the authorities would contain the fiscal deficit over
the medium term to levels that can be financed with grants and highly concessional
loans. Gross domestic public debt currently stands at 6 percent of GDP, and is projected to
decline further over the medium term. Moreover, net domestic debt is currently negative—at
minus 10 percent of GDP, reflecting sizable government deposits.
Under the baseline scenario, all debt burden indicators remain below their relevant
indicative thresholds.17 Debt level indicators stabilize at low levels under the terms of new

Jointly updated with the World Bank staff. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) focuses on external debt.
Domestic debt is not expected to significantly increase the total public debt burden in the long term.

17

The latest World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ranks Lesotho as a “medium
performer” in terms of policy and institutions. The applicable indicative thresholds for debt sustainability,
proposed under the framework for low-income countries, are an NPV of debt of 40 percent of GDP, 150 percent

43
borrowing assumed for the second half of the projection period. Reflecting in part the growth
of nontextile exports including diamonds, the NPV of external debt in terms of exports
declines steadily under the baseline scenario, with the ratio remaining well below the
indicative threshold of 150 percent over the medium term.
Under the standard stress tests, based on the volatility of key macroeconomic variables,
the debt burden remains below the indicative thresholds. In case of a large nominal
devaluation (30 percent), the NPV of debt would exceed 40 percent of GDP, but only over
the initial five years of the projection period (Table 1b, Scenario B6). In all other scenarios
the level of debt consistently remains below the indicative thresholds. An additional test,
designed to illustrate the vulnerabilities arising from the country’s narrow export base,
Box 1. Main Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario
• Annual Real GDP growth is assumed to increase gradually from about 2 percent in 2005/06 to
4.5 percent by the end of the projection period.
• Inflation (as measured by the GDP deflator) is projected to stabilize slightly above 4 percent, broadly in
line with experience in recent years.
• Fiscal deficits are projected to remain contained at a level that can be financed through external donors’
assistance. The government is assumed to pursue a fiscal policy that would help maintain low domestic
debt relative to GDP
• Imports and exports of goods and services and transfers are assumed to grow in line with GDP (in
U.S. dollar terms). FDI is assumed to grow slightly more rapidly, taking into account the reduction of
the corporate income tax rate in 2006 to attract foreign investment.
• The current account deficit (including official transfers) is determined by the above trends, widening to
about 5 percent of GDP in 2006/07 and broadly remaining at this level over the medium term.
• Net external public sector financing is assumed to rise to about 2 percent of GDP by the end of the
current decade and then to stabilize at this level. Foreign grants are assumed to remain stable at about
3 percent of GDP over the projection period. The DSA assumes that new borrowing would be contracted
on highly concessional terms during the first half of the projection period; however, as the country
reaches the threshold for eligibility under concessional windows of financing, it is assumed that the
average grant element of new borrowing gradually decreases from 45 percent to 20 percent by the end of
the projection period.
• Private sector debt is projected to increase only marginally in terms of GDP, to 0.6 percent by 2024/25.

assumes that the expansion of textile exports since 1999 based on the United States’ African
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) would be entirely reversed in 2006/07.18 Under this
extreme scenario, the debt sustainability indicators would rise sharply, with the NPV of debt-

of exports, and 250 percent of government revenues, and debt service of 20 percent of exports and 30 percent of
government revenues.

to-exports ratio peaking at about 174 percent in 2007/08, but drop below their indicative
thresholds over the medium term.
Based on the findings of this DSA, staffs are of the view that Lesotho faces a moderate
risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, all debt burden indicators are expected to
remain below the relevant indicative thresholds. Stress tests, based on the country’s historical
volatility, do not indicate any breach of the thresholds. However, shocks affecting the
country’s narrow export base could increase the country’s risk of debt distress.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 6, 2006

This statement provides an update on economic developments since the issuance of the staff
report. These developments do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

The Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Council has indicated its intention to
distribute additional windfall SACU revenue during fiscal year 2006/07. The
magnitude and timing of the receipts are expected to be determined in October 2006.
The authorities stated that they plan to pursue a prudent fiscal policy and resist
pressures to spend.

•

The exchange rate of the loti against the US dollar moved from M7.0 at the end of
July 2006 to M7.6 at end-September 2006, in line with the weakening of the South
African rand/US dollar exchange rate.

•

Gross international reserves rose from US$564 million, representing about 5 months
coverage of import of goods and nonfactor services at end-March, to US$604 million
at end-September 2006, representing 5.2 months of coverage.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
the Kingdom of Lesotho
On October 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Lesotho.1
Background
Lesotho has made good progress toward macroeconomic stability in recent years. Its
fiscal balance has been in surplus since 2003/04, owing mainly to rapidly rising receipts
from the South African Customs Union (SACU) and improved domestic revenue
collection. Reflecting the sizable SACU inflows and fiscal surpluses, the external current
account deficit has narrowed and gross international reserves increased to the
equivalent of about five months of imports of goods and nonfactor services by the end of
the fiscal year 2005/06. In line with price trends in South Africa, the inflation rate fell in
2003–05 despite rising oil import prices. Market yields on treasury bills have moved
downward and the spread relative to South Africa has virtually vanished, due to the
strengthened fiscal position. The government used part of the SACU windfalls to retire
nonconcessional debt, reducing the net present value of public external debt to levels
significantly below the relevant indicative debt sustainability threshold.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
However, economic activity has remained sluggish, reflecting the adverse impact of
exogenous shocks, and poverty remains widespread. Agricultural production was hit by
drought in 2002-05 and excessive rainfall in early 2006, which has also damaged roads
and bridges in the rural areas where about 70 percent of the population lives.
The manufacturing sector was adversely affected by a substantial real effective
appreciation of the loti in 2002–2004 and the removal of textile quotas by industrial
countries in early 2005, which led to the loss of about a quarter of jobs in the garment
sector. Following a halt of the loti appreciation and the signing of a bilateral agreement
that restrains exports from China to the U.S. market, the garments sector saw a modest
recovery recently.
In the context of the 2006/07 budget, the authorities have reduced the company income
tax rate to attract investment. With SACU revenue projected to reach a record level, total
spending is budgeted to increase sharply. A supplementary budget raises expenditure
further and largely eliminates the initially targeted budget surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP.
While the 2006/07 budget includes a significant increase in expenditures on
infrastructure and for reduction of nonconcessional external debt, the wage bill and
other recurrent outlays are also projected to increase relative to GDP. The execution
rate of capital expenditure, particularly concerning donor-funded projects, was low in the
past year.
Lesotho’s medium-term outlook is clouded by considerable downside risks, including a
further loss of trade preferences for the export sector and a decline in SACU receipts
relative to GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Lesotho authorities for their continued efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability under difficult circumstances. In particular, they noted the
marked improvement in the fiscal and external positions in recent years, and welcomed
the authorities’ prudent use of the large receipts from the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) in the last two years for debt reduction and the accumulation of
international reserves.
Directors cautioned, however, that economic growth is still low and that much remains to
be done to reduce poverty in view of Lesotho’s narrow resource and production base,
susceptibility to shocks, and high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Directors also identified
several downside risks for Lesotho over the medium term, including a further loss of
trade preferences and a decline in receipts from the SACU. Against this background,
Directors considered that the key policy challenges facing the authorities are to achieve
more rapid and broad-based economic growth through an acceleration of structural
reforms and to strengthen the medium-term fiscal position. International assistance

3
would continue to be essential for further improving fiscal management and overcoming
absorptive capacity constraints.
Directors emphasized the need for a prudent fiscal strategy, in view of the high
uncertainty regarding future SACU receipts and the fact that, under the exchange rate
parity arrangement, the burden of safeguarding macroeconomic stability falls on fiscal
policy and structural reforms. They supported the use of further exceptional SACU
receipts for reducing nonconcessional debt and increasing poverty-related spending,
but encouraged the authorities to strictly contain the wage bill and other recurrent
outlays. Directors also considered that the 2007/08 budget should aim at maintaining
fiscal sustainability. They cautioned that pension reform and a new medical aid scheme
should be introduced as part of a broader civil service reform that would set personnelrelated budgetary expenditures on a sustainable path. Directors also called on the
authorities to offset the revenue impact of the company tax cut through sustained
improvement in tax administration.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve public financial
management. They welcomed the wider application of the medium-term fiscal
framework and other steps to improve budget planning and execution. While supporting
the objective of improving public service delivery at the local level, Directors encouraged
the authorities to take prompt action to ensure that the implementation is broadly
budget-neutral. They underscored the importance of increasing the execution rate of
capital expenditure to support economic growth and increase aid absorption.
Directors stressed that, to achieve higher growth and diversify the production base,
the authorities need to press ahead with structural reforms aimed at improving Lesotho’s
attractiveness as a location for private investment. In this context, Directors considered
that the exchange rate peg under the Common Monetary Area has generally served
Lesotho well, but noted that the real appreciation of the loti in recent years heightens the
need for sustained actions to reduce structural impediments and enhance the
economy’s flexibility and competitiveness. They therefore urged the authorities to
implement without delay the reforms to remove red tape and other regulatory
impediments, and increase competitiveness by enhancing labor productivity,
infrastructure, and institutions. The launching of the Trade and Investment Facilitation
Center was seen as an important step in this direction. Directors also supported the
Central Bank of Lesotho’s efforts to improve private sector access to bank credit and to
strengthen the regulatory framework for the nonbank financial sector.
Directors agreed that Lesotho will continue to need international support in order to
make progress toward the MDGs and address pressing social challenges, including
combating HIV/AIDS prevalence. They stressed the need to mobilize additional donor
support for the strengthened implementation of Lesotho’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.

4
Directors saw scope to further improve the quality and timeliness of Lesotho’s statistics
for enhancing policy analysis and surveillance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
Lesotho may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.

Introduction

On behalf of our Lesotho authorities we would like to thank staff for the constructive
dialogue during the last Article IV consultations and the board and management for their
continued support. The authorities appreciate the advice proffered by the fund and are in
general agreement with the thrust of the staff report. As indicated in the staff report, the
authorities’ commitment to prudent macroeconomic management has contributed to
maintaining macroeconomic stability. However, high and sustained economic growth
necessary for meaningful poverty reduction has remained elusive. Lesotho has been
experiencing several exogenous shocks in the last few years which have made
macroeconomic management more challenging: the lapsing last year of the Multifibre
Agreement resulted in closures of textile factories and increased unemployment; there is
concern about the prospects of erosion of preferences under AGOA, which may also worsen
the performance of the textile industries; ongoing massive retrenchments of mine workers by
South African mines has cut-off the main source of remittances from abroad; and, there are
uncertainties surrounding the future of the government’s main source of revenue, SACU
receipts. These developments have impacted adversely on the prospects for growth and have
compounded poverty. In addition, Lesotho’s debt, especially multilateral, remains high, yet
the country does not qualify for debt relief, thus depriving the country of the necessary fiscal
space for achieving the MDGs. Going forward the authorities are dedicated to implementing
the policies and reforms aimed at preserving stability and promoting sustainable growth and
poverty reduction.
2.

Recent Economic Developments

Lesotho’s economic performance continued to show sustained improvements towards
macroeconomic stability. The fiscal balance registered a surplus for the third consecutive
year. At 3.9 percent of GDP during 2005/06, the fiscal surplus reflected a significant growth
in total revenue and grants as a result of higher than expected Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) revenues, as well as the lower than budgeted expenditure. The surplus
enabled Government to repay more of its non-concessional debt, thus further improving the
country’s external debt position to 53.1 percent of GDP. This further demonstrates the
government’s commitment to prudent and sustainable fiscal policies.
The external position remained favorable in 2005, with a build-up in gross official reserves to
about 5.8 months of import coverage. The growth in reserves was facilitated by a significant
improvement in the current account balance from a deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2004 to
a surplus of 1.2 per cent in 2005 as a result of higher SACU receipts.

2
In line with regional developments and despite the higher oil import prices inflationary
pressures remained subdued in 2005. The CPI based inflation rate declined from an average
of 5.1 per cent registered in 2004 to 3.5 per cent.
Economic growth, however, declined further from 3.1 per cent in 2004 to 1.2 per cent in
2005, largely as a result of a contraction in manufacturing output. Performance of the
manufacturing sector has been adversely affected by removal of textile quotas and the
resultant increase in competition, for the US market, from low-cost producers such as China,
and the relative strength of the loti against the US dollar. The unemployment situation
worsened in 2005 with manufacturing sector employment declining significantly due to the
closure of some textile and clothing firms and the continued fall in Basotho mineworker
employment by the South African mines.
3.

Macroeconomic outlook and policies

Macroeconomic prospects for Lesotho are clouded by the current deterioration in output as a
result of external shocks as well as the uncertainty surrounding future SACU revenues. The
deterioration in economic growth has worsened the unemployment problem and threatens to
worsen the already wide spread poverty levels. The high levels of HIV prevalence in the
country could also affect labor productivity negatively thus exacerbating the growth problem
and making it even more difficult for the country to reach the MDGs. The uncertainty of
SACU revenue poses a challenge to fiscal management as these receipts continue to account
for the bulk of government revenue.
The continued retrenchment of the Basotho workers from the South African mines also has
negative effects, reducing remittances and affecting the balance of payments, as well as
increasing unemployment and exacerbating poverty.
Fiscal policy
Lesotho’s membership of the CMA shifts the burden of macroeconomic management to
fiscal policy. Therefore, the importance of prudent fiscal policy cannot be overstated. The
core objective of Lesotho’s fiscal strategy is to maintain fiscal sustainability. Throughout
most of the 1990s and early 2000s the authorities have been successful in achieving this
objective with fiscal surpluses being consistently realized. The authorities continued to
exercise prudence in managing these surpluses and used them to retire some of the country’s
commercial and domestic debt, thereby improving debt sustainability and reducing the fiscal
burden of future interest payments. The surpluses are expected to continue up to 2007/08 due
to higher SACU revenue but fiscal prospects may deteriorate thereafter, as these receipts
begin to taper off. The authorities are conscious not to use the additional resources from
SACU in a manner that will create future expenditures. They will continue to use them to
settle some of the public debt and for critical once off expenditures. These will include the

3
expenditure on the repair of the physical infrastructure that was destroyed by the heavier than
normal rains that were experienced earlier this year.
The authorities are aware of the challenges that the potential fall in future SACU revenue
poses to maintaining the current policy stance and are committed to undertake expenditure
reforms to dampen its impact. They plan to improve the quality of public expenditure by
targeting high priority activities as identified in the poverty reduction strategy. The
authorities appreciate the potential fiscal impact of the pension and medical reform for civil
servants. They are currently studying the options available for their execution and undertake
to limit their costs to the minimum possible. These reforms are necessary as the pension
reform aims to replace the current unfunded defined benefit scheme with a funded defined
benefit or defined contribution scheme. The medical benefit scheme is also necessary to keep
up with regional labor market developments and alleviate the problem of brain drain.
Measures to improve the public financial management are also being undertaken that include,
widening the use of the medium term fiscal framework, improving service delivery at local
levels and introduction of the integrated financial management information system.
On the revenue front, the authorities continue to be committed to undertake domestic
revenues enhancing measures through continuous improvements in revenue administration
by the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA).
Monetary policy and Financial sector issues
The conduct of monetary policy in Lesotho is limited by the country’s membership in the
CMA, which provides for the loti to be pegged at par to the South African rand and for free
movement of capital within the CMA. In this regard, monetary policy in Lesotho aims at
maintaining a strong external reserve position that is adequate to support the exchange rate
peg as well as to meet the country’s external obligations. The central bank currently holds a
level of reserves that is more than adequate to cover these objectives.
The banking sector in Lesotho continues to be sound and well capitalized. The authorities
continue to implement measures geared towards improving prudential supervision and to
facilitate the development of the banking sector as well as the non-bank financial sector.
However, the banking sectors’ reluctance to extend credit to the private sector remains a
major concern for the authorities. To address this issue the Central Bank has embarked on a
number of reforms to improve financial intermediation and make conditions more conducive
for credit extension. These include the review of the laws that affect the financial sector,
which was initiated in 2005 and is expected to be completed in 2006. The review is expected
to harmonize and improve the legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector. The
Financial Institutions Act (FIA) is also being revised to accommodate the implementation of
the tiered banking system. The authorities have also developed an Anti Money Laundering
bill which is expected to be enacted into law before the end of 2006.

4
The Central Bank, in collaboration with the banking sector, is also embarking on a project to
modernize the National payments systems. The legal framework for the payments system is
being developed and the drafting of the law, with the technical assistance of the Fund, has
been completed. The Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system has been installed and was
successfully launched on August 25, 2006. The RTGS will mainly deal with settlement of
large value time critical transactions and is expected to be instrumental in reducing
settlement risks. Subsequent to the deployment of the RTGS, the authorities plan to also
implement an automated clearing house for low value high volume transactions in order to
reduce their settlement time.
Promotion of private sector led growth
Promotion of private sector led growth is crucial for Lesotho to reduce poverty. The
government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, cognizant of the need to improve the investment
climate and incentives as well as enhance international competitiveness, reduced company
tax rates starting from the 2006/07 fiscal year. The trade and investment facilitation centre
was also established to serve as a one stop shop for potential investors and this will serve to
reduce the regulatory impediments and facilitate investment. The authorities also plan to take
measures to improve labor productivity, economic infrastructure as well as to diversify
markets in order to reduce the country’s vulnerability to shocks.
4.

Conclusion

The authorities remain committed to implementing measures to safeguard macroeconomic
stability and to promote growth. They seek the continued support of the Fund and the
international community in general in mitigating the enormous challenges that they face in
their pursuit of these objectives. This is particularly important for the country to reduce
poverty and make headway towards achieving the MDGs.
