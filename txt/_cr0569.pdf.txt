•

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Bissau during
June 19-July 2, 2004, at which time the staff also discussed the Ex Post
Assessment of Performance under Fund-supported Programs (EPA). The staff
team comprised Messrs. Snoek (Head), Krichene, and Laporte and Ms. Mendez (all
AFR), Ms. Ocampos (STA), and Mr. Doré (Resident Representative). The team
cooperated with overlapping missions of West AFRITAC, the World Bank and the
European Union (EU).

•

The mission met with the President of Guinea-Bissau, the President of the
National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Economy and Finance,
and other senior government officials, and with the Governor of the Central Bank
for West African States (BCEAO). The mission also met with representatives of
civil society and the donor community.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 26, 2002. Directors
noted with concern that, as a result of inadequate policies, economic activity had
failed to pick up after the 1998-99 conflict and donor assistance was delayed. They
urged the authorities to reestablish sound financial management practices.
However, unsatisfactory policy performance continued and the three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) expired at
end-2003 without the completion of a review. The 2003 Article IV consultation
could not be concluded because of a coup in September 2003.

Guinea-Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
with effect from January 1, 1997. Relations with the Fund and the World Bank
Group are described in Appendices I and II, and the serious weaknesses in GuineaBissau’s statistics are discussed in Appendix III. Appendix IV provides the status
of completion point conditions under the HIPC Initiative and Appendix V contains
the Public Debt Sustainability Framework Tables. This paper is accompanied by a
Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix report (to be issued shortly).

Guinea-Bissau has gone through a very difficult period since a civil war in
1998-99, as continuing political instability, erratic government, and weak technical capacity
resulted in a stagnating economy, increasing fiscal problems, and a virtual collapse of the
government administration.
Following a coup in September 2003 and elections in March, a new government took
office in May 2004. The government program focuses on short-term measures to restore the
administration and normal rule-based fiscal management. Medium-term policies build on
IMF and World Bank-supported programs of the 1990s, aiming at improving the legal
system and promoting investment, reducing excessive regulation, and completing the
privatization program.
The main challenge for the country is to maintain political stability, especially in view
of the upcoming presidential elections. In this regard, the government program emphasizes
good governance, transparency and consultation, the lack of which was identified in the draft
PRSP as a main factor behind the war in 1998-99.
The government’s policies are encouraging, but serious challenges lie ahead. A recent
military mutiny raises doubts about the authorities’ ability to implement their program.
Moreover, the severe fiscal problems, reflecting a devastated economy, a low revenue effort
and excessive public sector employment, can only be resolved in the medium-term. In the
meantime, large financing gaps threaten to lead to further external and domestic arrears,
unless external support can be found. Third, the government program can only be
implemented with considerable technical assistance in building institutions and capacity.
Fiscal policy should aim at increasing revenue and reducing personnel costs. Tax
administration should be strengthened and the tax base widened. A medium-term public
sector reform program will be needed to reduce public sector employment; as a first step, a
civil service census should be carried out urgently, and ghost workers removed.
The authorities are in the process of finalizing the PRSP, which may be submitted to the
Boards of the Fund and the World Bank before a donor Round Table conference, tentatively
scheduled for December 15, 2004.
The staff supports the recommendation in the EPA that the next step in Fund
engagement in Guinea-Bissau be emergency post-conflict assistance (EPCA). However,
before discussions on a program to be supported by EPCA can be finalized, there should be
evidence that the causes of the recent military mutiny are being addressed and that the
government is able to implement its policies. EPCA, which should be in the context of a
concerted international effort, should be geared toward helping the authorities prepare for a
new PRGF arrangement, possibly over a two-year period. This should be complemented by a
strong technical assistance effort to help addressing serious technical weaknesses in all
aspects of fiscal management and macroeconomic statistics.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Guinea-Bissau has gone through a very difficult period in recent years. Political
instability continued after the civil war in 1998-99 (Box 1). Economic activity failed to pick
up because of the unstable political environment, a stalled reform effort, and large private
sector wartime losses (Table 1). Fiscal problems mounted, reflecting a near doubling of wage
expenditure after the war; weak expenditure management; declining revenue; and the
suspension of donor assistance amid growing concerns about governance and unsatisfactory
performance under the PRGF arrangement (Table 2). As a result, poverty has increased.
Guinea-Bissau remains one of the poorest countries in the world with per capita income of
US$185 (25 percent lower than in 1993) and a Human Development Index ranking that is
among the ten lowest internationally.

Box 1. The 1998-99 Civil War and Its Aftermath
In June 1998, a power struggle between the President and the military escalated quickly into a
much broader conflict, the roots of which lay in failed governance and a sense of exclusion
among much of the population. The fighting was concentrated in the capital Bissau. It resulted
in thousands of deaths, widespread damage to housing, infrastructure and government
buildings and equipment, the virtual annihilation of the small industrial sector, and the
departure abroad of many of the better educated.
The post-conflict strategy was based on an economic program supported under the PRGF,
interim debt relief under the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative),
and two key programs, financed by the World Bank, the European Union (EU) and bilateral
donors, for (i) demobilization and reintegration of the military and veterans of the
independence war (PDRRI); and (ii) clearance of public sector supplier arrears (DASP).
However, the country failed to attain political stability. The governing coalition fell quickly
apart and oppression increased, while economic management was neglected. The PRGFsupported program went off track immediately because of expenditure overruns, and part of the
interim debt relief and assistance to the PDRRI and the DASP was suspended.
Following delays beyond the constitutional deadline for holding elections, the military
removed President Yalà in a bloodless coup in September 2003. A civilian national transition
government organized parliamentary elections on March 28, 2004, which were won by the
main opposition party, but without a majority in parliament. On October 6, 2004, some military
units staged a rebellion—ostensibly to protest against corruption in the senior ranks of the
army and bad living conditions in the barracks—killing, among others, the Chief of Staff of the
Army. While the government reached an agreement with the mutineers quickly, mounting
demands by the rebels and the emergence of different factions within the army raised tensions
again later.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Economic activity remained sluggish in 2003. After a sharp fall in 2002, agricultural
production rebounded because of favorable weather conditions. However, activity in other
sectors continued to decline, reflecting the lingering damage of the war, increasing political
instability, and mounting public sector wage arrears. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
stagnated in 2003 (Figure 2).1 Consumer prices remained flat during December 2002-03,
reflecting falling domestic demand and adequate food harvests. The economic situation
remained broadly unchanged in early-2004.

The fiscal situation deteriorated further. With the possibility of elections, political
interference in fiscal operations increased and control by the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) collapsed during 2003. Provisional data indicate that the domestic primary
deficit (on a commitment basis) remained around 4 percent of GDP.2 However, debt service
to the IMF—which is paid automatically by the BCEAO from the government’s account—
increased sharply compared to 2002 (Table 5), as did payments for domestic short-term debt
and past arrears.3 The financing need was met by new domestic arrears. The salaries of most

The domestic primary deficit is defined as revenue excluding grants, minus current
expenditure excluding interest, plus domestically-financed capital expenditure.

The increase in debt service to the Fund reflects maturing purchases under the 1999-2000
EPCA. Access under the PRGF arrangement had been set 25 percent of quota higher than

civil servants remained unpaid through the first
nine months of 2003 as the authorities gave
priority to paying for goods and services to
promote political support (increasingly through
netting out against tax liabilities). Consequently,
the already severely weakened administration
virtually collapsed as morale declined and
strikes increased.

After the coup in September, the
transition government formulated a donor-20

mixed results (Box 2). Expenditure control was

strengthened and salaries eligible for donor
financing were paid, albeit with delays.
However, revenue remained considerably below
expectations, reflecting a decline in imports and
continuing administrative weaknesses. Moreover, the EU delayed disbursing the
compensation for fishing rights—more than 20 percent of revenue—pending a review of its
assistance to the sector, resulting in further arrears.

5.
Guinea-Bissau’s financial system
remains very small. Only one small bank operates in Bissau as two larger banks remained
closed after the civil war.4 Credit to the economy, mainly for import financing, declined in
2003, reflecting (corrected for accounting changes) the economic stagnation
(Figure 3, Table 3).
6.
Since Guinea-Bissau joined the WAEMU in 1997, its monetary and exchange rate
policies are set for the Union as a whole. Inflation has been low and the real effective
exchange rate depreciated through most of 2003 (Figure 4).

used to repurchase the EPCA; however, the authorities failed to make the repurchase. GuineaBissau continues to benefit from a subsidy on the charges on the EPCA.

Box 2. The Emergency Economic Management Plan (EEMP)
The EEMP was based on an international partnership agreement proposed by the United Nations (UN)
ECOSOC Ad Hoc Advisory Group for Guinea-Bissau to break the deadlock in donor assistance. The
plan included political and financial governance policies and was submitted to donors by mid-December
2003. To add to donor confidence, the UN established an Emergency Economic Management Fund
(EEMF), through which emergency budget support could be channeled and monitored. Assistance from
the EEMF is provided for social sector and nonmilitary operating expenditure, conditional upon the
implementation of the EEMP and the submission of detailed spending plans.
A key element of the EEMP was an emergency budget for 2004, that was prepared on the basis of
“minimum needs” with technical assistance from the IMF, West AFRITAC, the World Bank, and the
African Development Bank (AfDB). The main objective of the budget was to allow a basic functioning
of the government by providing for wages and basic allocations for health and education. The EEMP
included a treasury cash-flow plan for the period December 2003-June 2004 to facilitate fiscal
management and allow close monitoring. External support for the emergency budget amounted to almost
€7 million through June, slightly less than what had been requested.1/ The EEMP and the emergency
budget were replaced by the government program for 2004-08 and a revised budget for 2004, accepted
by parliament by end-July 2004.

The countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) contributed about
40 percent. Other contributions came from Angola, China, France, Ghana, Italy, The Netherlands,
Portugal, and Sweden.

The external current account balance continued to improve in 2003 (Table 4,
Figure 5). The deficit on the trade balance narrowed, mostly on account of higher cashew
nut exports. Imports declined as a ratio to GDP,

respectively. Average required debt relief was
calculated at 86 percent of the NPV of debt; the
Fund and the World Bank would provide
interim relief of 100 percent and Paris Club creditors of 90 percent of debt service falling
due. However, following nonperformance under the PRGF-arrangement, interim relief from
the IMF and Paris Club creditors automatically stopped after 2001. Debt to the IMF
continues to be fully

serviced; World Bank interim relief declined to 90 percent in January 2004—it will reach the
statutory limit by end-2007—and the AfDB extended 100 percent relief through 2006.5
However, debt service to other creditors continues to fall into arrears (Table 7).6

Guinea-Bissau lost all special bilateral donor relationships, but multilateral
donors are resuming disbursements. The Netherlands decided to end its special aid
relationship with Guinea-Bissau shortly before the coup in 2003, completing the exodus of
major bilateral donors following a long history of governance problems (although several
contributed, with relatively small amounts, to the EEMF). However, based on the EEMP, the
World Bank—in the context of its special approach to low-income countries under stress
(LICUS)—resumed disbursements for demobilization and arrears clearance in March 2004
(for a total of US$15 million—5 percent of GDP). It is also developing an Interim Support
Strategy for the period until end-2005. The EU withdrew from the arrears-clearance program
in early-2004, citing governance issues with its implementation, but the funds have been
reallocated to budget support. Following progress under a mandatory post-coup political
dialogue, discussions on disbursement of the EU’s remaining budget support have started. A
donor Round Table conference is tentatively planned for December 15, 2004.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
The discussions took place against the background of a stagnating economy,
severe fiscal problems, and a virtually collapsed public administration. The government
was preparing its program for 2004-08.7 The authorities and staff agreed that the immediate
challenge was to rebuild the administration and to avoid further domestic budgetary arrears
while laying the foundations for higher economic growth; consequently, the discussions
focused on short-term policies. Medium-term policies and structural reforms would need to
be fleshed out and implemented as administrative capacity was strengthened.
A. Short-Term Outlook and Policies
11.
The short-term macroeconomic framework assumes an improvement in
economic activity, reflecting donor assistance and a more positive policy environment.
5

China and Cuba have cancelled all official debt, while Italy has forgiven US$60 million in
arrears as of December 2000.
6

Total scheduled debt service was estimated at US$44 million (19 percent of GDP) in 2003,
of which US$5.1 million was paid to the Fund, US$9 million was covered by debt relief, and
US$29 million added to arrears.
7

Parliament approved the program, which was broadly in line with the policies discussed
with the mission, by end-July.

- 11 -

World Bank disbursements and payments by the UN for soldiers that participated in the
peace-keeping force in Liberia, amounted to almost 6 percent of GDP by mid-2004.8 Based
on their positive effect on domestic demand and a favorable outlook for agricultural
production, real GDP is estimated to increase by 1-2 percent in 2004 and by around 3 percent
in 2005. End-period inflation is expected to remain within the WAEMU’s target of less than
3 percent by the end of 2004. Reflecting low imports in the first half of the year, the external
current account balance, including official transfers, is projected to become slightly positive
in 2004.
12.
The authorities’ main priority was restoring administrative capacity and rulebased fiscal management. They would give the highest priority to paying government
salaries on time. Furthermore, they intended to pay the electricity bill monthly and provide
regular, albeit necessarily small, amounts for operating costs to the ministries, allowing the
administration to restart basic operations. The organization of the ministries will be
strengthened following a review of the respective laws. Measures already taken to improve
financial management included centralizing all revenue in the treasury account at the
BCEAO; requiring MEF approval for all expenditure commitments; and applying public
procurement regulations. Political appointees had been replaced by experienced technicians
at the head of the revenue departments. On the expenditure side, the travel budget had been
cut. Moreover, a revised budget for 2004, broadly as discussed with the staff, was approved
by parliament on July 29, restoring a normal framework for expenditure allocations; further
improvements toward a normal budget process would be made, with technical assistance
financed by the UNDP, in the context of the budget for 2005.
13.
Despite the measures, the fiscal situation will remain difficult (Table 10). Tax
revenue is not expected to recover significantly in the second half of the year. Nontax
revenue will be boosted by the EU’s compensation for fishing rights, but the expenditure,
that was originally planned to be financed from this revenue, has also been carried over into
the second half of the year. Moreover, the authorities intend to make up for the underfunding of the social sectors and of food for the military in the first half of the year. Outlays
on parliament will also be higher than originally expected (although lower than in previous
years). Consequently, the domestic primary deficit is projected to amount to almost 3 percent
of GDP for July-December 2004.
14.
The authorities felt that there was little scope for substantial revenue or
expenditure measures at this time. The weak economy was not conducive for tax increases,
and it would take time to strengthen tax administration. They agreed that there was
considerable scope for reducing personnel expenditure. However, as alternative employment
was not available, reductions in staffing would need to be prepared under a medium-term
public sector reform program. They agreed, however, with the staff’s suggestion to

complement a file-by-file review of the civil service with an immediate census to establish
the actual number of public servants.
15.
Including payment of arrears incurred during January-June and debt service,
the budget’s financing need amounts to almost 6 percent of GDP (€15 million) for the
second half of 2004. The authorities intend to clear all 2004 wage arrears and to start paying
the remaining debt to project accounts. External debt service will be limited mainly to the
Fund and the World Bank. With regard to financing, the remaining funds in the EEMF
amounted to about €2 million at end-June. Up to €10 million could be provided by the EU,
but it is not clear if Guinea-Bissau’s weak administration can meet the accounting
requirements for the use of these funds.9 In case the gap cannot be closed, the authorities
intend to give priority to wages and debt service to the Fund and the World Bank to avoid
interruption in new assistance; they will also seek further cuts in operating expenditure, but if
the financing shortfalls prove to be substantial, further wage arrears would be likely.
16.
The authorities indicated their intention to harmonize salaries across the public
sector. Following widening differences in remuneration between politicians and the military,
the previous government approved a ten-fold salary increase for the latter, which was,
however, never implemented. The authorities agreed with staff that it would be impossible to
finance that increase. As an alternative, they intended to harmonize public sector salaries
based on a reduction in the remuneration for politicians. Staff agreed with this approach, but
stressed the need to maintain the overall wage bill within budget.10
17.
The authorities intended to cooperate closely with the World Bank on
revitalizing the economy, including by reducing the still excessive regulation of the
economy and rehabilitating the electricity sector. They regretted the decision of the EU to
withdraw from the DASP; they intended to seek alternative donor financing since rebuilding
the private sector’s strength was crucial for the economy.

9

Moreover, because of noncompliance with these rules with regard to a disbursement of
€5 million in 2001, virtually that entire amount has to be reimbursed before Guinea-Bissau
can access the new funds (once repaid, these funds will be available again for new budget
support). The EU is providing technical assistance to improve compliance with the
expenditure accounting regulations.

10

Recently, the authorities reached agreement on a substantial decrease in wages for the
President, Ministers, and parliamentarians. However, minimum salaries in the civil service
were raised by about 15 percent (to €26 per month), and preliminary information indicates
that the wage bill for the military was almost tripled. The exact budgetary impact of these
agreements, which is expected to be significant, and some offsetting measures, remains to be
determined.

- 13 -

B. Medium-Term Outlook and Policies
18.
Medium-term policies should emphasize exploiting Guinea-Bissau’s excellent
growth potential in agriculture and fisheries. There is adequate supply of fertile land and
rainfall is good; the offshore waters are estimated to be among the most productive for
fishing in West Africa. Nevertheless, past policies focused on developing industrial activity
around Bissau, benefiting the political and military elite but providing little incentives for the
rural areas to improve agricultural productivity. Similarly, the local fishing sector remains
undeveloped. As a result, poverty remains endemic,11 and the economy remains highly
vulnerable to external shocks as more than 90 percent of exports, about 20-25 percent of
GDP, and more than 10 percent of fiscal revenue depend on cashew nuts, and a further
35-40 percent of revenue comes from fishing licenses to foreign operators.
19.
The discussions on the medium-term outlook and policies were of a preliminary
nature. The government’s program provides the main medium-term objectives: accelerating
economic growth, reducing poverty, and stabilizing the fiscal situation. However, the
policies remain to be detailed and costed, and basic data improved, before a realistic
medium-term framework can be prepared.
20.
The authorities and staff agreed that present trends were unsustainable, and the
discussions focused on a tentative medium-term scenario, based on strong action to
strengthen the fiscal position and on structural reforms to boost productivity growth
(Box 3). A combination of revenue and expenditure measures would be required to move the
budget’s domestic primary deficit from 5 percent of GDP in 2005 (including cost of elections
equivalent to 2 percent of GDP) to zero by 2007:
•

Guinea-Bissau’s low tax revenue-to-GDP ratio—almost half the WAEMU-area
average—indicates significant scope for revenue enhancement. A recent review of the
tax system by the World Bank found that domestic tax rates are generally higher than
in the rest of the region, indicating that additional revenue would have to come from
widening the tax base and improving administration.12 Other technical assistance
reports indicate that there are ample opportunities for this, but it will take time, and
technical assistance, for these to be realized.

11

About two-thirds of the population is living below the poverty line of US$2 per day. The
illiteracy rate is 70 percent in rural areas. Life expectancy is 45 years; 3 percent of the
population is estimated to be infected by HIV (Table 9 provides data in relation to the
Millennium Development Goals).

12

With regard to taxes on external trade, Guinea-Bissau applies the WAEMU’s common
external tariff. There are no known exceptions to the tariff and the trade regime has remained
unchanged in recent years; there are no known restrictions on the making of payments or
transfers for current international transactions.

- 14 -

•

Wage and wage-related expenditure claim almost 70 percent of revenue, double the
WAEMU target, indicating the possibility of substantial savings. Assuming the
implementation of a comprehensive public sector reform program, the wage bill has
been projected to remain constant in nominal terms at the level prevailing in recent
years. In the absence of a completed PRSP and costed policies, poverty reduction
expenditure has been projected at a constant ratio to GDP.

While this scenario would allow the government to finance domestic primary expenditure
from domestic resources by 2007, there would still be significant financing gaps in the
interim, reflecting the primary deficit and Guinea-Bissau’s high debt burden. Moreover,
despite the assumed resumption of HIPC debt relief, financing gaps would remain—although
at a much lower level—after 2007.
21.
The authorities noted that the medium-term structural reform program—
although still at a preliminary stage—provided a good basis for boosting growth along
the lines envisaged in the scenario. These policies build on programs that were supported
by the Fund and the World Bank in the 1990s, and on recent technical assistance reports.
Important elements include improving the legal system and investment regulations, reducing
inefficient taxes and regulations, and completing the privatization program. The World Bank
is providing assistance in many of these areas. Furthermore, the World Bank, the EU, and the
AfDB are providing assistance to the fisheries sector, including for strengthening
surveillance, research, and development of local fisheries, while the EU continues to provide
support for road infrastructure.

- 15 -

Box 3. Medium-term Scenarios, 2004–2009
Without strong policy adjustment, recent trends indicate low growth and a persistent substantial
deficit on the budget’s primary balance. The lack of reform would discourage donors to reengage.
Consequently, new (wage) arrears would be likely, making this scenario economically and
politically unsustainable.
The reform scenario assumes political stability and structural reform as well as strong measures to
improve revenue performance and contain personnel costs. It aims at a possible new PRGF
arrangement and full interim debt relief under the HIPC Initiative by early 2007, and attainment of
the completion point by end-2007. The fiscal financing gaps are assumed to be filled by renewed
donor support.

22.
Rebuilding the financial sector will be an important element in enhancing
growth prospects. The authorities shared staff’s concern that the WAEMU’s common
minimum capital requirement could be excessive for the small market of Guinea-Bissau,
discouraging new banks. They had therefore relaxed the requirement for Guinea-Bissau, and
a second commercial bank was expected by end-2004, at the same time as the WAEMU’s
regional microfinance bank.
23.
There are considerable downside risks in the medium-term scenario. First,
reflecting the many years of instability, and evidenced by the recent military uprising, the
risk of new political problems will remain high for some time to come, especially in view of
presidential elections in the first half of 2005. Second, limited administrative capacity and
the political need to keep urban interest groups satisfied could divert resources from muchneeded investment in agriculture, finance and basic infrastructure, possibly jeopardizing
growth prospects. Third, financing for the short- and medium-term budget gap remains
uncertain, and severe expenditure cuts or renewed wage arrears would greatly undermine the
ability of the government to implement its reform program, continuing a vicious circle of low
performance and declining donor assistance.13
24.
Staff and authorities agreed that the successful implementation of short- and
medium-term policies envisaged would require considerable technical assistance. In the
Fund’s area of competence, there is an urgent need for strengthening a broad range of
functions of the MEF, including macroeconomic statistics. In this regard, staff urged the
authorities to rapidly finalize a technical assistance master plan for the MEF for submission
to donors, requesting assistance to complement efforts already under way.14 Staff also
suggested that the authorities prepare a broad national technical assistance plan.
25.
The authorities attach great importance to the PRSP. They agreed with staff that
the latest draft lacked important elements, including prioritization and costing of the policies,
and a monitoring system. However, while work would continue, they felt that, in view of the
long delay since the Interim-PRSP in 2000 and the upcoming Round Table conference, it
would be important to finalize the document soon. They intend to submit the PRSP to the
Fund and the World Bank before end-2004, following which missing elements could be
added as technical capacity is strengthened.
13

Moreover, the EU is reviewing its fishing policies and the level and channel of future
revenue from this source is uncertain after the expiration of the present Fishing Protocol in
2005.

14

In addition to assistance from the EU, France, and the UNDP, West AFRITAC is
following up on diagnostic reports from FAD and STA missions in 2003 in the areas of
revenue and customs administration, expenditure management and budgeting, and national
accounts and fiscal statistics.

- 17 -

C. Ex-Post Assessment and Future Fund Involvement
26.
The authorities broadly agreed with the EPA. They indicated that the key issue of
improving the political situation would be addressed in the context of the government’s
emphasis on good governance and transparency. They would also strengthen fiscal
management further, while reducing regulations to minimize possibilities for corruption. The
judiciary would be strengthened and transparency would be increased, including by reviving
consultation mechanisms with social partners and civil society. They acknowledged that
progress in these areas would also be crucial for promoting the much needed resumption of
foreign assistance, as donors would require strong proof that the causes of the poor results of
past support were being addressed. They welcomed close international monitoring of, and
technical assistance in, these areas.
27.
The authorities preferred an early return to a PRGF arrangement, so that
interim debt relief could be resumed and progress made toward the HIPC Initiative’s
completion point.15 However, given the negative experience with the 2000-03 arrangement,
they acknowledged that it would be important to first build implementation capacity for a
PRGF-supported program. Nevertheless, they felt that a financial program with the Fund
would be crucial because of the urgent financial needs and its expected catalytic effect on
other assistance. In this regard, they agreed with the recommendation in the EPA that
renewed emergency post-conflict assistance (EPCA) would be the best option (Box 4).

15

In addition to the implementation of a number of key policies and measures (Appendix
IV), attainment of the completion point requires—reflecting Guinea-Bissau’s interrupted
record of performance—the completion of one review of a PRGF-supported program,
covering a period of policy implementation of at least six months immediately before the
completion point.

- 18 -

Box 4. Renewed Access under EPCA to Guinea-Bissau
Guinea-Bissau made purchases under the EPCA in September 1999 and January 2000
for an amount equivalent to 25 percent of quota, but failed to successfully make the
transition from EPCA to a PRGF arrangement. This reflected the fact that the conflict
reemerged after the initiation of the EPCA and did not end until the military coup in September
2003 (though recent events suggest that the conflict may be still ongoing). This was also due to
the fact that Guinea-Bissau continued to lack the institutional and administrative capacity
necessary to develop and implement a comprehensive economic program that could be
supported by a Fund arrangement. Despite the adverse consequences of the weak economic
performance in the past few years and the sizeable buildup of domestic arrears, including to the
civil service, Guinea-Bissau has remained current in its debt service obligations to the Fund,
unlike other external creditors that stopped interim debt relief.
Against this background, renewed Fund support under the EPCA appears to be the most
suitable way for the Fund to support the ongoing UN-led efforts to promote stabilization
in Guinea-Bissau, subject to satisfactory resolution of the recent uprising. Consistent with
the spirit of the Board decision in April 2004, in the context of its discussion of the Fund’s role
in low-income countries, to extend “the length of EPCA-supported programs, in total, to as
long as three years”1 (www.imf.org), the staff proposes to initiate in due course discussions on
an EPCA-supported program covering up to an additional two-year period, for a total of three,
albeit noncontiguous, years. Possible further access to Fund resources under the EPCA would
be restricted to an amount not to exceed a total of 50 percent of quota in outstanding purchases
under the EPCA. Moreover, in order to safeguard Fund resources, there would be a stronger
presumption that renewed access to Fund resources under the EPCA would be tranched.
In considering purchases of EPCA after such an interruption, stronger justification
would be needed than for the earlier purchases, including a more thorough assessment of
the risks to program implementation. Also, to help foster program implementation and to
strengthen assurances to donors, each purchase would be supported by a clear assessment of
Guinea-Bissau’s commitment to reform, and of progress in rebuilding administrative and
program implementation capacity.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Guinea-Bissau has gone through a very difficult time in recent years. With
hindsight, the political-military conflict of 1998-99 did not end in 1999 but reemerged in the
form of political instability in the following years. Consequently, the reforms stalled,
administrative capacity declined further, economic and fiscal problems deepened, and
poverty increased.
29.
The orderly transition from military coup to a government elected on the basis
of a broad reform platform was encouraging, but enormous challenges lie ahead. The
government’s minority status in parliament, next year’s presidential elections, and the painful
measures required by the deep financial problems, will put a heavy burden on the country’s
young democracy, and the political situation can be expected to remain fragile for some time
to come. As discussed in more detail in the EPA, a key cause in Guinea-Bissau’s
development failure during the last thirty years has been the emphasis on policies serving the
interests of the political and military elite in Bissau. In this regard, the staff strongly supports
the combined UN Security Council/ECOSOC mission to Guinea-Bissau of June 2004 in
urging all parties to put the national interest above short-term political considerations.
30.
The government program forms a good basis for addressing Guinea-Bissau’s
economic and financial problems, but the authorities’ ability to implement it remains
uncertain. Initial measures indicate strong commitment to the program’s objectives,
including with regard to restoring rule-based government and good management.
Nevertheless, as shown by the outcome of the recent discussions on public sector wages and
the military uprising, national consensus on the program is still lacking despite its approval
by parliament.
31.
The staff welcomes the initial measures to restore fiscal control, although the
recent increase in the wage bill was disappointing. With regard to the latter, the staff urges
the authorities to seek further offsetting measures, including by rapidly following up on the
civil service census, ensuring that wages are only paid to workers who are actually present.
Staff acknowledges that the scope for substantial revenue and expenditure measures is
limited in the immediate future because of the need to build administrative capacity and to
prepare a public sector reform program. In the meantime, the authorities should continue
strong efforts to find additional resources and to reduce nonessential expenditure.
32.
Medium-term policies will need to focus on strengthening the fiscal position. Tax
administration should be improved and the tax base widened. The public sector wage bill
should be brought under control on a durable basis through public sector reform. Such a
program will require considerable technical assistance to strengthen capacity, as well as
financial support, from donors.
33.
The emphasis of the authorities’ medium-term structural policies on boosting
growth through deregulation and improvements in the investment climate, is

- 20 -

encouraging. While many policies will take time to prepare, the staff recommends that the
still excessive regulation of the economy be reduced rapidly, which is a low cost measure
that could quickly yield results. Membership of the WAEMU has been beneficial to GuineaBissau as it allowed maintaining price and exchange rate stability despite the serious fiscal
problems, but the fixed exchange rate system makes structural reforms all the more important
for maintaining and improving external competitiveness.
34.
Guinea-Bissau’s unsustainable external debt and mounting debt service arrears
can only be addressed in the context of the HIPC Initiative. Until then, the staff
recommends that the authorities continue servicing debt to multilateral institutions so as not
to interrupt ongoing and possible new support, and to resume discussions with other creditors
on interim solutions. In order not to add to the already excessive debt, new assistance should
be mainly in the form of grants.
35.
It is understandable that, four years after the Interim-PRSP, the authorities
prefer to submit a full PRSP without further delay. The staff realizes that it will take time
for Guinea-Bissau to build technical capacity to complete a locally-owned PRSP that covers
all areas expected in such a document. Nevertheless, while detailed costings and a
monitoring system could be included in coming updates, the staff urges the authorities to
ensure that, in addition to prioritization of the policies, the PRSP reflect a broad domestic
consultation process.
36.
Continued strong policy implementation will have to be complemented by
considerable donor support for Guinea-Bissau to be able to solve its problems in a
reasonable timeframe. In view of the weak institutions and technical capacity, substantial
technical assistance will be required in implementing the needed policies. In this regard, the
staff welcomes the strong emphasis of the government program on good governance and
transparency, which is crucial for restoring relations with the donors.
37.
The staff supports the recommendation in the EPA that renewed EPCA would
be the appropriate next step in Fund engagement with Guinea-Bissau. The economic and
financial situation and the disruption of administrative capacity are worse than in 1999–2000
and financial assistance is urgently needed. However, Guinea-Bissau is not expected to be
ready to implement the strong policies that can be supported under the PRGF for some time.
In the interim, EPCA would provide time for donors to fully reengage, alleviate the heavy
burden of debt service to the Fund, and assist the government in strengthening administrative
capacity so as to gradually demonstrate its ability to effectively implement a new PRGF
arrangement. Nevertheless, the recent events indicate that the conflict may be continuing.
Therefore, staff will need to continue to evaluate the situation and complete discussions on
an EPCA-supported program only if it can establish that the recent military uprising has been
satisfactorily resolved and that the government is able to implement the program’s policies.
38.
In view of the broad range of problems, new Fund EPCA can only be successful
in the context of a concerted international effort. As indicated in the EPA, such an effort
should be based on strong donor coordination, and should include the regional institutions

- 21 -

that have been key in assisting the country in maintaining stability over the last twelve
months. The resumption of assistance by the World Bank and the EU, the broad donor
participation in the EEMF, and recent discussions in UN organizations, are positive
indicators for donor interest. Nevertheless, also in light of the recent military uprising, the
extent of a new concerted effort remains to be confirmed in a donor conference, which
should precede the approval of new EPCA.
39.
New external assistance should emphasize institution and capacity building. In
this regard, staff urges the authorities to rapidly seek assistance with the preparation of a
country-wide technical assistance plan. It also supports the authorities’ request for additional
technical assistance in the Fund’s area of competence.
40.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the BCEAO is subject to a full
safeguards assessment. An off-site safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on
July 25, 2001. The assessment concluded that high risks may exist in the financial reporting
framework and recommended an on-site assessment. An on-site safeguards assessment of the
BCEAO was completed on March 5, 2002. BCEAO authorities and Fund staff have reached
an understanding regarding the implementation of key recommendations related to financial
reporting and internal control.

Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement

Guinea-Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with
effect from January 1, 1997. Guinea-Bissau joined the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) in 1997, and the exchange system common to all members of the union is
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Starting
on January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has been pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of
EUR l=CFAF 655.95. On October 29, 2004, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of the SDR
was CFAF 768.49=SDR 1.

Guinea-Bissau: Relations with the World Bank Group
1.
As of August 18, 2004, IDA had approved 28 credits for Guinea-Bissau. Eight credits
had been in the transport and infrastructure sector, three in the energy sector, three for
strengthening the country's management capability (Technical Assistance (TA)/Economic
Management), two for financing urgently needed imports in support of the government's
economic recovery program, one in the agricultural sector, three in the health sector, two in the
education sector, one social sector project, three for structural adjustment, one for economic
rehabilitation and recovery, and one for private sector rehabilitation and development. The total
value of these projects amounts to about US$277.2 million equivalent, of which
US$242.8 million has been disbursed. As of end-July 2004, the undisbursed balance was
US$59.0 million.
Structural adjustment credits
2.
IDA has approved a total of US$ 63.4 million for structural adjustment operations. These
include two Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs), one supplementary SAC, and one Economic
Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC). The SACs supported the government's program in
the areas of economic liberalization and reform of the public administration and public enterprise
sectors, and the ERRC supports peace building following the political unrest, promotes the
revival of the economy and encourages the pursuit of reforms. Parallel financing of the SACs
came from Switzerland (US$5.3 million equivalent), the Saudi Fund for development
(US$3.2 million equivalent), the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(US$5.3 million equivalent), the African Development Fund (US$ 23.3 million equivalent), the
Netherlands (US$7.5 million equivalent), the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) (US$4.5 million), and Japan (US$2 million equivalent).
Lending program
3.
For the fiscal year (FY) 2005, IDA approved an HIV/AIDS project and has in the
pipeline a Coastal and Biodiversity Management Project. The IDA also proposes to support an
energy and water project during the FY 2005. The World Bank is assisting the country with the
Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative). An Interim Support Strategy
(ISS) is being prepared and is planned for FY2005.
Nonlending program
The Bank prepared a Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003. Bank staff participated, with
the IMF, in the development of an Emergency Economic Management Program (EEMP) toward
end-2003. The Bank will also continue to provide advice on public expenditure management in
the context of upcoming ISS. If all goes well, the Bank will carry out a Poverty Assessment
(PA), and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in FY05. For FY06, the Bank
plans to carry out a Development Policy Review (DPR) and a Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR). The DPR aims to highlight the main economic issues including debt

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

Guinea-Bissau: Statistical Issues
1.
Before the 1998-99 civil war, Guinea Bissau’s statistical database was
comprehensive, but significant weaknesses remained, particularly in the areas of national
accounts, the consumer price index (CPI), and the balance of payments. During the war,
much of the country's computer equipment was severely damaged, and many key technicians
left the country; as a result, data collection was severely impaired, except for trade data and
consumer prices. In early 1999, the authorities made a determined effort to reestablish their
data capacities and were able to recover most information related to production, government
finances, and monetary and balance of payments developments. This recovery was carried
out with the assistance of various institutions, including UN agencies and the World Bank,
which provided equipment and data.
2.
Guinea-Bissau is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its
GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
since November 2001.
Outstanding statistical issues
3.
In March 1994, the International Financial Statistics (IFS) introduced a country page
for Guinea-Bissau. Updates on exchange rates and monetary data are reported in a timely
manner. However, external trade and fiscal sector statistics have not been reported to STA
for publication in the IFS since 1997. Annual national accounts reports have improved, with
current price data being reported up to 2002. However, constant price GDP estimates remain
seriously out of date.
The authorities’ stance on statistical matters
4.
The Guinea-Bissau authorities are aware of the shortcomings of the country’s
database and have been receptive to the staff’s recommendations on how to effect
improvements. They are also committed to making the basic national statistics, publicly
available.
National accounts
5.
Inadequate data sources for national accounts statistics remain the major hurdle to
improving the country’s databases. The GDP aggregate is mostly based on crude
assumptions and coefficients derived from the 1986 benchmark-year estimates. The INEC
has been seriously affected by the armed conflict, and requires substantial technical
assistance to rebuild capacity to compile production statistics. Implementation of the
recommendations of the STA/GDDS mission of March 2003 would provide the foundation
for rebuilding national accounts to a standard that could allow for adequate analysis of real
sector developments in the country.

- 42 -

APPENDIX III

Consumer prices
6.
Since July 2002, an harmonized CPI is compiled, based on the same structure as in
other WAEMU countries. However, the price data are collected only for the capital Bissau.
Government finance
7.
The most recently annual data in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY) are for 1989. Between 2000-02, the authorities made substantial progress in
preparing timely reports on monthly and quarterly budget executions. These fiscal data
reports were widely circulated to relevant national institutions, however, they have not been
prepared since early 2003. Moreover, the quarterly reports are no longer submitted for
publication in IFS. The March 1996 STA mission suggested adjustments to the fiscal data
that would make them suitable for publication in both IFS and the GFSY. There were,
however, setbacks as a result of the armed conflict. To address the main shortcomings, the
authorities requested technical assistance from donors. Since 2002, the French government
has provided two experts to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)—one on
expenditure (this position is vacant since January 2004) and the other providing IT support.
The EU has also financed several experts.
8.
In March and April 2003, two Fund missions from Fiscal Affairs Department of the
IMF—one in revenue administration and the other in expenditure management—visited
Guinea-Bissau to assist the authorities in identifying weaknesses and to make
recommendations to overcome shortcomings in their respective areas. A third mission during
the same period—in the context of the regional GDDS project—made recommendations on
improving fiscal data. Two experts from West AFRITAC visited Bissau in February and
March 2004, to begin implementation of the recommendations of the April 2003 mission on
revenue administration, the first regarding the setting up of a Unit for monitoring of large
enterprises in the Domestic Tax Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF),
and the latter in the area of customs administration. In November 2003, a mission from the
African Department (AFR) of the IMF assisted the authorities with preparing an Emergency
Economic Management Plan and an emergency budget and a treasury cash plan for 2004.
Two AFR missions, in January and March 2004, have provided further assistance in
implementing, updating and monitoring the cash flow plan.
Monetary accounts
9.
Since Guinea-Bissau’s entry in the WAEMU on May 1, 1997, the BCEAO assumes
responsibility for compiling and reporting to STA monetary data for Guinea-Bissau, as is the
practice for other member countries in the Union. Guinea-Bissau has adopted the new
accounting and reporting procedures for monetary and financial statistics in accordance with
the BCEAO’s guidelines. Monthly data on monetary statistics for Guinea Bissau are reported
on a regular basis for publication in IFS, although with some delays. Data for the monetary
authorities and the deposit money banks through May 2004 are published in the September
2004 issue of IFS. The accuracy of monetary statistics is affected by large cross-border

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

movements of currency among BCEAO member countries and delays of up to two years in
their recording.
10.
The monetary and financial statistics mission that visited the headquarters of the
BCEAO in May 2001 provided technical assistance in addressing the main shortcomings
pertaining to coverage, methodology, and timeliness of monetary statistics. The mission
discussed and agreed with the authorities on an action plan for the implementation of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for the introduction of an area-wide
page in IFS for the WAEMU. The new page was subsequently introduced in the January
2003 issue of IFS.
11.
Following the recommendations of the 2001 monetary and financial statistics
mission, a regional seminar on monetary and financial statistics was organized by the
BCEAO in Dakar during April 22-25, 2003. STA staff participated in the seminar.
Participants agreed to set up a working group consisting of representatives from the National
Agencies and various departments of the BCEAO’s headquarters; the working group will
follow up on the implementation of the seminar’s recommendations to foster implementation
of the MFSM.
Balance of payments
12.
Guinea-Bissau reports trade data to AFR for operational purposes using information
from customs. Nevertheless, balance of payments data remain weak, due mostly to
substantial nonregistered trade and inconsistencies between data on net foreign assets as
reported by the BCEAO and other economic indicators. Data on workers’ remittances and
official transfers are available and reliable. The authorities have requested technical
assistance from the Fund to improve their balance of payments statistics. In August 2004, an
AFRISTAT balance of payments expert visited Bissau to assess the priority needs for
technical assistance and assist the authorities with the preparation of a work plan for
improving compilation of balance of payments and international investment position
statistics.
External debt
13.
During the civil war, the computer system processing debt data was severely
damaged, and no progress was made in rehabilitating it. As a result, debt data have not been
compiled since mid-1998. The basis for the current external debt database is the 2000 debt
sustainability analysis, which the authorities have used to keep track of the debt situation.
However, this is an excel-based database and a more sophisticated system is required to
improve day-to-day debt management. Moreover, the Debt Division of the Ministry of
Finance faces serious capacity constraints, both technical and material.
Recent technical assistance in statistics
14.
In March 2003, an STA/AFRISTAT technical assistance mission visited GuineaBissau to assess progress in the implementation of the GDDS project and to identify areas

APPENDIX III

where the Fund, through AFRISTAT, could offer further technical assistance to improve the
country’s national accounts. The mission proposed a two-faceted approach, recommending a
series of short-term and medium-term projects. The short-term proposals include projects to:
(i) carry out a general population census (2002); (ii) establish an index of industrial
production; (iii) establish a price index based on the WAEMU harmonized index; and
(iv) create an internet site for INEC for data dissemination. For the medium-term, the major
recommendation is adoption of the Systems of National Accounts (1993). The mission also
made recommendations for technical assistance: for the short term, it recommended
assistance to build capacity for implementation of the various projects, while for the
medium-term, it recommended assistance in the formation of personnel for the establishment
of the SNA 1993, and acquisition of material and IT needs.

Guinea-Bissau— Progress Toward Meeting the Conditions (Other Than Macroeconomic
Performance) for Achieving the Floating Completion Point Under the HIPC Initiative
PRSP Requirement: prepare a full PRSP and implement it for at least one year.
•

Status: The preparation of the PRSP was delayed because of the unstable political situation and the
need to conduct a new household budget survey. A first draft PRSP, including the results of the
poverty survey of 2002, was finalized in April 2003. A second draft was presented to the government
in March 2004. Elaboration of the macroeconomic framework and costings still need to be finalized.
Moreover, the authorities need to ensure the technical and political internalization, given the lack of
institutional anchorage of the process at present. The process has so far relied mostly on consultants
and there has been limited input from civil society and the government. A comprehensive
consultation involving all elements of society is thus not completed.

Governance Requirements: achieve progress in strengthening public expenditure management, including
the release of comprehensive budget execution reports twice a year, to allow monitoring of expenditure in
social sectors and the military; implement an action plan to reform the public procurement system and
install the new system in all ministries; and submit to parliament the external audit of the 1997-99 budgets
and implement an action plan of corrective measures.
•

Status: The audit of the 1997-99 budgets has been finalized. Substantial progress was made in the
reform of the public procurement system after the civil war but public expenditure management
deteriorated significantly through 2003. Regular reporting of budget execution, and monitoring of
social sector and military expenditure stopped. The public procurement system needs to be rebuilt.

Social sectors and structural reforms Requirements: eliminate fees for school books for all primary
education students (grades 1-4); implement the basic education action plan and increase the gross primary
school enrollment ratio to 61 percent; implement the National Health Development Program, and fully
vaccinate at least 40 percent of children under one year; adopt a plan to fight against malaria; adopt a
strategy to fight against HIV/AIDS; make at least 50 percent of the risk population (ages 14-29) aware of
transmission risks and prevention methods.
•

Status: Gross enrolment rate in primary education is estimated at 90 percent, exceeding the goal of
61 percent. This is a direct result of the elimination of tuition fees in primary education in 2002.
Progress on the implementation of the basic education plan is uneven. Classroom construction and
textbook distribution have progressed, but teacher training and capacity building activities have
lagged. A thorough progress report on the implementation of the basic education action plan is being
prepared; the recent multiple indicators cluster survey shows that only 11.4 percent of children under
one year are fully vaccinated; World Bank support to the NHDP is focusing on basic service delivery
programs; a strategic framework for the fight against HIV/AIDS is under preparation; latest data
show that only 12 percent of 15-49 years old women are aware of HIV/AIDS prevention methods.

Demobilization program: Requirement: complete the demobilization of 5,000 soldiers and reinsert former
combatants into civilian life as established in the demobilization and reinsertion program (PDRRI)
supported by the World Bank and other donors.
•

Status: An audit to assess the eligibility of combatants for the program was completed in 2001 and
the demobilization of 4,392 soldiers was finalized in mid-September 2002. Preparations for the third
phase—reinsertion of the demobilized combatants—were delayed by the suspension of
disbursements by donors. In 2003, the World Bank disbursed CFAF 2.3 billion, including CFAF 800
million in the context of a restructuring of its portfolio in Guinea-Bissau, to ensure continuity in the
program. In February 2004, it disbursed the remaining tranche of CFAF 3.6 billion under the
program.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 19, 2004
This statement contains information that has become available since the Staff Report was
circulated to the Executive Board on November 3, 2004. This information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The political situation remains fragile after the recent military mutiny. There
have been no further incidents since early October. A main demand of the soldiers—the
second payment for peace-keeping duty in Liberia—was met. However, recent nominations
to the top posts in the Armed Forces included officers who acted as spokesmen for the
mutineers, raising doubts about the distribution of political power between the Armed Forces
and the government. The Economic Community of West African States and the Community
of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP) have established permanent representations in
Bissau to support ongoing intermediation efforts; the CPLP is also supporting efforts to
identify the need for military reform.
2.
The revisions in the public sector wage scales in recent months are estimated to
have resulted in an almost doubling of base wages, which was partly offset by
eliminating non-wage benefits. In order to reduce tensions caused by unfulfilled promises
made by the previous government, the authorities agreed to raise civil service salaries by an
average of 67 percent and military wages by an average of 200 percent (bringing them
broadly in line with similar positions in the civil service). Preliminary estimates of the net
effect, including the offsetting measures, indicate that personnel costs would be more than
3 percent of GDP (€ 7.5 million) higher in 2005 than in 2004.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation
with Guinea-Bissau
On November 19, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau.1
Background
Guinea-Bissau’s per capita income of US$185 and its ranking among the ten lowest countries
on the Human Development Index place it among the poorest countries of the world. Following
independence in 1974, centrally planned policies led to high external debt, inefficient public
enterprises, and stagnating economic growth. Structural reforms toward a market-oriented
economy in the mid-1990s were supported by a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) (1993–1994)
and under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) (1995–1998). Despite good
economic progress during that period, serious governance issues led to an armed conflict
during 1998–99 that caused widespread destruction. In 1999 and 2000, the Fund assisted the
authorities’ post-war reconstruction effort through Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA).
The EPCA was succeeded by a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF), which was approved by the Executive Board in December 2000. At that
time, Guinea-Bissau also reached the decision point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. However, the PRGF-supported program went off-track in early 2001
and expired at end-2003 without the IMF concluding a review, and interim debt relief of the
Fund stopped after 2001.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Guinea-Bissau’s economic performance has weakened substantially in recent years. Real GDP
declined by 7 percent in 2002 and was flat in 2003. Structural reforms stalled after the war and
the private sector remained incapacitated because of the destruction of equipment and
infrastructure caused by the conflict, and the loss of stocks due to confiscating and looting. This
situation was exacerbated by donors’ decision to suspend budgetary support, including for two
key post-conflict programs—demobilization and re-insertion of ex-soldiers (PDRRI) and
clearance of domestic supplier arrears (DASP)—after the PRGF-supported program went offtrack and amid serious governance concerns.
The fiscal situation has deteriorated drastically in recent years. Following an initial windfall after
the conflict, revenue declined as the economy stagnated, prices fell for the main export product,
cashew nuts, and technical capacity in revenue collection weakened. Public sector employment
increased sharply after the conflict, which was compounded by a general wage increase in
2000, and expenditure management weakened amidst increasing extra budgetary expenditure.
As a result, in addition to external arrears, the budget started accumulating domestic arrears,
including, especially after mid-2002, in wages.
In 2003, the external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, halved relative to the
previous year, to 6.7 percent of GDP, reflecting higher cashew nut exports and stagnating
imports. The terms of trade deteriorated slightly (by 1.5 percent) in 2003, owing mainly to higher
import prices for petroleum products. Due to low domestic inflation, the real effective exchange
rate depreciated slightly.
Guinea-Bissau is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and
monetary and exchange rate policy is conducted at the regional level for the zone as a whole.
The Central Bank for West African States (BCEAO) reduced the discount rate from 6.5 percent
since 2002 to 4.5 percent in March 2004, in response to the fall in inflation, the decline in
interest rates in the euro area, and its high level of international reserves. Two main banks did
not reopen after the conflict, and Guinea-Bissau has just one bank, operating out of its only
office in Bissau.
Guinea-Bissau remains one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world. Interim debt
relief under the HIPC Initiative was halted by most creditors after the PRGF-supported program
went off-track; however, the African Development Bank and the World Bank continue to provide
interim debt relief. There are no arrears to the IMF, but debt service to most bilateral creditors
continues to fall in arrears.
Executive Board Assessment
Guinea-Bissau faces enormous challenges in embarking on a path of sustained growth and
poverty reduction in the face of deep-seated economic and social problems. Directors
welcomed Guinea-Bissau’s orderly transition in May 2004 to a government elected on the basis
of a broad reform platform, which offers the best prospect in recent years for an effective return
to normal economic activity.

-3Directors noted that continued political instability, as evidenced by the recent military rebellion,
as well as adverse exogenous shocks, have contributed to depressed economic activity,
widespread poverty and deteriorating social indicators, and increased macroeconomic
imbalances. In addressing these problems, the key challenges for the Guinea-Bissau authorities
in the period ahead will be to restore fiscal discipline, rebuild public administration, and improve
the climate for private investment and economic diversification. Meeting these challenges will
require a combination of peace, firm commitment to sound policies by the authorities, improved
governance and transparency, and the technical and financial support of the international
community.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the new government’s economic program for
2004-08, which they considered a good basis for beginning to address Guinea-Bissau’s
problems. They endorsed the program’s focus on strengthening the fiscal position and pursuing
structural reforms to boost growth and reduce poverty. They were encouraged by the
authorities’ commitment to the program, as evidenced by the initial progress made in restoring
rules-based fiscal management.
Directors considered that expenditure control will be a key element of the fiscal effort in the
short term. While acknowledging the importance of clearing tensions with unions and the
military left by inadequate past policies, they expressed concern that the recent large increase
in the budget’s wage bill risks new arrears, could further squeeze already very low poverty
reduction expenditure, and complicate relations with donors, who had provided emergency
budget support earlier in 2004. Directors urged the authorities to seek further offsetting
measures, including by rapidly following up on the civil service census to remove ghost workers
from the payroll. Expenditure also needs to be re-oriented to priority areas.
Directors agreed that priority should be given to rebuilding public administration and restoring
basic public services. Strengthening revenue administration and broadening the tax base as
well as better expenditure management will be key elements in this effort, to be followed by the
preparation and implementation of a comprehensive public sector reform program. In the
meantime, the authorities should continue strong efforts to find additional resources and to
reduce nonessential expenditure.
Directors welcomed the emphasis in the government’s medium-term policies on boosting
economic growth through structural reform. They stressed the need for rapid deregulation of the
economy, which would be a low-cost measure yielding quick results. Deregulation and other
structural reform will help strengthen Guinea-Bissau’s external competitiveness in the context of
the fixed exchange rate system of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. Other key
reforms will be improving the investment code, strengthening the legal system, pursuing the
privatization program, and rebuilding the banking system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ track record in remaining current on repayments to the
Fund. Resolution of external debt service arrears will require resumption of debt relief in the
context of the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative).
Directors urged the authorities to engage creditors with the aim of seeking solutions to the
mounting external debt service problems until they can be addressed under the HIPC Initiative.

-4They also urged caution in further borrowing by Guinea-Bissau and increased emphasis on the
use of grant financing.
Directors welcomed the government’s emphasis on the importance of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. They urged the authorities to ensure that the final document is based on broad
domestic consultation, and stressed the importance of prioritization and costing of poverty
programs.
Directors stressed that in order to overcome its serious economic problems in a reasonable
timeframe, Guinea Bissau will need to rely on substantial technical and financial assistance
from the international community. Noting that long-standing governance concerns had resulted
in a sharp decline in such assistance, they urged the authorities to pay particular attention to
implementing the governance-related reforms in their economic program. They also urged the
preparation of a country-wide technical assistance plan.
Directors stressed that the Fund should remain engaged in Guinea-Bissau. Most Directors
agreed that the next step in the Fund’s engagement could be emergency post-conflict
assistance. Considering the breadth of Guinea-Bissau’s problems, such assistance would need
to be part of a concerted international effort. A few Directors considered that, given GuineaBissau’s heavy debt burden and the time that may be needed to build the foundation of a stable
political framework, the issue of whether Fund financial assistance should only be in the form of
a concessional PRGF, possibly preceded by a Staff-Monitored Program, should be given further
consideration.
Directors welcomed the ex post assessment of Guinea-Bissau’s performance under IMFsupported programs. They observed that the country’s experience confirmed the importance of
good governance, proper sequencing of reforms, strong ownership, and political stability for a
successful Fund-supported program. Looking forward, they felt that renewed international
assistance should emphasize institution and capacity building, to which the Fund should stand
ready to contribute in its areas of competence, including fiscal management and
macroeconomic statistics.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Guinea-Bissau
November 19, 2004

Background and recent developments
I would like to express the appreciation of my Guinea-Bissau’s authorities to the staff for the
constructive discussions they had during the 2004 Article IV Consultation, and to Fund
management for its continuous support. My authorities are also grateful for the assistance
received from the international community to complement their own efforts towards
stabilizing the political environment and social conditions.
Since its independence in 1974, after 11 years of war of liberalization, Guinea-Bissau has
experienced continuous periods of political instability and social tensions, which culminated
in an armed conflict in1998-99 and had a severe impact on its economy. In addition to the
death of several thousands people and the displacement of many others, this civil war caused
widespread damage to the housing stock, basic infrastructure, and government buildings and
equipment. Moreover, it has exacerbated poverty and weakened the institutions, as well as
key social indicators, and has destroyed the productive capacity of Guinea-Bissau.
With Fund and UN support in the form of post-conflict assistance, my Guinea-Bissau
authorities took strong measures to address the devastation of the conflic. These measures
involved resettlement of displaced people, and adoption of measures to restore
macroeconomic stability. The good performance achieved enabled Guinea-Bissau to move
to a PRGF-supported arrangement and the country reached the decision point under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative in 2000. Although the new three-year (2000-2003) PRGF
arrangement went off track, the authorities maintained a close cooperation with the Fund and
the World Bank.
More recently, inflation has moderated and the current account deficit narrowed. Moreover,
the authorities have remained current on non reschedulable arrears, notably with the Fund.
With the assistance of the IMF, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, the
authorities have also prepared an emergency economic management program (EEMP) that
aims at restoring fiscal control and allowing a minimum level of operation of the government
and social services until the 2005 presidential elections. A key component of the EEMP was
the preparation and implementation of an emergency budget for 2004. This budget was
prepared on the basis of “minimum needs”. Technical assistance was jointly provided by the
Fund, West AFRITAC, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).
The EEMP and the emergency budget were replaced, in July 2004, by the government
program for 2004-08, and a revised budget for 2004 which was approved by parliament.
Following these measures, expenditure control has been strengthened, although revenue
remained well below expectations due to weak administrative capacity. Moreover, fishing
rights from the EU, another important source of revenue, which yields 20 percent of revenue,
were delayed. In the external sector, while imports declined, the export of cashew nut
increased, such that the current account balance improved in 2003.

-2My authorities recognize the importance of establishing more stable conditions in the
country, in order to lay the foundation for a broad-based economic growth, necessary to
reduce poverty. This will allow them to repair the remaining damage from the conflict,
restore fiscal sustainability and basic social services, and reduce widespread poverty.
I would like to reassure Directors of the determination of my authorities to improve the
political environment. Indeed, the recent tragic event of October army mutiny ended with the
signing of an accord between the government and the army mutineers who rose up over
unpaid salaries. In addition, it is worth noting that the support received from the
international community, notably the UN, the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries has been critical to
accompany the authorities’ efforts in this area. Moreover, my authorities are determined to
pursue further the adjustment process and the building of institutional capacity, in order to
establish a strong track record on program implementation. However, the tasks ahead
represent a daunting challenge that Guinea-Bissau cannot meet without an urgent support
from the international community in terms of technical and financial assistance.
Medium-term Outlook and Policies
The authorities agree with the staff that it will be important to rebuild the administration and
avoid further domestic budgetary arrears, while laying the basis for higher economic growth.
Real GDP is estimated to increase by 1-2 percent in 2004 and by around 3 percent in 2005.
Inflation is expected to remain within the WAEMU’s target of less than 3 percent by end of
2004. Reflecting low imports in the first half of the year, the external current account
balance, including official transfers, is projected to become slightly positive in 2004.
In the fiscal area, the authorities are committed to restoring administrative capacity and rulebased fiscal management. Thus, in order to defuse social tensions in the country, high
priority will be given to paying government salaries on time. This would help build trust and
credibility of the institutions. In addition, the authorities have planned to pay electricity bill
monthly to allow the administration to restart basic operations.
On structural reforms, my authorities are committed to pursue the agenda initiated under the
PRGF. Notably, they will strengthen the organization of ministries, following a review of the
respective laws. They have taken measures to improve financial management, including
centralizing all revenue in the treasury account at the BCEAO; and applying public
procurement regulations. Also noteworthy is that political appointees had been replaced by
experienced technicians at the head of revenue departments.
As regards expenditure, the authorities agreed to conduct a civil servant survey, which should
contribute to contain the wage bill. Moreover, it is the Guinea Bissau’s intention to
harmonize salaries across the public sector.
The authorities’ main medium-term objectives are: accelerating economic growth, reducing
poverty, and stabilizing the fiscal situation. In this regard, actions towards revitalizing the
private sector are needed. They agreed that the successful implementation of both short- and
medium-term policies would require considerable technical assistance. In the structural
reform agenda, the authorities will focus on improving the legal system and investment

-3regulations, reducing inefficient taxes and regulations, and completing the privatization
program.
On the financial sector, the recent decision by WAEMU relaxing the capital requirement for
Guinea-Bissau will facilitate the creation of new banks, including microfinance institutions.
Guinea-Bissau has an unsustainable external debt position. The difficult financial and
economic situation has made it difficult to service its debts. It is the intention of the
authorities to work closely with the Fund and implement the needed policies, so that it can
receive support under the PRGF, and also move to the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative.
PRSP
As regards the PRSP, the authorities are determined to finalize the document and to submit it
to the Fund and the World Bank soon. The authorities are committed to ensure that the final
PRSP is based on a broad domestic consultation process, with a view to promoting a
participatory process and ownership in setting the direction of poverty reduction policies.
Conclusion
My authorities would like to reiterate their firm commitment to restoring economic and
social stability. They are firmly committed to the adjustment process, which they view as
critical to improving the macroeconomic framework and poverty situation in Guinea-Bissau.
As such, they look forward to an early consideration by the Fund’s Board of a post-conflict
program.
