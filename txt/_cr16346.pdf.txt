IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Argentina
On November 9, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with Argentina.1
Upon taking office in December last year, Argentina’s new government faced pervasive
macroeconomic imbalances, microeconomic distortions, and a weakened institutional
framework. Confronted with this difficult situation, the authorities began an ambitious and
much needed transition toward a better economic policy. Important progress has been made
already in 2016. The peso is now market determined and exchange controls have been
essentially eliminated. The increase in utility tariffs has brought prices more in line with
underlying costs. The settlement with creditors has allowed a return to international capital
markets by both the private and public sector. Medium-term fiscal and inflation targets have
been announced in conjunction with a transition toward a modern system of inflation
targeting. Finally, the national statistics agency is being rebuilt, allowing for the publication
of improved and credible statistics.
The reversal of the serious imbalances and distortions inherited from the previous
administration, while necessary to lay the foundation for robust future growth, unavoidably
had an adverse near-term impact on the Argentine economy. However, the current recession
had begun even before the new administration took office and the alternative of continuing
with the unsustainable policy framework of the past administration was simply not tenable,
as it would have eventually led to a repeat of Argentina’s history of crisis, contraction, and
social distress. The economy is expected to rebound from a -1.8 percent recession in 2016 to
a 2.7 percent growth in 2017, and to grow at a close to 3 percent pace over the medium term.
A modest headwind from the planned fiscal rebalancing should be offset by a pickup in
private consumption (as inflation continues to fall), an improving external environment, and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. The last Article IV Consultation with
Argentina took place about 10 years ago, in July 2006.

a rebound of private investment. With strong policy action and dramatic changes underway
in the Argentine economy, the outlook is subject to greater than normal uncertainty.
Against this background, the central focus of the Article IV Consultation was on the best way
to restore sustained and equitable growth, boost job creation, and protect the poor from the
costs of restoring macroeconomic stability
The government has been clear in its commitment to bring inflation to single digit levels by
2019, and has maintained real interest rates broadly constant in positive territory while
lowering the policy rate since Spring this year as forward looking indicators of inflation
began to fall. A tight control of spending growth in the first few months of the year is
expected to allow the federal government to meet the primary fiscal deficit objective for 2016
(4.8 percent of GDP), despite injecting some fiscal stimulus in the second half of the year.
The 2017 Budget envisages a modest reduction of the primary federal fiscal deficit for next
year, to 4.2 percent of GDP, mainly on account of further cuts of energy subsidies. Over the
last few months, progress on structural reforms has occurred in the areas of governance,
anti-corruption, competition policies, and financial market infrastructure, but supply-side
bottlenecks remain that might impede a faster rebound of private investment and
productivity.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors strongly welcomed Argentina’s resumption of the Article IV
consultation and underscored the importance of close engagement between the authorities
and staff going forward.
Directors commended the ambitious reforms taken by the new administration to ensure a
more stable and sustainable economic policy framework. They cautioned that reversing the
legacy of severe macroeconomic imbalances, pervasive microeconomic distortions, and a
weakened institutional framework will take time, but noted that important progress has been
achieved by the authorities. While the measures taken have had a negative short-term impact
on economic activity, the Argentinian economy is expected to rebound in 2017. Directors
encouraged the authorities to remain steadfast in their reform efforts and reach out to
stakeholders to secure broad support.
Directors stressed that continuing to lower the fiscal deficit is an important part of the
adjustment. They noted that the pace and composition of rebalancing should be sensitive to
its impact on growth, jobs, and the most vulnerable segments of the population, while
maintaining clear medium-term objectives. In this context, Directors broadly saw the gradual
reduction of the fiscal deficit envisaged by the authorities to be appropriate. At the same
time, some Directors considered that the pace of deficit reduction could be accelerated if
economic activity was stronger than expected, including to facilitate the reduction of
inflation.

3

Directors emphasized the importance of institutional reforms to improve the efficiency and
credibility of the fiscal framework. These reforms include introducing a simple and
transparent medium-term fiscal policy plan; rationalizing government spending, including the
wage bill; removing poorly targeted and distortionary energy subsidies; and restoring
financial sustainability to the pension system. Directors also noted the need to make the tax
system more progressive over time to reduce the tax burden and make the system more
efficient. They also highlighted the importance of addressing issues related to fiscal
federalism.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to bring down inflation to single digits. They
broadly agreed that the pace at which inflation is reduced should remain attuned to its
economic costs and distributional impact. Directors emphasized that building credibility in
the monetary framework—in particular, establishing a clear price stability mandate for the
central bank and securing its operational independence, and eliminating monetary financing
of the deficit—will lessen the economic and social costs of disinflation.
Directors called for an ambitious agenda of supply-side reforms to improve the business
climate and achieve strong, sustained and equitable growth. They noted that priorities include
promoting competition, putting in place a better regulatory framework for energy and
utilities, fully realigning utility tariffs toward cost recovery, and instituting a transfer scheme
to protect the poor. Measures to gradually improve the quality of infrastructure, lower trade
barriers, and develop local capital markets would also help. Directors welcomed recent
progress to fight corruption, scale back government involvement in private industries, and
create a better governance framework.

KEY ISSUES
An inherited legacy of imbalances. Upon taking office in December last year,
Argentina’s new government faced pervasive macroeconomic imbalances,
microeconomic distortions, and a weakened institutional framework. These
encompassed unsustainably high consumption levels, historically low levels of
investment, and large fiscal deficits financed by money creation, which led to high
inflation. Distortions at the micro level included an extensive network of administrative
controls (for example, trade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, and price controls)
and a business environment that eroded competitiveness and undermined mediumterm growth. There was also an important weakening of the institutional framework for
economic policymaking, perhaps most evident in the loss of credibility of the national
statistics agency.
Initial policy steps. Confronted with this difficult situation, the new government began
an ambitious and much needed transition toward a better economic policy framework,
reversing the serious macroeconomic imbalances and microeconomic distortions
inherited from the previous government. Important progress has been made. The peso
is now market determined, and foreign exchange controls have essentially been
eliminated. The increase in utility tariffs has brought prices more in line with underlying
costs. The settlement with creditors has allowed a return to international capital
markets by both the private and public sectors. Medium-term fiscal and inflation
targets have been announced in conjunction with a transition toward a modern system
of inflation targeting. Finally, the national statistics agency is being rebuilt, allowing for
the publication of improved and credible data on inflation, trade, the labor market, and
output.
Prospects. The reversal of the serious imbalances and distortions inherited from the
previous administration, while necessary to lay the foundation for robust future growth,
unavoidably had an adverse near-term impact on the Argentine economy. However, the
alternative of continuing with the unsustainable policy framework of the past
administration was simply not tenable, as it would have eventually led to a repeat of
Argentina’s history of crisis, contraction, and social distress. The economy is expected to
emerge from recession in 2017 and grow at a close to 3 percent pace over the medium
term. A gradual rebound of private investment is forecasted as fiscal imbalances and
inflation are reduced and supply side reform proceeds. High gross external financing
needs and an overly backward looking process for wage inflation represent negative

ARGENTINA

risks to the outlook. However, the better policy framework could trigger a stronger
rebound in private investment creating an important upside for growth.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The way forward for Argentina is to restore balance to the
fiscal accounts and deploy monetary policy to steadily bring down inflation. Getting the
balance right in this policy mix will be complex but critical. Frontloading the reduction
of the fiscal deficit to the extent allowed by the current economic, political, and social
constraints would allow for a more accelerated reduction in interest rates, ease the
upward pressure on the real exchange rate, improve the public debt dynamics, and
facilitate the needed rebalancing from consumption to investment.
Institutional reforms. Rebuilding the institutional framework for good policies will
significantly ease the economic cost of the transition. This includes securing the
operational independence of the central bank and anchoring expectations through
simple and transparent medium-term fiscal objectives. Strengthening public
expenditure management and increasing the efficiency of public spending would create
space for a needed reduction of the tax burden and for measures to alleviate the
impact of the transition on the poor. Supply-side priorities include putting in place a
better regulatory framework for energy and utilities, fully realigning utility tariffs toward
cost recovery, and instituting a transfer scheme to protect the poor. There is also a
broader need to scale back government involvement in private industries and creating
a better governance framework, including by making further progress on the
government’s ambitious anti-corruption plans. Such a set of policies will create an
environment that is more conducive to private investment and will generate significant
medium-term dividends in terms of more and better jobs as well as a steady
improvement in the living standards for Argentina’s population.

increasingly interventionist role of the
government and important relative price
distortions, were eating into growth potential.
2.
Faced with declining growth prospects, the government supported the economy
through expansionary macroeconomic policies. A tailwind of high commodity prices and strong
demand for Argentine exports, particularly from China, helped. Despite this, macroeconomic
imbalances grew as sizable primary surpluses turned to deficit, and monetary financing pushed
inflation upwards (although official statistics showed unrealistically low inflation). By 2012, the terms
of trade moved against Argentina revealing the full extent of the underlying imbalances that
included an overvalued real exchange rate, high inflation, and a steady decline in international
reserves. To hold together the inconsistent and unsustainable policy mix, the authorities
progressively deepened administrative controls, including trade barriers, foreign exchange (FX)
controls (which led to a parallel exchange market), price controls, and pervasive distortions in both
markets and incentives. Even with these efforts, the economy moved into recession in late 2015 with
inflation ending the year at 27 percent (based on the City of Buenos Aires CPI).

TRANSITION

In the first few months of the new administration, bold steps were taken to:



Remove the various FX controls and let the exchange rate float, unifying the official and parallel
exchange markets, and correcting the overvaluation of the peso through a 40 percent
depreciation of the official rate in December 2015.



Announce a plan of fiscal consolidation to reach a zero primary balance by 2019.



Announce an inflation target of 20–25 percent for end-2016, falling to 5 percent by end-2019,
and begin the transition towards an
inflation-targeting regime.
Debt Issuance in International Markets



Regain access to international capital
markets by reaching a settlement with
creditors. This allowed the federal
government, provinces and private
corporations to issue about US$37.8 billion
in bonds in global markets so far in 2016

The new data released by INDEC also show that about 23 percent of Argentine households (about
2 million) lives below the poverty line, with their income being on average about 37 percent below the
poverty threshold (12,850 pesos or about US$900 per month). About 5 percent of households lives in
extreme poverty, with an income that on average is 40 percent below the threshold (4,930 pesos or
about US$350 per month). The geographical distribution shows that poverty is particularly high in the
Northeast of the country, where the household poverty rate is about 30 percent, compared to slightly
below 20 percent in the southern (Patagonica) region. The poverty picture is particularly worrisome
when looking at the age distribution, with about 47½ of children living in poverty and nearly one in
ten children in extreme poverty. By contrast, only 8 percent of the elderly population lives in poverty.
While different national definitions and data
availability make it difficult to compare poverty
rates across countries, based on official indicators
Argentina’s rate is among the highest in the
region. Based on standardized World
Bank/CEDLAS estimates of poverty rates (defined
as the share of population living with less than
US$4 per day) reveals that, using this definition,
in 2014 poverty in Argentina was higher than in
Chile and Uruguay but lower than Brazil, Mexico,
Peru, and Colombia.

These measures, while necessary to lay the foundation for robust future growth,
inevitably had an adverse impact on the Argentine economy which had already began to
contract in the last quarter of 2015. The peso depreciation and increase in utility prices have

headwinds arose from weak trading partner
demand, notably Brazil, and bad weather conditions. It is important to emphasize that the measures
that were taken were indispensable. While the exact form of the counterfactual is difficult to predict,
failing to address the unsustainable path that the Argentine economy was on would have led to
even worse outcomes that have been all-too-familiar to Argentina—potentially a run on local
currency assets, spiraling inflation, an abrupt fiscal adjustment as financing sources were exhausted,
and/or a depletion of foreign exchange reserves and balance of payments crisis.

across the country, relative to November 2015. Tarifa social
introduced for low-income segments of the population, in addition to
150 kWh of free electricity per month for poor households. Public
transport tariffs also increased, with uncertain fiscal savings given
increased fuel cost to government for service provision. In August
2016, the Supreme Court ruled for a reversal of the increase in
residential natural gas tariffs, bearing a fiscal cost of about 0.2
percent of GDP in 2016. The government has since announced a 3year plan to phase out natural gas tariffs by 2019, with the exception
of the tarifa social that will be maintained. The estimated fiscal savings

Current account and REER assessment. Although there is considerable uncertainty about any
estimated range, the real exchange rate appears modestly above the level implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies. The CA-regression approach of External Balance Assessment
(EBA) yields a cyclically-adjusted CA norm of about -1 percent of GDP. The desirable fiscal stance
subsumed in this estimate is based on a reduction of the overall general government fiscal deficit by
about 4 percent of GDP over the medium term (consistent with the authorities’ announced fiscal
consolidation plans and staff’s baseline). The assessment also assumes an increase in the FX reserves
over the medium term to around US$70 billion. With a 2016 cyclically-adjusted CA deficit of about
2¾ percent of GDP, the current account gap is estimated to be about -1½ percent of GDP. To a
considerable extent, this CA gap is explained by the fiscal and FX reserves policy gaps. The external

Argentina’s financial system appears resilient to the ongoing macroeconomic
transition. Argentina’s financial system is mostly transactional and has generally low exposure to
credit or exchange rate risk. Banks are well capitalized (total and tier 1 capital ratios are well
above regulatory minimums at 16.2 and 15.3 percent, respectively, as of June 2016), have low
non-performing loans (under 2 percent), and relatively large provisions (above 140 percent of
nonperforming loans). The liquidity position of the banks appears comfortable, with the liquidity
coverage ratio in 2016 well exceeding the minimum set by the Basel Committee. Currency

The administration’s approval ratings
remain high although the political climate is
becoming more challenging. Despite the economic
recession, the government’s approval rating remains
above levels seen during the previous
administration, and is one of the highest in Latin
America. However, the government does not have
a majority in Congress, and passage of legislation
is likely to become increasingly complex in the runup to the October 2017 congressional and
gubernatorial elections. A weak economy and high
poverty rates are likely to influence the
congressional discussion of the 2017 Budget, and
high inflation is likely to be at the forefront in the
next round of collective wage negotiations (that is
about to get underway).

Corporate Debt

mismatches are low and banks have an aggregate
net long FX position which limits risks from a sudden
currency depreciation.2 Corporate leverage is
generally low since companies mostly lacked access
to external funding and the domestic financial
system is small. Household debt is also relatively
low.

Sources: UTDT and Poliarquia.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The economy is expected to emerge from recession in late 2016 as the one-off impact
of the initial measures to remove macroeconomic distortions begins to fade. Staff is now
forecasting growth of -1¾ percent for 2016 as a whole rising to 2¾ percent in 2017, one of the
largest growth turnaround in the October 2016 World Economic Outlook. A modest headwind from
the planned reduction of the fiscal deficit should be offset by a pickup in private consumption, an
improving external environment, and a rebound of private investment. Over the medium term,
growth is expected to average around 3 percent as reforms are put in place to strengthen the
business environment, encourage investment, lower inflation, and restore order to fiscal finances.
However, data challenges and the uncertain process of Argentina’s transition away from its
previously unsustainable path create significant uncertainty in the outlook.

2

Banks’ gross FX position is also low as it represents around 17.6 percent of assets and 17.7 percent of liabilities
(data as of July 2016). Much of the FX assets are very liquid (deposits at the BCRA and cash), with 29.3 percent
corresponding to FX loans. But banks can only grant FX loans to those who actually have FX income (mainly
exporters) which significantly reduces risks from a depreciation of the peso.

Inflation will continue to decline at a slow pace due to a relatively high degree of
inertia in the determination of wages and prices. Inflation has decelerated sharply since its peak
in April, as the pass-through from the exchange rate depreciation and the effects of the tariff
adjustment have dissipated. In August and September 2016, official headline inflation was affected
by the reversal of the increase in natural gas tariffs, which subtracted about 0.7 percentage points to
the index values in both months. Core inflation continued to decline and reached 1½ percent (m/m)

The primary federal deficit is expected to fall to 4½ percent of GDP in 2017, a close to

Some stylized facts. Nominal wages grew
at a much faster pace than inflation after the
2001 crisis, allowing real wages to return to
pre-crisis levels by 2005. Since then, real
wages have been relatively sticky despite
recessions in 2009 and 2012. Persistently
high inflation and inflation expectations
have added to nominal inertia with a wage
setting system that is characterized by
extensive sectoral wage bargaining and a
de-facto high level of wage indexation,
despite the lack of formal backward
indexation.

An inflation model. Estimating a small
macroeconomic model for Argentina reveals a relatively high degree of persistence in nominal wage
growth, inflation, and inflation expectations. Real wages appear to respond relatively weakly to
changes in real activity:

𝑤̇ 𝑡 = 0.96𝑤̇ 𝑡−1 + 0.13𝑔𝑡 + 𝜖𝑤̇,𝑡
where 𝑝̇𝑡 is inflation rate, 𝑝̇𝑡𝑒 inflation expectations, 𝑤̇𝑡 nominal wage growth, 𝑟𝑡 the real interest rate,

Model performance and forecasts. The
estimated model seems to fit relatively well
Argentina’s inflation dynamics over the last
decade. Simulating the model forward, shows
inflation declining from 39 percent at
end-2016 to 20 percent in 2017. This would be
accompanied by a further 3¾ percent real
appreciation of the peso and 2.7 percent
growth in 2017. Using this same model,
reducing inflation to 17 percent by end-2017
(the upper end of the central bank’s target
band) would require a 400 basis point increase
in the path of real interest rates during the
course of this year and next, and would result
in a one percentage point lower growth in real
activity in 2017 relative to staff’s baseline.

accumulate international reserves from current low levels (to 100 percent of the IMF’s reserve
adequacy metric by mid-2018). The reserve accumulation will be largely as a result of converting the
proceeds of government external debt issuance into pesos, consistent with the authorities’
commitment to let the exchange rate float freely under the inflation targeting (IT) regime.
15.
The outlook is subject to a greater than usual degree of uncertainty but risks appear
broadly balanced around the baseline. Argentina is in a process of significant transition to a more
market-based economic framework and is simultaneously working to rebuild the statistical
information about their economy. The lack of a reliable statistical time series for certain data and the
unpredictable consequences of changes in relative prices, the removal of distortions, and a
reopening of the economy to international capital flows all add to the uncertainty around future
economic outcomes.
16.
Upside risks. Staff’s baseline scenario is subject to a number of upside risks (Risk
Assessment Matrix Table):


A faster rebound in private investment. Argentine companies have relatively low levels of
leverage and have neglected investing in new capacity and technologies over the past several
years (in large part due to the distortions and policy interventions that the economy faced).
Indeed, as of 2015, investment in Argentina is the lowest as a share of output when compared to
other economies in Latin America. Under staff’s baseline, the investment rate is expected to pick
up gradually over time, consistent with a study of past cases of investment rebounds in

Paper). However, with Argentina reGross Fixed Capital Formation

and to disinflate the economy with relatively
modest output costs.


A more successful tax amnesty. Increased disclosure and information sharing requirements across
tax jurisdictions have the potential to create strong incentives to declare assets under the tax
amnesty. This would lead to more tax revenues and, insofar as offshore funds of residents are
repatriated into government bonds, would meet some of the budget financing needs.



A stronger than expected recovery in Brazil. The October 2016 World Economic Outlook assumes
Brazil’s growth to rebound to 0.5 percent in 2017 after the 3.3 percent contraction in 2016. Brazil
accounts for about 20 percent of overall Argentina’s exports and 50 percent of its manufacturing
exports, so each 1 percentage point increase in Brazil’s growth above the 2017 forecast would
add an estimated ¼ percentage points to Argentina’s growth.

17.
Downside risks. The gradual pace at which macroeconomic imbalances are resolved leaves
Argentina vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks:


18

A tightening of external financial conditions. Given the significant gross external borrowing needs
of the government, an exogenous tightening of global capital markets could prove very
disruptive. At best, a higher cost of financing would worsen debt dynamics and necessitate a
stronger fiscal correction over the medium term. At worst, a sudden stop to external borrowing
(e.g., owing to higher global risk aversion) could create financing shortfalls. With limited
recourse to domestic financing, this could necessitate a more front-loaded fiscal adjustment at a
time when external demand would also likely be weakening. Such a downside would create
depreciation pressures on the currency and cause the central bank to react procyclically to
contain inflation. The relatively high share of short-term foreign currency debt in a few
non-financial private sector industries also poses rollover risks (see Annex I).

A reassessment of global risk leads to portfolio rebalancing, lowering

availability of funding of Argentina's fiscal needs through external
bond issuances and repatriation of funds by non-bank domestic
private sector. Domestic financial sector's funding could increase, but
given its small size it would not be able to meet the gross financing
needs of the federal government (11 percent of GDP in 2017).

Upward pressures on inflation emerge because of higher wage
growth and/or higher persistence in inflation and/or stronger second
round effects from increase in tariffs. The currency could become
more overvalued, and expectations of a future depreciation might
increase, which would fuel inflation expectations and lower the
demand for the peso.

Facing a wage-price spiral and the risk of a
run on the peso, the central bank should
react by increasing interest rates. A faster
reduction of the fiscal deficit may also be
needed to immediately reduce inflationary
pressures.

Medium

High
Continued appreciation of the currency leads to a worsening of the
current peso misalignment, a deterioration of the external position,
and renewed bouts of balance of payments pressures. A sharp
devaluation of the currency realigns the currency and alleviates the
pressures, leading to a jump in inflation and an immediate
contraction of economic activity with high social costs, as
household’s purchasing power is reduced. High FX exposure of the
public sector can lead to a spike in public sector debt and financing
difficulties.

The central bank would need to increase
interest rates to defend the peso, while fiscal
policy could be tightened and re-oriented to
protect the most vulnerable segments of
society at zero cost for the budget (for
example, though a faster elimination of
energy subsidies, using the resources to fund
means-tested transfers).

Low (in the
short run)

Medium
Weaker activity in China would impact Argentina primarily through
trade channels, including through a negative impact on the terms of
trade, as commodity prices would fall. This would affect especially
soy sector, as about 3/4 of Argentina's soybean exports is destined to
China. Staff estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point decrease in
China's growth would lower Argentina's export growth by 0.4–0.7
percentage points. Slower growth in China would also affect
Argentina indirectly, through its negative impact on the region,
particularly on Brazil.

Medium

‧ The depreciation of the peso would help
the economy adjust to the terms of trade

stances could be relaxed (fiscal policy could

increases by at least one standard deviation of its historical average.

Medium

A stronger recovery of Brazil would have important positive spillover
effects on Argentina's economy. The Brazilian market is especially
relevant for Argentine industrial exports. More than 45 percent of
exports of industrial manufactures go to Brazil. Staff estimates
suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in Brazil's growth would
boost Argentina's export growth by 0.7 percentage points, and has a
peak impact of ¼ percent on Argentina's growth.

Based on a comparison of past experience in Argentina and abroad, it
is assumed that US$30 billion of wealth is declared, generating US$1.9
billion in additional tax revenues and US$2.6 billion in budgetary
financing. However, increased disclosure and information sharing
requirements in foreign banks, particularly in Europe, have the
potential to significantly increase the incentive to declare funds. More
optimistic estimates range between US$40–100 billion. In such an
upside scenario, there would be a pick up in fiscal revenues and less
need for government debt issuance. The smaller crowding out of the
private sector could lead to greater private investment and growth.

greater fiscal revenues and stronger GDP

The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks

depreciation of the real exchange rate would add
about 3½ percent of GDP to the public debt.



Higher and more entrenched inflation. Higher nominal wage increases in the forthcoming
collective wage negotiations and second-round effects from the increase in utilities tariffs that
are scheduled to be implemented would add to inflationary pressures. This could translate into
increased concerns about macroeconomic stability, including through a loss of international
competiveness, and potentially trigger capital outflows and downward pressure on the currency.
Monetary policy would need to react to re-establish a nominal anchor which could further eat
into economic activity.

18.

Authorities’ view.



GDP growth in 2017–19 is expected to accelerate more strongly than in staff’s baseline.
Investment and export growth are expected to rebound more rapidly than assumed by staff. The
reforms taken in 2016 amount to a significant total factor productivity shock, and are expected
to generate a significant rebound of economic activity, reversing the decrease of potential
output and income per capita over the past decade.



Inflation. Reaching the inflation target 12–17 percent at end-2017 does not look ambitious, as
inflation expectations are now at levels consistent with year-over-year inflation being quite close
to the central bank’s (BCRA’s) target next year. The authorities noted that the current monetary
policy stance is adequate to lower inflation to the target range and that expectations are likely
to become more forward-looking as wage and price setters increasingly understand the BCRA’s
strong commitment to achieve the announced inflation targets. They also noted that the
increase in nominal wages needed to stabilize real wages at last year level varies across sectors.
A lower cost of capital and a better economic environment make up space for real wage
increases. In short, the authorities do not see a risk to their disinflation path stemming from
wage negotiations.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Exchange rate. The authorities are confident that the adoption of an IT monetary policy regime
with freely floating exchange rate will minimize the risk of currency misalignment as experienced
in the past. A strong currency should not deter the rebound of investment, given the improved
business conditions, productivity enhancing measures, and the abundance of capital at a time
where there is excess saving at a global level.



Risks. The authorities view the risks to their outlook as mostly on the upside. Removing the
pervasive distortions that were affecting trade and investment has the potential to generate an
ever sharper rebound of productivity and investment, which means there is a large upside risk to
their growth projections.

RESTORING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR SUSTAINED
GROWTH AND JOB CREATION
A. Fighting Inflation
19.
Bringing inflation to a single-digit level is a key priority. The BCRA has managed well the
transition to an inflation targeting regime under difficult circumstances, and reconfirmed in
September 2016 the inflation targets that were announced early in the year. The pace at which this
disinflation is achieved should remain flexible and adapt to circumstances as they unfold, remaining
conscious of the economic costs and, particularly, the distributional impact. For example, if inflation
inertia remains high, lowering inflation to 5 percent by 2019 could result in sizable output losses
(Box 4, and Chapter 4 of the Selected Issues Paper). This is why past episodes of transition from
moderately high to single-digit inflation generally occurred over a longer period of time (Box 5 and
Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues Paper).
20.
To support the central bank’s disinflation efforts, building credibility in the monetary
framework will be essential and will serve to lessen the economic and social costs in lowering
inflation. Creating robust institutional foundations for monetary policy based on inflation forecast
targeting would help build credibility over time and allow price formation to gradually become more
forward-looking, lessening the cost of disinflation and lowering the inflation premium that is
currently built into the domestic yield curve. The announced establishment of a six-member
Monetary Policy Council led by the BCRA Governor and the planned adoption (from January 2017)
of the 7-day repo rate as the policy rate are positive developments.3 Other steps that should be
taken immediately to strengthen the institutional underpinnings for monetary policy include (see
Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 5):


Establishing a clear price stability mandate for the central bank with operational independence;

3

The BCRA will conduct liquidity management and introduce standing facilities in connection with the 7-day policy



Eliminating central bank financing of the fiscal deficit;



Moving to less frequent decision points for the policy rate as macroeconomic conditions
stabilize (currently rate decisions are taken on a weekly basis); and



Continuing to build credibility in Argentina’s inflation statistics.
Box 4. Inflation Inertia and the Cost of Disinflation
Reducing inflation to a single digit is an essential step to achieve a more efficient allocation of resources,
increase savings, reduce income inequality, and ultimately boost the long-term growth potential of
Argentina’s economy. Disinflation processes, however, can also have short-term costs on economic activity,
which in a large part depend on the credibility of the monetary authorities and the degree of nominal inertia
in the economy, or the extent to which wages and prices are set in a forward-looking manner (Blanchard,
1998).1 Using a small macroeconomic model estimated on Argentine data (see Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 4) allows establishing a quantitative link between the degree of nominal inertia in wage and price
determination and the output cost of disinflation. With a coefficient on past inflation in the Phillips curve of
0.7, a model simulation bringing inflation from its level in Q1:2016 (33 percent, y/y, based on the City of
Buenos Aires CPI) to 5 percent would require real interest rates to peak at 12 percent during the first year,
resulting in a cumulative output loss over three years of slightly above 10 percent of potential GDP.
However, if a greater weight was placed on

and 1990s, whereas in Mexico it lasted more than
four years after the “Tequila crisis.” These countries also saw a significant real appreciation of their
currencies during the disinflation process (of about 50 percent in Colombia, 40 percent in Chile, and about
80 percent in Mexico).
A role for institutions. In many of these cases, reforming the institutional framework for monetary policy
was an instrumental ingredient in reducing inflation (see Cukierman and others, 2002, or Jacome and
Vazquez, 2008).1 This typically implied granting independence to central banks and assigning them a narrow
price stability mandate. Fiscal adjustment also contributed to this effort. For example, Colombia, Chile, and
Mexico ran a sizable primary surplus during their disinflation episodes.

Authorities’ view. The authorities stated that the announced pace of disinflation is
appropriate and they expect to achieve the 5 percent per year inflation target by 2019. They noted
that many countries that went from moderate to low inflation more gradually over time were facing
legal backward indexation (for example, Colombia in the 1990s), which is not the case of Argentina.
They also noted that staff is overestimating the output costs associated with disinflation in
Argentina. In the past, lower inflation in Argentina was generally associated with stronger, not
weaker, economic activity. This suggests that when starting from high and distortionary inflation

23

ARGENTINA

levels, reducing inflation actually increases economic activity. If expectations were to deviate from
the targets announced in September, the authorities would not hesitate to tighten the monetary
policy stance as needed to return to the announced disinflation path. Showing the resolution to
meet the targets announced (for both inflation and transfers to the Treasury) is an effective way to
build the credibility necessary to reduce inflation inertia. The authorities’ position is that changing
the monetary policy institutional framework along the lines suggested by staff is effective once
credibility has been achieved. Their reading of the experience of other countries was of more mixed
results on the role played by such institutional changes. There have been cases where the central
bank’s charter was changed after inflation had been reduced, in order to lock-in its benefits, rather
than at the beginning of the disinflationary process (for example, the United Kingdom in the 1990s).

B. Restoring Fiscal Integrity
22.
The government’s plan to lower the fiscal deficit remains a vital objective. The modest
pace of fiscal consolidation for next year implied by the proposed Budget for 2017 seems
appropriate given the domestic political and social constraints, and the need to support the
economy at a time when the population is still digesting the implications of this year’s costly
transition. However, in the event the upside risks materialize, the authorities should take the
opportunity to accelerate and frontload the reduction of fiscal imbalances as this would allow for a
more accommodative monetary policy stance, ease the upward pressures on the currency, improve
the public debt dynamics, and provide more support to the needed rebalancing from consumption
towards investment. Similarly, while the pace and composition of the shift in the fiscal position after
2017 will need to remain sensitive to the impact on growth, jobs, and the most vulnerable segments
of the Argentine population, frontloading the fiscal correction to the extent allowed by economic,
political, and social conditions would be desirable.
23.
The needed reduction of the fiscal deficit should be based on a rationalization of
government spending. Wages, pensions, and energy subsidies have risen by 11 percent of GDP
over the past 8 years. Indeed, public spending in

Education and health spending. About 70 percent
of public expenditure in education and health is
directed towards employee salaries. On education,
while primary and tertiary education expenditure and
indicators in Argentina are comparable to regional
averages and produce relatively good outcomes,
secondary school spending is high compared to peers,
and does not appear to produce better education
outcomes. On health, Argentina’s public health
expenditure amounted to 32 percent of total
government expenditure, compared to 15 percent for
the LA6 and OECD, and 12 percent for EMs, and
efficiency frontier analysis, drawing on the outcomes of
a range of other EMs and advanced economies,
suggests that there may be room for efficiency gains
(although health outcomes may also depend on a
series of different factors, including educational
attainment and access to sanitation facilities and clean
water).

Incidence of Residential Subsidies by Income Decile

Energy subsidies. Energy subsidies have risen
dramatically over the past decade and, at 4 percent of
GDP in 2015, constitute the bulk of non-pension social
transfers. These subsidies are largely regressive, with
many poor segments of the population lacking access
to the subsidized products (the poorest quintile of
households received about 10 percent of residential
natural gas subsidies and about 18 percent of
residential electricity subsidies; the richest quintile
received about 35 percent and 20 percent, respectively).



Eliminating untargeted energy subsidies. The current system of regressive energy subsidies should
be replaced with measures to protect the poor. This would free up significant fiscal resources to be
used for more productive purposes while protecting the poorest part of the population. The
government’s initial efforts to raise natural gas tariffs for households were reversed by the
Supreme Court. This subsequently led the government to consult with the public on a plan to
bring residential natural gas tariffs back to cost recovery by 2019, with a social tariff to protect the
poorest 1.5 million households. For 2017, under the proposed budget, the government plans to
lower gas and electricity subsidies by about ½ percent of GDP (to about 1½ percent of GDP). Staff
estimates suggest that, if successful, bringing both electricity and natural gas tariffs to cost
recovery while maintaining a social tariff would reduce spending by about 1 percent of GDP.



Reduce pension imbalances. Serious scrutiny of the pension system is needed to restore its
financial sustainability and reduce the contingent pension liabilities that will inevitably burden
Argentina’s young and/or its future generations (Box 7). Spending on pensions increased rapidly
over the last decade, from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2015.4 This was
largely a product of increases in benefits (the dependency ratio during this period was broadly
unchanged). The flow imbalance in the pension system will reach 2¼ percent of GDP in 2023
and over 5 percent by 2066 (see Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues Paper). The present value of
the pension deficit, net of financial asset holding of the pension fund, is around 29 percent of
2016 GDP. Restoring a sustainable pension system would require parametric reforms, including
indexing benefits to inflation, reducing the replacement rate, and gradually increasing the
retirement age for women.

24.
Authorities’ view. The authorities stressed that gradualism and flexibility are key to a
successful process of fiscal rebalancing. They noted that reducing the wage bill at both federal and
provincial levels will be a slow process, largely based on attrition, given the social cost associated
with reducing public sector employment in the context of a still ailing economy. The review of public
sector employment done at the federal level early this year suggests there is ample room for
efficiency gains. Efforts to modernize Argentina’s public administration are expected to achieve
significant cost savings and better quality of services over time, including by (i) integrating the
administration of human resources and purchases of goods and services across Ministries and public
agencies; (ii) digitalizing a vast number of administrative procedures; and (iii) reorganizing and
improving the utilization of information technology at all levels of the public administration,
including provinces and municipalities. On pensions, the authorities recognized that the current
system faces important long-term challenges, and noted that they are beginning to study the
impact of parametric reforms of the type suggested by staff. The government’s analysis will be a
contribution to the recently established commission on the pension reform, that will articulate a
comprehensive reform of Argentina’s pension system by end-2019. They noted that the effective

ARGENTINA

women retirement age is 63, which reduces the potential savings from increasing the minimum
retirement age to 65.
Box 7. Argentina’s Pension System: Options for Reform
Background. Pension spending has risen due to the expansion of the number of beneficiaries and the
introduction of a basic noncontributory pension. The structure of benefits has, however, been steadily
flattened over time. In addition to social security contributions, the system was funded by diverting to the
social security fund (ANSES) 15 percent of the national tax revenue pool. The system is partially funded with
around 10 percent in GDP in assets held by the Fondo de Garantia y Sustenibilidad.
Long-term projections. The imbalances in the system are exacerbated by:





the retroactive adjustment of benefits to past inflation introduced by the Ley de Reparacion Historica
(which will increase pension spending by an annual 0.7 percent of GDP over the medium term);
the introduction of a universal, minimum pension for the elderly regardless of their contribution history
(adding 2 percent of GDP to spending in the long run);
the Supreme Court ruling that the withholding of 15 percent of the common pool of tax revenues from
provinces was unconstitutional (implying a revenue loss of 1.6 percent of GDP by 2020); and
population aging (the old-age dependency ratio will double by 2066).

The cumulative impact of the net present value of pension liabilities over the next fifty years implies an
actuarial deficit of the system of around 30 percent of 2016 GDP.1
Pension Replacement Rate for a Male

Options for reform. Correcting this imbalance would
require some combination of:







Change in the indexation formula. Pension benefits
are linked to wage growth and the growth of ANSES
revenues per disbursed benefit. This formula causes
benefits to increase at rates above CPI inflation, and
to rise faster when the growth in the number of
beneficiaries slows. Indexing benefits to realized
inflation from 2019 onwards would reduce the
actuarial deficit by about 20 percentage points of
GDP.
Lowering the replacement rate. The replacement rate
(the ratio of the benefit to the last wage earned) is
about 72 percent of the average wage, well above the
OECD average (of 53 percent). Lowering the rate to
60 percent would reduce the actuarial deficit by about
10 percentage points of GDP.
A gradual increase of retirement age for women. An
increase in the female retirement age from 60 to 65
over the next ten years would reduce the actuarial
deficit by 10 percentage points of GDP.

Fiscal space will also be needed to overhaul Argentina’s inefficient and burdensome

investment. Argentina’s general government

measures that reduced the tax burden in 2016 by

on SMEs. The most immediate priorities in tax
policy are to:


Simplify the overall system. There are over 35 different types of taxes collected, with 15 of them
contributing only 1 percent of GDP to overall tax revenues. This imposes significant compliance
costs. At the same time, indirect taxes have multiple rates and special earmarking regimes, there
is a complex system of cross-exemptions and crediting that vary across the type of activity, the
location of that activity, or the type of tax base.



Reduce the marginal tax rate on labor. Employee’s and employer’s contributions for health and
social security together account for between 40 and 45 percent of wages, although with a cap
on employees’ contributions.5 This is above the OECD average, and hampers job creation in the
formal economy. A broad-based cut in contribution rates (of 2 percentage points) could be
financed by eliminating the current system of exemptions and deductions across provinces (that
account for 0.3 percent of GDP).



Raise and preserve over time the progressivity of the personal income tax (PIT). High inflation and
lack of adjustment of income tax brackets over the past decade meant that the PIT has become
less and less progressive. The authorities are about to submit to Congress a legislative proposal
that increases the dispersion of income tax brackets and marginal rates (lowering the bottom
rates while increasing the top marginal rate from 35 percent to 40 or 45 percent) with an
estimated annual fiscal cost of around ¼ percent of GDP (half of which borne by provinces).
However, increasing the highest marginal PIT rate above the corporate tax rate (currently
35 percent) could create incentives for tax arbitrage. Going forward, it will be important to
ensure that the real value of tax brackets is preserved.

5

The tax base for employee’s social security contribution is capped at an amount that is revised twice yearly
according to the pension indexation formula. Currently, the cap is 56,058 pesos per month, which is a little above
double the average wage of those contributing to the social security system.
28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Reduce the marginal tax rate on new capital. At 35 percent, the corporate income tax (CIT)
statutory rate is one of the highest in the region, and the lack of provisions to adjust depreciation
and capital allowances for inflation further increases the marginal tax rate on new capital
formation. There are also limited provisions for carrying forward losses, limited allowances for
depreciation, and low tax credits for R&D spending that raise the effective burden on
incremental investments. To encourage new physical and intellectual capital formation, the CIT
rate should be lowered by 5 percentage points, incentives for new R&D spending should be
expanded, and new investment should be encouraged through more generous depreciation
allowances, longer loss carry-forward, and inflation indexation of costs. The estimated annual
cost of these measures would be 0.3 percent of GDP for provinces and 0.2 percent of GDP for the
federal government.



Phasing out the financial transaction tax. The high marginal rate levied on transactions in
checking and saving accounts distorts the payment systems, discourages financial
intermediation, and incentivizes payments in cash. Removing this tax would imply a loss for the
federal government of about 1 percent of GDP.



Replacing the gross turnover tax and increasing
property taxes. Provinces should raise the
property tax (which yields about 0.3 percent of
GDP, well below international and regional
levels) 6 and replace the gross turnover tax—a
multi-stage sales tax that creates distortions
through cascading—with a less distortionary
tax on goods and services (the rate and base of
which would need to be determined by
provinces so that the impact on is revenue
neutral).

The net effect of all these measures is estimated to imply a loss of revenues of around
1¼ percent of GDP for the federal government (and a further ¾ percent of GDP for the provinces).
To minimize the impact on the budget and to support a pickup in private investment, a
simplification of the tax system and changes in the PIT and CIT could be implemented first, along
with the reduction in social security contribution rates, while the elimination of the financial
transaction tax could be phased in gradually. Changes at the provincial level need to be coordinated
with the reforms of the national tax system.
26.
Authorities’ view. Reducing the high tax burden is essential, but any substantial changes in
Argentina’s tax system will need to be phased in gradually, to make sure that the fiscal costs are
sustainable. The authorities noted that, together with this year’s increase in the minimum income
subject to PIT (which is now one of the highest in the region), the reform proposal that will soon be

discussed in Congress will significantly improve the progressivity of the PIT system. The proposal
may include a gradual increase of the income tax brackets over the next three years, to preserve
progressivity, which the authorities prefer to a formal indexation scheme as this could increase
inertia and may not increase the progressivity of the tax during the disinflation process. The financial
tax is a distortionary tax that weighs especially on SMEs, but can be eliminated only with caution and
within a more general reform of the tax system, given the large amount of revenues that it raises.
There is also a general agreement that the gross turnover tax is highly distortive, but replacing it
with another tax (such as a VAT or a sales tax at provincial level) could be too costly. These and
other tax changes will be reviewed by a special parliamentary commission that will form a proposal
for a comprehensive reform of the Argentina’s tax system to be sent to Congress by early 2018. The
authorities also expect significant increase in revenues from the ongoing reorganization of the tax
administration. In particular, the objective is to reduce VAT tax evasion from the current 30 percent
to the 20 percent that had been experienced a decade ago.

C. Rebuilding Fiscal Institutions
27.
Introducing a simple, transparent, and credible medium-term fiscal plan that guides
expectations would be valuable. Such a fiscal framework should aim to improve the overall
management of fiscal policy, strengthen the credibility of fiscal objectives, and improve the
identification and management of fiscal risks. Some elements of a fiscal framework are already
formally in place in Argentina, under the existing Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), but the system lacks
credible enforcement.7 A complete revamping of the existing legislation could take time. However,
pending a fuller reform, both federal and provincial governments could introduce simple and
transparent medium-term fiscal objectives (for example, on fiscal deficits) in a clear and concise
policy statement that would be presented alongside the annual budget. That statement would
include details on the macroeconomic assumptions underlying the medium-term budget and the
key policy measures to be taken to achieve the deficit objectives. Over time, as uncertainty subsides
and credibility increases, other measures could be adopted to strengthen the fiscal framework
including:


Introducing a medium-term debt target, limits on growth of spending, and/or an overall deficit
ceiling, with transparent and easy-to-monitor escape clauses that allow deviating from the limits
in exceptional circumstances. The new framework would restrict the ability for the Executive to
exceed budget expenditure ceilings or reallocate spending beyond certain limits without the
approval of Congress. It should also include credible enforcement mechanisms, including a

7

The Law, introduced in 2004, was suspended in 2010. It states that primary spending growth in federal and
provincial budgets cannot exceed the projected rate of nominal GDP growth. It also imposes limits on debt service
ratios at provincial level, and it requires the federal and provincial governments to maintain primary current balances.
However, enforcement mechanisms are weak: the only sanction for the federal government is the exclusion from the
Federal Fiscal Responsibility Council, a committee representing the federal government and provinces that verifies
the application of the law and should coordinate fiscal policy across federal and provincial governments. Sanctions
for provinces mainly include suspension from the authorization to issue debt and reductions of discretionary
transfers from the federal government.
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARGENTINA

“comply-or-explain” obligation for the federal government and automatic cuts to transfers for
provinces in case the limits are exceeded.


Develop a fiscal risk analysis framework including the publication of a fiscal scenario analysis and
long-term fiscal sustainability analysis.



Create a new mid-year fiscal report with updated estimates of fiscal outturns for the year and
revised medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal projections.



Establish a fiscal council, with legal and operational independence, that evaluates
macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts, costs new policy initiatives, assesses fiscal plans, and
monitors fiscal performances (including compliance with the FRL).

28.
Authorities’ view. The federal authorities agreed that it would be important to introduce a
medium-term fiscal framework, and said that they are planning to announce medium-term fiscal
targets before the end of the year. They pointed to a number of legislative initiatives that should
strengthen the institutional fiscal framework. In the context of the discussion of the 2017 Budget, a
proposal will be examined that limits the Executive’s power to increase total spending above Budget
appropriations and to move spending across different items (Ley de superpoderes). A proposal is
being considered that introduces a Congress Budget Office which would help Congress assess the
fiscal impact of legislative proposals. Finally, discussions with provinces are ongoing to reinstate the
Fiscal Responsibility Law over the next few months. While the exact contours of the Law are still to
be determined, it would likely include caps on current spending growth and fiscal deficit targets.
While the enforcement mechanisms are the same as under the old Law (and so based on the federal
government’s power to deny new debt issuance to provinces not complying with the limits) the
authorities are confident that the greater commitment to fiscal discipline from the federal
government will be shared by provinces and lend credibility to the new framework.
29.
With about 40 percent of general government spending taking place at the subnational level, greater efficiency in government spending will require a rethink of Argentina’s
fiscal federal structure that:


Realigns spending authority and revenue autonomy. Provinces are responsible for a substantial
share of spending but enjoy limited tax autonomy and have been depending on the federal
government for financing. In 2015, one-third of total provincial resources came from by
discretionary federal transfers, and around 35 percent of provincial debt is owed to the federal
government. Realigning responsibilities could require returning some spending responsibility to
the federal government and/or allocating more revenue sources back to the provinces.



Addresses the complicated and inefficient sharing of resources across provinces. With the
legislation behind the co-participation scheme unchanged since 1988, intricate layers of patches
have been introduced over the years to correct for increasing socio-economic disparities across
provinces and to respond to political pressures. The lack of a mechanism to adjust the
distribution of revenues across provinces to reflect their changing revenue capacity and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

ARGENTINA

spending needs adds uncertainty and volatility to fiscal policy at both provincial and federal
levels. As such, the current horizontal distribution of shared revenue and federal transfers across
provinces should be re-examined to make it more equitable, transparent, rules-based, and
stable.


Restricts the borrowing power of provinces. Although provinces appear to have low debt and
deficits, these aggregates mask significant heterogeneity and imbalances across provinces (see
Public Debt Sustainability Analysis). Debt and deficits are concentrated in a few provinces, and
the large share of foreign currency denominated debt poses risks (see Annex I). Consideration
should be given to strengthening prudential control mechanisms over provincial borrowing,
within constitutional limitations, perhaps to allow for a more active review role for the federal
government or to net debt service obligations from transfers to those provinces with weak fiscal
positions.

30.
Authorities’ view. The authorities agreed that a new legal framework would be needed to
strengthen the institutions and rules of fiscal federalism in Argentina. However, delivering
fundamental legislative changes in this area will not be easy, as it would require a qualified majority
in Congress and approval from all provinces. The gradual devolution to provinces of the 15 percent
of co-participation revenues once attributed to ANSES is expected to alleviate the financial
difficulties experienced by many provinces last year. Therefore, provinces are expected to reduce
their external borrowing going forward. If this were not to happen, the federal authorities are ready
to tighten their debt approval policy, or to link it more explicitly to the issuance of debt needed to
finance an increase in capital spending. As envisaged in the 2017 Budget, the federal authorities are
planning to reduce discretionary transfers to provinces in the future, partly offsetting the increase in
co-participated revenues (the proportion of national revenues shared with provinces will increase
from 37 percent in 2015 to 40 percent next year).

D. Protecting the Poor
31.
Measures need to be taken to protect the most vulnerable from the costs of the
ongoing transition. The new poverty data released by INDEC in September describes a critical
social condition (see Box 1). The current administration took measures to mitigate the effects of the
ongoing transition through an expansion of social programs, an adjustment in pensions, lower VAT
on basic goods, increasing the minimum income subject to PIT, and the introduction of a social tariff
for electricity and natural gas. Going forward, eliminating the highly regressive energy subsidies and
introducing a comprehensive mean-tested transfer program will help provide well-targeted support
to the poorest households. While such a safety net is being designed and implemented, the
government should maintain a lower tariff structure for low-income consumers. A lower tax on labor
would incentivize formal employment and bring more people under the umbrella of existing social
programs (including the public health and the public pension scheme).
32.
But fundamentally it will be stronger and sustained growth and lower inflation that
will help reduce poverty. Sustaining job creation by removing macroeconomic imbalances and
securing strong and durable growth will have an important impact on supporting the poor. Using
32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARGENTINA

CEDLAS estimate of the poverty level and staff estimate of the elasticity between GDP growth and
poverty, suggests that a one percent increase in per capita GDP per year would reduce poverty rate
by 0.4 percentage points.8 This implies that, under the staff baseline, the poverty rate would decline
by about 3¼ percentage points by 2021. A significant reduction of inflation will also help the protect
living standards of low income households. Continued progress in fostering gender equality in the
economy and addressing the remaining gender gaps would also contribute to increasing
Argentina’s potential growth and economic welfare (Box 8). This could require well targeted gender
budgeting initiatives, in particular with a focus on programs that facilitate or promote access of
women to educational and preventative health services (IMF, 2016).9
33.
Authorities’ view. The authorities emphasized that protecting the most vulnerable from the
potential negative impact of the reforms is a key policy objective, and voiced a strong commitment
to reduce the poverty rate. In addition to the tax and spending measures taken by the
administration during the course of 2016, the authorities noted that their social policy will be based
on three main areas: (i) adopting an income policy that prevents excessive labor conflicts and fosters
consensus, (ii) improving the quality of public goods (including health and education), and
(iii) promoting inclusiveness and social mobility through more efficient and targeted social transfers,
which are better linked to active labor market policies. With between 1 and 1.5 million workers
receiving less than half of the minimum wage and largely in the informal sector, measures that build
job-related skills are needed to help reintroduce this segment of the labor force into Argentina’s
formal economy, although only strong growth will produce quality and sustainable employment.
The authorities also agreed that disinflation will reduce the inequality of the income distribution,
given the disproportionate incidence of the inflation tax on low-income households. In particular,
they noted that the inflation tax represents 20 percent of the income of the lowest decile of
Argentina’s households but only 3 percent for the top decile.

The growth elasticity of poverty is estimated as the percent change in poverty with respect to a one percent change
in per capita GDP, using CEDLAS data for poverty and INDEC GDP data for the period 2004–14.

Argentina stands out in terms of female school enrollment,
vis-à-vis Chile and Uruguay, and even more when compared
to the average level of female education in Latin America and
the Caribbean (LAC). Argentina is a leader in the region in
female political representation and fares well in terms of
women’s labor force participation. However, when it comes
to indicators of maternity mortality and adolescent fertility,
Argentina is lagging behind its neighboring countries.

effectiveness. Despite relatively good anti-corruption regulation, enforcement has been uneven and
corruption remains pervasive in public institutions, including in public procurement and public
works.10 High levels of corruption are also seen by firms as an obstacle to investing in Argentina
(World Bank Enterprise Survey, 2015). Moreover, Argentina ranks 121 among 189 countries in terms
of ease of doing business, mostly reflecting corruption and excessive bureaucracy.
35.
The authorities began taking steps to rebuild public institutions, strengthen anticorruption controls, and step-up enforcement. These include initiatives to promote open
government, reduce bureaucracy, build human and institutional capacity, and increase digital
innovation in the public sector. A new framework for public tenders of infrastructure projects has
also been announced to increase transparency and prevent collusive practices. Staff welcomes the
recently proposed legislative reforms to provide additional tools to prosecute corruption, seize
assets linked to corruption, and introduce criminal liability for legal persons. These efforts would be
complemented by effectively mobilizing the anti-money laundering (AML) framework. In particular,
the authorities are encouraged to strengthen the AML/CFT controls in the financial sector, notably
relating to politically exposed persons, and ensure that financial intelligence is appropriately used in
advancing and supporting investigations and prosecutions of corruption.
36.
Financial deepening will create scope for domestic financing of productive activity,
strengthen the monetary transmission channel, and include a greater share of the population
in the financial system. Argentina has a relatively small financial system: bank credit to the private
sector is only 13 percent of GDP, and stock market capitalization is only 10 percent of GDP. To a
large extent, restoring macroeconomic stability is the best contribution that policymakers can offer
to the developing of local financial markets. Low inflation and positive real rates are needed to
increase the base of long-term domestic currency savings that will allow banks to increase lending

central bank has introduced a new inflationindexed account unit, to create a market for inflation-indexed fixed income instruments (both on
the deposit side and, for example, in mortgage loans).



Capital markets. The authorities are working at a reform of the 2012 Capital Markets Law, which
aims at developing closed-end mutual funds by equalizing tax treatment with open-end funds;
introduce legislation that provides for the enforceability of derivative netting; increases capital
requirements for broker dealers; and improves many aspect of corporate governance, including
by removing the power of the securities regulator to interfere in decisions approved by the
board of listed companies and strengthening its enforcement powers to take on anti-market
behavior. Progress has been made in improving capital market infrastructure: the creation of a
unified stock exchange (B&MA) will increase liquidity and lower transaction costs by
consolidating the trading platform, the central counterparty clearing house and the custodian
agency. The new central counterparty clearing house is expected to facilitate the development
of an interest rate swap market, currently quite limited in Argentina.



Insurance sector. Restrictions on insurance companies (that compelled them to invest in
infrastructure projects approved by a political committee and limited foreign investment) were
removed. Consideration is given to introducing tax incentives for investment in long-term assets,
such as life insurance and annuity products by updating the income tax deduction limits that
have been frozen since the early 1990s.



Public pension reserve fund. The new administration at ANSES has begun reforming the
governance and investment strategy of the public pension fund, which was significantly
mismanaged in the past. The objective is to preserve the fund’s capital, investing in projects
(mainly infrastructure projects and financial instruments that promote growth and support the
development of local capital markets) and using the returns to pay for the increase in pension
payments following the 2016 reforms. The authorities are considering utilizing part of the
endowment to set up a trust, which would securitize mortgages originated in banks (while asking
them to maintain a significant credit exposure) in order to help develop a local mortgage market.

establish an independent, rules-based regulatory structure for electricity generation, transmission,
and distribution, water and sewage, and natural gas. This should include clear, transparent, and
predictable mechanisms for adjusting tariffs. In addition, there should be accountability for the
quality of services and requirements to maintain the underlying infrastructure.


Natural gas. The 3-year plan for increasing natural gas tariffs for residential customers goes in
the right direction, and discussions are ongoing to update the old gas plan that fixes the
remuneration for natural gas producers and expires at end-2017. The old system (that
remunerates investment done before 2012 at prices well below current import prices and gas
produced with new investment at prices above current import prices) should be replaced by a
plan that guarantees remuneration at international prices, with caps and floors to avoid
excessive volatility, for a sufficiently long period of time so as to encourage investment in
exploration and production.



Crude oil prices are also regulated by
agreement between the government, refiners,
and the oil extraction companies, with
companies currently guaranteed a domestic
price of US$67 per barrel. The guaranteed price
should be phased out and investment
encouraged instead by better governance, a
clear long-term roadmap for their
development, and mechanisms to ensure
transparency, accountability, stability, and the
respect for contractual rights.

For electricity, the government plans to double the supply of effectively available electricity in
the next decade and reach a target for renewable resources to cover 25 percent of the country’s
energy needs. Two public auctions have been implemented so far this year, which awarded
10 years PPAs (Power Purchases Agreements) on thermal energy projects, both of which
attracted considerable interest also given the high rates of return offered. In the future,
improving the regulatory framework would ensure a more competitive tender process, allowing
further reductions in the cost of energy.

40.
Argentina fares poorly in the areas of market efficiency and competition. This reflects
the existence of anticompetitive regulation and barriers to entry (particularly in network industries),
a weak antitrust framework, and significant and unpredictable government involvement in private
industry. Important progress is ongoing at the Argentina’s National Competition Commission, which
has recently been restructured. A law has been sent to Congress that makes the Commission
independent, giving it a clear mandate to conduct investigations, and impose fines, and bring cases
to court. The legislation also introduces leniency programs to incentivize whistleblowing; updates
the thresholds for fines and merger and acquisition cases (that had not been adjusted for inflation
over the past decade); and introduces a special chamber in the judiciary to adjudicate on
competition cases. The Commission has already issued a report to Congress on the state of
38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

competition in the credit card industry and will follow up with studies on dominant position and
collusive behavior in other 13 sectors. The authorities have announced a Plan Productivo Nacional
that delineates an active industrial policy, aimed at maintaining or strengthening public support to
sectors deemed competitive (such as the automotive sector) and gradually eliminating it for
uncompetitive sectors (such as the electronic cluster in Terra del Fuego). The exact contours of the
plan have yet to be defined but should avoid an excessively active (i.e., picking-winners) industrial
policy. Instead, policy should seek to level the playing field by removing government support across
all sectors and lowering the tax burden more broadly.
41.
Progress on supply-side reforms could generate significant pay-offs for medium-term
growth and jobs. An extensive literature finds that structural reforms, including product market
reforms, have a positive impact on growth over the medium and long term (IMF, 2015).14 In
Argentina, a number of reforms could be achieved through legislative changes at little or no fiscal
cost. Financial liberalization would support both consumption and investment by relaxing credit
constraints. Similarly, improving the regulatory framework and reducing barriers to entry and the
costs of doing business would stimulate FDI and productivity. Using OECD estimates on the impact
(after 10 years) of product market reforms (proxied by an indicator of regulation in network
industries) on GDP levels suggests that closing half the gap between Argentina and the OECD
average could add 1½ percent to GDP by 2021 and 0.6 percent to employment.15
42.
Authorities’ view. The authorities agreed that fundamental supply-side reforms are needed
to improve the business climate and create the conditions for a more integrated, competitive,
productive, and inclusive economy. A multi-pillar Agreement on Productivity and Jobs has been
articulated (following the Plan Productivo Nacional) that aims at establishing a broad consensus on
measures to develop local capital markets, reduce cost of production, lower the tax burden, improve
labor legislation, foster innovation, increase competition, reduce red tape, and boost infrastructure.
While work in these areas has begun already, the authorities stressed that many of the reforms
would need to be phased in gradually, taking into account their political and social implications. For
example, removing costly and inefficient subsidies and protections for some sectors at a time when
the private sector is not creating new jobs could imply excessive social and economic costs. Rather,
it is preferable to try and incentivize a reallocation of resources from the least to the most
productive sectors, or production processes within sectors. The authorities said they are negotiating
with producers, provinces, and unions a gradual reduction of crude oil prices to international parity
over the next few months. Regulatory agencies in the energy sector are being redirected to their
original function, and new directors are being selected with more independence from political
pressure. The authorities intend to launch an ambitious program of infrastructure, increasing
government’s capital spending from 2 to 6 percent of GDP in about 8 years, two thirds of which in
partnership with the private sector. In order to achieve this objective a new law has been sent to

Congress that aims at improving the institutional and legal framework for public-private
partnerships, including by setting up a special unit that will assess the social return associated with
these projects, as well as their macroeconomic and financial implications. Finally, the authorities are
committed to further step-up their anti-corruption efforts. The Anti-Corruption Office has embarked
on increasing transparency and accountability of government public officials by making public all
financial asset disclosures. Together with financial sectors stakeholders, the authorities have also
started utilizing the AML/CFT controls in advancing and supporting investigations and prosecutions
of corruption.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Upon taking office in December last year, Argentina’s new government inherited a
legacy of pervasive macroeconomic imbalances, microeconomic distortions, and a weakened
institutional framework. These encompassed unsustainably high consumption levels, historically
low levels of investment, and large fiscal deficits financed by money creation, which led to high
inflation. Distortions at the micro level included an extensive network of administrative controls (for
example, trade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, and price controls) and a business
environment that eroded competitiveness and undermined medium-term growth. There was also an
important weakening of the institutional framework for economic policymaking, perhaps most
evident in the loss of credibility of the national statistics agency.
44.
A necessary and unavoidable transition. Confronted with this difficult situation, the new
government began an ambitious and much needed transition toward a better economic policy
framework, reversing the serious macroeconomic imbalances and microeconomic distortions
inherited from the previous government. Important progress has been made. The peso is now
market determined, and foreign exchange controls have been essentially eliminated. The increase in
utility tariffs has brought prices more in line with underlying costs. The settlement with creditors has
allowed a return to international capital markets by both the private and public sectors. Mediumterm fiscal and inflation targets were announced in conjunction with a transition toward a modern
system of inflation targeting. Finally, the national statistics agency is being rebuilt, allowing for the
publication of improved and credible data on inflation, trade, labor market, and output.
45.
Near-term costs but a more favorable future. The reversal of the serious imbalances and
distortions inherited from the previous administration, while necessary to lay the foundation for
robust future growth, unavoidably had an adverse near-term impact on the Argentine economy.
Indeed, the current recession had begun even before the new administration took office. However,
the alternative of continuing with the unsustainable policy framework of the past administration was
simply not tenable and would have eventually led to a repeat of Argentina’s history of crisis,
contraction, and social distress. Staff expects the economy to emerge from recession in late 2016,
and the planned fiscal consolidation in 2017 should be more-than-offset by a pickup in private
consumption, an improving external environment, and a rebound of private investment. It is no
accident that Argentina is forecast to experience one of the largest swings in growth—from negative
to positive—in 2017, based on the October 2016 World Economic Outlook.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARGENTINA

46.
With strong policy action and dramatic changes underway in the Argentine economy,
the outlook is subject to greater than normal uncertainty. On the upside, Argentina’s private
investment could prove to be more responsive to the measures taken so far to remove domestic
distortions, particularly given the clear underinvestment in a range of sectors over the past several
years. This would help with the fiscal position and would improve the outlook for long-term growth.
On the downside, given the expected reliance on external debt, a tightening of global financial
conditions could create pressures on the currency, affect the cost and availability of budgetary
financing, and impose a faster pace of fiscal consolidation. Higher inflationary pressures from
backward-looking nominal wage increases could lead to a more costly process of disinflation, which
would slow the rebound of economic activity that is expected for next year.
47.
The government should be commended for its commitment to bring inflation down to
single-digit levels. The pace at which this disinflation is achieved should remain flexible and adapt
to circumstances as they unfold, remaining conscious of the economic costs and, particularly, the
distributional impact. To support these efforts, building credibility in the monetary policy framework,
including through strengthening the institutional underpinning for policy will be essential and will
serve to lessen the economic and social cost of lowering inflation. Positive steps continue to be
taken by the national statistics agency in restoring the credibility of Argentina’s statistics.
48.
The government’s plan to lower the fiscal deficit remains a vital objective. The pace and
composition of this shift in the fiscal position will need to be sensitive to the impact on growth, jobs,
and on the most vulnerable segments of the Argentine population. Frontloading the fiscal correction
to the extent allowed by the current economic, political and social constraints would be desirable.
Doing so will allow for a more accelerated reduction in interest rates, ease the current upward
pressure on the real exchange rate, improve the public debt dynamics, and facilitate the needed
rebalancing from consumption to investment-driven growth. There will have to be a rationalization
of government spending, which has increased rapidly over the last decade. Much can be done to
strengthen public expenditure management, improve governance, and increase the efficiency of
public spending. Action is particularly needed on eliminating regressive energy subsidies, protecting
the poorest part of the population, addressing actuarial imbalances in the pension system, and
overhauling the inefficient and burdensome tax system. A clearer articulation to the public of the
policy measures that underlie the targeted reduction of the federal deficit in 2017 as well as a
simple, transparent and credible medium-term fiscal policy plan that guides expectations would
both be valuable.
49.
Rebuilding the foundations for growth. Strong, sustained, and equitable growth will require
the implementation of an ambitious agenda of supply-side reforms. Near-term priorities include
putting in place a better regulatory framework for energy and utilities, fully realigning utilities tariffs
toward cost recovery while maintaining measures to protect the poor, and modernizing financial
market infrastructure and regulation. There is also a broader need to scale back government
involvement in private industries and create a better governance framework, including by making
further progress on the government’s ambitious anti-corruption plans. Such a set of policies will
create an environment that is more conducive to private investment and will generate significant

1/ On February 1, 2013, the IMF issued a declaration of censure, and since then has called on Argentina to implement specified actions to address the quality of its official GDP
data. The new government that took office in December 2015 released a revised GDP series on June 29, 2016. At the IMF Executive Board meeting that took place on August 31,
2016, the revised series was considered to be in line with international standards.
2/ The consumer price data for Argentina before December 2013 reflect the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires Area (CPI-GBA), while from December 2013 to October 2015 the data
reflect the national CPI (IPCNu). The new government that took office in December 2015 discontinued the IPCNu stating that it was flawed and released a new CPI for the Greater
Buenos Aires Area on June 15, 2016. Given the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology of these series, the average CPI inflation for 2014, 2015,
and 2016 and end-of-period inflation for 2015 are not reported in the October 2016 World Economic Outlook. On February 1, 2013, the IMF issued a declaration of censure and
since then has called on Argentina to implement specified actions to address the quality of its official CPI data. At the meeting that took place on August 31, 2016, the IMF
Executive Board noted the important progress made in strengthening the accuracy of the CPI data. The Managing Director will report to the Executive Board on this issue again
by November 15, 2016. The Executive Board discussion on this issue will take place on November 9, 2016.
3/ The primary balance excludes profit transfers from the central bank of Argentina. Interest expenditure is net of property income from the social security fund.
4/ Average of LEBAC rates of all maturities.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
Argentina’s external position is judged to be vulnerable to growing imbalances on the current account
and exchange rate. The current account deficit is estimated to be about 2 percent of GDP above level
implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Since the 40 percent nominal
devaluation in December 2015, the real exchange rate has undergone an important appreciation as
strong capital inflows sustained a largely unchanged nominal exchange rate while a large wage and
price inflation differential with trading partners eroded competitiveness. The Argentine peso is
estimated to be overvalued by around 10–15 percent in 2016. Reserves are judged to be well below
adequate levels, and the significant reliance on debt-creating portfolio capital flows (including to
finance the public sector) makes Argentina vulnerable to a disruption to inward capital flows.

A. Current Account
Argentina’s current account (CA) balance
deteriorated substantially in recent years, from
near balance in 2012 to -2½ percent of GDP in
2015. This reflected falling commodity prices and a
nearly 50 percent real appreciation of the peso
between 2012 and November 2015, that weakened
competitiveness. A sharp worsening of the energy
trade balance due to domestic policy distortions
was also a factor.

levels fell. The strength in the peso, rising real wages, and accelerating inflation encouraged private
consumption while the growth in current spending increased public sector dissaving. However, the
true increase in external imbalances was masked by a range of controls.1 These included a tight
system of administrative controls to restrict both imports and the access to foreign exchange to
make payments for those imports that were approved. The availability of FX to make dividend
remittances was also limited. Since the new government took office in December 2015, most of the
controls have been lifted (see Annex Table 1) although non-automatic import licenses still apply to a
subset of products and services.

Also, the non-payments to the ‘holdout creditors’ helped mask the current account deficit, as the unpaid interest on
this debt was not included in the official current account balance.

The CA deficit is expected to worsen over the medium term. The CA balance is expected to
improve slightly in 2016 (-2.3 percent of GDP) as the peso devaluation and the removal of trade
restrictions and export taxes were offset by weak external demand and higher net income outflows.
However, from 2017 onward, the steady upward movement in the real exchange rate, increased
dividends from higher FDI stocks, and higher debt service payment (as the public sector builds
external debt) will cause the CA deficit to rise to 4.2 percent of GDP by 2021 (5.0 in cyclicallyadjusted terms).2
While there is much uncertainty, the CA deficit in 2016 appears to be above levels consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The CA assessment is made relative to
the expected 2016 CA position given the significant external payments distortions present in the
2015 CA outturn (which were largely addressed in 2016). The CA-regression approach of using the
EBA methodology yields a cyclically-adjusted CA norm of close to –1 percent of GDP. The desirable
fiscal stance assumed in this estimate is based on a reduction of the overall general government
fiscal deficit by about 4 percent of GDP over the medium term (consistent with the authorities’
announced fiscal consolidation plans and staff’s baseline). It also assumes an increase in the FX
reserves over the medium term to close to US$70 billion. With a 2016 cyclically-adjusted CA
expected to be about 2¾ percent of GDP, the CA gap in 2016 is estimated at about -1½ percent of
GDP. The external stability (ES) approach suggests that the current account balance needed to
stabilize the IIP position to the staff’s estimated steady-state value is about -¾ percent of GDP.

2

Prior to the exchange rate unification, staff and market estimates of FX overhang potentially arising from arrears on
imports and dividend payments amounted to about US$8 billion and US$9 billion, respectively. However, as FX
controls have been reduced since December 2015 and capital inflows to Argentina picked up, there has been little
evidence of FX pressures from these sources, suggesting that the estimates of import arrears may have been
overstated while dividends have likely been reinvested in the country.

assets were US$210 billion in 2015 (only US$30 billion has been declared to the tax authorities).
Foreign exchange controls have all but been eliminated. In December 2015, the authorities
rolled back many of the formal and informal controls on foreign exchange transactions, and further
steps were taken through August of this year to liberalize the system (see Annex Table 1). These
steps not only lifted the restrictive system put in place in 2011 (the “cepo cambiario”) but brought
Argentina to its most liberal foreign exchange system since 2001.
In the first half of 2016, the removal of most controls and a return to international markets
have led to a significant increase in gross flows in both directions. The removal of capital
controls allowed residents to officially move money abroad on a large scale through formal channels
for the first time since 2011 (estimated to be US$6 billion in 2016H1). In addition, in
the first half of 2016 an agreement with creditors caused the federal government to issue

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARGENTINA

(and the arrears on debt restructured under Argentina’s 2005 and 2010 debt exchange) and for
federal budget financing.
For the remainder of 2016, public external debt issuance should subside, and capital outflows
will moderate. The authorities are unlikely to issue any substantial new external debt for the
remainder of the year. Some external assets are assumed to be repatriated in order to purchase
domestically issued debt. This includes inflows from abroad to take advantage of the proposed tax
amnesty, which is assumed to be around US$2.2billion in 2016H2 (plus a similar amount from
domestically held wealth), and US$1.2bn in 2017H1 (again, with a similar amount from domestic
wealth).
Looking forward, public debt issuance and growing FDI will finance the current account over
the medium term. The government is expected to rely extensively on external debt issuance to
finance its fiscal deficit. Net external federal government bond issuance will average around
US$17 billion per year over 2017–21, in addition to around US$5 billion a year from IFIs. Such
large-scale issuance will have a crowding out effect on private sector net borrowing. Similarly, the
appreciating exchange rate will create a disincentive for net private inflows. FDI is expected to
increase gradually from around 1.8 percent of GDP (accruals basis) in 2015 to about 3 percent in
2021, as foreign investors finance an increasingly large proportion of domestic investment and
spending.

C. FX Intervention and Reserves
Following the 2001/2 crisis, a shift to significant current account surpluses due to the sharp
50 percent depreciation of the real exchange rate allowed the authorities to amass significant
reserves. Gross international reserves peaked in

By end-2015, gross reserves were US$25.6 billion (58 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric,

obligations) declined to around zero.

the BIS and a US$1 billion a repo with foreign banks.
By end-2016, reserves are expected to grow by a further US$2.2 billion, mainly as a result of
resident inflows under the tax amnesty program. While the regular net issuance of the provincial
and federal government for the remainder of the year will be around zero, the tax amnesty is
expected to draw in around US$4.5 billion in 2016 (includes tax payments and investments in
bonds/investment fund, from both domestic and external sources). This will help the government
build additional reserves of around US$2.2 billion, leaving end-2016 at US$33.3 billion (5.7 months
import cover).

54

Reserves will increase substantially over the coming years funded by large-scale public debt
issuance. The significant net public debt issuance is likely to help build foreign exchange reserves to
around US$67 billion, or 8.7 months import cover with an assumption that the BCRA will purchase
these proceeds from the FX market. The pace of reserve accumulation envisaged in the baseline
would mitigate the pressure on the REER and provide important buffers for temporary external
shocks.

D. Real Exchange Rate

The removal of most FX controls in mid-December
2015 resulted in an immediate 40 percent
devaluation of the peso. However, since March
2016, debt-creating portfolio inflows (as the economy
re-leveraged through external financial markets) have
sustained the nominal exchange rate within a narrow
range. At the same time, the surge in domestic wage

The stronger real value of the peso may have
hindered external competiveness. Since 2009,
Argentina’s share of world export markets has
steadily declined, as commodity prices have fallen
and non-price competitiveness has weakened.
However, this broad trend masks heterogeneity
between products. The loss of market shares was
greatest for Argentina’s main primary products
(cereals, soybeans) and energy products, also
reflecting high export taxes, export restrictions, and
domestic policies of regulated prices and subsidies
that discouraged investment and activity in these
sectors (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 6).

Argentina’s REER has appreciated significantly in

Argentina’s REER began a steady appreciation
trajectory that accelerated over the last few years

2015, the REER-CPI had doubled compared to its
end-2007 level. The bilateral real exchange with
Brazil, Argentina major trading partner, followed a
similar trend, with the ULC-based bilateral RER up

While there is significant uncertainty about any estimated range, the REER is judged to be
10–15 percent overvalued. The EBA-lite CA model suggests an overvaluation of about 12 percent
(using the estimated CA gap of about -1.6 percent of GDP and an elasticity of the CA to REER of
-0.13). Using the CA gap from the ES approach and the same elasticity yields a similar estimate.
Measures of Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) also suggest that the peso is overvalued. Indices by
PriceStats and World Economics, for example, suggest an overvaluation of between 5–20 percent
in August.

E. External Balance Sheet
More than a decade of financial isolation means that Argentina’s gross external assets and
liabilities are amongst the smallest among EMs. The net positive IIP position of 9 percent of GDP
in 2015 is unusual for an emerging market. The majority of external assets are in the form of debt
(‘other investment’), while slightly less than half of liabilities are in the form of FDI. External debt is
low (see Annex Figure 1 and Annex Table 2), of which over 50 percent is held by the general
government and central bank, while the banking sector has borrowed very little from abroad.

The balance sheet is robust to a nominal
depreciation. Argentina’s external assets and
liabilities are predominately denominated in
foreign currency, and, while individual entities in
the economy may have a net open FX position,
there is no large net exposure of balance sheets
to a depreciation. There may be currency
mismatches within particular sectors or agents
within the economy, so exchange rate shocks
could still cause balance sheet problems that
affect the real economy (see Selected Issues
Paper, Chapter 7).

Given that 30 percent of foreign liabilities (US$41 billion) are in the form of short-term debt
obligations, this creates an important rollover risk. There appears to be a concentration of
short-term foreign currency debt in the non-bank private sector. This borrowing is concentrated in
the petroleum and industrial manufacturing industries and predominately appears to be associated
with credit lines for import financing. While a sudden stop in such trade financing will have
important implications for the ability of business to conduct trade, this may not have the same
balance sheet spillovers as a discontinuation of other forms of debt obligations, such as working
capital.
By 2021, the external balance sheet is expected to switch from a net asset to net liability
position. Gross assets and liabilities are likely to grow in coming years as a more open capital
account allows greater foreign investment in Argentina and greater portfolio diversification by
residents. In coming years, this expansion is driven primarily by public sector borrowing, which will
rely on external financing to fund much of its deficit and rollover needs. However, as fiscal
consolidation sets in and crowding out effects diminish, the private corporate sector will become
increasingly exposed to international capital markets through borrowing.

Annex II. Potential Cross Border Spillovers
Argentina is a relatively closed economy, with modest trade and small financial linkages with the rest
of the world. A significant decline in growth in Brazil, China or the U.S. would, however, have a
material impact on exports and growth performance. Food commodity price shocks are also a source
of vulnerability. Argentina’s relative isolation from international capital markets, its positive net IIP
position, and the absence of large maturity and currency external balance sheet mismatches suggest
that vulnerabilities from external financial shocks are limited at present. A few regional economies are
highly dependent on imports from Argentina, in particular Bolivia and Trinidad and Tobago.

A. Inward Spillovers
International trade makes up a small component of GDP, and exports are relatively well
diversified in terms of market destination.
Export Market Diversification
Argentina has the smallest ratio of exports to

export markets (average of 2014–15)—Brazil
(19 percent), China (7½ percent), the U.S. (6 percent), Chile (4 percent), and India (3 percent). Lower
activity in these economies will have an impact on Argentina’s exports and growth.
Cluster analysis suggests that Argentina is connected to the rest of world trade through the
United States. Examining the network characteristics2 of international bilateral trade links identifies
three major global trade ‘nodes’—the U.S., China, and Germany. Argentina forms part of the U.S.
trade cluster. This suggests that second-round effects from U.S. activity are also important—for
example, a decline in U.S. growth will also weaken activity in countries such as Brazil, Chile, and
Mexico, which will then impact trade with Argentina. The U.S. economy is also likely to be the main
conduit for shocks originating in the rest of the world.

As measured by an “export Gini coefficient”, which measures the share of exports by destination market compared
to a hypothetical scenario where exports are shared evenly across all possible markets. If exports were spread evenly
across all countries (‘full diversification’), then the coefficient would equal zero. If all exports went to one country (‘no
diversification’), the coefficient would equal one.

Argentina’s export concentration in agricultural
commodities exposes it to commodity price shocks.
As of 2015, over 60 percent of exports is constituted by
agricultural commodities, comprising both primary
products and agriculture related manufacturing
products (vehicle exports make up a further 10 percent
of the total). The degree of diversification has declined
since 2005 largely driven by the growing specialization
in soy and cereal products. This leaves Argentina
vulnerable to shocks to global agricultural prices. For
example, a 10 percent decline in global agricultural
commodity prices would lead to around a 2 percent
decline in overall export values (direct effects only).

discussed in detail in Chapter 7 of the Selected Issues
Paper, Argentina has relatively few links to international capital markets, and its positive net IIP position,
and the absence of significant currency or maturity mismatches imply that risks from external financial
stocks are contained. While 95 percent of portfolio investments are reported to be from the U.S. (CPIS
database), the ultimate holders of these liabilities are likely to be more broadly globally diffused.

B. Outward Spillovers
A number of regional economies are reliant on Argentina as an export market. Exports to
Argentina from Bolivia and Trinidad and Tobago (mainly liquefied natural gas) account for
17 percent and 13 percent of their total exports, respectively. This suggests that potential outward
trade spillovers to these countries could be large. Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay supply around
6 percent of their exports to Argentina, suggesting

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Federal government gross debt is 52 percent of GDP and is expected to decline slightly in the medium
term, as the improvement in the primary balance is largely offset by higher interest payments. Risks to
solvency are modest but there are vulnerabilities from the high share of external debt and sizable gross
public gross financing needs. In particular, given that more than two-thirds of public debt is foreign
currency denominated, the headline debt-to-GDP ratio is understated by the current overvaluation of
the exchange rate. Provincial debt was at around 5 percent of GDP in 2015, but most of provincial debt
is concentrated in few provinces with large deficits.

A. Background
At end-2015, the federal government gross debt stood at about AR$3,000 billion, amounting to
52.1 percent of GDP.1 Reported financial assets of the federal government amount to AR$22 billion,
implying a net debt measure that is very close to the gross level.

¾–1 percent of GDP per year, to a primary
deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2021. This pace of fiscal consolidation is consistent with staff’s
estimates of the amount of new financing that will realistically be available over the medium
term (see Table 1) and with a slightly slower pace of medium-term fiscal rebalancing than
announced by the authorities earlier in 2016. Finally, the pace of fiscal consolidation is within the
inter-quartile range of past consolidation episodes in other countries. For these reasons, it is
assessed to be realistic.



Debt servicing costs. The high levels of inflation experienced in recent years, together with a high
proportion of non-interest bearing debt financing, have generated significantly negative real

effective interest rates. This high inflation is partially offset by the valuation effect on foreign
currency-denominated debt from the nominal exchange rate depreciation.
Box 1. Fiscal Outlook for Provinces
Thanks to the federal-for-provincial debt swap
initiated in 2004, provincial debt steadily declined
during the past 10 years and reached 4.6 percent of
national GDP in 2015, or 38 percent of provincial tax
revenues (including the portion of the taxes shared
with the national government). A third of provincial
debt is held by the federal government. At the
same time, the combined primary deficit was below
0.1 percent of national GDP, on average, during
2005–14, but it picked up to 0.4 percent in 2015, on
account of an increase in the wage bill and current
transfers.

Most of provincial debt is concentrated in a
few provinces with large deficits. The province
and the autonomous city of Buenos Aires
(which account for about half of Argentina’s
population and GDP) contribute to over half
of total provincial debt, with another
20 percent concentrated in other five
provinces (Cordoba, Chubut, Mendoza,
Neuquen, and Santa Cruz).

Debt-to-provincial tax revenues (prcent)

Under the baseline scenario, the provincial primary deficit is expected to increase to 0.7 percent of national
GDP in 2016, driven by higher wages and capital spending, and then decline gradually to 0.5 percent by
2021, mainly thanks to the devolution of shared revenues that were previously earmarked to ANSES, that is
assumed to more than offset lower discretionary transfers from the federal government. Debt is expected to
stabilize at 5.6 percent of national GDP in 2021. Although low, these aggregate numbers mask large
heterogeneity and vulnerabilities:

above (those with the largest debt, and the
greatest share of FX-denominated debt) have
accessed international markets, issuing FX debt for a total of US$5.6 billion. This exposes them to
exchange rate risk. For example, a one step 50 percent depreciation in 2017 would increase debt to
47 percent of provincial revenues (from 38 under the baseline), the equivalent of 6.3 percent of national
GDP, by 2021.

Under staff’s baseline, the government will become less reliant on central bank funding and
increasingly more dependent on external market financing in foreign currency (the share of FX
debt and FX-linked will increase from 69 to 80 percent of total debt between 2015 and 2021).

Along with the decline in inflation, this will push up real effective interest rates. As a result,
interest spending will increase from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2021.


Debt. Debt is expected to decline slightly over staff’s forecast horizon, from 52 percent of GDP in
2015 to 47½ percent in 2021, well below

GDP in 2021.



Gross financing needs. The large overall fiscal deficit and amortization profiles in 2016–17 will
keep gross financing needs (GFNs) elevated at above 10 percent of GDP. In 2016, GFNs will peak
at 13.2 percent of GDP, slightly below the ‘high risk’ summary indicator. Going forward, fiscal
consolidation and lower amortization needs imply a decline of GFNs to 6–7 percent of GDP by
the end of the projection horizon.

C. Shocks and Stress Tests


Solvency risks are contained. The relatively low level of debt and the modest downward trajectory
suggest that the risk of a solvency crisis for the federal government is modest. Shocks to the
primary balance and interest rates are unlikely to cause debt to increase significantly. However,
the high and rising share of FX-denominated debt poses risks, especially given that the
exchange rate is currently viewed as overvalued (see above). In addition, a shock to real GDP
growth (-1 percent in 2017 and 2018) would cause debt-to-GDP ratio to jump to 66 percent in
2018. Finally, a combined macroeconomic shock could be very detrimental and push debt just
below 90 percent of GDP by 2018.



Liquidity risks are higher. The relatively high level of GFNs through the medium term increases
vulnerabilities to a liquidity crisis. A shock to real growth—with knock-on impacts to the primary
balance and credit spreads (each 1 percent deviation of the primary balance would increase
spreads by 25 basis points, for a total increase of 125 basis points in 2018)—would push GFNs to
15 percent of GDP. A shock to exchange rate would cause a similar spike, and a combined shock
would push GFNs as high as 19 percent of GDP.



Contingent liabilities could also increase the debt level. Under current policies, contingent
liabilities from the increase in pension spending over the long run are estimated to be
40 percent of GDP in net present value term.

Mitigating factors. Rollover risks are mitigated by intra-government cross holdings. The high share
of debt held by other public entities reduces the risk of a liquidity crisis. In times of stress, the
federal government will likely be able to rely on other public bodies (notably ANSES and the BCRA)
to rollover debt coming due and even purchase new issuances. While this can significantly reduce
rollover risks for the federal government, it would constrain the behavior of these public entities,
preventing them from diversifying risk and pursuing better yielding investment strategies, apart
from crowding out private sector credit. Importantly, these intra-government debt holdings do not
reduce solvency risks and should therefore not be ‘netted out’ of the headline debt stock. The
federal government is obliged to repay these claims in full, and a failure to do so would cause
significant problems on the balance sheets of these public entities.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable.
Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable.
Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR): Not Applicable.
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the
Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.
Exchange Rate Arrangements: Argentina’s currency is the Argentine peso. The exchange rate
arrangement is classified as floating from December 17, 2015. Argentina has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. As part of the 2016 Article IV Consultation mission to
Argentina, a review of the exchange system for compliance with Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 of
the Articles of Agreement was conducted. The restrictive exchange regime put in place in 2011 (the
“cepo cambiario”) has been removed, and Argentina maintains an exchange rate system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, other than restrictions
notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation: The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation with Argentina
was considered by the Executive Board on July 28, 2006.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 3, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance, although structural breaks in a number of
macroeconomic series (including CPI, employment, unemployment, poverty) hamper empirical
analysis. The status of Argentina with respect to the accuracy of the CPI and GDP data will be
reassessed by the IMF Executive Board on November 9.
National Accounts: In June 2016, INDEC disseminated a new GDP series for 2004–15., which the
IMF Executive Board assessed in August 2016 to be in line with international standards. INDEC
published a methodology note and detailed estimates by economic activity of the GDP in
September 2016. These actions increase data availability and transparency of the national accounts.
Price statistics: A new CPI was disseminated in June 2016 with coverage restricted to Greater
Buenos Aires. At the request of INDEC, an IMF technical assistance mission visited Buenos Aires
during September and October 2016 to assess progress on improving CPI methods and to assist
with developing a national CPI. By October 2016, INDEC is planning to develop and disseminate a
national CPI that is scheduled for release in early 2019, using data from a new household
expenditure survey to be compiled in 2017–18.

Government Finance Statistics: Argentina disseminates data for general government operations,
central government operations, and central government debt.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Only highly summarized data for the central bank and other
depository corporations are reported to STA. Data for other financial corporations, such as
insurance companies, pension funds, and investment funds, are not reported.
Financial sector surveillance: Data for the core and nine encouraged FSIs are reported quarterly.
External sector statistics: Argentina disseminates timely balance of payments, International
Investment Position (IIP), external debt, and the statistical framework of international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity, but the periodicity of the IIP is annual rather than quarterly. Data
provision is under the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), circumstance that
contributes to Argentina’s argument for not recording liabilities pertaining to SDR’s allocations in
the balance of payments and IIP. Data re-disseminated by STA and converted to the updated
balance of payments manual, BPM6, includes these data, although it may be absent in external
debt reported to the World Bank. At the request of the authorities, a technical assistance mission
on external sector statistics will visit the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC) in
November 2016. INDEC is the agency in charge of compiling and disseminating the balance of
payments and IIP. The main emphasis of the mission will be to assist the authorities to facilitate the
provision of quarterly IIP data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996.
No Data ROSC has been conducted.
III. Data Submission to STA
Argentina does not report GFS data for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and its
last submission for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) was in 2004. The authorities
are encouraged to resume the regular data submission for the IFS.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
The current Country Partnership Strategy (FY15–FY18) was presented to the World Bank Board of
Executive Directors in September 2014. The CPS, developed in consultations with the Government, is
built around nine specific results, most of which are aligned with the Government’s Pobreza Cero goal
of eradicating poverty (e.g., access to safe drinking water; youth insertion into labor market; effective
health care coverage; environmental clean-up). The Bank Group resumed lending to Argentina after
more than three years in 2014 with the first set of IBRD operations explicitly focusing and directly
supporting the vulnerable and the poor.
Currently, the IBRD portfolio consists of 21 investment projects for a total commitment of US$5.8 billion
(average size US$275 million) and of 3 big trust funds (two of GEF and one Montreal Protocol TF) for a
total of US$23.4 million. The overall approximate lending envelope for the four-year CPS period is
between US$4 billion and US$4.8 billion, US$2.4 billion of which has already been committed. The
portfolio includes ten new operations approved by the Board under the new Country Partnership
Strategy. As of June 30, 2016, Argentina’s exposure to the World Bank Group was US$6,862 million
(exposure to IBRD was US$ 5,737 million).
The Bank has agreed with the government on the lending program for FY17. In addition to the three
operations already approved in the water, social protection and trade areas for a total amount of
US$845 Million, the package includes a project to support financing of small and medium
enterprises, two urban transformation projects, a water and sanitation project, an energy renewables
guarantee, an additional financing for the Metropolitan Urban Transport Project, and a state
modernization project.
IFC has committed $1.9 billion (during FY15–FY16) in 22 projects, consisting of $1 billion from its
own account and $895 million in mobilization. The 22 projects of the IFC portfolio comprise 14 longterm finance projects ($344 million IFC + $895 million mobilization) and 8 trade finance projects—
$672 million. As of end-FY16, the IFC portfolio stood at $1.7billion with 40 Projects. IFC is on target
to reach and potentially overshoot the investment commitment targeted for end FY18 ($1.7 billion).

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK2
Argentina’s current Country Strategy covers the period 2012–15, and focuses on interventions and
funding for two critical areas: the Norte Grande region and the Greater Buenos Aires area. The first
of these areas exhibits the lowest relative level of economic development in the country, together
with the highest incidence of poverty and social exclusion. The second suffers from high levels of

ARGENTINA

social exclusion, with major challenges for urban sustainability. Given the proposed geographic
focus, the Bank's strategy is based on the following objectives: the alleviation of obstacles to growth
with a special focus in Norte Grande; social and economic inclusion of the population, focused on
both regions; and urban sustainability and habitat improvement, with particular emphasis on the
Greater Buenos Aires area. The IDB is the main multilateral creditor of Argentina with a total debt
owed of US$11.2 billion in 2015 (53.6 percent of Argentina’s total multilateral debt).
Under the 2012–15 Strategy the following initiatives were approved: 15 sovereign guarantee
operations totaling US$2.6 billion, 28 private sector (non-sovereign guarantee) operations totaling
US$ 325.1 million, and 29 non-reimbursable technical cooperations for US$12 million. In addition,
another 3 sovereign guarantee operations for US$353 million and 4 technical cooperations for
nearly $1 million were approved in the first nine months of 2016.
As of September 2016, Argentina’s sovereign loan portfolio is composed of 47 operations, totaling
US$7.5 billion, with a disbursed percentage of nearly 58 percent. The portfolio is distributed as
follows: 36 percent dedicated to projects in the areas of infrastructure and energy, 28 percent in
climate change and sustainable development, 25 percent in institutions for development, 6 percent
in social sector, and 4 percent in integration and trade. Additionally, the private sector loans
portfolio comprises 13 operations with an approved value of US$247.5 million, and the nonreimbursable technical cooperation portfolio includes 30 operations, with an approved value of
US$30.7 million.

Argentina—Statement by the Staff on the Article IV Consultation
November 9, 2016
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report was issued
and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic outlook. The monthly indicator of economic activity showed positive 0.2 percent
(m/m) growth in August, the first time since March, but GDP is expected to have contracted
again in Q3. Construction activity fell by 13 percent (y/y) in September and industrial
production fell by around 7 percent (y/y) in Q3, driven by continued weakness in the
automotive sector. Private consumption indicators were mixed, with consumer confidence
increasing 6.3 percent in October but retail sales continuing to fall in real terms in August.
The trade balance continued to improve in September, mainly due to subdued imports.
Monetary policy. The central bank has maintained the policy rate unchanged for the past six
weeks at 26.75 percent, noting that inflation expectations for 2017 remain slightly above the
12–17 percent target (median inflation expectations for December 2017 were 19.7 percent in
October, slightly below the 20 percent expected in September). The construction and retail
sectors completed the second stage of their annual wage negotiations, which led to annual
salary increases of slightly below 40 percent in both cases.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit widened in September, with primary spending increasing at
close to 37 percent (y/y), mainly reflecting increase in transfers to the private sector following
the utilities tariff rollback. The authorities have announced a bonus in December for those
receiving the minimum pension and beneficiaries of social transfers, with an estimated fiscal
cost of around 0.2 percent of GDP. The first round of the tax amnesty ended on October 31
with a better-than-expected result of about US$4.6 billion declared in cash terms.
Debt issuances and FX reserves. The Treasury successfully issued 7 and 10 years fixed-rate
peso bonds in October. Although conducted in the domestic market, the transactions attracted
substantial interest from foreign investors, generating FX inflows that increased reserves to
close to US$40 billion in late October (the highest level since mid-2013, up from around
US$30 billion at end September). This allowed the central bank to pay back a US$2.5 billion
loan from the BIS. The province of Buenos Aires managed to raise US$750 million, totaling
US$3 billion year-to-date, while Santa Fe raised US$250 million in its first ever international
debt sale.
Legislative progress. The lower house approved with a large majority the 2017 Budget with
an overall deficit target for next year of -4.2 percent of GDP as in the original proposal. The
Budget contains the obligation for provinces to reduce the fiscal deficit by 10 percent next year
relative to the 2016 outturn. The lower house also approved a bill that limits government’s
authority to reallocate spending without Congressional approval to 7.5 percent of total
spending in 2017, falling to 5 percent in 2018. Finally, the lower house approved a bill that
redesigns an institutional framework for public-private partnership investment projects. All
bills now move to the Senate for final approval.

Statement by Mr. Torres, Executive Director, on Argentina
November 9, 2016
This is Argentina’s first Article IV Consultation in ten years. In that period Argentina was
the only G20 member that did not open its books to the Fund’s scrutiny. That has radically
changed. Since December 2015, Argentina’s statistics agency recovered its independence and its
reports’ integrity. As I will explain below, Argentina is now looking its problems in the eye and
tackling them decisively. It is also complying with its responsibilities with the international
community, and as such, my authorities have consented to the publication of this Article IV
report. I turn now to address the policies that are being implemented to redress Argentina’s
macroeconomic imbalances.
Populism left the country in tatters. By December 2015 Argentina was running down its
reserves, despite having imposed self-inflicting restrictions in access to foreign exchange. The
country was bound to a balance-of-payment crisis, but the previous government kept kindling
domestic demand by subsidizing consumption and over-staffing the public sector.1 Imports
essential to the industry were delayed or simply blocked, putting firms and jobs at serious risk.
Decadent public infrastructure, high transaction costs, and the practice of protecting cronies and
using the tax-agency to bully “unruly” entrepreneurs made Argentina a “no-go” zone for
investors. Productivity and competitiveness plunged2, the economy stagnated (since 2011) and
entered in a recession cycle in Q4 2015. Fiscal deficits were handsomely financed by moneyprinting and deposits at public institutions. Inflation was close to 30 percent (according to private
estimates, as nobody trusted the “Orwellian” official figures). The crisis was imminent. What has
changed?
Change is everywhere. I do not want to sound self-complacent because problems are still
looming large, yet it is only fair to note that in just 11 months in office President Macri’s
administration has achieved much more than what we could have reasonably expected. To begin
with, the crisis was averted and after 9 years of rigging statistics, economic agents are once again
believing in the official word.
Disassembling the bomb. Foreign exchange controls were successfully dismantled. The country
has now a single and floating exchange rate and access to foreign currencies is unrestricted.
Export taxes were eliminated (except for those on soy-beans, which were reduced) and the
litigation with creditors that had held-out from Argentina’s debt restructuring was successfully
settled. This allowed the country to regain access to credit markets. In April 2016, for the first

being accountable for over 80 percent of this increase.

time in 15 years, Argentina could tap international capital markets issuing bonds for US$ 16.5
billion. The issuance was four times oversubscribed and the money was mostly used to settle the
claims of the aforementioned holdout creditors, putting behind 15 years of litigation.
Bridling inflation. Just a few days after taking office the government pledged to bring down
annual inflation to about 5 percent by 2019 (see target-band below) and, together with the
virtually overnight removal of foreign exchange controls, the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA)
announced the transition to an inflation-targeting regime. The aforementioned regime was
formally launched on September 26.3 As staff notes, the targets are ambitious, yet inflation is
already slowing down rapidly. In September, consumer prices increased by 1.1 percent (a far cry
from the 2.1 percent monthly average in 2012-20154) and wholesale prices just 0.4 percent.
Perhaps even more telling is that consensus expectations for 2017 are currently at 19.8 percent,
already very close to next year’s upper limit of the band.

The Central Bank’s commitment to delivering lower inflation is very clearly shown in the
reduction of monetary financing of the Treasury: BCRA transfers to the government were
reduced by half in real terms in 2016 over the previous year, and are planned to be cut even
further in 2017, when they will represent only a third of their 2015 amount in terms of GDP.
Markets are voting with their feet for tamed inflation. On October 13 the government
launched a new series of local bonds, denominated in Argentine pesos, with 10 and 7-year
maturity and with a fixed nominal interest rate. Thirteen bonds were placed and the issuance was
comfortably oversubscribed. Given Argentina’s un-glorious record of high inflation, this was
quite an achievement. However, the inverted yield-curve was even more remarkable showing
that investors were ready to accept lower yields for the longer-term bonds (15.5 percent vs. 16
percent, respectively).
Gradual and relentless fiscal consolidation. In 2015 the fiscal primary deficit was over 5
percent of GDP, the economy was in recession, and (as I will explain below) about 1/3 of
Argentineans did not have sufficient income to cover their very basic needs. This was a dramatic
situation, yet the government had no choice. It rapidly set out a roadmap for fiscal consolidation
and, as staff rightly notes, fiscal tightening will be relentless all over President Macri’s
administration. One of the first measures was to dismount energy subsidies that overall amounted
to approximately 4 percent of GDP (in 2015). Beyond being costly, these subsidies were
economically, environmentally, and socially perverse. On the one hand, they created incentives

As recorded by the Statistical Agency of the City of Buenos Aires, which published its own CPI. It should be noted
that in August, CPI as published by INDEC, was artificially low (0.2 percent) following a ruling from the Supreme
Court that required reversing gas-price increases.

for energy over-consumption; on the other hand, they benefited mostly the affluent and forced a
country with abundant gas reserves to import an increasingly large part of the gas, oil, and
electricity it needed. Prices are now being progressively reconciled with the actual cost of
production. Admittedly, this painful process has been rather tortuous, as injunctions forced the
government to temporarily reverse price increases. Nevertheless, energy subsidies are already
being progressively phased out and in 2017 savings will come close to 1 percent of GDP.
The drop in output has bottomed out. Despite a short-lived uptick in 2015 fueled by preelectoral fiscal stimulus, the economy had been stagnant since 2011 and started contracting in the
last quarter of 2015. When the new administration took office it had little wiggling room for
counter-cyclical fiscal policies. Rather, it had to face unpaid bills that had been pushed forward
by the previous administration; urgently address the aforementioned perverse structure of energy
subsidies; and remove the exchange rate controls. Moreover, it also had to pause ongoing public
works to take a close look at the integrity of pending bills. As a result, the contraction was more
prolonged and severe than expected. Nevertheless, output has bottomed out in the third quarter of
2016 and the year will end with a slightly positive growth rate. Activity is already picking up in
several sectors; most notably in construction (anticipated by a 16 percent increase in cement
deliveries in July and August) and the government’s growth projection for 2017 is 3.5 percent
(from a negative rate of 1.5 percent expected for this year). It is worth noting that the
government’s 3.5 percent growth projection is on the conservative side, as most private
consultants (including some advising the political opposition) are much more sanguine.
Some differences with staff. I do not want to take issue with staff’s projections but will note a
few points. Let me start by acknowledging staff’s difficulties in assessing changes in the quality
of public expenditures. It is always difficult to discern how improvements in quality could affect
the fiscal multiplier. The challenge for staff was compounded by the fact that Article IV
consultations were interrupted for the last 10 years. Yet, it is important to note that whatever the
“quality-enhanced” multiplier may be, the effect of public money spent on a road that is heavily
overpriced could be dramatically different from that of public money spent on a reasonably
priced road that is actually delivered.
It is also important to note that some of the staff’s projections bode ill with their assumptions.
For instance, in a world with low or squarely negative interest rates, staff assumes that
Argentina’s real interest rates will be between 4-5 percent until 2019 (Table 5). However, despite
these unusually positive interest rates, gross national savings remain almost unchanged over the
entire five-year period covered by staff’s forecast (Table 1).

Staff notes that Argentina’s banking sector is currently mostly “transactional”. This explains that
credit to GDP ratio is unusually low (13.5 percent according to staff5 and just 12 percent
according to BCRA estimates). Nonetheless, with such a low start, staff projects slightly less
than a 1 percent annual increase (average) for credit to the private sector over the five-year
period covered by the report (Table 1).
It is also important to note that staff is understating Argentina’s capacity to rebuild its gross
international reserves. Without going any further, staff is projecting US$ 36.5 billion of reserves
for end 2017, whereas by the end of October 2016 they were already standing at approximately
US$ 40 billion.6
Finally, staff is also understating the government’s fiscal effort as it fails to mention its endeavor
to re-capitalize the BCRA. Indeed, it has exchanged the non-transferable IOUs that the previous
administration had used to “buy” reserves from the central bank, with tradable bonds that are
actually paying interests (approximately US$ 1 billion since the government took office in 2016).
Argentina’s shame: a rich country with an impoverished population. In June 2015 the
previous government pretended that poverty had almost been eradicated from Argentina (just
under 5 percent of the population was deemed to be under the poverty line). As soon as the new
administration took office it decided to truly eradicate poverty, but also the practice of tailoring
official statistics to political expectations. Today, quite a different reality is exposed to the
daylight. Almost one out of every three adults is under the poverty line and about 40 percent of
children do not have sufficient means to cover basic needs. This is unforgivable in a rich country
that is just emerging from a decade of record commodity prices.
The authorities know that a vibrant economy is the best way to create jobs, restore dignity and
pull people out of poverty. However, the inherited reality is just too dramatic, leaving no time to
wait-and-hope. President Macri has publicly stated that reducing poverty is his administration’s
absolute priority and that by the end of his period he expects to be judged by how effectively he
delivers on that objective. The government is implementing very active social policies, including
many that come from the previous administration; nevertheless, for a change it is delivering
hand-outs transparently and not exchanging them for political support. Moreover, it needs to be
underscored that the government is putting special emphasis on training programs to revamp and
increase the working skills of those that have been striving in the informal economy. All in all,
Social Services will represent 64 percent of total public expenditures in 2017, which are about 15

During October 2016 they increased by approximately US$ 7 billion and by October 27 they were standing at US$

percent of GDP.7 These transfers are indispensable to help the most vulnerable deal with this
stage of relative price variations and macro-economic rebalancing.

Among the main social programs is “Plan Nacional de Primera Infancia” (National Plan for Early Childhood)
which was launched at the beginning of 2016, whose objective is to eradicate malnutrition in children under the age
of 4. In education, in 2017 the national system will include all children over the age of 3; this will benefit more than
638,000 children. Moreover, 3,000 new kindergartens will be built before 2019. Recently, a national survey
“Aprender” was conducted to gain a broad picture and learn where the educational situation stands so that the
education policy can provide adequate measures. It is also worth noting that the “Asignación Universal por Hijo”, a
program created by the previous government that reaches 3.8 million children, is being maintained, enlarged, and
enhanced and now aims to add an additional 1 million infants with increased benefits.

Other programs that transfer income to the poor will also continue, such as “Argentina Trabaja” and “Ellas Hacen”,
albeit ensuring transparency and effectively ring-fencing transfers from all political interference. Moreover, a new
law approved by Congress refunds low-income households and pensioners 15 percentage points on VAT collected
on all debit card purchases, the minimum wage will also be increased by 33 percent in three stages, and important
programs on housing, water, transport, and health are underway. SMEs are also benefiting from several measures
and increased credit.
