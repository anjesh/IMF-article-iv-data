CHILE
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 14, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Growth has been strong, led by domestic demand, but a deceleration toward
potential appears to be underway. The labor market remains tight, while inflationary
pressures are subdued. The current account has deteriorated amid swelling capital flows.
Risks: Key downside risks relate to the outlook for copper, an intensification of the euro
area crisis, and a sudden stop of capital inflows. Overheating risks remain, as a sustained
slowdown in domestic demand is not yet assured.
Policy mix: Economic policies should support the orderly slowdown in activity and
domestic demand underway. To this end, the staff recommended a tighter fiscal stance
than implied by the 2013 budget, while monetary policy could remain neutral. If
downside risks materialize, the floating exchange rate is the first line of defense and
there is room for forceful monetary and fiscal policy action to support demand, as
warranted. Staff recommended a modest structural surplus for the coming years.
Financial stability: There are no major stability issues. The staff supported the
authorities’ efforts to improve regulation and supervision, including of financial
conglomerates, and encouraged continued vigilant attention to potential financial
stability risks.
Medium term: Achieving sustained, strong and inclusive growth will require actions to
tackle long-standing issues in energy, education, and the labor market.
Politics: Presidential and congressional elections will be held in November 2013.
Former President Bachelet (Socialist Party) has announced her candidacy. She and others
have called for tax, pensions, and education reforms.
Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on
macroeconomic policy and structural reform priorities. In line with Fund advice, the
authorities accelerated the withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus injected in 2009. Further, the
ongoing substantial financial sector reform agenda addresses FSAP recommendations.
Other recent reforms are in line with challenges staff have noted, such as raising labor
force participation and productivity and reducing income inequality.

Chile’s economic performance in recent years has been impressive. The rebound

fiscal rule—has enhanced policy clarity, reinforced Chile’s
resilience to shocks, and allowed for vigorous policy responses when needed, as after the
global financial crisis and the earthquake. Chile has the highest sovereign debt rating ever for
any Latin American country.
External conditions. Chile has benefited from strong demand and high prices for copper, its
principal export (which accounts for over half of Chile’s exports), and from easy global
financial conditions. But the global copper boom appears to be coming to an end.

2.
The outlook is bright but with important challenges. The key near-term challenge is
to support a soft landing in the economy in the context of a widening current account deficit,
swelling capital inflows, and an uncertain outlook for copper. The medium and long-term
challenge is to foster sustained growth without the boost from rising copper prices and against
the headwind of a stagnating working-age population. While Chile’s strong policy frameworks
and investor-friendly environment will continue to support growth, further actions are needed to
achieve a sustained improvement in productivity growth.

CURRENT CONDITIONS
3.

Economic activity, which surprised on the upside in 2012, has slowed in 2013.

•

2012. Real GDP growth came in at 5½ percent compared with 4.7 percent projected in last
year’s staff report, powered by surprisingly resilient private domestic demand. Mining
investment was particularly strong. Private consumption was boosted by employment and
real wage growth, whereas consumer credit growth continued to moderate. Booming
domestic demand and a slightly positive (and widening) output gap raised overheating
concerns—especially as the current account deteriorated rapidly.

performance from a business cycle accounting perspective.

confidence, both of which remain firm. And even if
recent developments do mark a turn in the cycle, supply conditions remain tight. This is most
clearly evident in the labor market: unemployment has fallen markedly to a historically low
6.4 percent and there are reported shortages in agriculture, mining, and construction.

4.
Meanwhile, fiscal policy has provided some dampening effect. The budget recorded
a small surplus in 2012 as the government saved revenue overperformance and kept spending
(notably current transfers and capital) below budget. The structural deficit improved to
½ percent of GDP, handsomely beating the authorities’ 1 percent target two years ahead of time.
On this basis, the fiscal impulse—measured by staff as the change in the non-mining structural
primary balance—was negative (mildly) for the third year in a row. The government thereby has
clawed back much of the stimulus injected in 2009. Expenditure grew 3.7 percent y/y in real
terms in 2013Q1.
5.
Inflation has been surprisingly low and declining. The principal factors behind this
development seem to include the peso appreciation last year, evident in tradable inflation; a

And the current account has deteriorated
further. The current account, which shifted from a surplus in 2010 to a deficit in 2011,
deteriorated further in 2012 and early 2013 (it was 4 percent of GDP in 2013Q1 (12 month basis)).
Resilient domestic demand has boosted imports, while exports have suffered from the
weakening of still high copper prices and torpid demand in the euro area, Japan, and in key
regional partners (Argentina, Brazil). The deficit is financed mostly by foreign direct investment,
though within FDI, the share of debt liabilities jumped to one third in 2012 from nil in 2007–09.
8.
These developments have raised balance of payments risks. The widening current
account deficit and the increased reliance on debt financing have increased balance of payments
stability risks and Chile’s exposure to sudden stops. But there are mitigating considerations:
•

REER. The real effective exchange rate is still only about 10 percent above its 1996-2012
average (as of April 2013), despite Chile’s sizeable terms of trade gains over the last decade.

•

S-I. From a savings-investment perspective, there has been a decline in saving, but the major
factor behind the swing in the current account is the increase in private investment,
predominantly in mining and energy.

•

Exports. The bulk of the drop in Chile’s exports in 2012 was to markets with weak demand,
and exports should be helped by the projected recoveries in Chile’s trading partners. Also,
Chile’s non-mining exports have not lost their global market share.

•

IIP. More broadly, Chile’s international investment position (level and changes) remains
robust, and the external debt is sustainable under a range of adverse scenarios (Annex I).

On balance, staff’s view, corroborated by EBA and CGER estimates, is that the peso is on the
strong side, but not clearly overvalued. The main concern is the current account deficit, though it
is not large enough to present immediate stability or sustainability risks.
9.
Macro-financial risks are contained. There are no clear signs of generalized asset price
or credit bubbles:
•

•

Banks. While credit growth remains quite strong across
all loan categories, it is on a declining trend and staff
analysis does not find evidence of a “credit boom.” 3
Nonperforming loans are low and fully provisioned, and
indicators on bank capital adequacy, liquidity, and
profitability remain healthy. That said, mid-sized banks
(about one-third of system assets) are expanding rapidly,
particularly in cyclical sectors like real estate, and with a
relatively high reliance on wholesale funding.
Nonbanks. The major players are insurance companies
and pension. The solvency of the insurance sector
(mainly annuities) appears adequate, according to the
Superintendence of Securities and Insurance, and the
sector’s investment returns improved in 2012. The
privately-managed pension system does not in itself
pose financial stability risks, and pension funds’
investments appear diversified both as regards fixed
versus variable income and domestic versus foreign.

•

Households/corporates. Household indebtedness has remained broadly stable in recent
years at about 55 percent of disposable income, while firms have taken advantage of easy
liquidity conditions to increase their indebtedness to about 90 percent of GDP. Neither level
seems high from an international perspective. For firms, currency mismatches have remained
limited, but profits and liquidity conditions have worsened compared with pre-crisis,
especially in construction and trade sectors that have the largest share of commercial debt.

•

Real estate. Real estate activity (supply and demand) has been dynamic. While residential
housing prices in aggregate do not suggest bubbles, these averages hide considerable
variation and some regions have seen substantial price increases that could spill over to
other parts of the country. One sign of incipient froth in the housing market is the jump in
average loan-to-value ratios to above 85 percent since late 2011, as highlighted in recent
central bank financial stability reports. Another issue is the above-mentioned worsening in
construction companies’ financial strength. As for construction, while residential housing
activity seems to be cooling off, commercial real estate (for which data are spotty) remains
hot with a substantial amount of office space being completed in 2013-14.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Barring unpleasant surprises, the baseline outlook is for a deceleration in domestic
demand and activity in 2013. Staff projects growth at 4.6 percent in 2013 and thereafter,
broadly in line with potential growth. Private investment will cool after three years of high
growth, in part as post-earthquake reconstruction winds down, while private consumption will
lose pace in line with recent employment and consumer credit developments. The fall in copper
prices will also impart a dampening effect although overall exports are poised to benefit from a
gradual recovery in partner countries. Staff sees fiscal policy injecting some stimulus in 2013. The
current account deficit would rise further in 2013 (to 4½ percent of GDP) and decline thereafter.
Inflation will move toward 3 percent by 2014, in line with market expectations.
11.
But the outlook is surrounded by considerable uncertainty and risk relating to the
twists and turns of the global economy and the strength of the cyclical changes in Chile: 4
Copper prices. The policy frameworks and the floating
currency have reduced Chile’s vulnerability to copper
prices. Still, a large and lasting copper price fall, e.g.,
triggered by a fall in investment in China (which
consumes 40 percent of world copper) would have
major effects on the current account and foreign
direct investment, public finances (14 percent of
central government revenue comes directly from
copper in 2012), and medium-term growth prospects.
Staff analysis suggests that a 10 percent decline in
copper prices reduces GDP by 0.8 percent over 8
quarters. 5

European financial stress. Spillovers via Spanish bank subsidiaries, which have a large
presence in Chile, have thus far not been important and the banking system’s direct funding
exposure to European banks is small. That said, intensified euro area distress could have a
major effect on confidence and funding for banks and corporations. 6 A slump in Europe
would also hurt Chile’s exports (about 15 percent of Chile’s exports go to the euro area).

These risks are events that could materially alter the baseline path (the most likely scenario in staff’s view). The
likelihood of risks listed in the table is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline.

Sudden stop. The current account deficit and the gross external financing requirement
(18 percent of GDP in 2013) expose Chile to sudden-stop risks (e.g., triggered by a disorderly
exit from unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies). Short-run effects could
involve sizable depreciation—though balance sheet effects would be contained by the lack of
important currency mismatches in the economy—and the above-mentioned effects on
funding. At the same time, foreign direct investment, which is the dominant type of capital
inflow to Chile, tends to be less susceptible to abrupt reversal than short-term capital but
would be affected by a fall in copper prices.

•

Overheating. Although this risk has lessened recently, a sustained moderation in domestic
demand is not yet assured. Demand could surprise on the upside, fueled by capital inflows,
credit expansion, and real wage growth. In such a scenario, the real exchange rate would
appreciate, inflation rise, and the current account deficit widen further—increasing further
Chile’s exposure to external shocks.

12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the contours of the staff’s views on the outlook
and risks. However, they considered that the current slowdown in activity has materially
diminished both the overheating risk and those associated with a sudden stop. The authorities
noted that the floating exchange rate is a key shock absorber and would help mitigate the effect
of external shocks, e.g., further declines in copper prices, on the current account deficit.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Supporting the Soft Landing
13.
To support the ongoing moderation in activity, staff suggested that the authorities
stay the course with broadly neutral fiscal and monetary policy. This strategy, which implies
no major shift in policy stance from last year, stands the best chance of supporting a deceleration
in economic activity toward trend without triggering additional capital inflows, undue currency
appreciation, and further widening in the current account deficit.
14.
For fiscal policy, this would mean a tighter stance than implied by the 2013 budget.
The 2013 budget, if executed in full, would increase spending by about 8 percent in real terms
and inject a fiscal impulse (measured by the non-mining structural primary balance in percent of
non-mining GDP) equal to about ½ percent. Given that the economy is moderating toward
trend, staff sees no justification for an expansionary fiscal stance this year. Rather, the staff
recommended that the government seek to ensure a broadly neutral stance by keeping spending
below the budget ceiling as in the last two years (while protecting infrastructure and social
spending). This would bring the structural balance closer to zero. The authorities took note of the
staff’s view and reiterated their commitment to a structural deficit equal to 1 percent of GDP in
2013, but noted that, as in the past, they would save any revenue overperformance.
15.
Monetary policy considerations are finely balanced. Staff and the central bank
agreed that a broadly neutral stance is appropriate and that this might call for a rate cut if

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

inflation and inflation expectations remain low, domestic demand weakens faster than expected,
or the external outlook deteriorates. In this context, the authorities and many analysts also noted
that Chile’s policy rate (at 5 percent) is high among emerging markets. At the same time, staff
noted that if domestic demand does not cool as envisaged, a policy rate increase might be
needed, despite the likely effect on peso appreciation.

B. Coping with External Spillovers
16.
Chile is in a strong position to deal
with external shocks even though buffers are
smaller than before Lehman. Chile’s stellar
macro-financial performance in response to the
double-shock of the global financial crisis and the
earthquake attests to the economy’s resilience—
supported by vigorous fiscal and monetary policy
responses, though the recovery was also helped
by the rebound in copper prices.

•

Exchange rate. The floating exchange rate
(and Chile’s demonstrated lack of fear of floating) is a key shock absorber, including in a tail
risk scenario with a sharp and lasting drop in copper prices or a sudden stop. Foreign
exchange reserves could be used to avoid excessive currency depreciation, if needed.

•

Monetary policy. The low inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations would allow a
forceful monetary policy action, as in 2009.

•

Fiscal policy. The rude health of public finances—gross public debt (including debt of the
central bank and non-financial public enterprises) at 34 percent of GDP and a net asset
position for the central government, even if less than half the size than pre-Lehman in
percent of GDP, at an enviable 7 percent of GDP—provides room for the operation of
automatic stabilizers and (as a last resort) for fiscal stimulus if output falls (Box 2).

•

Liquidity operations. Finally, as post-Lehman crisis and in late 2011, the authorities should
be prepared to deploy measures to contain liquidity pressures, including expanding repo
operations, broadening the range of eligible collateral, and introducing dollar swap auctions.

C. Medium-Term Fiscal Policy
18.
Staff encouraged the authorities to consider a modest structural surplus over the
next couple of years to ensure sizable fiscal buffers. A modest surplus would stabilize
government net assets as a share of GDP on current copper price and growth projections.
Achieving and maintaining a small surplus will be challenging, though, since unlike in the past,
the spending room under the fiscal rule is unlikely to benefit from increases in structural copper
price and revenue—and the authorities may even have to confront a decline in structural copper

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

CHILE

revenue for the first time in the life of the fiscal rule. It will be important that permanent
spending commitments are matched with permanent revenue increases. The authorities broadly
agreed with staff’s considerations but noted that it would be for the next administration to
define the structural balance target for its term. The staff also welcomed the authorities’ work to
incorporate long-run expenditure and revenue projections into the budget framework
19.
The staff welcomed the creation of a Fiscal Council in April 2013. The Fiscal Council,
created in April this year, will advise the Minister on the implementation and operations of the
fiscal rule, and on any methodological changes to it. The Council, whose views will be made
public but not binding, will help enhance the rigor and transparency of the rule.

D. Reinforcing Financial Stability
20.
Chile’s financial system is generally robust but it also presents challenges. As
discussed, banks and nonbank financial institutions are well-capitalized and liquid. In the central
bank’s stress-tests, the banking system is solvent even under extreme scenarios. 7 Importantly,
financial sector developments and risks are subject to close monitoring and proactive supervision
by the central bank and the three supervisory agencies (Superintendence of Banks and Financial
Institutions (SBIF), Superintendence of Pensions (SP), and Superintendence of Securities and
Insurance (SVS)) and the proactive Financial Stability Council (created in 2011). Nonetheless,
given its size (assets equal to 200 percent of GDP), its exposures to global and euro area tail risks,
and the important presence of financial conglomerates, the financial system merits continued
robust monitoring.
21.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ ambitious policy agenda to strengthen regulation
and oversight further. Many of the reforms follow advice of the 2011 FSAP (Annex II).
•

Progress: Key recent achievements include the strengthening of the SBIF (18 percent more
staff) with a growing focus on nonbank institutions; efforts (including within the Financial
Stability Council) to identify and quantify the systemic importance of conglomerates; and the
revised credit card norm, which strengthens capital and liquidity requirements and levels
prudential regulation between bank and nonbank issuers. As part of the intended adoption
of a risk-based supervisory system for the insurance industry, SVS has issued for public
consultation its first risk-based capital model.

•

Reforms under way. The following legislation is under preparation or in Congress: the law
that introduces risk-based supervision of insurance companies; legislation to expand the
credit registry to include comprehensive credit history from banks and nonbanks; and a
revised corporate bankruptcy law. Further, the General Banking Law is being revised, focusing
on adopting Basel III capital standards (Box 3). The revisions will not address 2011 FSAP
recommendations on strengthening SBIF independence and the legal framework for bank

resolution; the staff encouraged the authorities to tackle these issues as soon as feasible.
Finally, the staff commended the work to improve supervision of conglomerates, and
encouraged continued effort on a legal framework for consolidated oversight.
22.
As for macro-prudential policies, though there are no systemic risks that warrant
immediate action, some modifications could be considered. Staff welcomed the decision to
strengthen the Financial Stability Council’s legal underpinning by establishing it in law. This law
would also enhance information sharing among the Financial Stability Council members and
information collection with regard to conglomerates. Although there is no urgent need for
macro-prudential policy changes, in view of the recent rise in average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
to about 85 percent (high by international standards), staff recommended that some form of
LTV and debt-to-income (DTI) regulation be applied to all mortgages: currently the so-called
non-endorsable mortgages, which have grown rapidly and now account for 85 percent of
mortgages, are the only ones without LTV or DTI caps (Box 4). Other macro-prudential measures
could be considered as needed. The authorities agreed that some form of LTV measures could
be useful, perhaps linked to provisioning requirements.

E. Fostering Strong and Inclusive Growth over the Medium term
23.
Reinforcing the prospects for strong and inclusive growth requires concerted
actions on two fronts.

copper boom winding down, investment already at
high levels, and the scope for employment growth curbed by low unemployment and
slowing growth in working-age population (to 0.9 percent a year by 2020, from 1.7 percent in
2010), growth will depend on a sustained reinvigoration of productivity growth, including in
mining. It is unclear what explains the jump in productivity in 2012 but it would be premature
to assume it heralds a major shift in the economy’s performance.

•

Inclusiveness. There is also scope to make growth more inclusive. Chile has the most skewed
income distribution among OECD countries and its Gini index has declined only modestly to
0.52 in 2011 from 0.56 in 2003.

CHILE

24.
The staff commended the authorities on recent efforts and it was agreed that
important challenges remain. By most metrics, Chile has the best investment climate in the
region. Recent initiatives to reduce international trade costs and shorten the time it takes to start
a business (to one day) should improve the climate further. The staff also welcomed the efforts to
update Chile’s bankruptcy procedures. Key areas where further action is needed include:
•

Energy. Strengthening Chile’s energy generation and infrastructure is crucial for mediumterm growth prospects. The authorities’ plan to connect the two main electricity grids is an
important step but more action is needed to tackle costs and foster investment in the sector.

•

Education; social policies. More equal access to high-quality education and training would
help improve productivity and income inequality, while well-targeted transfer programs
would improve social mobility and skill-formation among low-income groups. The efforts to
establish an education quality assurance system, improve access to education through
scholarships and reduced costs of state-guaranteed loans, and strengthen Conditional Cash
Transfer programs are welcome.

•

Labor market. Recent measures, including subsidies to low-income women and an extended
maternity leave scheme, can help encourage higher female labor participation which in turn
would help with growth and income equality. In line with OECD recommendations, a
reconsideration of the relatively high severance payments and the rigid working hours, and
strengthened training programs could help ensure efficient labor allocation.

25.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s views. They agreed that achieving a
sustained increase in productivity is important and they were encouraged by the rebound in
productivity in 2012 that they considered mostly a trend increase. They also noted the difficulty
in reaching political consensus on labor market reforms and large hydroelectric power projects.

F. Other Issues
26.
Chile has a long record of high-quality statistics and data are adequate for
surveillance. Recent months have seen controversy surrounding the 2012 population census
and certain sub-components of the consumer price index. The staff urged prompt, transparent,
and credible resolution to these controversies. They welcomed the authorities' announcement of
a speedy audit of the population census with the involvement of an expert committee, as well as
the plans to address methodological issues in the consumer price index in a timely manner.
Furthermore, the staff supported the idea of strengthening the National Institute of Statistics’
independence, as is being proposed.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Growth in recent years has been strong, led by domestic demand, but a slow down
appears underway. Growth surprised on the upside in 2012 and on the downside in the first
quarter of 2013. These ups and downs appear to be part of a bumpy transition toward a more
sustainable rate of expansion in economic activity. The moderation in activity is also reflecting a
shifting outlook for copper prices.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

28.
The main cloud over the strong performance is the rapid shift in the current
account. The ballooning current account deficit and the increased reliance on debt financing
have raised balance of payment risks. Still, staff’s assessment is that the peso is on the strong
side but not clearly overvalued.
29.
Macroeconomic policies have been prudent. In recent years, fiscal policy has provided
a welcome dampening effect on demand, thereby helping prevent overheating and a more
substantial real appreciation and current account deterioration. Monetary policy has been on
hold since early 2012 and is broadly neutral.
30.
And macro-financial risks appear contained thanks in large part to the authorities’
active supervision and monitoring. There are no clear signs of broad asset price or credit
bubbles. Liquidity and solvency indicators and stress tests suggest that the financial sector is
generally healthy and robust. That said, some mid-sized banks are expanding fast, with relatively
high reliance on wholesale funding. As for real estate, aggregate price developments do not
suggest bubbles but continued close monitoring will be important, including of commercial real
estate construction which remains very dynamic.
31.
The near-term priority is to support the ongoing moderation in domestic demand
and activity, amid swelling capital inflows and a widening current account deficit. In this
context, a neutral fiscal stance would be desirable and can be achieved through a tight grip on
spending in the remainder of the year, and saving any revenue over performance. This would
bring the structural balance closer to zero.
32.
There is a great deal of uncertainty and risks surrounding the outlook stemming
both from real and financial channels. The main downside risks to the outlook are a sharp and
lasting drop in copper prices, re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area, or a sudden stop
in capital inflows. At the same time, there is also a chance that domestic demand does not abate
as envisaged, raising overheating risks.
33.
Monetary policy should be ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook
and fiscal automatics stabilizers should be allowed to operate unimpeded. As a last resort,
there is ample space for fiscal stimulus if output falls. The floating currency provides a natural
buffer against external shocks and the ample reserves could be used to avoid excessive
depreciation.
34.
Further strengthening of the medium-term fiscal framework is appropriate. Staff
recommends aiming for a small structural surplus over the next few years, as this would help
maintain strong fiscal buffers while stabilizing net assets as a share of GDP. The establishment of
the Fiscal Council is welcome as it further strengthens the transparency of the fiscal framework.
Staff also commends plans to incorporate long-run expenditure and revenue projections into the
budget framework.
35.
The staff applauds the authorities’ proactive work on financial stability issues.
Recent progress in strengthening supervision of nonbanks and financial conglomerates is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

CHILE

welcome. Current legislative initiatives, notably the General Banking Law, the law on the Financial
Stability Council, the law on risk-based supervision of insurance companies, the legislation to
expand the credit registry, and the corporate bankruptcy law, will strengthen prudential
oversight. Looking ahead, the broad-based banking regulation reform scheduled for this year will
be an important improvement. However, addressing pending FSAP recommendations, including
a legal framework for consolidated oversight of financial conglomerates, should remain a priority.
And while there are no systemic risks that warrant immediate action, the authorities should
consider extending some form of loan-to-value and debt-to-income regulation to all mortgages.
36.
The medium-term challenge is to foster sustained and inclusive growth. Boosting
productivity and labor force participation will be needed to sustain growth without the benefit of
the tailwind of rising copper prices and with slowing growth of working-age population. To this
end, key areas for further reform include: make access to high-quality education and training
more equal, and consider well-targeted social transfers to spread growth benefits; promote
investments in the energy sector to ensure sufficient and competitive energy supply; and make
the labor market more flexible.
37.
A prompt and transparent resolution of the recent statistical controversies would
protect Chile’s long tradition of high quality data. Staff welcomes authorities’ outreach efforts
among local analysts and data users, and their plans to obtain advice from international experts.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. What Explains the Peso Movements?1/
The Chilean peso usually moves in tandem with copper prices, but there have been episodes when it
deviates, e.g., in the period July 2012-May 2012 when the peso appeared stronger than what could be
explained by copper prices (in recent weeks the gap has

The following explanatory variables are used: copper
price, relative U.S./Chile CPI, the spread between the
yields on 90-day Chilean and U.S. government bills, and VIX (the implied volatility of S&P 500 index
options)−a common measure of global financial distress. The regression also includes dummy variables to
capture the last two foreign exchange interventions by the Central Bank of Chile (April-December 2008 and
January-December 2011) and the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve to capture the effect of quantitative
easing (QE).

The model fits the in-sample dollar/peso exchange rate movements well. A 10 percent increase in copper
prices would strengthen the peso by about 1.7 percent against the dollar over the long run. Higher ChileU.S. interest spread would strengthen the peso. Higher global financial distress, in contrast, would lead to a
stronger dollar. The Central Bank’s interventions in 2008 and 2011 did seem to help weaken the peso,
although only by about 3½ and 2½ percent, respectively. The result also suggests that QE3 could lead to an
appreciation of the peso against the dollar by about 2 percent.

Box 2. The Strength of Government Finances
The Chilean central government is a net creditor. The net asset position at end-2012 equaled about
7 percent of GDP. The average net position among emerging markets is negative 24½ percent of GDP.
Chile’s consolidated public sector has a net asset position of some 2 percent of GDP.
Gross assets include the two sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) as well as
other instruments. The stabilization fund (ESSF) currently stands at
about 5½ percent of GDP and represents a flexible fiscal buffer that
can be used to cover deficits and amortizations. The pension reserve
fund (PRF) stands at about 2¼ percent and is earmarked to cover a
fraction of pension related outlays starting in 2016. Further, the
government currently holds about 3½ percent of GDP in other liquid
foreign currency denominated assets which will be in part used in the
near term to strengthen the ESSF and establish a US$4bn (1.5 percent
of GDP) Education Fund.
Central government gross debt is relatively low (equal to 12 percent of
GDP), and would remain comfortable under various shocks (see Annex
I). Also, recent Fund research finds that Chile could withstand tail
event-type of shocks—even responding with expansionary policies—
without putting fiscal solvency at risk (debt would remain below 40
percent of GDP).1/
Contingent liabilities are relatively small. The net present value of
contingent liabilities amounted to 3.7 percent of 2012 GDP (or
0.02 percent of GDP on an annual flow basis). 2/

Box 3. Chile and Basel III
The capital and liquidity requirements within the Basel III framework are due to be implemented over 201519. Estimations carried out by the central bank and the supervisor of banks and financial institutions, and
liquidity and solvency stress tests carried out by the 2011 FSAP show that these requirements would not be
particularly difficult for Chilean banks to meet. The authorities are working to adopt the main elements of
Basel II and III, but no formal road map for Basel III has been announced.
Formally, Chile’s capital adequacy requirements follow Basel I standards, with complementary central bank
regulation bringing in elements of Basel II and III. There are no specific capital charges for operational risk,
but some capital (based on the 1996 Market Risk Amendment of the Basel I Capital Accord) must be held in
respect of market risk. Preliminary estimates by the central bank show that capital levels are above the
minimum level agreed under Basel III and it therefore appears that the new capital standards would not be
overly restrictive for Chilean banks.1

The legal framework already includes a leverage ratio (Basel III includes a leverage ratio but details are yet to
be finalized). The system’s leverage (as measured by Tier 1 capital to assets) has always exceeded 6 percent
over the last decade.
For the liquidity standards, the Chilean regulatory framework establishes 30- and 90-day mismatch limits in
domestic and foreign currencies. The liquidity stress tests for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable
funding ratio (NSFR), conducted in the context of the 2011 FSAP Update show that the banking system is
well positioned to meet the LCR by 2015 and the NSFR by 2019.2
___________________________

Regarding systemic capital surcharges, a higher capital adequacy ratio (from 10 to 14 percent) is temporarily required
(for no less than one year) when a merger or acquisition would result in a bank with a market share above 15 percent.

In 2012, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed on a revised framework for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio
with an extended phase-in period. The design of the Net Stable Funding Ratio is under discussion.

and companies. It will be managed by the Superintendence of Banking and Financial Institutions (SBIF).

and standardized residential
and commercial property

The Central Bank published residential housing price data back to 2001 in December 2011 and December 2012, and commercial real

price indices (M, M)

estate data in June 2012. The data compose three indices: hedonic prices, mixed adjustment, and total sales. The working group on
Housing Market of the Financial Stability Council (FSC) has produced data on Loan-to-Value ratios.

Develop a strategy to ensure

The 2008 Pension Reform contained several measures to address the issue of low pension and replacement rates, including the

adequate replacement rate

introduction of a new solidarity pillar to prevent old-age poverty and measures to reduce the gender gap in old-age income (e.g.

for retirees (H, M)

division of balance in case of divorce). To increase coverage, subsidies for young workers and a gradual mandatory participation of
independent workers were introduced (2012 was the first year of the phase-in transition).The mechanisms for voluntary pension
savings with tax incentives were improved and widened. The effectiveness of these measures has been under evaluation in this
period; particularly the collective voluntary saving mechanism which has not been successful and will require modifications.
More recently, the Superintendence of Pensions (SP) has developed two new methodologies to measure and forecast replacement
rates. One model uses administrative and survey data at the individual level. The other is a pension risk model, which is used in a
public web-based pension simulator that allows users to estimate their pension under different return assumptions. Since its
launching, the simulator has averaged 10 thousand visits per month. The Pension Supervisors has launched a web tool for members
to check if employers have paid contributions on behalf of workers. There is also ongoing joint work with the OECD on computing
replacement rates. These efforts should lead to an updated assessment of replacement rates, based on which further reforms will be
considered.

Strengthen the independence

The Government has prepared a draft law to be submitted to Congress in 2013, which envisages improving governance of the

In 2012, an FSAP implementation workshop for securities regulators was organized with the help of the Toronto Centre. The SVS has
established an action plan to detect gaps in the implementation of the CPSS IOSCO principles of Financial Market Infrastructures.
Advancing on the implementation of the principles, the SVS will change the norm on management of integral risk and the rule about
credit and liquidity risk, and enact, after proper studies about the issue, a new rule on corporate governance and a new rule on trade
repositories.
In April 2011, the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), SVS, SBIF, and the SP issued regulations against corruption of senior government
officials. They established criteria to define Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), and procedures for financial intermediaries to determine
the source and destination of funds of such persons. In addition, all entities supervised by the UAF are required to register all
transactions of PEP and inform of any suspicious operations. Progress has been made on GAFISUD recommendation to require
foreign subsidiaries to inform about activities carried out in countries that are not in compliance with the set standards. In 2011, the
UAF initiated 306 sanctionary processes and 268 between January and September of 2012.
IMF’s Legal Department has provided technical advice to the Chilean authorities on the development of their national AML/CFT
strategy. On March 14, 2013 the ministers of Interior and Finance jointly launched the “ National strategy against money laundering,”
a task force (involving more than 20 public institutions) aiming to provide a diagnosis of the situation of the public sector and provide
concrete solutions for the challenges identified. The authorities are expecting to conclude this process during the second half of this
year. Chile is still under an enhanced follow up process with GAFISUD given the existence of outstanding issues regarding compliance
with key AML/CFT recommendations.
There have been no changes to date.

The Finance Ministry, Central Bank, and the SBIF conducted a joint crisis exercise in 2011, coordinated by Crisis Management
Analytics. The Financial Stability Council is currently reviewing lessons from the exercise, and plans to prepare a cooperation protocol
based on those lessons. In addition, there has been progress in enhancing the supervision of conglomerates. As mentioned above, a
draft bill will be submitted to Congress to provide the FSC a legal framework and to strengthen the capacity of supervisors to request
information on conglomerates.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 5, 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The National Institute of Statistics (INE)
regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC)
also publishes comprehensive macroeconomic and financial data. The Ministry of Finance
publishes fiscal data.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
National Institute of Statistics: http://www.ine.cl/
Central Bank of Chile: http://www.bcentral.cl/
Ministry of Finance: http://www.minhda.cl/
Recent Developments: The Central Bank started to publish housing and commercial real estate
price data in 2012, which allows better monitoring and identification of risks. The National
Institute of Statistics (INE) has announced that it will revise the methodology for measuring the
clothing sub-index, which has a downward bias, and to review the methodology for three other
sub-indices (rents, domestic services, and electronics guidelines). Based on the 2011-2012
Household Budget Survey, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be updated. As noted, the new CPI
will include improved methods regarding imputed rents, seasonal items and quality adjustment.
Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May 17,
1996.

A data ROSC was published September 17,
2007.

Reporting to STA (Optional)
The CBC uses the standardized report forms (SRFs) to report monthly data for the central bank,
other depository corporations (ODCs), other financial corporations (OFCs), and monetary
aggregates. However, data for the ODCs exclude savings and credit cooperatives and OFCs
exclude investment funds, general funds, housing funds, foreign capital investment funds,
factoring societies, leasing companies, and financial auxiliaries.
The CBC reports all core and 7 of 28 encouraged financial soundness indicators on a monthly
basis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 8, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On July 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Chile, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.1
Background
After growing strongly over the past three years, the economy appears to be decelerating
toward potential. Chile recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis and the February 2010
earthquake, and the growth surprised on the upside in 2012, powered by strong private
domestic demand—in particular investment in mining. Real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth slowed in the first quarter of 2013 to 4.1 percent (year on year) from 5.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2012. Credit growth has been on a declining trend although is still quite strong.
The labor market remains tight, with the unemployment rate at a historically low level.
The current account, which shifted from a surplus in 2010 to a deficit in 2011, deteriorated
further in 2012 and early 2013. Imports remained robust, underpinned by resilient domestic
demand, while exports have suffered from the weakening of still high copper prices and lower
demand in the euro area. The current deficit is financed mostly by foreign direct investment
(FDI) (about half to the mining sector), though within FDI, the share of intercompany loans has
increased significantly in recent years. Both gross capital inflows, in particular FDI, and outflows
increased significantly in 2012, but net inflows declined as a result of increased portfolio
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to Headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
The executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that
a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
outflows by Chilean pension funds. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
Inflation has been low and declining, as a result of the peso appreciation last year, an increase
in labor productivity, and falling energy prices. There is also downward bias in at least one
component of the consumer price index, but this bias does not seem to materially change the
inflation picture. Inflation expectations remain anchored at the official target of 3 percent. The
central bank has left the policy rate at 5 percent, a broadly neutral rate, since January 2012.
The government recorded a small fiscal surplus in 2012 as it saved revenue overperformance
and underspent the budget. The structural deficit improved to ½ percent of GDP, beating the
authorities’ 1 percent target two years ahead of time. The fiscal impulse—measured as the
change in the non-mining structural primary balance—was negative (mildly) for the third year in
a row, provided some welcome dampening effect. The 2013 budget targets a structural deficit of
1 percent, and would inject some fiscal impulse.
Macro-financial risks are contained. Despite strong domestic demand, capital inflows, and
ample liquidity, there are no clear signs of generalized asset or credit bubbles. The banking
system is sound−banks are well-capitalized and liquid, and nonperforming loans are low and
fully provisioned. That said, there has been a marked increase in average loan-to-value ratios in
mortgages since late 2011, and some mid-sized banks are expanding fast, with relatively high
reliance on wholesale funding.
Real GDP is expected to grow 4.6 percent in 2013, broadly in line with potential growth. The
current account deficit is expected to widen further in 2013 amid lower copper prices. Inflation is
expected to move toward 3 percent over the next year. The near-term challenge is to support a
soft landing in the context of a widening current account deficit, swelling capital inflows, and an
uncertain outlook for copper. Boosting productivity growth is a key medium-term challenge.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Chile, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Growth in recent years has been strong, led by domestic demand, but a slow down appears
underway. Growth surprised on the upside in 2012 and on the downside in the first quarter of
2013. These ups and downs appear to be part of a bumpy transition toward a more sustainable
rate of expansion in economic activity. The moderation in activity is also reflecting a shifting
outlook for copper prices.
The main cloud over the strong performance is the rapid shift in the current account. The
ballooning current account deficit and the increased reliance on debt financing have raised
balance of payment risks. Still, staff’s assessment is that the peso is on the strong side but not
clearly overvalued.
Macroeconomic policies have been prudent. In recent years, fiscal policy has provided a
welcome dampening effect on demand, thereby helping prevent overheating and a more

3
substantial real appreciation and current account deterioration. Monetary policy has been on
hold since early 2012 and is broadly neutral.
And macro-financial risks appear contained thanks in large part to the authorities’ active
supervision and monitoring. There are no clear signs of broad asset price or credit bubbles.
Liquidity and solvency indicators and stress tests suggest that the financial sector is generally
healthy and robust. That said, some mid-sized banks are expanding fast, with relatively high
reliance on wholesale funding. As for real estate, aggregate price developments do not suggest
bubbles but continued close monitoring will be important, including of commercial real estate
construction which remains very dynamic.
The near-term priority is to support the ongoing moderation in domestic demand and activity,
amid swelling capital inflows and a widening current account deficit. In this context, a neutral
fiscal stance would be desirable and can be achieved through a tight grip on spending in the
remainder of the year, and saving any revenue over performance. This would bring the
structural balance closer to zero.
There is a great deal of uncertainty and risks surrounding the outlook stemming both from real
and financial channels. The main downside risks to the outlook are a sharp and lasting drop in
copper prices, re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area, or a sudden stop in capital
inflows. At the same time, there is also a chance that domestic demand does not abate as
envisaged, raising overheating risks.
Monetary policy should be ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook and fiscal
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate unimpeded. As a last resort, there is ample
space for fiscal stimulus if output falls. The floating currency provides a natural buffer against
external shocks and the ample reserves could be used to avoid excessive depreciation.
Further strengthening of the medium-term fiscal framework is appropriate. Staff recommends
aiming for a small structural surplus over the next few years, as this would help maintain strong
fiscal buffers while stabilizing net assets as a share of GDP. The establishment of the Fiscal
Council is welcome as it would further strengthen the transparency of the fiscal framework. Staff
also commends plans to incorporate long-run expenditure and revenue projections into the
budget framework.
The staff applauds the authorities’ proactive work on financial stability issues. Recent progress
in strengthening supervision of nonbanks and financial conglomerates is welcome. Current
legislative initiatives, notably the General Banking Law, the law on the Financial Stability
Council, the law on risk-based supervision of insurance companies, the legislation to expand
the credit registry, and the corporate bankruptcy law, will strengthen prudential oversight.
Looking ahead, the broad-based banking regulation reform scheduled for this year will be an
important improvement. However, addressing pending Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) recommendations, including a legal framework for consolidated oversight of financial
conglomerates, should remain a priority. And while there are no systemic risks that warrant
immediate action, the authorities should consider extending some form of loan-to-value and
debt-to-income regulation to all mortgages.

4
The medium-term challenge is to foster sustained and inclusive growth. Boosting productivity
and labor force participation will be needed to sustain growth without the benefit of the tailwind
of rising copper prices and with slowing growth of working-age population. To this end, key
areas for further reform include: make access to high-quality education and training more equal,
and consider well-targeted social transfers to spread growth benefits; promote investments in
the energy sector to ensure sufficient and competitive energy supply; and make the labor
market more flexible.
A prompt and transparent resolution of the recent statistical controversies would protect Chile’s
long tradition of high quality data. Staff welcomes authorities’ outreach efforts among local
analysts and data users, and their plans to obtain advice from international experts.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
