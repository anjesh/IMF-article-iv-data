Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with the Philippines
Approved by James Gordon and Tessa van der Willigen
December 22, 2008
•

Discussions: Manila, November 5–14, 2008. The mission met: Finance Secretary Teves, Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Tetangco, Budget Management Secretary Andaya, National
Economic Development Authority Secretary Recto, other senior government officials, and private
sector representatives.

•

Team: Messrs. I.H. Lee (Head), Eskesen, Iizuka (all APD), Botman (FAD), Halikias (SPR),
Ree (MCM), and Baqir (Resident Representative). Mr. Warjiyo (OED) attended some of the
meetings.

•

Consultation focus: Near-term financial sector and macroeconomic policies to safeguard
domestic and external stability in the context of adverse global trade and financial spillovers.
Medium-term policies to lower vulnerability.

•

Policy dialogue: In recent years, the exchange of views with the Philippine authorities has been
frank and constructive. Fund advice has found particular traction in the areas of fiscal
consolidation, building a credible monetary policy regime, and sustaining reforms of the financial
system and supervision.

•

Outreach: The mission held a press conference on November 14, which was well attended and
received extensive local media coverage.

•

Exchange rate: Largely market determined. The Philippines has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange rate free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Data: Data provision is adequate overall, but shortcomings remain. The 2004 Data ROSC
identified national accounts and balance of payments statistics as weak. The authorities have
made progress in these areas with technical assistance from STA.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: GDP growth is projected to decline to 4.4 percent in 2008 and further to
3½ percent in 2009, driven by softening external and private domestic demand. A deepening
of the global economic downturn presents downside risks to this outlook. Inflation is
expected to reach 9½ percent in 2008 and decline to 6 percent in 2009, led by a decline in
commodity prices and weaker demand.
Policy issues: In light of the turbulence in the world economy and financial markets, the
discussions centered primarily on the spillovers from the worsening external environment
and policies to manage the associated near-term risks.
Staff’s views: The BSP should continue to closely monitor the banking sector, including
off-balance sheet activities. The BSP should also stand ready to apply existing liquidity
facilities flexibly. The current prompt corrective action (PCA) framework is largely adequate
to deal with spillovers, but a more rules-based approach could be considered over the
medium term, and BSP staff should be legally protected against litigation. The proposed
doubling in deposit insurance in a bill before Congress is welcome, but a provision allowing
greater flexibility to raise the ceiling if needed should also be introduced. The Philippine
Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) should be recapitalized and the banking resolution
tool kit could be further enhanced. The current neutral monetary stance appropriately
balances the risks to inflation and growth, but there is scope to ease monetary policy if
downside risks to growth materialize. The exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, posing no threat to external stability. Fiscal policy could help cushion the
current slowdown, but credibility considerations related to fiscal discipline leaves only room
for a measured loosening. Looking ahead, the introduction of a formalized medium-term
fiscal framework and streamlining of government-owned and controlled corporations would
support fiscal consolidation efforts.
Authorities’ views: Bank surveillance has been strengthened and steps have been taken to
reduce risks related to off-balance sheet activities. There was agreement on the importance of
legal protection of supervisors, the need to recapitalize the PDIC, and the merit in having
flexibility to raise deposit insurance coverage further if needed. However, the current prompt
corrective action and banking resolution frameworks were considered appropriate and there
was no immediate need for enhancements. It was too early to ease monetary policy
considering the high level of inflation. Moreover, a lowering of interest rates could add to
downward pressures on the exchange rate, which would also be inflationary. However, there
would be room to ease rates if downside risks to growth materialize and inflation
expectations decline sufficiently. The exchange rate was assessed to be in line with
longer-term fundamentals, similar to staff’s assessment. Fiscal policy should play a
counter-cyclical role, but there was agreement that near-term fiscal easing should be limited
to preserve credibility. Fiscal consolidation remains a key medium-term policy objective.

I. INTRODUCTION

Following solid economic performance in recent years, the economy now faces
headwinds. Over the past three years (ending

now present challenges.

2.
Political support for reforms may wane. The government has fended off calls for a
repeal of the VAT on petroleum products following the sharp rise in oil and food prices
earlier in the year. However, pressure to delay tax policy reforms could grow as the 2010
Presidential elections draw nearer.
3.
The 2008 Article IV consultation took place in the context of a more challenging
economic and political environment. The discussions focused on policies to safeguard
domestic, including financial, and external stability, especially in light of the ongoing global
financial turmoil. They also focused on medium-term policies to lower vulnerability.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The impact of the global economic strains has been contained so far, but the
Philippine economy is not immune.
•

GDP growth moderated to 4.6 percent in the first three quarters of 2008 from
7.2 percent in 2007. The slowdown was driven by weaker external demand and
consumption as the oil and food price shock reduced real income, outweighing the
Business and Consumer Expectations for the Next Quarter

positive impact from robust remittances. Later in the year, the global financial turmoil
further weighed down business and consumer sentiment, indicators of which suggest
the moderation will continue into next year.
•

Inflation is high, but the momentum
has slowed. Headline inflation
peaked in August at 12½ percent
(year-on-year) led by higher food and
fuel prices. However, it fell to
9.9 percent in November as annual
gains in commodity prices receded.
Moreover, there is currently no
evidence of additional inflation
pressures, including from wage
adjustments.

The spillover from the global financial turmoil to domestic financial and currency
markets has intensified since September. Equity prices have declined by around
45 percent in 2008, with almost half of the decline taking place since the turmoil of
mid-September. The wealth effect has been limited, however, with less than 2 percent
of the population invested in capital markets. Measures of credit risk have increased
with (market-based) expected default frequencies of banks at elevated levels and
Philippine sovereign spreads wider by 300 bps (EMBI+ PHL) since end-August. Yet,
spreads remain 175−200 bps lower than the EMBI+ Global average, reflecting
reforms in recent years and foreign exchange reserve accumulation during good
times.

The external position has weakened and the exchange rate has depreciated.
Remittances have held up well so far, increasing by 17 percent (year-on-year) through
September, reflecting the geographical and professional diversification of the
Philippine workers (including presence in the Middle East). Even then, the current
account surplus declined during the first half of the year as external demand waned
and commodity prices increased sharply. Capital inflows also weakened during the

6
same period. Net foreign equity outflows reached US$800 million through
November, of which a third took place since end-August. Against this background,
the peso has depreciated by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar and the real effective
exchange rate by around 6 percent in 2008.

During the first half of the year, corporations saw their average profits cut by a third
due to waning demand. Nevertheless, strong profit growth in the past few years and
some pre-financing during the capital market boom have reportedly provided a
cushion to allow the large corporates to better weather the cyclical downturn in the
near term. Moreover, the peso credit market, which is still liquid, could support
somewhat higher domestic credit demand. However, smaller businesses, particularly
in trade-oriented activities, appear to be under some stress due to slowing business
and rising costs of trade credits.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS

5.

Economic activity is expected to slow over the near term.

•

Growth is projected to decelerate to 4½ percent and 3½ percent in 2008 and 2009,
respectively. On the supply side, the electronics industry is most susceptible to the
external slowdown with industry analysts expecting the U.S. book-to-bill ratio to
decline sharply given significant oversupply. Retail trade and financial services are
also expected to grow at a slower clip with consumer sentiment already at its lowest
since 2005. Staff projects inflation

Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside. Financial sector stress could
intensify if the global financial turmoil worsens or is drawn out (see Section IV.A). A
deepening of the global economic downturn would weaken the external position,
especially if remittances contract as the recession in the United States deepens and
economic activity in the Middle East slows (Box 1). Fiscal reform delays, possibly
due to the upcoming elections, could further push up financing costs as investors
charge a higher risk premium. On the upside, globally coordinated fiscal stimulus, if
it were to take place, could mitigate the downside risk.
Box 1. How Exposed is the Philippines to a U.S. Slowdown?
Philippines’ economic linkages to the United States are quite strong. Trade linkages account
for about 12 percent of GDP (including trade through third countries). Moreover, financial
linkages and remittances present channels for adverse balance sheet and wealth effects.
The correlation with the U.S. cycle has
almost doubled since the mid-1990s.
Quantitative analysis suggests that a
1 percentage point decline in
U.S. growth could lower growth in the
Philippines by about 0.4−0.6 percentage
point (directly and through other trading
partners such as China). The extent of
spillovers appears to have increased
over time—in part, this may be the
result of the development of the
electronics sector in the Philippines and
also reflect the rising importance of
remittances from the United States.

6.
The medium-term outlook depends critically on reform progress and the
duration of the global economic slowdown.
•

Growth is expected to pick up only moderately over the medium term in the baseline
scenario. As heightened risk aversion subsides and inflation recedes further, private
investment and consumption will likely strengthen. However, absent deeper tax
reforms to finance much-needed infrastructure and social spending, and measures to
tackle a weak business environment, the upside is constrained.

•

A “worse” case scenario could entail a more prolonged period of strained conditions
in the global financial system. The world economy would be in a deeper recession
than currently envisaged in the baseline, with spreads widening substantially and
domestic growth falling well below potential. Economic activity would slow
markedly and remain lackluster over the next couple of years. This environment will
likely impose significant stress on the domestic banking system and could result in an

8
extended period of bank restructuring, which in turn will further subdue economic
activity. The balance of payments position could weaken considerably with a
sustained decline in workers remittances, and the peso would be subjected to
substantial downward pressures.
7.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment. Growth in 2009 is
expected to be slightly higher than projected by staff, reaching 3.7−4.7 percent on account of
stronger domestic economic fundamentals and supportive macroeconomic and financial
sector policies (see Sections IV.A and IV.B). This was in part based on a more optimistic
view on the resilience of workers remittances. The recent decline in oil prices was not
expected to materially affect remittances from the Middle East, in part because many of the
ongoing construction projects started before the spike in oil prices and were expected to be
completed. Moreover, Filipino workers in the United States are increasingly employed in less
cyclically sensitive professions (i.e., health care). However, the authorities shared staff’s
view that the near-term economic outlook was subject to downside risks and an elevated
level of uncertainty, especially as regards external demand. The authorities expect inflation to
fall within the target range during the second half of 2009, in line with staff’s projections.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered primarily on (i) policies to manage the near-term risks related to
spillovers from the worsening external environment and (ii) medium-term policies to reduce
vulnerabilities, in particular the agenda for financial sector reform and fiscal consolidation.
A. Safeguarding Financial Stability—Tackling Global Spillovers
8.

Adverse global spillovers have so far been contained, but present challenges. 1

•

The exposure to failed and distressed global financial institutions is limited. As of
end-September 2008, direct exposures to Lehman Brothers stood at US$350 million
(3 percent of equity), but a large part has already been provisioned for. Combined
exposure to Lehman Brothers and 10 other distressed major global financial
institutions amounted to US$1.5 billion or 13 percent of banking system equity.
However, the exposures are concentrated in a few banks.

•

Banks are exposed to market risks through their large holdings of debt securities.
These account for about a quarter of total bank assets and consist primarily of
Philippine government bonds, of which about half are denominated in foreign
currency. Local banks are also exposed to credit linked notes (CLNs), issued by
international banks and tied to foreign currency-denominated government securities.
As such, changes in domestic interest rates or in sovereign spreads are leading to

1

See accompanying selected issues chapter on financial contagion for further details.

9
large mark-to-market losses. 2 Exposure to other structured products are, however,
limited.
•

Banks have increased their off-balance sheet activities since 2007 in the form of unit
trust funds and matching pools of investors with specific projects. The size of these
activities amounts to around P 1.2 trillion, or 20 percent of on-balance sheet assets.

•

Profits fell in most banks during the first three quarters of 2008. Despite increased
lending, partly driven by a drying up of external funding and depressed equity
markets, profits fell due to significant mark-to-market losses on fixed income
instruments, lower service fees, and smaller interest margins. Moreover, a few large
banks wrote down their claims on failed foreign financial institutions, particularly in
the third quarter.

•

Banks are still weighed down by legacy assets. The gross nonperforming assets
(NPA), including foreclosed properties, are still large relative to banking system
capital, and provisioning remains low. 3 Moreover, the NPA-to-equity ratio is high at
around 30 percent.

9.

The banking sector confronts these problems from a relatively strong position.

•

Nonperforming loans (NPL) have declined in the last few years, falling further during
the first half of 2008 to 5.2 percent of total loans (excluding interbank loans) and
84 percent have been provisioned for.

•

The CAR of the banking system as a whole is high by regional standards, averaging
around 15 percent by end-June 2008, although some banks are closer to the statutory
limits.

Staff calculations suggest that a 100 basis point widening in EMBI-PHL credit spreads (currently around
500 bps) results in capital losses on US$-denominated government bonds and credit-linked notes of around
3 percent of equity, leading to a ½ percentage point decline in the capital adequacy ratio (CAR).

3

Real estate (including foreclosed) holdings are generally not assessed at market value, but loss allowances are
shown in balance sheet. If all foreclosed assets were mark-to-market, a 40 percent decline in real estate prices
could wipe out 9 percent of banking capital (equivalent to a 1.5 percentage point decline in the average CAR).

10
10.
Moreover, risk-management practices have improved and surveillance has
strengthened. In line with the regional trend, commercial and universal banks adopted
Basel II in June 2007, applying the standardized approach for credit risk and either the basic
indicators approach or the standardized approach for operational risk. The implementation of
Basel II resulted in lower CARs for the banking system, around 300 basis points, due to
capital charge for operational risk and more punitive risk weights on NPLs, Real and Other
Property Acquired (ROPA), and foreign currency securities. On its part, the BSP has stepped
up its risk-based supervision in recent years, enhancing the CAMELs framework for
monitoring bank risks. 4

Policy issues and staff views
11.

The banking system is exposed to domestic and external channels of risk.

•

Through the local economy: The economic slowdown will further reduce earnings
and worsen asset quality as households, SMEs, and export-oriented firms find it more
difficult to service their debt. In this environment, it will also be harder to dispose of
the large portfolios of foreclosed properties.

•

Global spillovers: A key risk to banks stems from mark-to-market losses. For some
banks, these losses have already been significant and implied problems meeting the
asset cover requirement for Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), exacerbating
the downward pressure on the peso. Off-balance sheet entities, including trust
accounts, could entail reputational risks and other contingency risks for banks in case
of significant redemption pressures.

As a result, some of the weaker banks could be subject to heightened stress in the baseline
scenario, but especially if the global economic and financial environment deteriorates further
than envisaged and triggers additional spillovers.

4

CAMELS stands for Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to
Market Risks.

11
12.
In response, the BSP has introduced a number of measures to help address the
fallout from the global financial crisis.
•

Surveillance and communication: The BSP has enhanced its day-to-day monitoring of
the banking system and stress-testing exercises, and it has sought to assure depositors
that the banking system remains sound. However, there may be scope for stepped-up
surveillance, including closer monitoring and supervision of off-balance sheet
activities.

•

Regulatory forbearance: Largely in accordance with the provision of the
October 2008 amendments to International Accounting Standards (IAS 39), the BSP
allowed banks 5 a window up until November 14 to reclassify securities from
mark-to-market accounts to hold-to-maturity accounts and UDSCLs (unquoted debt
securities classified as loans) based on any prevailing fair value between July 1 and
November 14, 2008. 6 Also, the BSP exempted until March 31, 2009, unrealized
mark-to-market losses from the calculation of banks’ FCDU asset cover requirement.
The staff highlighted the importance of the BSP’s resolve to not let these measures
impair transparency about the soundness of financial institutions. Moreover, to the
extent pressures on emerging market bonds are expected to remain for a while, these
measures delay rather than solve the problem.

•

Liquidity support: The BSP has appropriately introduced a number of measures to
support interbank liquidity (see Section IV.B). Staff encouraged flexible application
of existing liquidity facilities as needed to stem any further stress.

13.
Strengthening the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework would be a good
preparatory measure to adequately deal with any bank distress. The current PCA
framework appears broadly adequate to deal with spillovers from the global turmoil on
individual local banks. In the short run, the BSP should be given legal authority to disclose
enforcement actions, while preserving the right for secrecy in situations where disclosure
may aggravate panic, rather than ameliorate it. Importantly, the amendments to the BSP
charter ensuring legal protection of BSP staff, a long-standing issue, should be implemented
without any further delay.
14.
The staff supports the authorities’ plan to raise the deposit insurance ceiling, but
saw scope for a more flexible framework. The proposed doubling of deposit insurance to
P 500,000 is welcome. However, to further strengthen safeguards during times of severe
5

BSP circular 628 and SEC Memorandum Circular 10 clarify that reclassification option shall not be availed to
Unit Investment Trust Funds (UITFs), mutual funds, and investment companies.

6

However, the BSP allowed reclassification of CLNs linked to foreign currency government bonds issued by
the Republic of the Philippines without bifurcating of the embedded derivatives. This diverges from the
international financial reporting standard, which requires derivatives to always be fair valued.

12
stress, the deposit insurance framework should provide for greater flexibility to raise the
ceiling if needed. 7 It will also be key to recapitalize the Philippine Deposit Insurance
Corporation (PDIC) to match the higher insurance liabilities under the new limits, and
change to a risk-based contribution structure to help foster financial soundness. 8
15.
The mission welcomes the envisaged enhancement of the banking resolution tool
kit, including through the proposed introduction of a bridge-bank facility. However, a
more flexible application of the purchase-and-assumption (P&A) tool, 9 not contingent on the
finalization of depositor payout, should also be considered. It could make takeovers more
attractive and possibly lessen the need for activation of deposit insurance. To further enhance
the effectiveness of the banking resolution framework, rights of existing shareholders of
ailing banks should be limited; restructuring decisions should be legally irreversible; and
PDIC staff should be protected against litigation.
16.

Medium-term considerations include the following:

•

Shift to a more rules-based PCA framework, including by formalizing triggers at
multiple stages of financial soundness tied to accelerated stringency of remedial
actions. This could help fast-track action on banks experiencing distress.

•

Address large overhang of foreclosed properties, which are about 50 percent larger
than the NPLs, with provisioning below 18 percent. They impair the return on capital
and also leaves banks more vulnerable to property cycles. There is benefit to selling
these properties with some haircut, rather than wait until property prices reach a
certain threshold or establish joint ventures with developers to manage these
properties. The current environment would, however, argue for a gradual sell-off.

•

Further develop capital markets to strengthen financial intermediation. Less than
250 companies are listed on the stock exchange and only a fraction of shares are
traded actively. Domestic bond markets have deepened in recent years, but
government securities still account for 95 percent of the market. These
underdeveloped capital markets reflect high industrial concentration and large
conglomerates funding their operations from retained earnings and bank borrowing.

7

The current limit is P 250,000 (US$5,300), which covers only about 14 percent of the total value of deposits.
Moreover, the PDIC capital base is small with only P 50 billion readily available in the deposit insurance fund.
The PDIC has, however, a credit facility at the BSP, and under its charter could issue its own bonds.

8

The audited net assets of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) are relatively low at 1½ percent
of system deposits (P 49 billion; end-2006). Moreover, premiums are uniformly capped at 0.2 percent of the
insured amount irrespective of risk profiles of banks.

9

Bundling certain assets and liabilities together for sale from a failed bank can sometimes help bank liquidators
better recover than selling or arranging a merger for the whole bank. This bundled sale is called P&A as the
purchaser of the assets simultaneously assumes the liabilities.

13
Improving the business climate should go in tandem with future developments of the
capital market where a strong clearance and settlement infrastructure is a key
precondition. Continued efforts to shift the public bond mix toward domestic issuance
could help deepen debt markets. Moreover, transition towards funded pension
schemes could help generate local portfolio investment demand.
The authorities’ views
17.
The authorities agreed with the basic contours of the staff’s assessment, although
they found the existing contingency framework adequate.
•

Channels of risk: They shared staff’s view on the domestic and external channels of
risk. However, they noted a number of risk-mitigating circumstances: (i) despite a
pickup in lending in recent years, the loan-to-deposit ratio is still low; (ii) sector loan
concentration is limited and NPLs have continued to fall; (iii) bank capitalization is
high and exposures to risky financial instruments are low; and (iv) corporates
generally have strong balance sheets.

•

Contingency measures: The authorities agreed with the need for a proactive approach
for remedial action and considered their existing PCA framework as adequate to deal
with banks under stress. They pointed out that a more rules-based PCA approach
would leave them with less flexibility to deal with individual bank cases, which often
differ and require a more idiosyncratic response. Legal protection of supervisors and
restriction of shareholder rights during bank restructuring were considered a priority.
They also agreed with the need to recapitalize the PDIC and saw some merit in
having flexibility to raise the deposit coverage temporarily if needed. At the same
time, they did not think a more flexible application of the P&A tool would necessarily
lead to more effective bank resolution, but could actually cause instability if it was
perceived as a restriction on depositor rights. The authorities also pointed out that
steps have been taken to reduce risks related to off-balance sheet activities, including
through the introduction of enhanced client suitability requirements and
disclosure/sales provisions of unit investment trust funds.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

18.
The authorities’ concerns have now shifted from inflation to global economic
and financial spillovers.
•

Monetary policy was tightened midyear in response to the rapid rise in inflation, but
subsequently moved to a neutral stance. The BSP raised policy rates in June, July,
and August by a combined 100 bps—taking the reverse repo rate (RRP) to 6 percent.

14
However, the BSP left rates unchanged at the October and November monetary
meetings, citing an improving inflation outlook.

The central bank has taken a number of steps to support liquidity. While peso
liquidity is still adequate, the reserve requirement was preemptively reduced by
2 percentage points to 19 percent, and the amount allocated for the rediscount
window was doubled from P 20 billion to P 40 billion. To address some segmentation
of the dollar interbank market, the BSP opened a dollar-denominated deposit window
and a short-term dollar repurchase facility. Moreover, banks have entered a
“gentleman’s agreement” to reduce their over-bought dollar positions by 50 percent,
step up interbank dollar lending, and increase scrutiny over clients’ foreign
investments.

•

The exchange rate has come under pressure from the weakening balance of payments
and a shift to long dollar positions. In response, the BSP has drawn down
US$9 billion of its foreign exchange swap position so far in 2008 and built up a
US$1.4 billion short position of nondeliverable forwards. Gross international reserves
have been kept steady at around US$36 billion (240 percent of short-term debt),
partly propped up through higher external borrowing by the BSP.

Policy issues and staff views
19.
The shift from a tightening to a neutral monetary stance was appropriate
considering the rebalancing of risks. Staff shares the BSP’s assessment that inflationary

15
pressures are beginning to recede, led by falling commodity prices and a softening demand
outlook. Moreover, the downside risks to growth and the elevated level of uncertainty
surrounding the near-term outlook are important considerations.
20.
If downside risks materialize, the policy response would depend on the nature of
the shock. In the event the economic slowdown proves protracted and inflation expectations
adjust sufficiently downwards, a likely scenario, monetary policy could be eased (Box 2). In
this case, the exchange rate should be allowed to fully adjust to the changing external
environment, limiting interventions to smoothing erratic movements. However, in the case of
a temporary financial shock arising from further global portfolio adjustment, the BSP could
use a mix of interest rate hikes and limited unsterilized intervention to support the peso. In
both cases, preserving the level of reserves at a sufficiently high level will help provide
confidence in the peso and the resilience of the financial system.
21.
The exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line with the level implied by
longer-term fundamentals. As such, it does not pose a threat to external stability. This
assessment rests on a number of observations, including (i) interventions in recent years have
been in both directions, intended to smooth erratic exchange rate changes; (ii) current
account balances projected at a constant real effective exchange rate imply only a small
improvement in the net foreign asset position over the medium term; and (iii) quantitative
estimates suggest the exchange rate does not deviate significantly from its long-term
equilibrium level, especially when taking remittances into account. 10

Incorporating remittances into the analysis suggests that the current level of the real exchange rate is even closer to
equilibrium. Moreover, this also reduces the discrepancy between the macroeconomic balance and equilibrium exchange
rate approaches (for further details, see the Selected Issues Paper chapter on exchange assessment and remittances).

Box 2. Vulnerabilities if Downside Risks Materialize
A significant slowdown in the global economy and continued financial turmoil (international
capital markets accessible but at a much higher cost and stronger capital reflows to advanced
countries) could seriously disrupt the economy.
• Financial sector: Banks will be impacted through both domestic and global channels as
discussed in Section IV.A. A number of banks could buckle and the authorities would need
to protect depositors and restructure weak but viable banks to contain the crisis.

The authorities’ views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations. It was too early to
ease monetary policy at this stage with inflation still running high despite the recent
deceleration. Moreover, the authorities were concerned that lower interest rates could add to
the downward pressures on the exchange rate, which could also fuel inflation given the large
share of imports in the consumption basket. However, the outlook for commodity prices and
the projected economic slowdown was expected to reduce price pressures. Together with
monetary easing elsewhere, this could provide them with some monetary flexibility. If

17
downside risks to growth were to materialize and inflation expectations decline sufficiently,
the authorities would stand ready to reduce policy rates. That being said, monetary policy
should not carry the burden alone, but fiscal policy should also provide counter-cyclical
impetus.
23.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of the exchange rate. They
welcomed staff’s efforts to enrich the quantitative exchange rate assessment by taking into
account remittances, an important determinant of the exchange rate in the Philippines. They
further pointed out that the peso is market determined and interventions are limited to lessen
undue volatility. This had been demonstrated clearly by the large appreciation of the peso
until end-2007 and the subsequent significant depreciation. In this regard and as part of an
ongoing discussion of the classification of the Philippine’s exchange rate system, the
authorities reiterated their concern that the Fund’s continued focus on formal and narrow
classifications of exchange rate regimes is not in sync with operational realities. Furthermore,
it could detract too much attention from the underlying economic issues at hand.
C. Fiscal Policy
24.
The 2008 budget will likely record a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP, a slight
improvement over last year’s 1.7 percent of GDP. The tax effort is expected to remain
broadly unchanged at around 14 percent of GDP as windfall gains from high oil prices will
be broadly offset by changes to the income tax law (Box 3) and weaknesses in domestic VAT
collection. On the expenditure side, higher current spending is expected to be offset by
lower-than-budgeted capital expenditure, reflecting weak absorptive capacity. Nonfinancial
public sector debt in percent of GDP is projected to rise modestly this year, due largely to a
weaker exchange rate, reversing the recent trend.

The 2009 deficit target has been revised up and financing conditions could
become more challenging in 2009. The originally envisaged 2009 budget deficit target was
½ percent of GDP, in line with plans to balance the budget in 2010. In light of the slowing
economy, the proposed deficit has been revised up to 1½ percent of GDP to accommodate
higher capital outlays and a modest increase in pro-poor spending. It now awaits Senate
approval. On this basis, the public sector gross financing requirement for 2009 is estimated at

18

Box 3. Recent Tax Policy Reforms and Options for Tax Base Broadening
Recent and planned reforms aim to stimulate investment and support household consumption,
but result in a significant revenue loss—about 0.6 percent of GDP. Reforms include:
• Personal income tax: The exemption levels for personal income taxes were raised; the optional
standard deduction (OSD) was increased from 10 percent to 40 percent of gross income in lieu of
listed allowable deductions; the OSD is now available to corporations (estimated loss of
P 20 billion).
• Corporate income tax: The corporate income tax rate to be reduced from 35 percent to
30 percent in early 2009 (estimated loss of P 26 billion).
• Personal Equity and Retirement Act (PERA): Contribution is possible up to P 50,000 per year
(P 100,000 for married couples) and entails a 5 percent tax credit. Withdrawals, after reaching
age 55, are tax exempt (estimated loss of P 2 billion).
The authorities and staff agree that, to offset the revenue loss, tax base broadening and
administration reform remain key:
• Rationalizing tax incentives: A compromise Bill currently being discussed would phase out the
income tax holiday (ITH) in six years. After it expires, companies would be subject to a lower
income tax rate of 15 percent or a 5 percent tax on gross income earned.
• Accelerating tax administration reform: Implementation of tax administration reforms agreed
with the authorities in 2005 has been slow. The priorities at the Bureau of Internal Revenue
include taxpayer registration, arrears collection, returns filing, and improving audits. Progress in
customs administration reform has been particularly poor; priorities continue to be strengthening
management controls and the integrity of the import and export clearance system and upgrading
enforcement/intelligence functions.
•

Raising and indexing excises: Unifying, raising, and indexing excise rates on tobacco and
alcohol products, as proposed in House Bill No. 3759 (estimated gain of P 31.8−P 33.8 billion).

18½ percent of GDP, of which close to 40 percent
is external. The power sector is a significant
contributor to the foreign currency financing
requirement, although this can partly be met from
past privatization proceeds. Also, gross financing
needs could increase significantly in percent of
GDP if the peso were to depreciate further or
contingent liabilities were to be realized, including
from outstanding guarantees as well as
government-linked corporations and financial
institutions.

Large deficits have emerged at the National Food Authority (NFA). The NFA
buys imported and domestically produced rice and, on average, sells at a lower price to
targeted poor or in remote regions where poverty is prevalent. With higher import volumes

19
and food prices, NFA’s deficit is projected at 1 percent of GDP this year from a broadly
balanced position in 2007.
27.
Power sector privatization remains a priority. To date, the government has
privatized around 70 percent of its generating assets (Luzon-Visayas grid), including two
generation plants this year, and plans to finalize the privatization of the generating assets by
2009. FDIs will be key for the successful completion of the privatization plan and sustainable
power sector development. In this regard, the slow adjustment of electricity-tariffs to global
input prices (e.g., oil price) and lack of transparency in the pricing mechanism are concerns
for investors.
Policy issues and staff views
28.
Staff saw some scope for a measured fiscal policy easing to cushion the
slowdown. The 2009 deficit target relies on an ambitious revenue target of 15.9 percent of
GDP. Staff projects revenues of 14.9 percent of GDP and, thus, in the absence of additional
tax efforts or some expenditure restraint, meeting the deficit target would be difficult. This
could rekindle investor concerns about the authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline,
especially in light of the declining tax effort, increasing debt-to-revenue ratio, and the current
challenging financing environment. Consequently, staff suggested that the deficit be capped
at 2 percent of GDP, the bulk of which could be financed domestically without placing undue
strain on the local market given the high level of peso liquidity in the banking system. To
achieve this deficit, without unduly squeezing expenditure, it would be preferable to raise the
tax effort through administrative and legislative measures, such as reforming sin taxes and
streamlining fiscal incentives in line with current proposals before Congress (Box 3).
Otherwise, expenditures on infrastructure, wages, and maintenance and operations will have
to be kept broadly unchanged from projected 2008 levels (in percent of GDP), while
protecting higher spending on well-targeted pro-poor programs.
29.
Plans to streamline the operations of the NFA and other government-owned and
controlled corporation (GOCCs) should move forward. Since the NFA does not target at
the household level, the authorities’ goal of protecting the poor can be better realized through
fundamental reform of NFA aimed at full cost recovery of operations and limiting its role to
providing food security. The generated savings could in turn be used for well-targeted
conditional cash transfer schemes.
30.
It is important to carry through with the planned privatization of the power
sector to promote more cost-efficient supply of electricity. In this regard, more transparent
and market-based tariff adjustments would be desirable to attract investors’ interest. At the
same time, the timing of the planned auctions should be flexible in view of the prevailing
market conditions. 11
11

See selected issues chapter on the power sector for further details.

20
31.
The introduction of a more formalized medium-term fiscal framework could
help better anchor fiscal policy. A good first step in this direction would be to submit the
medium-term expenditure framework alongside the budget to the legislature. Consideration
could also be given to adopting a Fiscal Responsibility Law, focusing on responsible and
transparent budget management, including a provision requiring that new spending or tax
proposals are fully financed. This could eventually be supplemented by the introduction of an
explicit numerical rule to anchor fiscal policy. 12
32.
Public sector debt is broadly sustainable, but staff encouraged closer monitoring
and management of contingent liabilities, including from outstanding government
guarantees. As elaborated in Appendix I, the public debt level is sustainable but sensitive to
exchange rate changes and contingent liability shocks. For example, in the event of a
10 percent of GDP increase in public debt from realization of contingent liabilities or bank
recapitalization, it would take the government five years to return debt to the pre-shock level.
Combined with a more formalized medium-term fiscal framework, closer monitoring of
contingent liabilities could help enhance the risk management of the public sector balance
sheet.
The authorities’ views
33.
The authorities agreed that the near-term fiscal easing should be measured to
strike the right balance between fiscal credibility and growth concerns. They considered
their deficit target achievable, but acknowledged that the current uncertain economic
environment presented risks to the revenue outlook. In this regard, they were hopeful that
current proposed changes to sin taxes and tax incentives could be approved by the legislature.
In the event they could not attain their revenue target, they would scale back expenditure and
agreed that a deficit cap of around 2 percent of GDP would be appropriate.
34.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal consolidation over the
medium term and were receptive to the introduction of a more formalized
medium-term framework. They agreed with staff that the need to enhance social and
physical infrastructure called for revenue-based consolidation in line with current proposals.
As staff, they saw merit in strengthening the targeting of existing cash-transfer schemes and
taking steps to further build absorptive capacity to improve execution of capital spending
programs. They also considered the gradual rationalization of NFA and the introduction of
monitorable performance targets of other GOCCs as an integral part of the consolidation
process, and were intent on finalizing the privatization of the power sector. Finally, the
authorities were interested in establishing a more formalized fiscal framework to further
strengthen fiscal management, but cautioned that this would require cooperation from
Congress, which had not supported a previously proposed Fiscal Responsibility Law.

12

See selected issues chapter on fiscal policy during downturns and alternative fiscal rules.

21
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The Philippines face a challenging economic environment, but starts from a
position of relative strength. Growth is expected to slow to 4.4 percent in 2008 and
3½ percent in 2009, led by deceleration in external demand and private consumption as
remittances level off. Inflation is projected to decline from 9½ percent in 2008 to 6 percent in
2009 as commodity prices recede further and demand eases. However, a prolonged global
downturn present downside risk to the growth outlook.
36.
Financial sector reform in recent years has strengthened bank soundness, but
the sector is exposed to domestic and external sources of risk. Supervision has been
strengthened in recent years through the upgrading of the BSP’s supervisory capacity, the
introduction of the risk-based CAMELs approach, and the adoption of the Basel II and
international accounting standards. Nevertheless, banks will not be able to escape the impact
of the economic slowdown on their earnings and asset quality. Moreover, on the external
side, a continuation of strained conditions in global financial markets could lead to further
losses on the large security holdings. External financing conditions could be tight and
off-balance sheet activities may entail reputational risks in case of severe redemption
pressures.
37.
To help forestall further fallout from the global financial crisis, the BSP should
continue to closely monitor the banking sector and retain supervisory vigilance.
Heightened surveillance should continue, including close monitoring of off-balance sheet
activities. While the relaxation of mark-to-market accounting rules has provided some relief,
it does not constitute a permanent solution and it is important that it is not allowed to impair
transparency about financial soundness. The BSP’s proactive steps to address liquidity strains
are welcome and staff encourages a flexible application of existing facilities as needed to
stem further stress.
38.
The PCA framework is broadly appropriate, but there is some scope for
improvement. The BSP should be given legal authority to disclose enforcement actions,
while preserving the right to nondisclosure if needed to avoid loss of market confidence. The
introduction of a more rules-based framework and triggers tied to increasingly stringent
remedial action could also be considered over the medium term. Concurrently and without
any further delay, the BSP charter should be amended to strengthen legal protection of
BSP staff.
39.
The proposed increase in deposit coverage to P 500,000 is welcome, but further
steps to strengthen the bank resolution framework are encouraged. Flexibility to
increase deposit insurance coverage temporarily would be important in high stress cases. The
envisaged introduction of a bridge-bank facility is welcome, but could be complemented by a
more flexible application of the purchase-and-assumption tool to strengthen the resolution
toolkit. Bank restructuring decisions should be irreversible and PDIC staff should be
protected against litigation.

22
40.
The current neutral monetary stance appropriately balances the risks to inflation
and growth, but may have to be adjusted if downside risks materialize. The credibility of
the inflation targeting framework has helped anchor inflation expectations. BSP’s commitment
to the framework was underscored when they, in mid-2008, decisively hiked rates to address
second-round effects from the commodity price shock. A protracted slowdown, now a likely
scenario, provide scope for monetary easing if inflation expectations continue to adjust
downwards. The exchange rate should in this case be allowed to adjust fully to the changing
external environment, with interventions limited to smoothing erratic movements. A
temporary financial shock, on the other hand, may call for a hike in interest rates and limited
unsterilized intervention. Even then, preserving sufficiently high reserves will help provide
confidence in the peso and the resilience of the financial system.
41.
The exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line with the level implied by
longer-term fundamentals. As such, it does not pose a threat to external stability.
Interventions in recent years have largely been in both directions, intended to smooth erratic
exchange rate changes. Moreover, quantitative estimates suggest the exchange rate does not
deviate significantly from its long-term equilibrium level.
42.
Fiscal policy should help to cushion the current slowdown. Fiscal consolidation has
significantly reduced the public debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years. However, the room for
fiscal stimulus is limited as the debt level still remains high and the tax effort has declined,
with gains from the landmark EVAT reform eroded by other tax measures. Based on this,
fiscal easing should be measured to avoid compromising credibility, capping the fiscal deficit
at 2 percent of GDP. To achieve this, the authorities should raise the tax effort through
administrative measures and tax reform. Otherwise, expenditures will have to be contained,
except for outlays on well-targeted pro-poor cash benefits.
43.
Looking ahead, a formalized medium-term fiscal framework should be
considered. A good first step would be to submit the medium-term expenditure framework
alongside the budget to the legislature. Consideration could also be given to adopting a fiscal
responsibility law, which could involve provisions requiring that new tax or expenditure
measures be fully financed. It could also involve the introduction of a numerical fiscal rule to
help anchor fiscal policy.
44.
Operations of the NFA and other GOCCs should be streamlined further and
privatization of the power sector should continue. The authorities’ goal of protecting the
poor can be better realized through fundamental reform of NFA aimed at full cost recovery of
operations and limiting its role to providing food security, using the savings for well-targeted
conditional cash transfer schemes. A comprehensive review of the operations of other GOCCs,
eventually leading to monitorable performance targets, remains a priority as well. To attract
investments in power companies, a more transparent and market-based tariff adjustment
mechanism would be desirable. The authorities should proceed with remaining power sector
privatization, although timing of the planned auctions may need to be delayed due to the
prevailing constrained market conditions.
45.

Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation be on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The Philippines’ public sector debt is broadly sustainable. In the baseline scenario, no
new measures are introduced over the medium term apart from the planned reduction in the
corporate income tax (CIT) rate in 2009 and the full-year impact of the 2008 increase in
personal income tax thresholds. In this scenario, the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt
will initially increase, mostly due to exchange rate depreciation, and then decline to
54 percent of GDP in 2013. While the debt dynamics are favorable overall, they remain
vulnerable to shocks, especially to the exchange rate and, to a lesser extent, growth.
Projected external debt dynamics are generally benign. In recent years, external debt has
steadily declined—from nearly 80 percent of GDP in 2002 to just over 40 percent in 2007.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, the external debt ratio would fall gradually over the
medium term to around 33 percent in 2013. This level of external indebtedness compares
favorably with other emerging market economies, and past empirical work suggests that it
entails limited vulnerabilities, although some remain:
•

Continued vulnerability to the exchange rate: A one-time real depreciation of
30 percent is estimated to entail a 20 percentage point jump in the external debt ratio
from its 2008 level, which would remain above 60 percent in the medium term.

•

Rising resilience to interest rate and growth shocks: Given the lengthening of
maturities and tilt toward domestic financing, external debt is less affected by world
interest rates and domestic growth shocks. It is only moderately affected by
noninterest shocks to the current account.

intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt).
2/ Revenue is the sum of all nonfinancial public sector revenue net of intra-public sector payments. It is assumed that 80 percent of Bureau of Treasury revenue represents interest and dividends from other
parts of the nonfinancial public sector.
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangement:

The exchange arrangement is classified as an independent float. The value of the Philippine
peso is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes
in the spot and forward markets in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations in the
exchange rate and to strategically build reserves.

ANNEX II: PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
World Bank lending and nonlending activities
Since the World Bank started operations in the Philippines, it has committed approximately
$12 billion under IBRD loans and $239 million under IDA credits (fewer cancellations).
As of September 30, 2008, the Philippine portfolio consisted of 26 projects, amounting to
$1.41 billion with undisbursed balance of $923.5 million. Two projects were approved in
FY08: the Bicol Power Restoration Project ($12.9 million) and the National Roads
Improvement and Management Project 2 ($232 million). Based on net commitments and by
sector, the current portfolio can be broken down as follows: human development
($371 million, 26 percent); transport and energy ($323 million, 23 percent); rural
development and environment ($304.8 million, 22 percent); urban development
(244.0 million, 17 percent); social development ($136.8 million, 10 percent); and governance
and economic management ($32.9 million, 2 percent).
The current Philippines Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) builds on the government's
2004–10 Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan and has two main goals: economic
growth and social inclusion. It also identifies two important levers for pursuing these goals:
achieving fiscal stability and improving governance. The CAS supports Islands of Good
Governance (successful experiences of public service delivery and effective public
institutions) in national government agencies, local governments, and dynamic sectors in the
Philippines that demonstrate how improved accountability and service delivery can lead to
better economic and social outcomes. The CAS Progress Report of June 2007 re-affirmed the
relevance of the CAS theme of supporting Islands of Good Governance, recommended an
extension of the CAS for one year (to end-FY09), and a scaling up of the Bank’s lending
based on the increased fiscal space and government demand for more Bank assistance.
The extended coverage of the current CAS is up to June 2009. The World Bank is now in the
process of formulating a new CAS to cover the period July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2012.
Emerging shifts in strategy include: increasing focus on direct poverty alleviation;
operationalizing the focus on governance; expanding and re-focusing the knowledge agenda;
and strengthening linkages to global issues––climate change and disaster risk management.
The new CAS is expected to be discussed by the Bank’s Board in April 2009.
An important aspect of World Bank support to the Philippines is in the form of analytical and
advisory activities leveraged through partnerships with other organizations, administration of
trust funds, and policy dialogue. The World Bank is implementing a more programmatic
approach to its AAA program in the Philippines, and will continue this with Inclusive
Growth as the AAA flagship theme that addresses the topical issue in the Philippines today
of how to get more growth and how to make it more inclusive. The Inclusive Growth AAA is
in addition to AAA on macro/fiscal, governance, health, education, local government issues,
rural poverty reduction, environment and social safeguards. Two major pieces of ESW were
delivered in FY08, including a Country Procurement Assessment Report and a Development
Update for the Philippines Development Forum (PDF), and three key ESW products are

6
expected in FY09––the Philippines Development Report, Inclusive Growth, and Country
Environment Assessment.
The Bank has an extensive outreach program in the Philippines to promote knowledge
sharing. Currently, there are 11 Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) around the
country that make available Bank publications and development literature either through online access or through hard copies. The Bank has also partnered with the Asian Institute of
Management to create a Global Distance Learning Network that offers distance learning
sessions for a broad national, regional, and international audience. In addition, the Bank also
maintains an external country website (www.worldbank.org.ph).
Partnership
Strategic partnerships, supported by large bilateral and multi-donor trust funds administered
by the World Bank, are beginning to form a growing line of business in the Philippines, as
the government and its development partners move toward coordinated sector-wide
approaches in delivering development assistance to various sectors, in line with the Paris
Declaration.
The PDF, formerly called the Consultative Group (CG), is the primary mechanism of the
government for facilitating substantive policy dialogue among various development partners
and other stakeholders on the country’s development agenda. The main event is held in
country every 12 months, and the next PDF is scheduled to convene in March 2009. The PDF
is chaired by the Philippine Government, represented by the Department of Finance, and the
World Bank serves as the co-chair. The PDF has eight working groups in the following areas
to facilitate the policy dialogue throughout the year related to their specific themes: MDGs
and social progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms;
governance and anti-corruption; Mindanao, sustainable rural development; infrastructure, and
decentralization and local government. The World Bank is actively engaged as co-lead
convener or participant in all the PDF working groups.

ANNEX III: PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
From January 2005 to June 30, 2008, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved seven
public sector loans totaling $1.409 billion, 1 including $1.35 billion for five policy-based
loans 2 and $28.5 million for 25 technical assistance and grant-financed projects; generated
$559 million in co-financing; approved $434.4 million for private sector operations; and
supported two peso bond issues totaling P 7.5 billion to finance local currency operations. 3
Since joining the AsDB in 1966, the Philippines has received 202 loans for a total of
$10.15 billion, and 332 technical assistance grants amounting to $152.36 million. Energy and
agriculture account for the largest proportion of lending (Table 1). Since 1998, 76 percent of
lending has been for policy-based operations and 24 percent for investment projects.

AsDB’s private sector operations, which are made without government guarantee, amounted
to $632.2 million, including 18 loans of $595.3 million and 20 equity investments of
$36.8 million. The Philippines is one of the largest clients for these activities. Private sector
operations can be applied flexibly across projects, though the focus would be on the
development of critical infrastructure projects and promotion of key financial sector
initiatives. Targeted infrastructure projects include power generation and transmission,
renewable energy, energy efficiency, water supply, sanitation and waste management sectors,
1

Two project loans for $59 million were among these.

2

In 2007, two policy-based loans totaling $550 million (94 percent of all lending) and one project loan were
approved.

3

These comprised bond issues of P 2.5 billion in October 2005 and P 5 billion in May 2007 to fund a loan to a
special-purpose vehicle for the resolution of nonperforming loans.

9
toll road construction and operation, light rail systems, housing finance, and port operations.
In the financial sector, target opportunities include (i) provision of a loan to domestic banks
or nonbank companies to support microfinance and small and medium enterprises; (ii) asset
backed securities; (iii) support for the issuance of corporate bonds to develop the capital
market, and (iv) partial credit guarantees to support lending to small and medium-term
enterprises.
The AsDB’s Philippines Country Strategy and Program 2005–07 (CSP) provides the
framework for the alignment of AsDB’s activities with Philippine priorities. In 2007, the
AsDB and the Government of the Philippines agreed on an operational program for 2007–08,
which extended the CSP by one year through the Country Operations Business Plan (COBP)
2007–08. In 2008, AsDB and the government agreed on an operational program for 2009–10,
which extends the CSP by another two years. The strategic focus of the CSP on fiscal
consolidation, improved investment climate, and accelerated attainment of the Millennium
Development Goals remains valid. The extension of the CSP to 2010 will align the cycle of
the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with the government's planning cycle. The indicative
assistance pipeline for lending products includes a total of $624 million for 2009 and
$350 million for 2010. AsDB would continue its support for medium-term reforms via the
Development Policy Support Program, the Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation
Program, and the Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program. The share of
policy-based loans in total loans is expected to be 66 percent.
In the recent Country Assistance Program Evaluation (CAPE) 4 conducted by AsDB’s
Operations Evaluation Department, AsDB’s assistance over the past four years was assessed
as highly relevant, aligned with national priorities. The assistance program was particularly
effective in helping the government achieve progress in addressing the need to improve fiscal
performance. AsDB has directly supported government efforts to increase development
effectiveness and has helped implement new, more transparent procurement regulations.
Loans, technical assistance projects and advocacy have had a significant impact on the
direction of sector reforms and capacity development, especially for financial sector
regulation and intermediation, and local government reform. To increase its relevance,
AsDB’s partnerships outside the national government are being intensified or created,
including those with government-owned and controlled corporations, Local government
units, the Supreme Court and other pillars of justice, business groups, and civil society.

ANNEX IV: PHILIPPINES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. A
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module was published on
the IMF website in August 2004. The ROSC identified the national accounts and balance of
payments statistics as needing particular attention. The country subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standards in August 1996.
A. National Accounts
Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national
accounts. These include large discrepancies in GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides (the official GDP estimates), with consequent differences in estimates of
GDP growth.
The data ROSC identified a number of causes for these problems. 5
•

Deaths and births of establishments are not adequately captured. This gap is of
growing importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years,
with a large number of new establishments, in particular in the electronics and
information technology industries.

•

Compilation relies on an outdated benchmark year and fixed input-output ratios.
Estimates are derived by extrapolation of the 1988 benchmark year using fixed inputoutput ratios. For example, GDP statistics for the electronic sector suggest that value
added remained at 10 percent of exports over the past years in spite of industry evidence
that the domestic component of exports has been rising sharply. 6

•

Statistical techniques in estimating GDP at constant prices are inadequate. For most
activities, not all components of the production accounts are compiled, instead only value
added is estimated. Value added at current prices is calculated by extrapolating the
benchmark year value with an indicator for the value of output; data in constant prices are
estimated using a price deflator for output. In addition, the national accounts constant
price estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed by multiplying 1985
values by quantity data (weights) from the foreign trade statistics for current years.
Because of this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products
appear high compared with developments in world market prices.

The consumer price index has been compiled since February 2004 using weights based on
the 2000 Family Income and Expenditures survey. A notable change was that the weight

Currently, the authorities are compiling new national accounts series based on the 1993 SNA guidelines.

Industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly to around 30 percent
in recent years.

11
given to the group comprising food, beverages, and tobacco decreased to 50 percent in 2000
from 55 percent in 1994, the previous weight reference year.
B. External Sector Statistics
Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics. In 2005,
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) created a new Department of Economic Statistics, with
one of its units to concentrate on compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of
payments and the international investment position. Progress since 2004 has included a
significant improvement in the measurement of imports to correct an underestimation of
imports of electronic goods on a consignment basis, improvements in the classification and
recording of remittances, the introduction of a new methodology for measuring trade credits,
and progress in the direct investment survey. Data for external debt and reserves are
generally of good quality, although the data ROSC mission identified scope for
improvement.
The revisions to imports have narrowed the gap between national trade data and those
of partner countries on a net basis. An interagency task force on import statistics was
established in July 2002 to improve the measurement of activity in the electronics sector,
which accounts for about 43 percent of trade flows. Results of surveys covering electronics
sector raw material imports confirmed that imports were routinely underestimated in reports
to the National Statistics Office. Import figures have therefore been revised substantially,
back to 2000. 7 However, substantial differences remain with partner country data on gross
flows of exports and imports, with the latter about 15 percent higher than the corresponding
national data. The BSP is continuing research on the factors behind discrepancies in data
related to trade in processed goods, such as electronics and textiles.
Challenges remain for addressing certain compilation issues. Since deregulation in the
early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional
channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The Foreign
Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about 70–75 percent of foreign
exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict banking
secrecy rules. Steps have been taken to measure cross-border transactions that skirt the
domestic banking system, such as flows through inter-company accounts. 8 Enterprise
surveys, for example, have been introduced, although these are conducted on a voluntary
basis and will take time to implement fully. Unless modifications are made to secrecy rules
associated with FCDU accounts to facilitate the collection of data for statistical purposes,

7
8

Data from 1996–99 have not been revised and remain underestimated.

According to recent household surveys, typically about 30 percent of remittances of Overseas Filipino
Workers were not channeled through the banking system, suggesting that remittances may have been
underestimated by about US$3 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) in 2002.

12
compilers of the balance of payments will continue to face challenges in securing adequate
source data.
C. Monetary and Financial Statistics
Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the Fund’s
methodology. The October 2007 MFS mission introduced the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to the IMF and an integrated monetary database
(IMD) that will meet the data needs of the BSP, APD, and STA. The IMD will become
operational when the BSP submits data in the SRFs.
D. Government Finance Statistics
While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important
respects, the fiscal and data ROSCs found areas that require strengthening. An
important problem is that the budget is presented on an obligations basis, while the deficit is
reported on a cash basis. In addition, the budget classification differs from the accounting
classification, complicating comparisons of budget and outcomes. Moreover, for levels of the
public sector beyond the budgetary central (national) government, consolidated fiscal
outturns for items other than the fiscal balance are generally unavailable. In addition, there is
a discrepancy between stocks and flows resulting from differences in time of recording and
inconsistency in the coverage and classification of some transactions related to debt
guarantees and assumed debt. The authorities agreed to compare the coverage of data in the
two debt recording systems, standardize the classifications of these transactions, and improve
the recording of debt transactions according to international best practice.
The introduction of a standardized chart of accounts, and the electronic New
Government Accounting System has facilitated the compilation of annual financial
statements for all the levels of the public sector. The accounting system allows for the
compilation of accrual based accounts and also provides for the compilation of a statement of
cash flows. These statements become available six months after the end of a reference period.
In addition, the mission worked with the authorities to revise classifications in the chart of
accounts, in order to allow for the consolidation of data for the nonfinancial public sector as a
whole. Also, it recommended separating the market and nonmarket activities of the
government-owned-and-controlled-corporations, so that consolidated data for the general
government sector could be compiled.
Annual data covering only the budgetary central government are reported for
publication in the GFSY, and monthly budgetary central government data are
published in the IFS. A dedicated unit in the Department of Finance was created to compile
government finance statistics in accordance with GFSM 2001 framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
PHILIPPINES
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asian and Pacific Department
(In consultation with SPR)
Approved by James Gordon and Tessa van der Willigen
January 14, 2009
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This supplement to the Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation provides
updates on recent economic and policy developments. These developments do not affect the
overall analysis and policy recommendations contained in the staff report.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
2.
The economic outlook has become more challenging than previously anticipated. The
downtrend in economic sentiment indicators and high frequency trade data already point to a
faster slowdown in economic activity. Notwithstanding fiscal stimulus plans, external
demand is projected to worsen more rapidly in main trading partner countries. Moreover,
countries hosting Philippine workers, including in the Middle East, are facing a more abrupt
economic slowdown. In light of these developments, staff now expects the economy to grow
2.9 percent in 2009, below the earlier projection of 3.5 percent. Headline inflation fell from
9.9 percent in November to 8.0 percent in December, primarily driven by receding food and
fuel prices. In line with slowing demand, inflation is expected to fall to 4.8 percent in
2009 compared to a previous forecast of 6 percent.
3.
Domestic financial markets have improved somewhat in recent weeks. Equity prices
have remained broadly stable since mid-December 2008 in line with developments
elsewhere, but volatility is high. Credit spreads have narrowed since mid-December and the
peso has strengthened, but high option price volatility points to continued investor
uncertainty.
4.
Banks’ losses on securities were contained during the third quarter as some banks
took advantage of the temporary relief from mark-to-market rules. Broadly as expected, some
of the largest banks reported mark-to-market losses for the third quarter of 2008 (ranging

2
from 4 to 11 percent of capital). However, nonperforming loans have remained broadly
stable to date. Unrelated to the recent financial turmoil, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
(BSP) in December 2008 and January 2009 placed 18 small rural banks under receivership of
the PDIC. These banks had insufficient assets to cover their liabilities, and had performed
unsafe and unsound banking practices. While this action could still be challenged at the
higher court, it reflects the BSP’s resolve to deal with unsound banking practices. In a bid to
strengthen bank capital, the BSP is in the process of introducing differentiated capital
requirements consistent with pillar 2 of the Basel II framework.
5.
The current account surplus is narrowing. Exports fell by an average of 13½ percent
in October and November, the largest annual decline since 2001. Similarly, growth in
remittance inflows slowed to 3.3 percent in October from 16.4 percent in September.
However, weakening domestic demand and receding commodity prices have led to a marked
slowdown in imports, containing the drop in the current account balance. Nevertheless,
international reserves rose slightly (US$0.3 billion) in December to $37.1 billion partly on
account of income on BSP’s foreign assets, while the swap position remained broadly
unchanged.
III. MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY
6.
The BSP lowered policy rates by 50 basis points at the December policy meeting. The
Monetary Board noted that the outlook was supported by the shift in the balance of risks,
following the easing of commodity prices, the moderation in inflation expectations, and the
expected slowdown in economic activity. The rate cut was consistent with staff’s
recommendation.
7.
Recent fiscal developments suggest a lower-than-anticipated deficit in 2008, while
the deficit in 2009 is expected to be in line with the original projections. Recent data suggest
that tax revenues could be higher than originally projected by staff, while expenditures are
likely to be in line with initial forecasts. The 2009 budget has been passed by the House and
the Senate and is currently awaiting passage from the bicameral session of Congress.
Considerations are being given to reallocating expenditure within the existing envelope to
stimulate the economy. The authorities also contemplate front-loading spending, which may
prove difficult due to the delayed budget approval and capacity constraints. Staff considers
the cap on the 2009 deficit at 2 percent of GDP still appropriate since within this envelope,
the smaller 2008 deficit would imply a larger fiscal expansion in 2009.
8.
The national government successfully sold $1.5 billion worth of 10-year bonds in the
international debt market in early 2009, completing the government’s external funding
requirement for 2009 and making the Philippines the first sovereign debt issuer in Asia this
year. The offering was four times oversubscribed.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 17, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Philippines
On January 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Philippines. 1
Background
Following solid economic performance in recent years, the economy faced headwinds
initially from the commodity price shock and subsequently from the global economic and
financial turmoil. After reaching 7.2 percent in 2007, GDP growth moderated to
4.6 percent during the first three quarters of 2008, led by weaker external demand and
consumption as the oil and food price shock reduced real income. Headline inflation
peaked in August at 12.4 percent, but fell to 8.0 percent in December as commodity
prices receded. The external position has weakened due to high commodity prices,
lower exports, and more recently, capital outflows. The exchange rate depreciated
accordingly, compounded by a shift to long dollar position. Yet, international reserves
remain at US$37 billion, 240 percent of short-term debt.
The spillover from the global financial turmoil to domestic financial and currency markets
has intensified since September. Equity prices have declined by around 48 percent in
2008, with almost half of the decline taking place since the mid-September flare up in
turmoil. The wealth effect has been limited, however, with less than 2 percent of the
population invested in capital markets. Measures of credit risk have increased with
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

(market-based) expected default frequencies of banks at elevated levels and Philippine
sovereign spreads wider by 300 bps (EMBI+ PHL) since end-August. Yet, spreads
remain 150−200 basis points lower than the EMBI+ Global average, reflecting reforms in
recent years and reserve accumulation during good times.
The exposure to failed and distressed global financial institutions is limited. As of
end-September 2008, direct exposures to Lehman Brothers stood at US$350 million
(3 percent of equity), but a large part has already been provisioned for. Combined
exposure to Lehman Brothers and ten other distressed major global financial institutions
amounted to US$1.5 billion or 13 percent of equity. However, banks are exposed to
market risks through their large holdings of debt securities and credit linked notes. As
such, recent changes in domestic interest rates and in sovereign spreads have led to
mark-to-market losses. Nonetheless, the banking system remains on average wellcapitalized.
Monetary policy was recently eased as the inflation outlook improved due to receding
commodity prices and the expected economic slowdown. The Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas (BSP) has taken a number of steps to help address the fallout from the global
financial crisis on local banks. The reserve requirement was recently reduced by
2 percentage points to 19 percent and the amount allocated for the rediscount window
was doubled. To address tightness in the dollar interbank market, the BSP opened a
dollar-denominated deposit window and a dollar repurchase facility. The BSP has also
enhanced its day-to-day monitoring of the banking system and stress-testing exercises,
and mark-to-market rules have been relaxed to bring relief to banks.
The 2008 budget will likely record a deficit of 1 percent of GDP, an improvement over
the 2007 deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP. The tax effort is expected to remain broadly
unchanged at around 14 percent of GDP. Expenditures are expected to be slightly
lower, partly due to lower capital expenditure reflecting weak absorptive capacity.
Nonfinancial public sector debt in percent of GDP is projected to decline modestly in
2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Philippine economy faces strong headwinds, but
starts from a position of strength. Directors expected growth to moderate over the near
term as external demand falls, and private consumption wanes with more modest
remittance inflows. Weaker domestic demand, accompanied by receding commodity
prices, should anchor expectations of lower inflation.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of financial sector soundness and supervision in
recent years, which should enable banks to better withstand the impact of the economic
slowdown. Nevertheless, continuing strains in global financial markets could lead to
further losses on banks’ security holdings, reduce the availability of external financing,
and raise risks related to banks’ off-balance sheet activities.
To limit the fallout from the global financial crisis, Directors encouraged the BSP to
continue to monitor closely the banking sector and maintain supervisory vigilance. While
regulatory forbearance, including the relaxation of mark-to-market accounting rules, has

3
provided banks with temporary relief, Directors emphasized the importance of
maintaining transparency regarding banks’ financial positions. Directors welcomed the
BSP’s proactive steps to address liquidity strains, and called for existing liquidity
facilities to be used flexibly, as needed to relieve further stress.
Directors agreed that the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework to address financial
sector vulnerability is broadly appropriate, but saw scope for improvement, including
stepped-up surveillance of off-balance sheet activities. The BSP should be given legal
authority to disclose enforcement actions when disclosure does not undermine market
confidence, and the BSP’s charter should be amended to strengthen the legal protection
of bank supervisors. Directors called in general for setting in place a more rules-based
PCA framework over the medium term, with a few Directors emphasizing the need to
maintain flexibility to deal with specific situations.
Directors supported the proposed increase in the Philippines Deposit Insurance
Corporation (PDIC) deposit coverage, and noted the importance of allowing for flexibility
to temporarily raise it further if the financial sector experiences high stress levels.
Recapitalization of the PDIC will be key to support the enhanced deposit protection.
Directors welcomed the proposed enhancements to the bank resolution toolkit, including
the bridge-bank facility, and several Directors encouraged the authorities to reconsider a
more flexible application of the purchase-and-assumption tool. Directors recommended
that bank restructuring decisions be made irreversible, and that the legal protection of
PDIC staff be strengthened.
Directors noted that the credibility of the inflation targeting framework has helped anchor
inflation expectations. They considered appropriate the recent easing of monetary policy
in light of the receding inflation pressures and the emergence of downside risks to
growth. They saw scope for further monetary easing if inflation expectations continue to
fall. They recommended that the exchange rate remain flexible so as to adjust to the
changing external environment, with the central bank’s participation in the foreign
exchange market limited to smoothing erratic movements. A strategy of raising interest
rates and limited unsterilized intervention, while preserving a prudently high level of
foreign exchange reserves, should be considered in response to a temporary financial
shock. A few Directors cautioned, however, that such a strategy should avoid inducing
procyclical movements in interest rates.
Directors concurred with staff’s assessment that the exchange rate of the Philippine
peso is broadly in line with longer-term fundamentals and does not threaten external
stability.
Noting that fiscal consolidation has reduced the public debt-to-GDP ratio significantly in
recent years, Directors agreed that fiscal policy could help to cushion the current
slowdown. However, given the still-high level of public debt, there should be a measured
fiscal stimulus to avoid compromising fiscal sustainability and policy credibility. To
provide more scope for fiscal easing and outlays on well-targeted pro-poor cash
transfers, Directors suggested raising the tax collection effort, broadening the tax base,
and rationalizing tax incentives. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to limit the
fiscal deficit to no more than 2 percent of GDP by being prepared to scale back
expenditures in the event of a shortfall in tax revenues. They encouraged the authorities

4
to develop specific contingency plans to address unexpected pressures on the fiscal
accounts.
Directors considered that a formal medium-term fiscal framework would help strengthen
fiscal policy planning. They supported the introduction of a fiscal rule, and a fiscal
responsibility law providing for the full financing of new tax and expenditure measures.
Directors called for a further streamlining of the National Food Authority and other
government-owned and controlled corporations. They looked forward to the completion
of the privatization of the power sector.

Statement by Perry Warjiyo, Executive Director for the Philippines
January 16, 2009
1. The Philippine authorities value the constructive exchange of views with the Fund
staff during the Article IV consultation and their candid assessments of key economic
and financial developments as well as policy responses. They also appreciate the
papers on selected issues which provide valuable inputs to the discussions,
particularly those related to assessing spillover effects of the global financial crisis,
incorporating remittances in exchange rate assessment, and presenting alternative
fiscal responses during economic downturn. The authorities affirm their commitment
to sound macroeconomic management and structural reforms to better withstand the
challenges in the economy as a result of the global crisis.
The Philippine economy has been holding up relatively well from the current global
financial crisis and economic downturn
2. The economic growth moderated to 4.6 percent over the first three quarters of 2008
from a solid growth of 7.2 percent in 2007. The weaker external demand and impacts
of oil and food price shocks on domestic consumption weighed down the growth
performance and offset the favorable impacts of robust remittances and expanding
services sectors. Macroeconomic stability has remained broadly intact. Prudent
monetary policy response resulted in inflation decelerating to 8.0 percent in
December 2008 from a peak of 12.4 percent in August. Current account recorded a
surplus of US$1.2 billion during the period January-September 2008 following the
robust remittances and positive export growth. The economy has also been resilient in
absorbing the strains of capital outflows and corresponding pressures on the exchange
rate with net international reserves further increasing to US$35.5 billion as of end
2008.
3. The authorities fully recognize that the Philippine economy would not be completely
immune from the spillover effects of the global financial crisis and economic
slowdown. Global economic slowdown, particularly in the US, Europe and Asia,
would unduly weaken the external demand and moderate the export growth of the
Philippines. Nonetheless, the authorities are confident that continued robust
remittances, including revenues from business process outsourcing, along with
stronger domestic economic fundamental and supportive macroeconomic and
financial policies, would provide ample cushions to the economy from further
downturns, allowing growth to revert to trend in the medium term. Economic growth
is projected to decelerate to 3.7-4.7 percent in 2009 before it picks up to 5.2 – 6.2
percent in 2010. On inflation, latest baseline forecasts (as of December 18) showed a
deceleration in the inflation path in 2009. Inflation is expected to be within the 4.5
percent ± 1.0 percentage point target for 2010. Current account will remain in surplus,

2
estimated at about US$2.0 billion in 2009, which will further strengthen the external
position of the economy.
4. The authorities are determined to maintain sound macroeconomic management and
further advance the structural reform agenda. The immediate challenge is to arrest the
slowdown of economic activity. The authorities envisage a moderate fiscal policy
easing in the proposed 2009 budget to cushion the slowdown without undermining
fiscal consolidation and long-term sustainability. Monetary policy continues to be
geared toward price stability, consistent with the inflation targeting framework, while
the exchange rate remains to be market determined. Recent declines in fuel and food
prices have improved both the inflation outlook and expectations, providing greater
flexibility to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to ease monetary policy. In the
financial sector, focus is being given to assessing the vulnerabilities of the system and
implementing measures to ensuring the availability of liquidity and thus help address
the spillover effects from the global financial crisis. At the same time, contingency
measures for dealing with banks under stress have been strengthened.
A moderate fiscal easing is envisaged without undermining fiscal sustainability
5. Consistent with fiscal consolidation, the deficit (excluding privatization receipts) of
the National Government is projected at 1.4 percent of GDP in 2008, a moderate
improvement from 1.5 percent in 2007. In an effort to stimulate investment and
support household consumption, the authorities introduced tax reforms in the areas of
personal income tax, corporate income tax, and Personal Equity and Retirement Act
(PERA). The reforms, while resulting in tax revenue loss of about 0.6 percent of GDP
in 2008, are expected to yield a higher tax collection over the medium term. The tax
revenue loss has been matched by the windfall gains from high oil prices and
prioritized spending to further improve the fiscal performance. Current expenditures
were maintained at the budgeted level of 14.2 percent of GDP while absorptive
capacity constraints resulted in a lower than budgeted capital spending of 2.5 percent
of GDP.
6. For 2009, in light of the slowing economy, the authorities are proposing a fiscal
deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP to accommodate higher capital expenditures and an
increase in pro-poor spending. The authorities believe that this stance of fiscal policy
strikes the appropriate balance between the needs for a moderate fiscal easing in the
near term and continued progress in fiscal consolidation. To achieve the programmed
deficit, they are confident that tax revenues could be increased to 15.9 percent of
GDP while expenditures will moderate slightly to 16.7 percent of GDP. Nonetheless,
in the event of a shortfall in tax revenues, expenditures would be scaled back and the
deficit would be capped at 2 percent of GDP. Spending for social and physical

3
infrastructure will be enhanced through better targeting of existing cash-transfer
schemes and improvements in the absorptive capacity of capital spending.
7. Fiscal reforms remain the priority in the agenda of the authorities. They agreed that
the tax base needs to be broadened, particularly through rationalization of tax
incentives, accelerating reforms in tax administration, and raising and indexing excise
taxes. Fiscal consolidation will also be supported by gradual rationalization of the
National Food Authority (NFA) and introduction of performance targets to other
Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). Power sector
privatization remains a priority with the turnover of the transmission facilities from
the National Transmission Corporation, a GOCC, to a private entity, namely, the
National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. To further strengthen fiscal
management, the authorities welcome the staff’s suggestion to introduce a more
formalized medium-term fiscal framework, but stressed that this would need strong
support of Congress.
Monetary policy strikes the appropriate balance of achieving the inflation target and
mitigating the risks to growth and financial stability
8. The credibility of the inflation targeting framework (ITF) in the Philippines has
helped anchor inflation expectations. For the most part of 2008, monetary policy
addressed the second-round inflationary effects of high oil and food prices. BSP
raised the policy rates by a combined 100 bps in June, July and August in response to
the less favorable inflation outlook following the rapid rise in inflation. Subsequently,
the policy has shifted to a neutral stance in October and November due in part to the
upside risks associated with a weaker peso, even when inflation has decelerated. To
address the risks of tight liquidity in the banking system, the reserve requirement was
preemptively reduced from 21 percent to 19 percent and the amount allocated for the
rediscount window doubled from PhP 20 billion to PhP 40 billion. Partly on account
of the strong commitment of the BSP, inflation declined by 4 percentage points from
a peak of 12.4 percent in August to 8 percent in December while the availability of
liquidity in the banking system was ensured.
9. Staff’s assessment that the Philippines’ exchange rate is in line with fundamentals is
appreciated. The authorities also value the staff’s efforts in incorporating remittances
in the quantitative assessment of exchange rate equilibrium. That said, a pressing
challenge for monetary policy under the current global financial crisis is the volatility
of capital flows. While the credible ITF has been successful in anchoring price
stability, large capital flow reversals have posed a challenge to maintaining external
stability. Consistent with the country’s exchange rate regime, the peso remains to be
market determined with BSP’s participation in the foreign exchange market aimed
only at smoothing volatility and promoting more orderly market movements. The

4
peso, like the currencies of other emerging economies, has been under strains of
depreciation stemming from capital flow reversals and the uncertain global
environment. Nonetheless, the accumulation in international reserves over the past
years has provided the BSP ample policy space to dampen the disruptive effects of
exchange rate volatility.
10. With the latest forecast of a decelerating inflation path over the two-year policy
horizon, BSP decided to cut the policy rates by 50 bps in its December 18, 2008
meeting. The central bank believes that inflation will be falling within the target by
2010. The outlook is also supported by the downward shift in the balance of risks,
following the easing of commodity prices, the moderation of inflation expectations,
and the expected slowdown in economic activity. Overall, BSP believes that as
inflation pressures continue to recede, as also evidenced in the further slowdown in
inflation in December, there is greater latitude to ease policy rates. As such, monetary
policy will continue to focus on achieving price stability while allowing room for
economic growth.
Measures have been adopted to strengthen the banking resilience from spillover effects
of the global financial crisis
11. The Philippine banking sector has faced the current global financial crisis in a
relatively solid footing, due to strengthened prudential regulations and effective
oversight of financial institutions over the past years. With the capital adequacy ratio
averaging at around 15 percent, bank capitalization is high by regional standards
while exposures to risky financial instruments are low. Loan-to-deposit ratio is near
maximum at around 72 percent given reserve requirement at 21 percent (reduced to
19 percent on November 19, 2008). Sector loan concentration is limited and NPLs
have declined in the last few years to around 5 percent of total loans. Moreover, risk
management practices have improved and surveillance strengthened. Commercial and
universal banks have adopted Basel II since June 2007, in line with the regional trend.
12. Nonetheless, the authorities shared the general thrusts of staff’s assessment on the
domestic and external channels of vulnerability risks from protracted global financial
crisis. In response, the BSP has adopted a number of measures to further enhance the
resilience of the banking sector. To address the risks of tight liquidity in the banking
system, the BSP has introduced a number of measures to support interbank liquidity.
Surveillance in the banking system remains strong through day-to-day monitoring and
stress-testing exercises. To further safeguard deposits in the banking system, doubling
of deposit insurance coverage to PhP 500,000 has been proposed while public
communication has been intensified to assure depositors of the soundness of the
banking system. Regulatory forbearance in mark-to-market accounting has also been
introduced in line with international best practice.

5

13. The authorities believe that the existing contingency framework remains adequate,
but took note of the staff’s suggestion for further improvements in some areas. For
remedial actions in dealing with banks under stress, the existing prompt corrective
action (PCA) framework is considered as appropriate. The authorities take the view
that the staff's suggested rule-based approach may in fact restrict the flexibility that
the BSP may require from time to time to address special circumstances across
individual bank situations. Although the authorities are generally receptive to the
proposal for a bridge bank facility, they reiterated their position that the added
benefits from a more flexible application of the purchase-and-assumption (P&A)
model should not come at the expense of curtailing the underlying rights of
depositors. The BSP broadly agrees with the principle of increasing the maximum
deposit insurance coverage in the context of the package of reforms that are meant to
strengthen the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). However, the matter
of the recapitalization of the PDIC is itself subject to legislative action. They also
agreed on the imperative for legal protection of all supervisors and the restriction of
shareholder rights during bank restructuring.
Concluding Remarks
14. The Philippine economy has been holding up relatively well under the current global
financial crisis and economic downturn. While economic growth has moderated as
external demand weakened, overall macroeconomic and financial stability has
remained. The authorities are fully cognizant that the economy would not be
completely isolated from a prolonged and perhaps deep global economic downturn.
As in the past, they are firmly committed to sound macroeconomic management and
structural reforms to better fortify the economy in addressing the challenges in the
near term and allowing growth to revert to trend in the medium term. In doing so,
they value the Fund’s views and intend to continue working closely with it through
the regular Article IV consultations and technical assistance programs.
