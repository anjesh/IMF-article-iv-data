EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Georgia’s economy has performed well over the last two years. Prudent macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms have resulted in robust growth rates, inflation in single digits,
and a significantly improved revenue performance that has allowed for many fiscal initiatives
to be undertaken while maintaining fiscal stability.
Performance under the program has been good. All but one quantitative performance criteria
were met. The target on arrears clearance was missed due to concerns about inflation, but the
authorities are committed to clear the entire stock by end-2006. The structural performance
criterion on the submission of a new customs code was delayed, mainly to give more time for
discussions with the business community. The authorities have requested completion of the
third review under the arrangement, and waivers for the missed performance criteria.
Economic prospects over the medium term are favorable, with robust economic growth likely
to continue. Policy discussions on the medium-term focused on measures to remove
obstacles to growth, including a public investment program that addresses infrastructure
needs (such as roads and power supply) to sustain growth, a financial sector development
strategy that would increase the sector’s contribution to growth, and ways to improve
institutional quality and reduce rent seeking opportunities affecting private sector investment.
Program discussions focused on the macroeconomic framework and policy objectives for
2006. While maintaining the fiscal deficit broadly unchanged, social expenditures are
projected to increase, reflecting higher minimum pensions and a targeted poverty benefit
program scheduled for implementation in mid-2006. The monetary program targets reserve
money growth of 25 percent for the year, consistent with the authorities’ inflation objective
of 5 percent by end-2006, and a further reserve accumulation to 2.3 months of import
coverage. In this regard, efforts are underway to strengthen the National Bank of Georgia’s
(NBG) ability to conduct monetary operations and control inflation, and to improve the
coordination of policies between the NBG and ministry of finance. Consistent with the
objective of increasing fiscal control and transparency, the authorities are in the process of
developing guidelines for monitoring and reporting the activities of all central government
Legal Entities of Public Law. A Banking System Development Strategy for 2006–09 is under
preparation.
The main risks to the medium-term outlook stem from election pressures, with significant
elections scheduled for each of the next three years, political tensions regarding the status of
the breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and energy sector vulnerabilities.
Finally, it will be important to implement further measures to improve governance, building
on the progress in this area in recent years.
Georgia has made substantial progress in creating a sound policy framework, and the
authorities’ strong record of accomplishment bodes well for continued successful
implementation of the program.

I. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE ROSE REVOLUTION
1.
The breakup of the Soviet Union brought a steep fall in real GDP in Georgia—almost
75 percent, by most estimates the worst for any transition country. Over the following
decade, the government had some success in stabilizing prices (following early
hyperinflation), as well as in price liberalization, privatization of state-owned enterprises,
and a first phase of legal, fiscal and financial reforms.1
2.
From 2000 to 2003, real GDP growth averaged 5.8 percent, while CPI inflation
averaged 4.8 percent. Mismanagement and poor tax administration, however, undermined the
implementation of policies, leading to low tax collections and rapidly rising domestic arrears.
Tax revenues were low—averaging 13.2 percent of GDP—and the cash fiscal deficit,
constrained by financing, was 1.8 percent. Domestic arrears totaled 3.4 percent of GDP by
end-2003. The Rose Revolution brought in a new government in January 2004.
3.

The new authorities embarked on an ambitious agenda of reforms:

•

To reduce graft in tax and customs administration, high-ranking officials were fired
or prosecuted, with many making large reparations payments; the state tax
department was reorganized; and a financial police was created.

•

To create a business-friendly environment, a simplified and streamlined tax system—
eliminating nuisance taxes and reducing burdensome regulations—was initiated.

•

To improve governance in the public sector, measures to restructure the civil service,
strengthen management in state-owned enterprises, and reinvigorate privatization
were initiated.

4.
The restructuring of the public sector led to significant improvements in
governmental functions, particularly revenue collection. Tax revenues grew by 3.7 percent of
GDP in 2004, and a further 1.6 percent in 2005. With this improved performance, many
fiscal initiatives—increasing pensions, upgrading defense capacity, and clearing arrears—
could be undertaken while maintaining fiscal stability.
5.
The Saakashvili administration continues to attach priority to the reintegration of the
breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Relations with Russia—Georgia’s largest
trading partner—are tense, related in part to Russia’s relations with Abkhazia and South
Ossetia and in part to Georgia’s dependence on Russia for gas and electricity.

IMF Country Report 03/346 presents a detailed discussion of these policies.

6.
Economic activity accelerated and inflation pressures abated in 2005 (Table 1,

proj.
remained high in 2004 (the latest
information available)—with
52 percent of the population living under the official subsistence level and 17 percent in
extreme poverty (Table 2). 2
7.
The general government deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP in 2005, far below the
budgeted 4.8 percent (Table 3). Tax revenues rose to 19.8 percent of GDP. Total
expenditure and net lending increased from 18.6 percent of GDP in 2004 to 24.9 percent in
2005, led by an increase in current expenditures of 4.5 percent of GDP, in particular in
transfers and subsidies to Legal Entities of Public Law (LEPLs) to buy defense goods. While
social spending increased from 7.1 percent of GDP in 2004 to 8.1 percent in 2005 (on a cash
basis),3 defense spending more than doubled from an estimated 1.6 percent to 3.5 percent of
GDP.4 Privatization receipts (3.6 percent of GDP) financed the deficit, modest net foreign
repayments, and an increase in government deposits with the National Bank of Georgia
(NBG).
8.
The introduction of a reserve money target strengthened the monetary policy
framework and helped maintain price stability (Table 4). Although capital inflows were
substantially lower than in 2004—due in part to lower than forecast privatization proceeds

The outturn was slightly less than programmed as some social programs were phased out and the targeted
poverty benefit meant to replace them was delayed to mid-2006.

4

These figures exclude defense-related expenditures by LEPLs, for which no data are available. As discussed
below, all such expenditures have ceased since January 2006.

and a winding down of pipeline

reserves increased by US$91 million
(Figure 2). The lari appreciated about
2 percent both nominally against the
U.S. dollar and in real effective terms
(Figure 3), with limited central bank
discretionary intervention (Figure 4).
Remonetization of the economy
continued (Table 5). Cooperation
between the NBG and the treasury in
forecasting liquidity conditions
improved, but unexpected government
spending occasionally still results in
swings in reserve money.

9.
The banking sector has performed well. Returns to assets and equity rose in 2005,
while credit to the private sector grew 83 percent, albeit from a low base. Although lending
continued to be primarily in foreign currency, lari-denominated loans tripled, reducing loan
dollarization by about 10 percentage points to 77 percent of total loans. Most of the credit
boom was financed through higher deposits, which grew 31 percent, with the rest financed
by net borrowing abroad. The share of non-performing loans has fallen from 6.2 percent at
end-2004 to 3.8 percent at end-2005 (Table 6). Mirroring developments on the asset side,
deposit dollarization declined to 72 percent. Consolidation in the banking sector continued in
2005, with 3 banks merged or closed.
10.
Banking supervision has become more proactive. The authorities took decisive
steps to resolve an insolvent bank in February 2006, once the situation was uncovered in an
on-site inspection. Temporary administration was put in place, an offer was made to
Georgian banks rated CAMEL one or two, and contingent plans were prepared in case viable
offers were not received. When these actions were publicly announced, net withdrawals from
the bank were insignificant, indicating no loss of depositor confidence. The sale of this bank
brings the number of banks to 18.
11.
A fiscal stance that was less expansionary by more than 2 percent of GDP
compared with the budget helped prevent the projected widening of the current
account deficit in 2005 (Table 7). In addition, lower-than-projected official disbursements
(mainly reflecting slower than targeted project implementation) and foreign direct investment
in the new pipelines slowed import growth. Preliminary data suggest export growth (net of a
one-time adjustment for unregistered trade in 2004) also slowed. The strengthening of the

-9-

lari since the beginning of 2005 may have contributed to this (Box 1). International reserves
remained at about 2 months of non-pipeline imports.
Box 1. Is Georgia Competitive?
Evidence on the level and trend of Georgia’s competitiveness is mixed (SIP, Chapter V). Georgia’s
real exchange rate (RER) has appreciated during the past 24 months because of both strong real GDP
growth and foreign exchange inflows related to foreign direct investment and a repatriation of savings. A
continued positive external outlook and domestic spending pressures suggest that RER appreciation is
likely to persist.
External competitiveness has started to suffer as a result. The share of Georgian exports in the
country’s main trading partners’ import markets started to decline in early 2005. Furthermore, Georgia’s
cost of doing business indicators continue to rank poorly, even compared to its neighbors.
Notwithstanding these facts, U.S. dollar wages are the lowest in the region, and the RER is most likely
still undervalued. Furthermore, two recent competitiveness studies indicate that the productivity of
Georgia’s economy has improved markedly in 2004–05.

12.
Georgia has reached debt rescheduling agreements with most bilateral creditors
on terms comparable to those offered by the Paris Club in July 2004 (MEFP, paragraph 12).
The authorities have asked the Paris Club to extend the deadline for concluding the
remaining discussions to end-February 2006.
13.

Structural reforms moved forward in many areas:

•

Fiscal: A comprehensive tax reform took effect in 2005 entailing a significant
simplification of the tax code: (i) the number of taxes was reduced from 21 to 7; (ii)
personal income tax rates ranging from 12 to 20 percent were unified under a single
rate of 12 percent; (iii) the VAT rate was reduced from 20 to 18 percent; (iv) the
payroll tax rate was reduced from 33 to 20 percent; and (v) exemptions and special
regimes were significantly curtailed. In parallel, the authorities have continued to
improve revenue administration. Treasury reforms continued throughout 2005. In
early 2006, the Single Treasury Account (STA) became fully operational. LEPLs,
however, operate outside the STA. Progress continues toward the goal of compliance
with the recommendations of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) by early 2007. While the authorities produced their first MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in 2005, they recognize further work is
needed to make this an effective policy tool. A new customs code, which will further
modernize customs administration in Georgia, was submitted to parliament in
October 2005.

•

Banking: The NBG has started to develop a strategy to guide development of the
financial sector over the medium term, and has proposed eliminating restrictions
limiting nonbank shareholders to 25 percent of the equity capital in Georgian banks.

- 10 -

Also, the major banks have created a credit information bureau, enabling them to
better gauge the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.
•

Energy: The technical and financial viability of the energy sector improved
somewhat during the year, with quasi-fiscal losses declining from 4.5 percent of GDP
in 2004 to an estimated 4 percent in 2005, owing mainly to the significant increase in
collections due to the use of communal metering and reinforcement of payment
discipline.

•

Business environment: A law was passed in June 2005, reducing the number of
businesses for which a license is required from 900 to 150, and reducing the time for
applying and processing applications using a “one-window” approval and the “silence
is consent” principle.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM

14.
The program is broadly on track, with only one missed quantitative
performance criterion (Table 8). Fiscal performance was stronger than programmed, with
tax revenues well above program levels more than offsetting expenditures slightly above
program levels. After slightly exceeding the June indicative reserve money target, the NBG
stepped up efforts to contain reserve money growth, observing the end-September
quantitative performance criterion and end-December indicative targets on reserve money by
wide margins. NIR targets were met comfortably. The one area where performance was
poorer than programmed was arrears clearance, as the authorities missed the September
performance criterion for clearance of domestic expenditure arrears, and the indicative target
for the year. Citing inflationary concerns, the authorities only cleared arrears of
GEL 104 million (0.9 percent of GDP) in 2005, compared to the programmed level of
GEL 149 million (1.3 percent of GDP).
15.
One end-September structural performance criterion was met, while the other—
the submission of the Customs Code to parliament—was implemented with a short
delay (Table 9). Two of three end-September structural benchmarks were also met. The
missed structural benchmark (on the submission of the trade liberalization strategy) was
delayed to give the business community time to comment, and the authorities time to
consider a more radical liberalization. The resulting strategy calls for a reduction of the top
tariff rate from 30 to 12 percent in 2006, 5 percent in 2007, and the elimination of import
tariffs by 2008. The authorities met the end-December performance criterion for completing
the transition to the single treasury account, the benchmarks for proposing upgraded “Fit and
Proper” criteria for bank owners, and the preparation of a pension strategy, but missed two of
five end-2005 benchmarks.5 The introduction of targeted poverty benefits, which was
delayed by inflation concerns and the complexities of proper targeting, is proposed as a
5

performance criterion for end-June 2006. The other missed benchmark—to complete
registering taxpayers—is underway.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
16.
Against the backdrop of reasonably low inflation and good growth performance,
underpinned by strong and consistent reforms, the Article IV discussions focused on
medium-term policies necessary to maintain growth and reduce poverty. Discussions
centered on measures to deal with obstacles to growth—including crumbling infrastructure
that needs to be addressed by the public investment program, financial sector
underdevelopment, and poor institutional quality affecting private sector investment—while
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
A. Medium-Term Economic Prospects and Challenges
17.
The authorities assess economic prospects in the medium term as strong (Table
10). Their focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability, liberalizing the economy and
removing remaining obstacles to businesses, and developing complementary public
infrastructure required for private sector activity, should create an environment for steady
growth and improvement of living standards in the coming years.
18.
The primary focus of the public investment program over the medium term is
on improving roads and power supply, which the authorities consider to be key to
maintaining growth. The authorities recognize the importance of strengthening their
medium-term fiscal planning, and in that context are seeking to improve the Basic Data and
Directions (BDD) document, their equivalent of an MTEF. Nonetheless, they view the four
supplementary budgets in 2005 as a positive reflection of their strong revenue and
privatization performance. Discussions focused on ways to increasingly tie expenditure
policy to a well prioritized medium-term strategy that could provide a coherent policy
framework in which to prepare supplementary budgets.
19.
The NBG and government are preparing a financial sector development strategy
for 2006–09. The strategy will focus on (i) streamlining some of the more cumbersome
regulations and harmonizing them with Basle principles, (ii) consolidating NBG's functions
and independence; (iii) refining the payments system; (iv) introducing measures to develop
capital markets, including for government securities; and (v) easing the entrance of foreign
banks into Georgia.
20.
Despite substantial progress on reducing corruption and improving governance,
the authorities realize that further reforms, particularly in the judicial area, are needed
(SIP, Chapter III). The authorities see Georgia becoming a liberal and deregulated market
economy, with few opportunities for rent-seeking. In addition, the new trade liberalization
strategy, which will eliminate all tariffs by 2008, is seen by the authorities as a key step to
integrate Georgia into the global economy.

- 12 -

21.
The main challenge facing the authorities is to maintain macroeconomic stability
in the face of a significant inflow of resources, election pressures, and regional tensions.
With privatization proceeds, remittances, and official assistance—including grants soon to
begin from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)—financing rural infrastructure and
the rehabilitation of the energy sector, the burden of controlling inflation will be on monetary
policy. In addition to maintaining the quality of spending given capacity constraints, the
fiscal and monetary policy mix may need to be reexamined going forward. In this regard, the
authorities recognize that the NBG’s ability to conduct monetary operations needs to be
strengthened, and the coordination of policies between the NBG and ministry of finance
improved. Finally, regional tensions and political uncertainties represent a risk to sustainable
medium-term growth.
B. Near-Term Economic Policies
22.
As a foundation for program discussions, the authorities updated the
macroeconomic framework for 2006 to reflect the recent robust performance of the
economy, keeping in line with underlying PRSP objectives. Real GDP growth is projected
to be 6.4 percent in 2006, assuming a slowdown of agricultural growth to a more sustainable
level and high oil and gas prices. The fiscal stance is projected to remain roughly unchanged,
with a programmed deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP on a cash basis, as all remaining domestic
arrears are cleared. While the budget projects the fiscal deficit on a commitment basis to
increase to 2.2 percent of GDP, staff projects the deficit to decline to 1.1 percent of GDP
(from 1.5 percent in 2005). The monetary program targets a further reserve accumulation of
about US$146 million in 2006, which would increase non-pipeline import coverage to
2.3 months, whereas growth of reserve money would be limited to 25 percent, consistent
with a targeted decrease of CPI inflation to 4.7 percent by end-December 2006 (MEFP Table
2).
2006 budget
23.

The 2006 budget incorporates the following key features:

•

A fiscal framework in line with the PRSP and MTEF;

•

Financing from privatization proceeds and concessional resources;

•

Tax revenues that are projected conservatively against the backdrop of large
improvements in tax administration in 2004, and the major tax reform in 2005; and

•

A focus on the quality and sustainability of increased expenditures on infrastructure,
energy, and defense, and the replacement of untargeted social programs with welltargeted extreme poverty benefits.

24.
The 2006 budget envisages a roughly unchanged fiscal stance, with a deficit of
2.2 percent of GDP on a commitment basis. Clearance of arrears is budgeted to be

- 13 -

0.4 percent of GDP, reflecting arrears claims that have already been verified, leading to a
deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP on a cash basis.
25.
The budget contemplates an increase in current expenditures (0.6 percent of
GDP) and a decrease in capital expenditure (0.5 percent of GDP). The wage bill is
expected to remain roughly unchanged as a share of GDP, and defense spending to decline
slightly, while social spending is projected to increase to about 9 percent of GDP, reflecting
anticipated increases in minimum pensions as well as the targeted poverty benefit program
now scheduled for mid-2006.6,7 The budget also includes GEL 35 million in temporary
energy subsidies to cushion private gas consumers from the 70 percent increase in gas tariffs,
prior to the introduction of the new poverty benefit.
26.
The 2006 budget includes a conservative 19.3 percent of GDP revenue
projection, as the budget was prepared before the 2005 outturns were known. Actual
2005 tax revenues amounted to 19.8 percent of GDP, reflecting continued gains in tax
collections and further improvements in revenue administration. The authorities agree that
this strong revenue effort is likely to be sustained, with 2006 tax revenues expected to be
about 1 percent of GDP higher than budgeted. They intend to use excess revenues first to
finance the clearance of any additional verified arrears, as the government seeks to resolve
all arrears claims outstanding as of end-2005 by end-2006 (MEFP, paragraph 16 and Table 1;
a planned structural performance criterion for end-December 2006). Notwithstanding the
reductions in customs duties, import taxes are expected to be unchanged as a percentage of
GDP, as lower rates (including excises on cigarettes) are expected to reduce smuggling.
27.
Grants are expected to increase in 2006, partially offsetting declining
privatization receipts. The 2006 MCA disbursements comprise the majority of the projected
1.3 percent of GDP in grants. Privatization receipts are projected to be 2.6 percent of GDP.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
28.
The monetary program for 2006 targets reserve money growth at 25 percent,
consistent with the authorities’ single-digit inflation objective (Box 2, MEFP paragraph
32). The program does not foresee direct borrowing from the central bank, and the authorities
intend to introduce legislation prohibiting any such borrowing in the future (an end-March
performance criterion).

6

Progress toward the implementation of this targeted poverty benefit has been substantial, with a significant
share of Georgian families already having applied for the benefit.
7

Goods and services are expected to increase by 2 percent of GDP. This increase is largely presentational, and
mostly offset by lower local government expenditures, as schools were converted to LEPLs, and transfers to
LEPLs are recorded as purchases of goods and services.

- 14 -

29.
The NBG emphasized that it stood ready to use its indirect monetary policy
instruments more actively to affect the monetary base, including sterilizing its foreign
exchange interventions. To increase its stock of such instruments, the ministry of finance
and the NBG are nearing agreement on securitizing some of the non-tradable government
debt held by the central bank (MEFP, paragraph 33).8 In the event of unexpected capital
inflows, the NBG will conduct sales of treasury bills and central bank CDs to contain the
monetary expansion from any foreign exchange purchases. In light of mounting confidence
in the banking system that should allow further dedollarization, the NBG also plans to
streamline its reserve requirements by equalizing the requirements for domestic and foreigncurrency deposits.9
Box 2. Preparing for Inflation Targeting
Most CIS countries, including Georgia, manage the exchange rate, but are exposed to frequent and
sometimes large external shocks. An (implicit) exchange rate peg may not be sustainable, since both
reserves and sterilization instruments are limited. Recognizing the importance of low and stable inflation,
most countries also monitor monetary aggregates. This strategy, however, can prove difficult in light of
money demand instability.
As an alternative monetary policy framework, a growing number of countries have chosen to
target inflation directly. Some of the prerequisites of inflation targeting include (i) price stability as the
overriding objective of monetary policy; (ii) an independent central bank that has instruments to reach its
(assigned and agreed) inflation target; (iii) a strong accountability framework; (iv) a strong and wellunderstood transmission mechanism from the NBG’s operating target to inflation; and (v) a sufficiently
good econometric model to successfully forecast inflation.
While the NBG believes it will not be ready to switch to this paradigm soon, fulfilling these
prerequisites would contribute to improving the conduct of monetary policy. Although the NBG is
in principle autonomous, it is subject to political pressures to influence the exchange rate and interest
rate. A public declaration that price stability is the NBG's overriding goal (together with a commitment to
a more flexible exchange rate) would help reduce these pressures. While the NBG's legal mandate
currently includes price stability, it also includes maintaining the purchasing power of the lari, which
could conflict with price stability. The NBG has announced an "estimate" (as opposed to "target") for the
one-year-ahead CPI inflation rate, continues to develop a macroeconomic model, and is aiming to
publish a financial stability report. Finally, the NBG recognizes that it should embark on a public
campaign to explain its monetary policy actions and report to the public at a higher frequency.

30.
Maintaining external competitiveness remains a key policy challenge. The CPIbased real exchange rate and low labor costs suggest the lari may be undervalued. Thus,
8

Discussions on this agreement are currently focused on the government’s desire to see a reduction in NBG
administrative costs. Failure to reach agreement would make implementation of the agreed monetary program
more difficult, but would not fundamentally undermine the authorities’ economic program.
9

Reserve requirements are currently 2 percent for lari deposits and 13 percent for foreign currency deposits.

- 15 -

further upward pressure on the exchange rate stemming from strong international financial
support and FDI expected for Georgia over the medium term could well be accommodated.
At the same time, surveys of the costs of doing business in Georgia suggest that external
competitiveness may be weaker than the real exchange rate comparisons suggest.
31.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a floating exchange rate regime
and their general intention to refrain from intervention other than to smooth market
fluctuations. However, while recognizing the importance of the inflation target, the
authorities voiced concerns about the negative impact of a lari appreciation on exports in the
event of larger-than-anticipated foreign exchange inflows. In their view, large U.S. dollardenominated household assets and income flows would require a more managed approach to
appreciation if pressures were to arise.
C. Structural Reforms
32.
There have been improvements in fiscal transparency since 2004. However,
concerns remained about the persistence of quasi-fiscal funds operating outside the budget
with limited accountability and transparency. Two such funds—the Armed Forces Fund and
the Law Enforcement Fund—had been widely discussed in Georgia. The authorities
explained that these funds had been formed in early 2004 to address specific problems, but
noted that there was no longer any need for them. These funds are now closed, and are being
liquidated (MEFP, paragraph 30). A third fund, the Reform and Development Fund, which
previously financed budget expenses, has been transformed into an NGO.
33.
More generally, the authorities are undertaking a program of reforms of
LEPLs, which have become the cornerstone of their decentralization strategy. The
authorities are committed to decentralizing the provision of government services, and are
delegating control and accountability of major government functions to these LEPLs. While
having no disagreement with these principles, staff argued that a monitoring and reporting
framework needed to be put in place urgently. The authorities agreed it was important to
ensure the LEPL reform did not undermine gains in fiscal transparency and accountability
(Box 3), and are committed to a number of steps designed to ensure effective monitoring of
their activities (MEFP, paragraph 29). It was agreed that progress in this area would be
reviewed in the context of the fourth review of Georgia’s PRGF arrangement.

- 16 -

Box 3. Reforming Legal Entities of Public Law (LEPLs)
The authorities view the conversion of fiscal entities into LEPLs as an opportunity to improve
government service delivery (SIP, Chapter IV). The conversion of budgetary organizations to LEPL
status is designed to provide them greater autonomy, and thus allow them to implement reforms quickly
while bypassing bureaucratic red tape. However, insufficient consideration may have been given to
ensuring the new LEPLs were accountable for results, or to monitoring their activities. While the exact
number of LEPLs is not known, between 1999 and 2003 an estimated 700 budgetary organizations were
converted to LEPLs at the local and central government level. In December 2005, the authorities
converted about 2,700 individual schools into LEPLs, bringing the estimated number to more than 3,400.
The main fiscal risks associated with the LEPL reform include the following:
•

The LEPL reform in its present state weakens the monitoring and reporting of the fiscal
accounts of the general government, with implications for budget transparency and control;

•

The delegation of authority will create problems controlling the quality of spending, particularly
as LEPLs have less developed Public Expenditure Management systems; and

•

There is a significant risk that LEPLs may incur debt and arrears.

34.
The authorities emphasized the importance of upgrading the Budget Systems
Law (BSL) to organic status, but noted that certain technical amendments to the BSL were
needed first; after these were passed, they would renew their efforts to get the law upgraded.
They reiterated their intention to be GFS 2001 compliant by 2007.
35.
Building on the comprehensive tax reforms that took place in 2005, the ministry
of finance plans to improve tax administration by focusing on three key priorities: (i) selfassessment, (ii) risk management, and (iii) taxpayer segmentation. An FAD regional tax
administration advisor will assist the authorities in these efforts. While acknowledging that
the customs code that was recently submitted to parliament represents a significant
improvement, staff urged the authorities to strengthen the penalty provisions in this code; the
authorities agreed to consider this recommendation.
36.
The NBG plans further financial sector reforms (Box 4), including strengthening
supervision (MEFP paragraphs 34–39). Consideration is being given to introduction of a
deposit insurance system, but the authorities recognize that appropriate conditions are
necessary before its introduction. The authorities believe further sector consolidation, by
merging or closing weak banks, will be an important step toward creating appropriate
conditions for deposit insurance. Finally, an FSAP update is currently underway. The
authorities plan to implement recommendations coming from this exercise, which will be
reflected in an FSSA to be presented to the Board along with the fourth review.

- 17 -

Box 4. Developing the Financial Sector in Georgia
Financial sector development in Georgia has lagged behind many other transition countries (SIP,
Chapter I). Monetization was low after independence, trailing the levels in Central and Eastern
European economies and the Baltics (see table). Financial intermediation is shallow, and commercial
banks have targeted their activities to a small group of companies and consumers, resulting in lower
private sector credit than in the comparable countries.
Over the past year, increased confidence in the Georgian banking system, higher consumer
spending, and emerging business opportunities have triggered a credit boom. Since end-2004,
commercial banks’ lending to the private sector has increased by more than 80 percent—albeit from very
low levels. Some of the additional loans are consumption-related or mortgages, fuelling property prices
in Tbilisi.
While economic growth has been high in recent years despite the limited financial market
development, a stronger financial sector will be essential to sustain this economic development.
Greater financial intermediation, in particular benefiting small- and medium-sized enterprises, should
spur investment and job creation. As firms’ financing needs go beyond retained earnings, and equity
financing is not viable given shallow equity markets, the banking sector will play a crucial role. For the
financial sector in Georgia to catch-up with the advanced transition economies, financial sector reforms
such as greater consolidation and foreign entry, and enhanced creditors’ rights, need to gain momentum.

The authorities are increasingly focused on strengthening the energy sector
through modernization, privatization and diversification of energy sources. They noted
the need to install individual meters for households and adjust electricity tariffs to costrecovery levels, upon the completion of the tariff review sponsored by the World Bank (Box
5). The authorities plan to privatize six hydropower plants and three distribution companies
in 2006. In addition, a draft law has been prepared establishing a debt restructuring
committee charged with resolving the long-standing problems in the sector.

- 18 -

Box 5. The World Bank Work Program in Georgia
The World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY06–09 builds on the government Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP), as well as emerging government strategic
thinking on the development framework. It targets several goals: i) generating growth and job creation by
removing barriers to private sector development and improving infrastructure, finance and markets; ii)
enhancing human development and social protection through improved education, health, social
protection, and community services; and iii) strengthening public sector management and budgetary
processes to enable Georgia to better plan and meet its own development goals.
A key component of the CPS is a series of Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSO). The PRSO
has four pillars:
•

Strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency.

•

Improving electricity and gas sector services.

•

Improving environment for private sector development.

•

Improving social protection, education, and health care services.

38.
A key goal for the authorities is to create a favorable business climate by
liberalizing the economy, and restructuring and privatizing the remaining state-owned
enterprises. The EBRD transition indicators show significant accomplishments in these
areas, especially in comparison to other CIS countries (Box 6). In addition to a better
business environment, several surveys have also reflected improvements in governance,
although important challenges remain.

- 19 -

Box 6. Latest Surveys on the Business Environment and Governance
The Georgian authorities have clearly established momentum in reforming the business environment. A
series of surveys that came out in 2005 reflect improvements resulting from the policy changes
undertaken by the current administration. Most informal views are that the next round of these surveys
will reflect even larger gains.
In the World Bank’s Doing Business 2005, Georgia showed the second largest improvement and ranked
100 out of 155 countries. Georgia performed better than other countries in the region in starting a
business, rigidity of employment, registering property, and closing a business.
In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index of 2005, Georgia was ranked 86th out of
117 countries, up 8 spots, the seventh largest upward move. The two main areas of improvement were
macroeconomic stability and the quality of public institutions.
Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom had Georgia jumping from 100th place in 2005 to
68th place in 2006, with its score improving from “mostly unfree” last year to “mostly free” this year.
Areas of improvement were concentrated in monetary policy, the financial sector, and foreign
investment, while property rights, regulation, and the informal market scores remained poor.
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005 showed modest improvement from 2 to
2.3.

Technical assistance and data issues
39.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with the technical assistance provided by
the Fund during the last two years (Appendix I). While the assistance has been broadly
effective, there have been delays in the implementation of some recommendations. These
shortcomings can be attributed to capacity constraints and, in certain areas, changing
priorities. Future needs involve government finance and balance of payments statistics

- 20 -

methodology, as well as implementation of recommendations from the FSAP update
currently underway.
40.
The quality and timeliness of economic and social statistics have improved over
the past few years, although real sector, fiscal, and balance of payments data require further
enhancements (Appendix IV). Georgia plans to subscribe to the General Data Dissemination
Standard, and the data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring.
D. Medium-Term Risks and Capacity to Repay
41.
The medium-term debt sustainability analysis (Appendix V), shows that Georgia
faces a moderate risk of debt distress, as evidenced by the decline in the medium term of
all indicators of external indebtedness below the relevant debt-burden thresholds of the NPV
of debt (150 percent of exports, 40 percent of GDP, and 250 percent of fiscal revenue).10
Stress tests indicate that Georgia would be vulnerable to adverse external and domestic
shocks, or bad policy choices. For example, export value growth less than historical
averages—2 percent growth for 2 years—would result in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
becoming unsustainable at 150 percent, even if the gap were financed at better than
commercial terms (30 percent grant element). With official reserves low (at about 2 months
of non-pipeline imports), this could erode hard gained exchange rate stability. Overall,
Georgia’s capacity to repay the Fund seems strong (Tables 11 and 12).
42.
A significant risk this year is the authorities’ commitment to maintain
macroeconomic restraint in the face of election pressures while sustaining commitment to
pro-poor spending. In addition, relations with Russia are tense, as political tensions remain
high regarding the status of the breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The
recent explosions, which interrupted gas and electricity imports from Russia, show that the
energy sector continues to be a major source of vulnerability. Energy sector reforms,
including privatizations that are transparent and internationally tendered, as well as a further
diversification of energy sources, would contribute to the sector’s medium-term viability.
Finally, continued progress in structural reforms will be necessary for sustainable mediumterm growth.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The transition, following the Rose Revolution, to better quality fiscal policies
underpinned by a determined undertaking of a broad range of reforms, including in tax
10

These thresholds are policy-dependent and Georgia is considered a medium policy performer, as
measured by the World Bank’s CPIA. The main macroeconomic assumptions of the baseline scenario
include real GDP growth of about 5 percent in 2006–11 and 3½ percent in 2016–25, inflation of less
than 5 percent after 2006, and an external current account deficit excluding interest payments of less
than 5 percent of GDP in 2006–11, falling to less than 2 ½ percent thereafter.

- 21 -

policy and administration and the business environment, has provided a key foundation
for placing the Georgian economy on a strong growth path. The authorities are to be
commended for their performance over this period. The challenge ahead is to reinforce the
reforms with adequate implementation, while proactively addressing the remaining
vulnerabilities.
44.
The staff welcomes the effective implementation of the economic program in
2005. All but one of the quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2005 were met.
Although the authorities cited inflation as the reason for not clearing the programmed level
of arrears, staff believes that clearing back wages and salaries would have had minimal
impact on inflation. The staff thus welcomes the authorities’ commitment to clear all
remaining arrears by end-2006.
45.
Owing largely to the strong revenue performance and restraint on capital
expenditures, the deficit was half the budgeted level. Given this positive fiscal position,
staff regrets the delay in clearing arrears and introducing a targeted poverty benefit.
Moreover, staff believes there is an urgent need to strengthen fiscal planning, and to put it in
the context of a meaningful MTEF. The pace of increase in some categories of spending is
also cause for concern, such as the increase in current expenditures by more than 4 percent of
GDP and the more than doubling of defense spending.
46.
The projections underlying the 2006 budget appear conservative. The main risk
to the agreed framework is the danger of supplemental budgets to increase spending in an
election year. The staff urges the authorities to exercise spending restraint, and to ensure all
expenditures are in line with the PRSP and MTEF.
47.
The newly created LEPLs have to be monitored carefully to ensure adequate
financial control. While acknowledging the authorities’ objective of creating more flexible
functions of government, staff is concerned with the rapid movement in this direction
without adequate monitoring and reporting procedures. The staff urges the authorities to
urgently develop and implement such procedures.
48.
The current stance of monetary policy, aimed at lowering inflation to about
5 percent, is appropriate. To attain this target, it will be important to allow the exchange
rate to appreciate, especially in the event of higher capital inflows. Foreign exchange
intervention should be limited to smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The level of the
exchange rate is possibly somewhat undervalued at the present time; the nominal exchange
rate should be allowed to appreciate over the medium term while safeguarding
competitiveness through structural reform-induced productivity improvements.
49.
While staff welcomes the improved coordination between the ministry of finance
and NBG, there is need for further improvement in this coordination to avoid swings in
monetary aggregates. Moreover, the authorities should be prepared to actively use the newly
created instruments of monetary policy to achieve their inflation targets.

- 22 -

50.
The financial sector’s growth in the last year, albeit from a very low base, has
been impressive. To ensure the sector remains healthy amid such vigorous expansion, it will
be critical to ensure strong and effective banking supervision. In addition, increasing
minimum capital requirements, allowing foreign banks to enter and further consolidate the
sector, and implementing fit and proper ownership requirements will be important. The
adoption of forthcoming FSAP recommendations should further strengthen the financial
sector.
51.
Notwithstanding the tremendous gains made in the last two years, the structural
reform agenda needs to be ambitious to increase competitiveness, sustain growth and
reduce poverty. The authorities’ priorities to overhaul and transform transport infrastructure,
and the energy and water sectors, to deepen the financial sector, and to improve customs in
conjunction with radical trade liberalization that envisages a complete abolition of import
tariffs in two years, appropriately target removing the key obstacles to growth. If effectively
implemented in the context of macroeconomic stability and a favorable business
environment, they will provide reasonable assurance of sustained growth over the mediumterm. Notwithstanding the impressive recent improvements, to ensure a favorable business
environment, it will be important for the authorities to continue to aggressively work to
improve governance and property rights.
52.
Staff remains concerned that safety nets are not in place at this critical juncture.
While increasing pensions and defraying higher energy costs for households will help the
poor, the authorities need to move ahead with clearing wage and pension arrears and
introducing the targeted extreme poverty benefit. Going forward, poverty and inequality
reduction is essential to keep broad support for the market-based reforms that will deliver
higher living standards for all in Georgia.
53.
Given Georgia’s good overall performance under the program, and commitments
outlined in the MEFP, staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the
nonobservance of performance criteria and recommends the completion of the third review
of the PRGF arrangement. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultations be held in the
24-month cycle.

APPENDIX I

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) is
subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on June 4, 2004.
The assessment was completed on December 10, 2004 and concluded that safeguards in
place at the NBG appear generally adequate. However, certain vulnerabilities were identified
in the internal audit and internal controls areas, and the safeguards assessment recommended
measures to address them.
IX.

Exchange Arrangements:

(a) Since April 29, 1993, the Tbilisi Interbank Currency Exchange (TICEX), established
by the NBG and a group of commercial banks, has conducted periodic auctions to determine
the exchange rate of the domestic currency vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. These auctions are
conducted daily. Foreign exchange bureaus are allowed to buy and sell foreign currency bank
notes. Georgia’s exchange rate regime is classified as “managed floating.”
(b) Georgia maintains no exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security
reasons, and notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
X.

APPENDIX II

GEORGIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership in Georgia’s Development Strategy
1.
The government’s PRSP; Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(EDPRP), was presented to the Boards of IDA and the IMF in October and November 2003.
A Joint Staff Advisory Note together with the Progress Report on the EDPRP was sent to the
Boards of IDA and IMF in June 2005. The IMF completed the second review under the
PRGF arrangement in July 2005. On September 15, 2005, IDA endorsed a new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY06–09, and approved the first in a program of three
Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs).
2.
The Fund has taken the lead in assisting Georgia in improving macroeconomic
stability and pursuing fiscal reforms. The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy
dialogue on structural issues, focusing on: (i) strengthening public expenditure management;
(ii) improving performance of the public sector; (iii) reducing corruption; (iv) deepening and
diversifying sources of growth; (v) protecting the environment; and (vi) reducing poverty.
Georgia is one of the largest IDA borrowers in the CIS, with borrowing of US$816 million
for 40 operations. The PRSO has supported further elaboration and implementation of the
key elements of the government’s poverty reduction strategy as described in the EDPRP and
Progress Report. The PRSO program is built on four pillars: (i) strengthening public sector
accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector
services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving
social protection, education and health care services. Other support has come in the form of
project support and Analytic and Advisory Activities across a broad spectrum of areas
including education, health care, social protection, energy, roads, water and sanitation,
agriculture, agricultural research and extension, irrigation and drainage, forestry,
environment, biodiversity, enterprise development, municipal development, judicial reform,
and cultural heritage. A Public Expenditure Review (PER) was prepared in 2002, and a
Trade Study in 2003. The PER is being followed by a series of annual programmatic PERs,
the first of which is under preparation. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
was prepared in 2002 and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in 2003.
Updates of these are scheduled for FY06. A series of annual programmatic Poverty
Assessments are being implemented
3.
Georgia became a shareholder and a member of IFC in 1995. As of January 1, 2006,
IFC has invested around $137 million to finance projects in the financial, power, oil and gas,
and manufacturing sectors. IFC continues to explore the investment opportunities in
partnership with strategic investors in both the financial and real sectors of the country. In
the financial sector, IFC has focused on supporting the development of the housing finance
market, providing credit lines and technical assistance to the leading banks—the Bank of
Georgia and TBC Bank. To reach small and medium enterprises, IFC helped to establish
ProCredit Bank of Georgia, the country’s first bank specializing in lending to micro and
small enterprises. Most recently, IFC has provided a credit line to TBC Leasing to support
the rapid growth of their portfolio of SME clients; this project grows out of two year's of

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

technical assistance to the Government and private sector to support the growth of the leasing
sector. In oil transit, IFC has provided equity and credit to local and international companies,
including investments by British Petroleum and other sponsors in the construction of the
Baku-Supsa Early Oil Pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline. Other investment
projects have been in electricity distribution (AES-Telasi), mineral water (GGMW), and
glass bottle production (Ksani Glass Factory). IFC has also provided donor-supported
technical assistance to strengthen its client banks, introduce new financial products
(including leasing and housing finance), support public-private partnerships in the energy
sector, and to improve the business climate and corporate governance practices. The Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), a joint facility of IFC and the World Bank, carried out
an Assessment of Administrative Procedures for Doing Business in 2003. FIAS finalized an
advisory project in July 2004 to assist the Government in its efforts to remove administrative
obstacles to investment to improve the business environment for private businesses, and the
Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) did an extensive study of the barriers to SMEs, finalized
in early 2005. PEP and FIAS are currently holding joint consultations with the Government
to identify concrete steps to be taken for improvements to the business environment.
4.
Table 1 summarizes the division of responsibilities between the two institutions. In a
number of areas—for example, the social sectors, rural development, environment,
infrastructure, and judicial reform—the Bank takes the lead in the dialogue and there is no
related conditionality in the IMF-supported program. The Bank is also leading the dialogue
on private sector development and energy, and Bank analysis serves as inputs into the Fund
program. In other areas—the financial sector, public expenditure management, and civil
service reform—both institutions have worked together. Finally, in areas like monetary
policy and domestic customs revenue, the IMF takes the lead.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
5.
In the social sectors, IDA updates Georgia’s Poverty Assessment based on quarterly
household data. IDA’s focus has been to improve execution of budgetary expenditures for
health, education and poverty benefits and to raise the efficiency in the use of scarce public
resources. Through the Social Investment Fund credits, IDA is focusing in particular on areas
with high poverty levels to provide basic infrastructure to the poorest communities. Through
the PRSO program, IDA is strengthening the dialogue with the government on social
protection reform (safety nets, pensions, poverty benefits, labor market institutions and
policies).
6.
In education, the Adaptable Program Credit addresses a broad spectrum of
educational reform issues, aimed at improving learning outcomes of primary and secondary
students through curriculum reform, development of a national assessment and examination
system, training of teachers, provision of learning materials, and development of capacity to
make better use of physical, financial, and human resources. It also tackles key financing
issues through the introduction of a per capita based formula for financing basic education.

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

While the investment needs of school buildings are substantially higher than is currently
affordable, the Social Investment Fund projects continue to assist in financing urgent repairs
to school facilities in many communities. The first PRSO is supporting the government’s
efforts in institutionalizing systemic changes initiated with its education reform strategy.
7.
In health, IDA credits support the government in improving health care financing,
exploring risk-pooling options, introducing a new system of primary health care, and
improving the focus of publicly-funded services to the poor and on priority public health
interventions. SAC III and the SRS Credit have supported hospital restructuring. In addition,
IDA will be engaged in policy work in health sector reform in the context of the MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the PRSO program.
8.
In infrastructure, support is being provided through the Secondary and Local Roads
Project, the Municipal Development and Decentralization Project II and the Social
Investment Fund Project. These projects provide financing at the community level for critical
infrastructure needs, primarily for school and health facility heating and repair, small
hydropower schemes to provide electricity, drinking water and sanitation rehabilitation, as
well as transportation infrastructure rehabilitation. IFC supported the privatization of Tbilisi
electricity distribution through an investment in AES-Telasi, and IFC Advisory Services
advised the government on the management contract for UEDC. The recently approved
Infrastructure Pre-Investment Facility project is to facilitate infrastructure investments of
strategic importance and/or special complexity by providing technical assistance to assess the
feasibility and effectiveness of investments, focusing on energy and transport sectors,
9.
In rural development, IDA credits have supported development of private sector
farming and agro-processing improvements, agricultural credit, irrigation and drainage, and
agricultural research. IDA credits have also been supporting creation of local institutions,
such as rural credit unions and water users associations. A recently approved Rural
Development Project is to develop the productivity and profitability of the private agriculture
sector with the aim to increase incomes and employment and reduce poverty in rural areas.
10.
A Judicial Reform Project has provided funds for development of new court
administration and case management procedures, rehabilitation and construction of
courthouses, a computerized network system, assistance for judicial training, and an
extensive public information and education outreach effort to inform citizens of their rights
and communicate the government’s reform efforts.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
11.
The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the PRSO program.
Institution building and technical assistance have been supported through the Structural
Reform Support Project. The Bank also leads in the areas of:

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

a)

Private Sector Development. The PRSO program focuses on improving investment
climate and reducing constraints to private sector development in Georgia. IDA has
also been supporting private sector participation in other areas, such as energy, urban
services and agriculture. The IMF has worked with the authorities to initiate audits of
the accounts of three major state-owned enterprises.

b)

Energy. The energy system is in poor condition, with unreliable supply and
unsustainable debts. However, under the PRSO program, the Georgian authorities
have made progress and payment collections and service levels have improved
substantially in the power sector. The Government of Georgia has been working with
IDA and other donors, including the Fund, to introduce more private management
and ownership, and to implement a series of short-term action plans and longer-term
steps to improve the overall functioning of the sector. IDA has also provided
additional funding to the power sector in 2004. The Fund has been focusing on
reducing quasi-fiscal losses in the sector, especially through improved bill
collections, while the pursuit of tariff policies at cost-recovery levels would be
facilitated by a Bank-assisted review of the tariff policy methodology. The Georgian
authorities prepared the Energy Sector Strategic Action Plan for 2005–08 which is
being implemented and updated periodically under the PRSO program. In a new
operation, the Bank will finance a feasibility study for a major, new hydropower plant
that could add about 20 percent to the country’s hydropower capacity.

c)

Public Sector Management. The first PRSO supports, inter alia, administrative and
civil service reform, improvements in public expenditure management and
strengthening financial accountability. The recently approved Public Sector Financial
Management Reform Support Project is to provide technical assistance and capacity
building in the first three areas. The Fund is providing technical assistance in support
of tax and customs administration reform.

d)

Municipal Finance: The Municipal Development and Decentralization Project II has
been assisting the government to review the current intergovernmental fiscal relation,
and to suggest an equalization transfer system to compensate for horizontal fiscal
disparities across local governments.

Areas of shared responsibility
12.

The Bank and the Fund have been working jointly in the following main areas:

a)

Poverty Reduction Strategy. Both institutions have been working closely with the
government to support the development of the PRSP (or EDPRP as it is known in
Georgia), through seminars and workshops, direct staff input, and donor coordination.
A JSAN on the progress with implementation of the government’s EDPRP was
issued in June 2005.

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

b)

Budget Planning and Execution. The annual programmatic Public Expenditure
Reviews and the PRSO program will provide the underpinnings for systemic changes
in expenditure management, development of an MTEF, and improvements in
financial accountability. The Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support
Project will finance technical assistance and necessary investment to support budget
planning and management processes within the MoF and line ministries and to
support introduction of an integrated public financial management system. The Fund
is focusing on treasury reform within the ministry of finance.

c)

Financial Sector Reforms. The joint Financial Sector Assessment Program has
supported: (i) strengthened banking and non-banking supervision; (ii) introduction of
international accounting standards; (iii) consolidation of banks through higher capital
requirement ratios; (iv) anti money-laundering legislation; (v) strengthening the
regulatory environment and removing impediments for development of viable
nonbank financial institutions; and (vi) strengthening the payment system. IFC has
worked to strengthen the banking sector through investment and technical assistance,
and has supported the development of the financial leasing market through technical
assistance. The Fund has focused on banking supervision, anti-money laundering
legislation, and improvements in monetary control instruments with extensive
technical assistance from its Monetary and Financial Systems Department.

Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
a)

Fiscal Framework and reforms in tax policy and tax and customs
administration. The Fund’s focus on prudent fiscal policy has served as an important
framework for IDA’s work on public expenditure management. The Fund’s Fiscal
Affairs Department is now taking the lead in the areas of tax policy and tax and
customs administration reform.

b)

A. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY
13.
On September 15, 2005, the World Bank Executive Board endorsed the new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY06-09 designed to assist Georgia with deeper institutional
reform as well as more fundamental infrastructure improvements. The CPS builds on the
EDPRP, as well as emerging Government strategic thinking on the development framework.
In doing so, it targets several goals: (i) Generating growth and job creation by removing
barriers to private sector development and improving infrastructure, finance and markets;
(ii) Enhancing human development and social protection through improved education,
health, social protection, and community services; and (iii) Strengthening public sector
management and budgetary processes to enable Georgia to better plan and meet its own
development goals. Along with the CPS, the first PRSO, of a series of three single tranche
annual Poverty Reduction Support Operations was approved of which US$13.5 million is a
regular IDA credit and US$6.5 million is an IDA grant. Other recent operations include a
US$5 million Infrastructure Pre-Investment Facility Project, a US$3 million Public Sector
Financial Management Reform Support Project, a US$24 million Reform Support Credit, a
US$20 million Secondary and Local Roads Project, a US$3.6 million Electricity Market
Support Project, a US$10 million Rural Development Project, and a US$5 million Irrigation
and Drainage Community Development Project Additional Funding for flood control. The
Bank continues its discussion with the government on a more comprehensive medium-term
reform strategy that would be supported by future Poverty Reduction Support Operations and
technical assistance operations.

APPENDIX III

GEORGIA: RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of December 31, 2005)
1.
As of December 31, 2005, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) had signed 49 investments in Georgia with cumulative commitments totaling
US$401.3 million.11 Current Portfolio Stock equals to US$259.8 million. The EBRD’s first
operation, a power rehabilitation project, was signed in December 1994. Since then, the pace
and composition of portfolio growth has varied significantly from year to year. Current
portfolio includes thirty three private sector projects (of which five projects are regional).
The ratio of private sector projects in the portfolio now stands at 80 percent.
2.
During 2004, all operations signed in Georgia were in the private sector and
amounted to US$95.2 million. The energy sector accounted for the largest share of signings –
US$78.6 million. The Bank also provided an additional SME line of credit to a local bank for
US$2.7 million, an equity increase in a local partner bank and expanded its Trade facilitation
program by US$10.9 million. Financial support to the local production sector was also
provided, including a US$1.1 million equity investment to a local private sector refreshment
drinks producer and a US$1.2 million equity investment in a private local wine producer.
3.
During 2005, the Bank signed 18 transactions in Georgia for US$105.9 million in
total of which all but one were in the private sector and all were without sovereign
guarantees. These included: three DIF equity investments (US$5.3 million) all in
agribusiness; two MCFF risk sharing facilities with local banks (US$10.0 million); the first
ever municipal transport project with no SG (US$3.4 million); one regional energy project
(US$29.4 million); a wine bottling project (US$7.3 million); a SME credit line (US$10.0
million); two MCFF sub-loans (US$5.0 million); two bank capital increases (US$1.5
million); the first ever syndicated loan to a local bank (US$20.0 million in total, of which
US$7.0 million on EBRD’s account); the first loan to a local leasing company (US$3.0
million); and TFPs with three partner banks (US$24.1 million).
4.
The EBRD is helping Georgia to benefit from its privileged location, transforming it
into a regional transportation and natural resources hub. Georgia is part of the ‘Early
Transition Countries’ (ETC) initiative. Launched in April 2004, the initiative aims to
increase investments in the Bank’s seven poorest countries. The initiative builds on
international efforts to address poverty in these countries. Through this initiative, the EBRD
will focus its efforts on private sector business development and selected public sector
interventions. It aims to stimulate market activity by using a streamlined approach to
financing, focusing on smaller projects, mobilizing more investment, and encouraging
ongoing economic reform. The Bank will accept higher risk in the projects it finances in the
ETCs, while still respecting the principles of sound banking.

APPENDIX IV

GEORGIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The Fund has provided Georgia with substantial technical assistance in the
compilation of macroeconomic statistics (Appendix I, Table 1). Despite improvements in the
areas of national accounts, price, monetary, and government finance statistics, the quality of
macroeconomic statistics remains poor, reflecting deficiencies in statistical methodologies,
coverage, and insufficient resources. Problems are particularly acute in the compilation of
national accounts, balance of payments, foreign trade, and fiscal statistics. Nonetheless, the
core statistical indicators compiled by the authorities are provided on a timely basis and are
generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. The data module of the Report
on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), prepared in July 2002 was published on
the Fund’s external website on May 27, 2003. In August 2005, the authorities notified the
Fund of their commitment to participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), and appointed a national GDDS coordinator. As a next step to formal GDDS
participation, the authorities will need to prepare GDDS metadata and plans for statistical
improvement.
Real sector
2.
National accounts statistics follow the concepts and definitions of the System of
National Accounts 1993, with GDP estimates by production and expenditure compiled
annually and quarterly. Revisions of the national accounts follow an established schedule.
Preliminary national accounts estimates are available after four months, and a final estimates
after 13 months. The 2002 data ROSC mission found that data sources used for the
compilation of national accounts statistics were inadequate. The coverage of the business
register is not comprehensive because of the lack of economic census data. The coverage of
units in terms of value added is relatively good for industry, satisfactory for transport and
communications, and poor for agriculture, retail trade, construction, catering, and services.
Administrative sources used to estimate the non-observed economy are limited, and data for
imports and exports of services (taken from the balance of payments) are inadequate. The
main weakness of the statistical techniques used for national accounts are the compilation of
the constant price estimates as well as the assessment and validation of source data. Given
the sizeable infrastructure investment underway, technical assistance will need to focus on
refining statistical coverage of such projects. A technical assistance mission in
April/May 2004 proposed a number of improvements in the estimation of national accounts
from the expenditure side. An April 2005 follow-up mission identified a problem related to
the volume measure of taxes on products; as a result, GDP data for 2004 were revised.
Money and banking
3.
A March 2002 STA mission found that the authorities had implemented many of the
recommendations made by the December 2000 mission, but in a piecemeal manner that left a
number of methodological problems unresolved. To address them, the mission advised the
National Bank of Georgia (NBG) (1) to break down resident data beyond the subsectors of
“general government” and “the rest of the economy,” in order to provide more disaggregated

- 52 -

APPENDIX IV

information about the sectoral distribution of credit; (2) to incorporate all Fund-related
accounts transparently in the central bank survey; and (3) to distinguish restricted deposits of
insolvent banks from the deposit liabilities that qualify for inclusion in broad money. The
mission also reviewed implementation of the NBG’s new chart of accounts (introduced
January 1, 2001) and associated changes in procedures for compiling monetary statistics to
ensure error-free data classification. The July 2002 data ROSC found that most elements in
the data quality assessment framework for monetary statistics were fully or largely observed,
and recommended improvements in the statistical coverage of nonbank depository
corporations and the provision of documentation on metadata. It also recommended
increased transparency regarding access by governmental agencies to monetary statistics
prior to their release to the public.
4.
In response to a request from STA, the NBG has recently compiled and submitted to
STA a pilot set of monetary data using the framework of the new Standardized Report Forms
(SRF). Subsequent STA review of the data validated the resulting monetary aggregates. STA
is in the process of converting its monetary database into the SRF format for publication in
the IFS supplement. The NBG has been providing regular updates of these data to STA.
Government finance
5.
Government finance statistics (GFS) on a cash basis are reported to STA for
publication in the GFS Yearbook. Classification broadly follows the analytic framework of
the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual, but the concepts and definitions of revenue,
expenditure, and financing differ from the international standard in significant respects. In
addition, the central treasury and line departments employ differing accounting systems, with
the treasury having a single-entry cash basis. The single-entry system hampers the treasury’s
capacity to reconcile bank statements and hinders the reporting of information on accounts
payable. Another issue concerns the limited budget classifications available for expenditure.
Discrepancies can arise when matching budget appropriations with the classified expenditure
because the locally developed structure of expenditure codes changes frequently.
Consequently, statistical performance and reliable budget reporting could improve once the
treasury adopts internationally accepted accounting standards, including a unified treasury
general ledger maintained on a double-entry cash basis. There are substantial differences in
the classification systems of different government subsectors. Bridge tables linking national
classification codes and GFSM 2001 codes were established by a GFS mission in 2003 and
used in 2004 to report 2004 GFS in the GFS Yearbook. The authorities plan to compile and
disseminate government finance statistics on a Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) basis starting in 2007.
Balance of payments
6.
A June 2005 balance of payments (BOP) statistics mission found that the authorities
have partially implemented the recommendations of the 2002 data ROSC and 2002 and
2003 BOP missions. The SDS: (1) expanded the data sources for several of the balance of
payments items, such as transportation, travel, insurance, communications, government

- 53 -

APPENDIX IV

services, and current and capital transfers; (2) implemented new software for the database of
customs declarations; and (3) produced the balance of payments in the standard format
recommended by the Fund, with the separate identification of exceptional financing
transactions. The mission also found that the Customs Department (CD) improved the trade
data collection system by (1) installing in all of the customs offices the ASYCUDA clientserver system, which is designed to maintain the customs declarations database in real time;
(2) elaborating and implementing the instructions for completing customs declarations; and
(3) improving verification of customs declarations. However, SDS failed to improve staffing
arrangements; on the contrary, during the latest SDG reorganization, the number of
permanent staff was reduced, while communication equipment was upgraded. The June 2005
BOP statistics mission focused on (1) analyzing the situation in which the NBG plans to
assume the responsibility for the compilation of the balance of payments; (2) reviewing
estimation methods for compiling data on various components of the balance of payments,
with particular attention for the estimation of workers’ remittances and compensation of
employees; and (3) identifying data sources, collecting preliminary data, and producing a
partial international investment position statement.

APPENDIX V

Georgia—Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Georgia is at moderate risk of debt distress. The baseline scenario is sustainable.
Domestic debt is negligible and all external debt indicators are well below the relevant debtburden thresholds. Contributing factors to the moderate risk rating are Georgia’s uncertain
regional political outlook and weak record in meeting debt service obligations under the
previous administration.
2.
Under the baseline scenario, debt ratios are on a rapid downward trend
(Table 1a and Figure 1a). Public debt falls from 41.1 percent of GDP at end-2005 to just
21.9 percent at end-2009 and continues to decline thereafter (Table 1a).1 In net present value
(NPV) terms, public debt is also expected to fall by about half before the end of the decade.
The exercise assumes (i) real GDP growth of just over 5 percent in the medium term and
3½ percent over the long term; (ii) a budget deficit including net lending of 1 percent of GDP
over the medium term; (iii) clearance by end-2007 of expenditure arrears of 1.1 percent of
GDP at end-2005; and (iv) clearance by end-2008 of energy-related debt to Turkmenistan of
more than one percent of GDP at end-2005. The fiscal deficit is funded through external
financing and privatization receipts through 2009. The share of concessional debt is
declining from over 37 percent of new external borrowing in 2003, to an average of about
24 percent over the medium term. The share of domestic debt is decreasing steadily over the
medium and long term.
3.
Georgia’s external debt level is also deemed sustainable under the baseline
scenario with external debt projected to decline steadily from 2006 (Table 1b and
Figure 1b). Georgia’s external debt is estimated at around 27 percent of GDP at end-2005,
equivalent to less than 100 percent of exports in NPV terms. The projected gross external
debt accumulation over the medium term is moderate at about $100 million a year, and total
debt is declining as a share of GDP to about half of the end-2003 stock by end-2006. With
limited private external borrowing, projected capital flows from FDI and transfers (both
private and official, including about $300 million from the MCA) will be the main sources to
finance a shrinking trade deficit that is projected to stabilize at about 8 percent of GDP in the
long run, provided export values grow at around 6 percent.2
1

Public debt is defined on a gross basis and excludes debt owed by state-owned enterprises.
It also excludes contingent liabilities from the Soviet era. At the end of 2005, about
75 percent of general government debt was denominated in foreign currency, while debt to
the NBG accounted for about 18 percent. General government expenditure arrears and
treasury bills accounted for the remaining liabilities.
2

For further details on recent developments in Georgia’s debt statistics as well as the long
run baseline scenario, see The World Bank's Georgia Country Partnership Strategy, October
26, 2005.

- 56 -

APPENDIX V

4.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests are constructed to examine the sensitivity
of the baseline projection of public and publicly guaranteed debt to a range of potential
shocks (Tables 2a and 2b). Most of these factors would not jeopardize Georgia’s debt
sustainability. On exception is a return of export value growth from about 10 percent in 2005
to about 2 percent (the historical average of 2 1/2 percent minus one standard deviation of
about 1/2 percent). Even if limited to 2 years, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would reach
unsustainable levels of more than 150 percent, even if the gap were financed at better than
commercial terms (30 percent grant element). With official reserves low (at about 2 months
of non-pipeline imports), this could erode hard gained exchange rate stability. Another
exception occurs at long run growth of about 3 percent. At this threshold debt dynamics
begin changing and NPV of debt to GDP and debt to revenue rise substantially.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ATTACHMENT I

March 14, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes the 2006
policies supported by the International Monetary Fund as Trustee under a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The memorandum proposes
performance criteria for end-March 2006 and end-June 2006, and outlines our broad
macroeconomic objectives and policies for 2006. These policies are consistent with the
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) presented to the IMF and
World Bank in October 2003 and with the Annual Progress Report of our EDPRP, which
was submitted in January 2005.
The Government of Georgia believes that the policies set forth in the attached memorandum
will achieve the objectives of the program, but it will take any additional measures that may
become appropriate for this purpose. The government will consult with the Fund on the
adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the
MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
We request hereby the completion of the third review under the PRGF arrangement and we
request waivers for nonobservance of two structural performance criteria for end-September
2005. The first of these performance criteria required submission of a Customs Code to
parliament, but we encountered delays because of the need to ensure extensive consultations
with the private sector on provisions of the proposed law. The Customs Code was submitted
to the parliament on October 17.
The other structural performance criteria required the clearance of budget arrears by endSeptember 2005. Given our concerns over the possible inflationary consequences of making
these payments, we decided it would be best to delay clearing the arrears. We have
subsequently continued clearing arrears and in the attached MEFP have committed to clear
the arrears by end-2006. We also propose the deletion of the performance criterion on a floor
for general government tax revenue.

ATTACHMENT II

MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
Introduction
1.

The government’s economic program for 2006, which is supported by a PRGF

arrangement, aims to achieve poverty reduction through sustained, rapid, and equitable
economic growth in an environment of low inflation. This Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies reviews our progress to date in the implementation of the program and
describes our economic policies and strategy through 2006.
Current Economic Developments and Performance
2.

The government’s economic policies in 2005 ensured macroeconomic stability and

improved growth prospects. In the first nine months of 2005, economic growth was 7.7
percent, driven primarily by the rapid expansion of agriculture, banking, trade and
communication sectors. Preliminary estimates indicate that real GDP growth in 2005 was
about 8 percent. Inflation for 2005 was 6.2 percent. Despite significant increases in prices for
tobacco and alcohol (mainly due to increased excise taxes) and petroleum products,
inflationary pressures were avoided.
3.

Macroeconomic stability was ensured by controlling inflation through careful

coordination and implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. The overall fiscal deficit
(on a cash basis) for 2005 was 2.4 percent of GDP. This is less than projected and reflects
limited administrative capacity in some line ministries and our decision to delay some
expenditure because of concerns over inflationary pressure. For example, our decision to
postpone clearing some budget arrears was because of our concern for inflationary pressure.
4.

Monetary policy has also been supportive of the need to contain inflationary

pressures. During 2005, reserve money increased only by 19.7 percent, which is below the
target envisaged by the program. Despite concerns in early 2005 about significant foreign
currency inflows and the possible instability for the national currency, the appreciation of the
lari has been modest and smooth. During 2005, the lari appreciated by 2.5 percent against

- 66 -

ATTACHMENT II

the U.S. dollar in nominal terms and appreciated by 3.1 percent in real effective terms. Gross
international reserves of NBG increased by 24 percent to $474 million in 2005, which is
about 2.1 months of non-pipeline imports.
5.

Fiscal performance in 2005 was stronger than projected at the time of the second

review under the PRGF arrangement. For 2005, the cumulative fiscal deficit on a
commitments basis was GEL 177 million compared with a projection of GEL 407 million,
while the cash deficit was GEL 279 million. Underpinning the strong fiscal performance last
year was strong revenue collection. For 2005, revenues collected by the Customs Department
increased by 66 percent as compared with 2004. This improvement is due to restructuring of
the Customs Department that included elimination and streamlining operations and functions,
introducing a new staff management system, reducing staff by 9.5 percent and increasing
salaries. As part of our efforts to strengthen the Customs Department, we are in the process
of examining and recertifying the department’s staff. Customs units moved to a one-window
principle, which significantly simplified the customs clearance procedures. In addition,
technical equipment was improved due to the assistance of donor organizations. As a result
of these measures, the level of corruption has been significantly reduced.
6.

Tax administration has continued to improve. During 2005, tax revenues increased to

GEL 2,300 million, which is a 27 percent increase compared with 2004. The improved
collection of tax revenues was due largely to expansion of the tax base and improvements in
tax administration. Improvements in tax administration, including the introduction of better
data processing and management systems, have allowed continued strong performance in
collection of tax revenues, despite a significant reduction in tax rates and the number of taxes
as part of the liberalization of the Tax Code. We estimate that the ratio of tax revenues to
GDP was at least 19.8 percent for 2005, which is a significant improvement compared with
2004.
7.

As part of government’s effort to improve the budget process, we have introduced a

medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). The first stage in this process was the
preparation of our Basic Data and Directions (BDD) document, which identified the major

- 67 -

ATTACHMENT II

trends of the state budget based on the principle of medium-term projection of expenditures.
The BDD was submitted to parliament for discussion in May 2005. The second phase of the
MTEF process was to apply these expenditure guidelines to the activities of various parts of
government. The strategic priorities and spending projections for 2006-2009 for key line
ministries were submitted to parliament as part of the proposed budget for 2006. We
recognize that the MTEF process should be refined and improved, but believe it has already
made a contribution to a more transparent and coherent budget process. For the purpose of
strengthening and institutionalizing of MTEF process, government adopted a decree that
establishes a clear link between line ministries strategies and strategic priorities reflected in
the BDD. Additionally, the format of key documents was revised to facilitate the inclusion of
line ministries’ strategies into BDD. Also the calendar for preparing the MTEF was clarified.
8.

The government’s structural reform program continues to make good progress,

despite some delays. A new Customs Code was developed and submitted to parliament on
October 17, 2005. The submission of the Customs Code to parliament was delayed, which
meant that the structural performance criterion for end-September was missed, because of the
need to ensure extensive consultation with the private sector on the provisions of the
proposed law. The new Customs Code will significantly simplify the customs procedures.
Since the proposed legislation has been submitted to parliament and passage is expected
shortly, we request a waiver for this structural performance criterion.
9.

Our civil service reform strategy is under preparation and will serve as the basis for

an implementation action plan. Medium-term action plans were developed for each ministry
and discussed at a government session. For the purpose of increasing the efficiency, quality
and flexibility of the state management, the number of ministries has been reduced from 18
to 13. Additionally, numerous state departments and other units were consolidated and
subordinated to their respective ministries.
10.

There has been a significant improvement in the business environment since 2003. In

June, parliament approved the law on “Licenses and Permissions,” which constitutes a major
reform of the legislation governing the issuance of licenses and permits. The main principles

- 68 -

ATTACHMENT II

of public sector regulation were redefined for the purpose of simplifying the system and
eliminating impediments. As a result, the list of the activities for which licenses and permits
are required was reduced by about 85 percent. Licensing procedures were improved and
simplified by introducing the principles of “one-window for approval” and “silence is
consent.” We have also simplified the requirements for standardizing and certifying
commodities sold in Georgia. This reform liberalizes the domestic market by reducing excess
administrative barriers, introducing voluntary quality standards for commodities while
maintaining compulsory technical regulations with respect to safety, and recognizing the
technical certification of commodities by other countries.
11.

Government recently approved proposals for a significant liberalization of our trade

regime. We were unable to submit the proposed legislation to parliament on time (structural
benchmark for end-September) because of the need for extensive consultations with the
business community. We have, however, completed the consultation process and submitted
the proposed legislation to parliament. If approved, the new tariff regime will move from 16
bands to 3 and will reduce the maximum tariff from 30 percent to 12 percent for 2006.
Further, the legislation also would eliminate the 12 percent band beginning in 2007 and
eliminate all tariffs in 2008. We believe that the implementation of the new trade regime will
enhance the prospects for economic growth.
12.

The government is continuing negotiations with external creditors under the auspices

of the 2004 Paris Club agreement. As of end-February 2006, we signed restructuring
agreements with six Paris Club creditors and two non-Paris Club creditors, which leaves four
agreements (one with Paris Club members and three with non-Paris Club creditor countries)
to be concluded. In order to continue negotiations, we have received another extension from
the Paris Club and expect to sign agreements with the remaining external creditors by endFebruary 2006.
13.

Georgia made important steps towards combating money laundering. In particular,

we ratified 1990 Council of Europe Convention “on Laundering, Search, Seizure and
Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime” (the Strasbourg Convention), adopted the Law

- 69 -

ATTACHMENT II

“On Facilitating the Prevention of Illicit Income Legalization” (in force since January 2004)
and established the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS) at the NBG. The FMS became a
member of the Egmont Group in June 2004. The Service conducts its activities in close
cooperation with MONEYVAL and in accordance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
recommendations and EU directives. The FMS has elaborated detailed regulations on
financial monitoring for different kinds of monitoring entities from which it receives
information concerning suspicious and above threshold (GEL 30,000) transactions. The
information received by the FMS is systemized and analyzed and, in case of raising the
grounded supposition that a transaction may be related to illicit income legalization or
terrorism financing, is forwarded to Special Service of Criminal Prosecution of Illegal
Income Legalization at the General Prosecutor’s Office of Georgia.
14.

In 2005, the FMS submitted draft amendments to the Criminal Code of Georgia and

Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia to parliament that would assure compliance of
Georgian legislation on provisional measures and confiscation of property with the
provisions of the Strasbourg Convention. These amendments were approved by parliament in
December 2005.
15.

The amendment to the legislation which would upgrade the Budget Systems Law

(BSL) to an organic law was submitted to parliament in March 2005, where its passage
requires a constitutional majority. Passage of the proposed draft has been delayed because of
opposition in parliament. Government is now in the process of proposing technical
amendments to the BSL. Following their approval, the government will continue to make its
best efforts to secure passage of an amendment that would upgrade the BSL to an organic
law.
16.

We are also requesting a waiver for missing the end-September performance criterion

relating to the clearance of arrears. As noted, we have been concerned about the inflationary
consequences of making these payments and prefer to delay payments rather than risk higher
inflationary pressures. Additionally we wish to ensure that all claims for payment are
legitimate and so we are vetting the claims carefully, which is a time-consuming process. As

- 70 -

ATTACHMENT II

of end-December 2005, the stock of claimed arrears was GEL 182 million, which is greater
than at end-June 2005 because more claims have been submitted. The process of verifying
claimed arrears and clearing them continues. For 2005, we cleared GEL 104 million of
verified arrears leaving a stock of GEL 182.1 million in claimed arrears and GEL 59 million
in verified arrears at end-2005. While we cleared fewer arrears in 2005 than anticipated
under the program, we feel the delay is justified. During 2006, we plan to complete the
evaluation of all arrears claimed as of end-2005 and clear all those that are verified. We will
ensure that clearing verified arrears in excess of those included in the 2006 budget will not
increase the overall fiscal deficit.
Economic Policies for 2006
17.

The government’s economic reform program for 2006 and beyond aims at further

improving the macroeconomic environment as a means of encouraging broad-based growth
in support of poverty reduction. The main sources of economic growth will continue to be
industry, agriculture, trade, transport and communications. The primary areas for reform are
privatization of the remaining state-owned enterprises and properties; enhancing the business
environment; reforming the judiciary; developing the financial sector; and revising the labor
code. As a result of the ongoing reform process, we anticipate further growth of foreign
direct investment over the medium term.
18.

According to the government’s 2006 Economic Program, real growth of GDP in 2006

is projected to be 6.5 to 7.5 percent and end-period inflation for 2006 is projected to be 5-6
percent. Our target for gross international reserves of the NBG is 2.3 months of non-pipeline
imports. The current account deficit is projected to stabilize at 7.4 percent of the GDP. As
was true in 2005, our program for enhancing macroeconomic stability will require
disciplined fiscal and monetary policies and careful coordination of the two.
19.

The MTEF that we prepared in 2005 (and consisted of the BDD and appendices to the

2006 budget law) will be updated during the course of 2006. Particular emphasis will be
given to identifying expenditure priorities for 2007-10 and to refining and extending

- 71 -

ATTACHMENT II

strategies for individual line ministries. In addition, we will ensure consistency between the
annual BDD and the subsequent budget. In order to enhance transparency of the budget
process, both the BDD and the detailed strategies and spending plans will be posted on
appropriate websites.
20.

In order to strengthen macroeconomic coordination and planning, we are preparing a

medium-term strategic action plan for 2006-09 that incorporates the main elements of
strategy documents that were prepared in the past few years, including the EDPRP,
Individual Policy Action Plan and the EU Neighborhood Policy Paper. Additionally, we have
begun preparing our PRSP progress report, which we expect to complete by end-September
2006.
Fiscal Policy
21.

The proposed budget law for 2006 that was approved by parliament projects tax

revenues of 19.3 percent of GDP. Additionally, we anticipate continued improvements in tax
and customs administration. For 2006, the overall fiscal deficit on a commitment basis is
projected at 2.2 percent of GDP. In 2006, we will clear the outstanding stock of verified
arrears. Hence, by end-2006 the entire stock of verified arrears will be completely cleared
and no new arrears will be accumulated. The overall fiscal deficit on a cash basis is projected
to be 2.6 percent of GDP.
22.

A large element of the anticipated improvement in tax collections will be derived

from reform of the Customs Code and through better administration. We expect the new
Customs Code to take effect on April 1, 2006 and believe it will significantly simplify
customs procedures. Other reforms include upgrading information and data processing
systems, introducing a harmonized system of commodity nomenclature; and improving
technical equipment at key customs clearance points. Further improvements in tax
administration include simplifying tax declaration procedures and allowing electronic filing
of tax returns for selected tax payers.

- 72 -

23.

ATTACHMENT II

In 2005, the government did not borrow from the NBG and no such borrowing is

planned. The NBG will submit to parliament an amendment to existing legislation that
prohibits government borrowing from the NBG under all circumstances (structural
performance criterion for end-March 2006).
24.

Improved revenue collection will allow the government to increase expenditures in

several key areas. Total allocations for social spending are budgeted at 8.6 percent of GDP.
As part of our effort to increase social sector expenditures, we began a comprehensive reform
of the education sector in 2005 that will continue in 2006. The main goal of the reform is to
bring the education system of Georgia in compliance with international standards. From
2006, the education system will be funded from the state budget.
25.

In line with our EDPRP, another priority in the social sphere is the government’s

effort to eliminate extreme poverty. We increased the minimum pension to GEL 28 per
month (equivalent to about $15) as of January 1, 2005. In 2006, we plan to increase the
minimum pension by GEL 10 to GEL 38 per month, with an increase of 5 lari per month on
March 1, 2006 and a further 5 lari on September 1, 2006. Additionally, we plan to introduce
our poverty alleviation program on June 1, 2006 (structural performance criterion for endJune 2006). The guiding principle of this reform is that social assistance will no longer be
exclusively oriented to certain categories of the population (e.g., single pensioners, disabled,
and IDPs). Instead, social assistance will be targeted on those households living below the
extreme poverty line. Cash benefits for households below the poverty line shall be
determined in accordance to the current level of living conditions and family size. The state
will supplement the income of households at least to the level of the extreme poverty line.
The main outcome indicator will be that at least 60 percent of those identified as extremely
poor will be covered by the program.
26.

Beginning January 1, 2006, the cost of gas imported from Russia increased

significantly. Whereas the average cost of gas was $64 per thousand cubic meters (tcm) in
2004 and 2005, the cost in 2006 is $110 per tcm. In order to mitigate the impact of higher gas
prices, we plan to delay increasing the gas tariff for households until May 2006. The

- 73 -

ATTACHMENT II

difference between the import price of gas and the price paid by households will be borne by
the budget at a projected cost of GEL 35 million. Once our poverty alleviation program is
operational (June 1, 2006), we will assess the case for using this vehicle to compensate lowincome households for higher gas tariffs.
27.

In addition, there will be some new developments in local and central budgets in

2006. Specifically, a draft law on Budget of Local Self-Management Units was submitted to
parliament in November 2005. The proposed law will regulate the preparation of local
budgets and their approval as well as the methodology for calculating transfers to be received
by the local budgets.
28.

The privatization process will continue in 2006. The guiding principle for

privatization is that the state should own only those properties that are essential for
performance of the state functions. During 2006, it is envisaged to carry out privatization in a
transparent manner with an emphasis on enterprises in the energy distribution, power
generation and communication sectors. The amount generated from this is estimated to be
GEL 338 million or 2.6 percent of GDP.
29.

We are working to strengthen the financial management of Legal Entities of Public

Law (LEPLs). We have begun the process of establishing a database of all central
government LEPLs and expect the database to be populated by end-March 2006 (structural
performance criterion for end-March). We are currently refining a system for financial
monitoring of LEPL activities through the line ministries. We will prepare operational
guidelines for financial management and reporting that ensure adequate financial monitoring
of LEPLs. The preparation of the operational guidelines is already advanced and will be
completed by end-June 2006.
30.

In early 2004, several quasi-fiscal funds were established outside the government to

meet critical expenditure requirements in the aftermath of the Rose Revolution. In order to
enhance fiscal transparency and accountability the Army Development Fund and the Law
Enforcement Fund ceased operations on January 1, 2006. Further, in January 2006 it was

- 74 -

ATTACHMENT II

publicly announced that the two funds would be liquidated by end-March 2006. The Reform
and Development Fund now operates as an NGO and does not have any fiscal functions. Any
other funds, which continue to operate and finance general government expenditures will
report their financial activities on a current basis and will be treated as part of the general
government.
31.

The reform of the treasury will continue in 2006. As agreed at the time of the second

review under the PRGF arrangement, the single treasury account system became fully
functional by end-2005. Expenditure and income accounts were merged into a single treasury
account. In the mid-term, we will introduce a new classification of the budget and a new
methodology of registration, which will be based on cash-based method indicated in GFS
2001. These and all other necessary activities will be introduced in order to continue
consolidation of public finances into the treasury system.
Monetary Policy
32.

A disciplined monetary program that features a flexible exchange rate regime is

central to our macroeconomic strategy for 2006 and beyond. Based on a target for end-year
inflation of 5-6 percent, the program projects an increase in money demand of 12 percent
during 2006 and an increase in the money multiplier of 3 percent over the same period.
Reserve money growth would thus be limited to 25 percent and broad money growth to 29
percent. We plan to increase gross foreign reserves to about 2.3 month of non-pipeline
imports or about $620 million. The NBG will intervene in the foreign exchange markets only
as necessary for smoothing sharp fluctuations, especially in light of the large capital inflows
expected in 2006. Further, we will submit amendments to existing legislation to parliament
that would prohibit government borrowing from the NBG under all circumstances (structural
benchmark for end-March 2006).
33.

We are determined to improve the operation of financial markets in Georgia by

fostering the development of markets for safe assets of various maturities and to strengthen
the NBG’s ability to conduct monetary policy by increasing its portfolio of marketable
securities. By end-March 2006, the government together with the NBG will agree on

- 75 -

ATTACHMENT II

measures to achieve those objectives, including securitizing all existing NBG claims on the
government at the rate of GEL 40–50 million per year with maturities of 2–5 years (structural
benchmark for end-March). In addition, the NBG will begin issuing CDs with a maturity of
up to one year.
34.

To upgrade banking supervisory policy and implement the Basel Core Principles for

Effective Banking Supervision, the NBG is planning to make changes to the Law on
Activities of Commercial Banks regarding consolidated supervision and definitions of bank
insiders, Fit and Proper Criteria for bank administrators and significant shareholders. To
improve banking sector transparency, the NBG is publishing standardized forms about
financial data of commercial banks in NBG’s bulletin and sending them electronically to
each bank. The NBG is planning to prepare the regulation on transparency of commercial
banks, which will specify details on information subject to be disclosed regularly.
Additionally, as agreed at the time of the second review we will require banks to publish
their quarterly statements and to post them on the NBG’s website to improve transparency.
The NBG has already completed the consolidation of bank supervision department into a
single structure, downsized it and introduced new management there. This process of
consolidation and introduction of efficiency gaining measures will be extended to the rest of
the NBG.
35.

In order to strengthen the commercial banking sector and ensure that it is able to

support future economic growth, we plan to enhance the bank supervision function at the
NBG. Further, we will prepare a Banking System Development Strategy for 2006-2009 by
end-March 2006 (structural benchmark for end-March 2006). At the same time, the NBG
will continue closing or merging all commercial banks that do not comply fully with
prudential requirements. Additionally, we have submitted legislation to parliament that will
eliminate restrictions on the percent of total shares in a commercial bank that can be owned
by an individual or legal entity (structural benchmark for end-March 2006). In effect, this
will allow an individual or legal entity to own 100 percent of a commercial bank.

- 76 -

36.

ATTACHMENT II

Following the recent on-site inspection of one Georgia’s larger commercial banks, the

NBG concluded that the bank should be either liquidated or sold. In order to avoid a broad
loss of confidence in the banking system the NBG, working in collaboration with the
government, introduced an interim management to the commercial bank and arranged for the
sale of the bank to the most competitive bid from a sound local commercial bank.
Furthermore, the buyer requested a short-term credit line from the NBG as a contingency
measure. If this credit line is activated, the injection of this additional liquidity into the
system may complicate the implementation of the monetary policy. The NBG will, however,
use its monetary policy tools (including short-term CDs) to help mop up any excessive
liquidity.
37.

Further, the NBG will fully implement the recommendations of the 2004 Safeguards

Assessment Report of the IMF’s Finance Department, particularly by formally documenting
all its internal control processes, including key operating policies and procedures. Moreover,
an FSAP update mission visited Tbilisi recently to study some of the important issues,
including the recent surge in the private sector credit, pertaining to the financial stability.
Structural Reforms
38.

The government recognizes the importance of an aggressive structural reform

program as a means of fostering growth and international competitiveness. Of particular
importance is the need to improve the business environment and strengthen the protection of
property rights.
39.

An important element of this reform was parliament’s approval in June 2005 of a new

law on Licensing and Permits. This law greatly simplified the regulatory environment for
enterprises, not least by reducing the number of licenses and permits from more than 950 to
150. We are currently in the process of implementing this new regulatory framework, which
will require amending dozens of individual laws. We are also preparing a new system of
government supervision of food and medicine. The proposed legislation will be prepared in
parallel with the restructuring of the Ministry of Agriculture. We are also preparing

- 77 -

ATTACHMENT II

legislation aimed at establishing a system of self-regulation for professional activities/fields.
The initial draft on the accounting and auditing fields is already developed.
40.

During 2006, the energy sector rehabilitation will be continued. In 2004 quasi-fiscal

deficit of the sector amounted to 4 ½ percent of GDP (caused mainly by low collection rates,
non-payment of electricity consumed in Abkhazia, and energy theft), financed partially by
transfers from the government, but mostly through debt and the run-down of the stock of
capital. We are committed to rehabilitating energy sector facilities so that electricity can be
supplied 24 hours per day to all paying customers. For these purposes, the 2006 budget has
appropriated more than GEL 247 million, about 1.9 percent of GDP, to investment in the
energy sector. We project that the quasi-fiscal deficit for 2005 was about 4 percent of GDP
and will be reduced further in 2006.
Program Monitoring
41.

Completion of the fourth review under the PRGF arrangement, scheduled for mid-

June 2006, will require observance of the structural performance criteria for end-March 2006
shown in Table 1 and the quantitative performance criteria in Table 2, while the end-June
structural criterion and end-September quantitative performance criteria will apply to the
fifth review, currently scheduled for mid-December 2006. The review will focus on progress
in resolving arrears and progress toward developing a system of financial monitoring for
LEPLs. It will also take stock of ongoing and planned steps to add momentum to structural
reforms, especially in the areas of energy, public sector operations, the business climate, and
trade liberalization.

Statement by IMF Staff Representative
March 31, 2006
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
These developments do not the change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Estimated real GDP growth for 2005 has been revised upward to 9.3 percent,
reflecting both a stronger than expected 2005 performance and a modest downward revision
of 2004 GDP. Inflation in the twelve months that ended in February fell further to 5.1 percent
of GDP.
3.
The authorities appear to be on track to meet the indicative quantitative targets and
performance criteria for end-March. Fiscal and monetary performance through end-February
was well in line with program targets.
4.
A Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Finance and National
Bank of Georgia has been signed. The agreement includes a securitization schedule for the
non-marketable government debt held by the NBG, thereby creating more instruments of
monetary policy. In addition, legislation to eliminate commercial bank ownership restrictions
was passed by parliament, and amendments to prohibit government borrowing from the NBG
were submitted to parliament.
5.
The authorities’ trade liberalization strategy is being discussed in parliament.
However, the three-year plan reported in the staff report has faced objections. As a result, the
authorities now plan to pass the trade reform in three stages. In the first stage, the highest
tariff rate of 30 percent would be reduced to 12 percent, and the number of import tariff
bands would be reduced from sixteen to three (at 0, 5 and 12 percent), as had been discussed
in EBS/06/40.
6.
The authorities are making good progress toward establishing and populating the
LEPL database, and appear to be on track to meet the related end-March structural
performance criterion.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Georgia
On March 31, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Georgia.1
Background
The breakup of the Soviet Union brought a steep fall in living standards in Georgia, among the
worst for any transition country. Following a period of hyperinflation in the mid-1990s, the
Georgian authorities had some success in stabilizing the political and economic situation, only
to experience a temporary setback during the Russian crisis. Economic growth started to pick
up in 2000, but fiscal performance was poor, resulting in insufficient spending on priority items
and the build-up of domestic arrears.
Georgia’s economy has performed well over the last two years, and the fiscal turnaround has
been impressive. Since the change in government in late 2003, Georgia has demonstrated
strong fiscal performance and a renewed commitment to press ahead with structural reforms,
including the privatization of state-owned enterprises and further legal, fiscal, and financial
reforms. Prudent macroeconomic policies have resulted in robust growth rates of about
7 percent on average in 2004–05, and average CPI inflation of about 7 percent over the same
period. Significantly improved fiscal revenues have allowed for many spending initiatives to be
undertaken while maintaining fiscal stability. The new government has also shown its resolve
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2to combat corruption, including by reorganizing parts of the public sector and by prosecuting
corrupt high-ranking officials of the previous government. More recently, the government has
focused on creating a business-friendly environment, including by reducing the administrative
hurdles to economic activity.
Strong fiscal performance over the last two years enabled a significant increase in government
spending. In 2005, the Georgian authorities implemented a comprehensive tax reform,
simplifying and streamlining major taxes, eliminating nuisance taxes, and lowering most tax
rates. Nonetheless, tax collections rose from 14.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated
19.8 percent of GDP in 2005, resulting in a cash deficit that was substantially lower than
budgeted in the last two years. At the same time, the government eliminated a large part of the
outstanding domestic arrears. The Georgian authorities have started a process of fiscal
decentralization by devolving some fiscal responsibilities to local bodies.
Over the past two years, monetary developments have been characterized by high reserve
money growth, continued remonetization of the economy, and, more recently, a credit boom.
After a period of lax monetary policy in late 2004, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) stepped
up its efforts to contain the monetary expansion, in line with its target for inflation.
Underexecution of the budget has also contributed to the slowdown of reserve money growth
due to higher-than-expected government deposits at the central bank. Interest rates on
treasury bills have continued to decrease since the political turmoil in late 2003, but no
treasury bills have been issued since mid-2005 in light of the government’s limited financing
needs. Available data indicate that the banking system remains strong.
In 2004, the lari appreciated by 12 percent against the U.S. dollar. This appreciation resulted in
a substantial improvement of Georgia’s external debt situation. Excluding imports related to
two pipelines, the current account deficit increased somewhat as a share of GDP over the past
two years, reflecting stronger aid inflows and related imports. Gross international reserves
have slowly increased to 2.1 months of nonpipeline imports at end-2005.
The authorities submitted a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) progress report to the
Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank in March 2005. Although the availability of
data is scarce, it appears that there has been limited progress toward reducing poverty.
Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors broadly agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended
the authorities for their impressive progress over the last two years, including in
maintaining macroeconomic stability, turning around the fiscal position, and combating
pervasive corruption. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to push ahead with further
structural reforms, which will improve public sector operations and the business
environment and foster private sector development, so as to put the economy on a path to
sustained growth.

-3-

Directors supported the authorities’ economic program for 2006, which—based on sound
macroeconomic policies—aims at bolstering growth and keeping inflation at single-digit
rates, while carrying forward the structural reform agenda. In this context, they noted the
need for further progress on reducing widespread poverty.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ plans to increase public spending in priority areas,
based on their assurances that fiscal sustainability will be maintained. They welcomed the
introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework, which should help to improve fiscal
planning and expenditure control. Directors cautioned that the authorities’ intentions to
decentralize fiscal responsibilities may lead to a weakening of fiscal transparency, and
stressed the need to monitor closely the Legal Entities of Public Law (LEPLs) in a
transparent way, and to ensure their full accountability. Against the backdrop of continued
high poverty, Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the social safety nets,
including by introducing the targeted poverty benefit as planned.
Directors welcomed the gains from the far-reaching tax reform enacted by the authorities
in 2005, while encouraging them to continue strengthening tax administration.
They regretted that the authorities cleared fewer domestic arrears than foreseen under the
program, but noted the authorities’ commitment to eliminate the remaining stock of
outstanding verified claims by the end of 2006. Directors urged the government to resist
additional spending pressures that may arise ahead of local elections in the fall.
Directors viewed the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate, and welcomed the
vigorous efforts by the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) to contain inflation. At the same
time, they observed that a stronger fiscal position contributes to new challenges in the
conduct of macroeconomic policy, which will require enhanced coordination efforts
between the fiscal and monetary authorities. They noted that the extremely small treasury
bill market makes effective liquidity management more challenging. In this context, they
welcomed the recent memorandum of understanding between the NBG and the ministry of
finance on securitizing some of the outstanding nontradable debt held by the NBG, which
will provide the central bank with much-needed monetary policy instruments.
They encouraged the authorities to strengthen the autonomy of the central bank.
Directors observed that the improved economic outlook for Georgia and strong capital
inflows could put some appreciation pressures on the exchange rate. They agreed that the
authorities should monitor developments closely, and endorsed the authorities’
commitment to a floating regime, with foreign exchange interventions limited to smoothing
temporary and extreme fluctuations.
Directors commended the authorities for their continued efforts to strengthen the financial
system. They noted that strong credit growth requires robust banking supervision practices
to avoid the pitfalls associated with a credit boom. In this context, Directors looked forward
to discussing the ongoing Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Update in the
context of the next review. Going forward, Directors welcomed the NBG’s strategy to

-4-

attract international interest in the Georgian financial sector and to consolidate the banking
sector and foster competition.
Directors welcomed the substantial progress achieved in fighting corruption, improving
governance and transparency, and enhancing the business climate. They endorsed the
authorities’ structural reform agenda, which is geared toward removing bottlenecks in
infrastructure and energy, and they recommended strengthening legal institutions to further
entrench the principles of good governance and foster the enforcement of creditor and
property rights. Directors stressed the importance of moving ahead with the privatization
agenda. They welcomed the planned liberalization of the trade regime as a bold step
toward strengthening Georgia’s competitiveness.
Directors broadly agreed with the findings of the recent debt sustainability analysis, noting
that the appreciation of the national currency in 2004 and the government’s repayment
efforts have eased the debt burden considerably. Directors welcomed the bilateral
agreements reached in the wake of the July 2004 Paris Club debt rescheduling, and urged
the authorities to finalize as soon as possible the outstanding agreements with Paris Club
and other bilateral creditors on comparable terms.
Directors noted that the provision of data by the authorities is adequate for surveillance
and program monitoring purposes, but encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the
statistical database, with technical assistance from the Fund, particularly in the compilation
of national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review of Georgia's PRGF Arrangement and Approves
US$20.2 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the third review of
Georgia's performance under the three-year program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). In completing the review, the Board approved the authorities' request for waivers for the
nonobservance of the end-September 2005 quantitative performance criterion on the clearance of
domestic expenditures arrears and the end-September 2005 structural performance criterion on the
submission to the parliament of a new customs code.
The Executive Board approved the PRGF arrangement on June 4, 2004 (see Press Release No. 04/107)
for an amount equivalent to SDR 98 million (about US$141.2 million). Completion of the third review
will enable Georgia to draw SDR 14 million (about US$20.2 million), bringing total disbursements under
the arrangement to SDR 56 million (about US$80.7 million).
Following the Executive Board discussion of Georgia's economic performance, Mr. Takatoshi Kato,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Georgia’s economy continues to perform well, bolstered by a further improvement in the fiscal position
and monetary policy geared at controlling inflation. The new administration continues to demonstrate
strong ownership of the program supported under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and has
pushed ahead with structural reforms. Against the backdrop of the tax reform that took effect in
January 2005, the Georgian authorities have further strengthened their revenue position, which enabled
higher spending on priority items without endangering fiscal sustainability. More focused spending has
also contributed to a slowly improving poverty situation.
“The government has advanced its structural reform agenda, including by upgrading revenue
administration, promoting transparency in government operations, and facilitating private sector
activities. Further progress is needed, however, to safeguard fiscal sustainability and transparency,
enhance growth prospects, and encourage additional private sector investment, including from abroad.
“The thrust of the authorities’ economic program for 2006 is to continue economic growth and poverty
reduction while maintaining macroeconomic stability and keeping inflation at single-digit rates. Public
spending priorities for 2006 will focus on shielding the poor from adverse economic conditions and on
improving the environment for private investment, including by upgrading infrastructure and providing
more reliable energy supply.
“Going forward, higher government spending against the backdrop of sizable capital inflows will require
enhanced coordination between the fiscal and monetary authorities. The authorities should continue to
aim at strengthening the capacity of the National Bank of Georgia to effectively manage liquidity
fluctuations,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Yuri Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director for Georgia
and Elvira Eurlings, Advisor to Executive Director
March 31, 2006
Economic developments
Georgia’s macroeconomic performance in 2005 was impressive. Recent calculations
show that real GDP grew by 9.3 percent, reflecting a significant improvement over 2004
when growth was about 6 percent. The 2005 growth rate has been broad-based with doubledigit growth in several sectors like construction, communications, financial intermediation
and agriculture. This broad-based growth is a crucial element of the authorities’ policy to
expand job opportunities and reduce poverty. At the same time, sound and coordinated
monetary and fiscal policies kept inflation under control. Real growth of GDP in 2006 is
projected to be 6.5 to 7.5 percent and end-period inflation for 2006 is estimated to stabilize
around 5-6 percent. Moreover, last December, Georgia received its first international credit
rating. Standard and Poor’s Rating Service assigned a ‘B+’ long term and ‘B’ short-term
sovereign credit rating with a positive outlook, emphasizing the ‘authorities’ strong political
commitment to prudent financial policies and market-oriented structural reforms.’
The cooperation between the Georgian authorities and the Fund has been fruitful. The
authorities are pleased that all but two end-September performance criteria in the program
supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility have been met, in most cases even
with wide margins, in particular in the fiscal field.
Fiscal policy
In 2005, the authorities continued their impressive fiscal consolidation policy. Efforts
to strengthen tax administration, crack down on corruption, smuggling and tax evasion and
contain expenditures resulted in a general government deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, well
below the budgeted 4.8 percent. The impressive fiscal performance was specifically
underpinned by continuous strong revenue collection, in particular by a reorganized and
streamlined customs department, where subsequently collected revenues increased by 66
percent compared with 2004. More in general, despite the reduction in tax rates and the
number of taxes as part of the liberalization of the Tax Code, tax revenues in 2005 still rose
to 19.7 percent of GDP, which is a 26.4 percent increase compared with 2004. For 2006,
expansion of the tax base and improvements in tax administration will continue. The 2006
budget prudently projects tax revenues of 19.3 percent of GDP, leading to an overall fiscal
deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP (cash basis), financed by privatization proceeds. Part of the
revenue collection will be derived from the gains of the new Customs Code in terms of more
simplified procedures, which is expected to take effect this year.
Improved revenue collection will allow the government to increase expenditures in
several key areas, for example in the social area. Total allocations for social spending will
increase compared to last year and are now budgeted at 8.6 percent of GDP. A priority in the
authorities’ social policy agenda is the eradication of extreme poverty. To this end, the
authorities increased the minimum pensions and they will introduce a targeted poverty
benefit program in June this year. As of now, already 300 thousand statements were
submitted from people eligible for social assistance by the government. Ways will also be

-2explored to make the poverty program instrumental for compensating low-income
households for the higher gas tariffs. The authorities are also in the process of drafting their
PRSP progress report, which is expected to be completed by end-September this year. The
structural performance criterion on preparing a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) was met.
In the area of fiscal transparency and accountability, significant progress has been
made. In particular, in early 2004, several quasi-fiscal funds were established outside the
government to meet critical expenditure requirements in the aftermath of the Rose
Revolution. Now, after two years when the need for these separate funds has subsided, the
authorities decided that, in order to enhance budget transparency and avoid any off-budget
spending, these funds would cease their operations on January 1 this year and would be
liquidated by the end of March. One remaining fund will be converted into an NGO and will
be privately financed and controlled.
Privatization is an important component of the economic reform process in Georgia,
and will continue to play a distinctive role in the economic development of the country going
forward. The authorities will continue to aim at carrying out privatizations in a transparent
manner with an emphasis on enterprises in the energy distribution, power generation and
communication sectors.
Prudent fiscal policies also contributed to containing the current account deficit.
Moreover, recent preliminary data show that export growth actually increased compared to
last year while import growth has been slower. For 2006, the current account deficit is
projected to stabilize around 7 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy and financial sector reform
Sound monetary management has continued to underpin macroeconomic stability,
aiming for low inflation as the primary objective, while maintaining a flexible exchange rate
regime. Despite concerns in early 2005 about significant foreign currency inflows, the
appreciation of the lari has been modest and smooth (the lari appreciated by 3 percent in real
effective terms). Consumer price inflation in 2005 equaled 6.2 percent which is well below
the expectation of 7 percent and the 2004 level of 7.5 percent. The target on arrears clearance
was missed given the authorities’ concerns over the possible inflationary consequences of
making these payments at the end of last year. At the same time, the process of verifying
claimed arrears continued and this year, the authorities are strongly committed - as laid down
in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies - to complete the evaluation of all
arrears claimed as of end-2005 and clear all those that are verified by the end of 2006.
For 2006, the NBG will continue to carefully manage liquidity and is fully committed to the
objective of maintaining single-digit inflation around 5-6 percent. Gross foreign reserves will
increase to about 2.3 month of non-pipeline imports.
As highlighted by staff, the banking sector has performed well in 2005 and credit to
the private sector grew by 83 percent, albeit from a very low level. Nonetheless, Georgia’s
level of monetization remains below 20 percent of GDP, resulting in a much lower credit to
the private sector than seen in most other transition economies. Moreover, as stated in the

-3interesting Selected Issues paper, the expansion of credit in the banking sector is
accompanied by longer maturities, lower lending rates and de-dollarization. Some of the
factors contributing to the rapid credit expansion have been the increased confidence in
future prospects for the country, legalization of businesses that started in 2004 and continued
in 2005, increased banking competition and improved access to relatively low-cost credit. At
the same time, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) is committing equal efforts to guide this
substantial credit expansion in a prudent manner by strengthening its supervisory activities.
Draft legislation concerning the introduction of a deposit insurance system is ready and the
process of imposing increased minimum capital requirement has been brought forward and is
now expected to be implemented in July next year. Moreover, work is continuing to increase
transparency and consolidation of the overall financial sector and ease the entrance of foreign
banks.
Furthermore, the NBG is committed to stimulate the development of financial
markets, foster financial sector stability and strengthen the independence of the NBG, as
reflected in its upcoming Banking Sector Development Strategy. In addition, the NBG
together with the government reached agreement on an overall reform package to streamline
NBG’s balance sheet and operations and strengthen the NBG’s ability to conduct monetary
policy by increasing the NBG’s portfolio of marketable securities, including the total amount
of government debt held by the NBG. An FSAP update mission has visited Georgia recently
and the authorities are in the process of studying the staff’s recommendations.
Structural reforms
The World Bank recently ranked Georgia among the top global reformers in the CIS
region. According to the Doing Business study, reforms in Georgia have made it easier to
start a business, have cut the number of activities that require licenses from 950 to 150, eased
the cost of separating redundant workers and cut the time and cost to register property. At the
same time, there are still areas that need attention, such as further simplifying tax collection
and enhancing investors’ protection.
Furthermore, after an extensive consultation process, the authorities submitted
ambitious legislation to parliament concerning their trade policy. When adopted, the new
tariff regime will be considerably liberalized, by moving from 16 bands to 3 and reducing the
maximum tariff from 30 percent to 12 percent for 2006. Further consultations to ultimately
eliminate tariffs altogether will continue going forward. The implementation of the new trade
regime will dramatically enhance the prospects for trade, investment and economic growth.
In addition, the European Union and Georgia are enhancing their cooperation through the
EU/Georgia Action Plan, which will encourage and support Georgia’s objective of further
economic integration.
The end-September structural performance criterion concerning the parliamentary
submission of the Customs Code faced some delay due to the need to ensure extensive and
satisfactory consultations with the private sector on provisions of the proposed law. The
Customs Code was nonetheless submitted to the parliament in October and passage is
expected soon.

-4As highlighted by staff, the authorities chose - in the context of improving
government services - to convert some budgetary organizations into Legal Entities of Public
Law (LEPLs). In this way, reforms could be implemented in a more straightforward manner,
while the LEPL Management would still ensure that activities were performed according to
existing standards. Although the authorities believe this reform will promote more efficiency
and therefore constitutes the way forward, they do recognize some potential risks associated
with this reform, such as a weakening of monitoring and reporting practices. Therefore, as
recommended by staff, the authorities are finalizing a database of all LEPLs through which
effective financial monitoring of LEPL activities can be facilitated. In addition, operational
guidelines are being prepared concerning financial management and reporting requirements
which will be completed by end-June 2006. Moreover, the authorities will continue to study
international best practices.
The authorities are also committed to rehabilitate energy sector facilities so that
electricity can be supplied 24 hours per day to all paying customers. For these purposes, the
2006 budget has appropriated more than 1.9 percent of GDP to investment in the
energy sector. Furthermore, parliament adopted in December last year legislation that would
assure compliance of Georgian legislation on provisional measures and confiscation of
property with the provisions of the Strasbourg Convention.
The authorities request a waiver for nonobservance of the two performance criteria
for end-September 2005 and subsequently request completion of the third review under the
PRGF. This will signal to the international and business communities that Georgia is well on
track with its ambitious reform agenda. In closing, we would, on behalf of the authorities,
like to once again thank staff and management for their dedicated work and policy advice to
Georgia.
