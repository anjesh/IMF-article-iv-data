IMF Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with Algeria
On August 29, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Algeria.1
Background
Since the outset of its Fund-supported adjustment and reform program in 1994, Algeria
has made—in particularly difficult circumstances—substantial progress toward the
restoration of macroeconomic stability and implemented a comprehensive set of
structural reforms. Growth turned positive, the inflation rate dropped, and the balance of
payments’ viability was restored. Assisted by a tightening of domestic demand
management, the Algerian economy was able to weather the oil price downturn of
1998–99, thus demonstrating increased resilience to external shocks.
With the surge in oil prices from the spring of 1999, the balance of payments position
strengthened markedly in 2000. While the Algerian dinar remained relatively stable in
real effective terms in 2000, record hydrocarbon exports boosted total merchandise
exports and imports increased modestly in dollar terms. This resulted in a massive
current account surplus of about 17 percent of GDP in 2000 (following a balanced
position in 1999), which contributed to the rise in gross official reserves to
US$11.9 billion (equivalent to over a year of imports) by end-2000, from US$4.4 billion
at end-1999. Similar developments in early 2001 led to a further increase in gross
official reserves to US$15.2 billion at end-June 2001. The debt service ratio fell to 21
percent in 2000 from 40 percent in 1999, partly because of the large increase in the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the August 29, 2001 Executive Board discussion based on the
staff report.

value of exports. Since amortization exceeded drawings, external debt decreased by
US$2.8 billion to US$25.5 billion at end-2000 (48 percent of GDP).
High hydrocarbon prices also contributed to a sharp improvement in the budget position.
Notwithstanding a 22 percent increase in expenditures in 2000 fueled by a surge in
capital outlays, the increase in hydrocarbon revenue resulted in a switch in the budget
balance to a surplus of close to 10 percent of GDP in 2000 from a small deficit in 1999.
The latter allowed early retirement of domestic debt and the accumulation of large cash
balances on the treasury account at the central bank. To help preserve these resources,
the government established a stabilization fund in 2000.
Despite a dynamic hydrocarbon sector, GDP growth was modest in 2000. Hydrocarbon
production increased by about 5 percent in 2000, compared to 6.2 percent in 1999.
However, overall GDP growth was modest (2.4 percent in 2000) and lower than in 1999
(3.2 percent) due to sluggish growth in nonhydrocarbon sectors in 2000 (1.5 percent
compared to 2.2 percent in 1999). In particular, agricultural production was once again
affected by unfavorable climatic conditions while industrial production recorded only a
slight increase, entirely attributable to the dynamism of the private sector. On the whole,
growth was in all likelihood too weak to have had an effect on unemployment, currently
estimated at about 30 percent of the labor force. A reduction in inflation, mainly driven
by food prices, continued in 2000: the average increase in the consumer price index
dropped to 0.3 percent from 2.6 percent in 1999. However, the 12-month moving
average increased by 1.7 percent during the year ending in June 2001.
Regarding structural reforms, only a few laws (notably those liberalizing the
telecommunications and mining sectors) have been adopted by parliament since end1999. However, in July 2001, the public sector assets in the steel-making sector were
transferred to a company which is majority-owned by a foreign investor. In the same
month, a second mobile telephone license was sold to a foreign investor. In addition,
intense preparatory work on various other reforms took place. In particular, the
government has prepared a draft law liberalizing the hydrocarbon sector and has taken
steps toward extending public infrastructure concessions. It published, in early 2001, a
first list of public enterprises to be partly or entirely privatized. Concerning trade, the
authorities have stated their objective to conclude before the end of 2001 the
negotiations towards an association agreement with the European Union and to pursue
simultaneously the negotiations for membership in the World Trade Organization. In this
context, they are also in the process of introducing a comprehensive reform of the
external tariff.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic
management and progress in restoring macroeconomic balances under difficult
circumstances and in the context of rapidly changing oil prices. A prudent fiscal stance
and cautious easing of monetary conditions have led to a major strengthening of the
balance of payments position and a large accumulation of official reserves. External
debt indicators have improved, and the inflation rate has declined sharply.

Nevertheless, Directors noted that the Algerian economy still faces major challenges
over the medium term. Higher economic growth is needed to reduce unemployment and
improve living standards, and the export and revenue bases need to be diversified to
reduce external and fiscal vulnerability. In Directors’ view, these require the introduction
of a comprehensive set of reforms to promote private sector investment and raise the
efficiency of new investment, particularly in the non-hydrocarbon sectors. In this context,
Directors stressed the importance of privatization, restructuring of public enterprises,
comprehensive banking reform, enhanced competition, and further trade liberalization.
In the face of mounting social demands, low growth and inflation, and strong fiscal and
external positions, Directors endorsed the fiscal stimulus being introduced in 2001, and
the authorities’ 2001–04 economic recovery plan. They considered that the recovery
plan could temporarily boost growth and thereby reduce unemployment and poverty in
the short term, and would not jeopardize Algeria’s fiscal and external positions as long
as oil prices do not drop significantly from their current levels. However, Directors
encouraged the authorities to review the quality of expenditures in consultation with the
World Bank. They stressed that the recovery plan would have to be complemented by
the accelerated implementation of structural reforms to strengthen growth on a
sustainable basis. Directors expressed concern about a possible resumption of
inflationary pressures and the vulnerability of the public finances to a marked downturn
in oil prices. In this regard, they were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to
adjust fiscal policy to future developments in the oil market and to maintain a cautious
monetary stance.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to manage the exchange rate float in a
flexible way to safeguard competitiveness and dampen external shocks. They
recommended that the exchange system be further liberalized to strengthen the role of
market forces and to continue reducing the importance of the parallel market, noting that
liberalization is particularly appropriate in the current context of a strong reserve buildup.
While Directors expressed concern at the overall pace of structural reforms in 2000, they
welcomed the reforms implemented in 2001 as well as the authorities’ assurances that
their recovery plan would not be a substitute for accelerated structural reform. Directors
were encouraged by recent achievements, including the sale of a second cellular
telephone license, the transfer to a foreign investor of public assets in the steel- making
sector, and the recapitalization of state-owned banks. They welcomed the recent
ordinance extending the scope of privatization to all economic sectors and streamlining
its procedures. Directors emphasized that privatization should be undertaken in a
transparent manner and in consultation with all concerned parties. They suggested that
the social safety net be strengthened to cushion the impact of public sector restructuring
in the event of labor retrenchment.
Directors were encouraged by the adoption of an ordinance simplifying the investment
incentives structure and leveling the playing field between public and private investors
as well as foreign and domestic investments. They also welcomed the government’s
efforts to implement a comprehensive tariff reform and commended the authorities for

-4-

the recent adoption of an ordinance accelerating tariff reductions and reducing the
number of tariff bands. Directors commended the authorities for eliminating the minimum
duty values system and encouraged them to streamline the list of goods subject to a
temporary additional rate and to consider further reductions in the maximum tariff rate.
Directors stressed the importance of further restructuring the banking system,
strengthening bank supervision, and modernizing the payments system. They also put
emphasis on other structural reforms, such as those pertaining to agricultural land,
housing, and the judiciary. Directors recommended liberalization of most remaining
administered prices, and the reinstatement of the periodic adjustment of domestic
petroleum prices to reflect international oil prices and exchange rate fluctuations. They
welcomed the authorities’ measures to enhance transparency, and urged the
strengthening of efforts to improve governance—including at the local and regional
levels.
Directors welcomed the ongoing efforts to remove the data weaknesses that currently
hamper the monitoring of economic conditions and formulation of economic policies.
They urged the authorities to strengthen data coverage, quality, and timeliness, and to
use the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System as a framework for statistics
development.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (a) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (b) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2001
Article IV Consultation with Algeria is also available.
