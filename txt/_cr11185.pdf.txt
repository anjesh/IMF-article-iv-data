EURO AREA POLICIES
SPILLOVER REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION WITH MEMBER COUNTRIES
June 30, 2011

Issues. Spillover reports explore the external effects of policies in systemic economies,
focusing on concerns raised by key partners. In the case of the Euro Area (EA), partners
appreciated policy efforts to address the sovereign debt crisis, but were concerned over
potential spillovers in case debt difficulties in the EA were to deepen, as highlighted by
the bouts of heightened co-movement over the past year between stresses in EA
program countries and global financial markets.
Findings. The main messages are as follows:
 An intensification of the EA debt crisis, especially if stress were to spread to the core

EA, could have major global consequences. This is supported by financial market
signals, analysis of a model of global bank interconnectedness, and results from a
broader macro-modeling approach. Thus, decisive further policy actions to contain the
crisis are critical not only for the EA itself, but also from a global perspective.
 Projected fiscal consolidation efforts in the EA should have modest global demand

effects that could be more than offset by credibility gains. Monetary tightening in the
area that proceeds at a slightly faster pace than markets presently anticipate would
have limited spillovers, but reversal of extraordinary measures would need to be timed
with improvements in banking sector health and dissipation of market tensions in EA
program countries to help prevent potentially large effects on other economies.
 Envisaged reforms to strengthen banking system resilience, labor and product market

reforms to enhance growth potential, and further trade liberalization under the Doha
round would have positive, though modest, spillovers.
Authorities’ reactions. The EA authorities agreed that any spread of the crisis would have
global repercussions, but were confident that policy measures enacted to date and those
that were in prospect should help contain the crisis. They also broadly agreed with staff’s
findings on macroeconomic and structural spillovers, although they were more sanguine
on the direct contractionary effects of fiscal tightening, and emphasized that, given the
area’s high degree of openness to international trade and finance, it was a net recipient of
spillovers from the rest of the world during normal times.

SPILLOVER REPORTS
Spillover reports examine the external effects of domestic policies in five systemic
economies, i.e., the S5, comprising China, Euro Area, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United
States. The mere existence of external effects does not imply that policy modifications or
collective action is needed—that depends on many considerations, including the presence of
economic externalities. The aim rather is to stimulate discussion, providing a global perspective
for policy advice in Article IV discussions and input for the Fund’s broader multilateral
surveillance.
In each case, key partners are asked about outward spillovers from the economy in
question, on the basis of which staff choose issues for analysis. To facilitate candor, spillover
reports do not cite who raises a specific issue. For this report, the consulted were officials and
analysts from the other S5 and from selected emerging markets—Brazil, Hong Kong SAR,
India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, and Thailand.
This report does not try to capture the full extent and historical significance of the EA’s
influence on the world economy. Rather, it focuses on a few forward-looking issues raised by
partners, brings to bear relevant analysis, and describes the reactions of the Euro Area
authorities. Technical papers underlying the analysis can be found in Euro Area Spillovers:
Selected Issues. A separate forthcoming report will summarize the themes emerging from
discussions with the S5.

BACKGROUND

The Euro Area (EA) plays a major role in the global economy and therefore has

potentially large spillover effects on the rest of the world. The EA produces about a fifth of
global output, second only to the US. With its exports and imports together adding to almost
30 percent of GDP, the area accounts for a larger share of world trade than any other economy.
Its financial sector is also one of the world’s largest, with banking exposures to other countries
exceeding those of all other economies, although its debt and equity markets—as measured by
turnover—are dwarfed by those in the US. The euro is also the second most important reserve
currency after the U.S. dollar, and its share of reserves has been growing steadily since its
inception.

Market perceptions of events in the EA program countries (Greece, Ireland, and

Portugal) illustrate the possibility of large spillovers from the area in times of stress.
While these countries are small in economic terms, the financial exposure of core EA



country banks to them is large. Jointly they represent just 6 percent of EA GDP and a very
small share in the foreign exposure of core EA banks overall (2.6 percentage points).
However, at 32 percent of total shareholders’equity for those core EA banks that hold
such assets in the case of program countries, the exposure is quite sizable in absolute
terms, opening the door to significant spillovers also outside the euro area.
This potential for major spillovers can be seen in market reaction to developments in the

EA over the past year (see charts). CDS spreads and bond yields for the EA program
countries have risen to historically high levels, and their correlation with financial market
spreads for other EA economies remains very high. In the run up to the approval of the

Greece program, correlations of EA program country CDS spreads and bond yields with
global asset prices rose sharply, highlighting the contagion potential. Marked pickups in
correlations were also evident around the time the Ireland and Portugal programs were
being finalized. While the increased correlations between EA and non-EA asset prices
could partly reflect reactions to common risk factors (see Section III.B), they underscore
the risk that an intensification of stress in the EA could have sizable effects on global
markets.
3.

Against the backdrop of the EA’s large global role and ongoing challenges in the EA

program countries, the rest of this paper undertakes an in-depth analysis of EA spillovers.
To motivate the analysis and to identify key areas where spillovers could be important, the next
section sets out views from authorities outside the EA on their perceptions of the main spillovers
from the area. Section III maps economic spillovers to assess their size and how they are
transmitted across regions (e.g., through trade and financial linkages, and indirectly through
broader confidence effects). Section IV assesses potential spillovers to the rest of the world from
policies in progress or envisioned in the area, with special focus on the estimated global impact
of (i) an intensification of financial market stress in the EA; (ii) prospective EA monetary and fiscal
policies; and (iii) EA structural reform in the areas of financial regulation, labor and product
markets, and trade. Conclusions are presented in the last section.

VIEWS FROM OUTSIDE ON EURO AREA SPILLOVERS

Most partner authorities focused on financial spillovers from the EA, with spillovers

seen as escalating sharply if the sovereign debt difficulties in the EA were to intensify.
Authorities generally saw the spillover potential from further stress in Greece, Ireland, and
Portugal as relatively contained, but were concerned that if stress were to spread to Spain and,
especially, the core EA, spillovers could be substantial. Potential spillovers through financial
confidence effects and direct banking channels were seen as especially critical, but some
authorities also considered that effects through trade and FDI channels could be significant,
particularly for countries that are geographically close, and with strong trade ties, to the EA (see
below). Counterparts noted that while EA authorities had made progress in the wake of the
Greece program in addressing problems in the periphery (at both the individual country and
central levels), further measures to delink sovereign and banking sector problems, including
through stress tests and follow-up to recapitalize banks as needed, as well as more centralized
fiscal policy would help limit adverse spillovers to the rest of the world.

EURO AREA POLICIES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

5.

Other spillovers discussed included the impact of EA macroeconomic policies, trade

and FDI links, and regulatory changes on partner countries.


Macroeconomic policies. Problems with EA debt sustainability were seen as increasing global
tail risks, as discussed above. On a more positive note, counterparts saw the prospect of
adverse spillovers from EA fiscal consolidation plans—through the demand compression
effect—as relatively minor, and some observed that the net impact could even be positive if
credibility gains and associated confidence effects are significant. Spillovers from ECB policies
were, similarly, seen as contained to the extent that any phasing out of the ECB’s
unconventional support policies did not undermine the periphery. Spillovers from ECB rates
hikes ahead of other advanced economy central banks would also likely be contained to the
extent that robust EA growth at the core was in place.



Trade and FDI. Reflecting the EA’s role as the world’s single largest trading entity, trade and
FDI links were seen as strong, particularly for neighboring countries. For close neighbors, their
role in the EA supply chain accentuates these trade linkages, making them far stronger than
financial spillovers. Counterparts were confident that implementation of the EA’s Doha
commitments would have a favorable impact.



Regulation. Some counterparts argued that proposed EU financial regulatory reforms could
have major spillovers on neighbors, especially should their discretionary regulatory powers be
affected as a result of new EU regulations.

movement of growth in China with the EA and the rest of the S-5 has been weaker as China’s
economic performance outpaced that of the rest of the S-5 countries, including during the recent
crisis.

A closer look at these growth links suggests that Euro Area output shocks have had

generally moderate spillovers.

authorities diagnosed the EA as a net importer of
global spillovers. This was attributed mostly to the
EA’s relative trade openness, compared with the
U.S., which exposes it to incoming trade shocks. The
continuing dominance of U.S. debt and equity
markets, backed by the still strong global role of the
U.S. dollar, was also seen as playing an important
role. As an illustration, the authorities noted that

their analysis of the transmission of positive investment shocks indicated that such shocks in the
EA had smaller spillover effects on the rest of the world than the other way around.
8.

Moving beyond the S-5, countries geographically closer to the EA—generally those

with stronger trade links—are affected more by the area’s economic fluctuations. Results
from a G-20 macroeconometric model of business cycle transmission through international trade
and financial channels indicate that spillovers tend to be greater for economies closer to the EA
(Chapter 1 of Selected Issues Paper). Among G-20 countries, the highest impact can be found in
Russia, reflecting its strong trade linkages with the EA, followed by the U.K., reflecting its strong
trade and financial linkages (text chart).

A implication of this analysis is that EA growth shocks are likely to have the largest

spillover effects on non-EA European and North African economies. Though direct empirical
results from the macroeconometric analysis are not available for these countries, their generally

Indeed, the strong relation between the

channels in transmitting growth shocks. With

African countries, the impact of EA shocks on
these economies could be especially significant.

B. Financial Sector Spillovers
10.

Analysis of global risk factor movements across different asset classes suggests

strong spillovers from the EA (Chapter 2 of Selected Issues Paper). The analysis, which is based
on a principal components approach, assesses the extent of spillovers from individual EA asset
markets across borders and across various financial markets (mainly bonds and equities), after
abstracting from “risk commonalities” (that is,
after adjusting for comovement due to common
shocks). The key findings are:

risk, cross-correlations of EA financial sector spreads with spreads of EA non-financial
corporations as well as with financial corporations outside the EA, such as Japanese and
U.S. banks, are sizable and significant. The latter may reflect direct links among financial
institutions as well as transmission of spillovers via bank funding markets.
11.

The authorities agreed with staff’s views that financial spillovers from core EA banks

to the rest of the world could be substantial. Both the authorities and staff also agreed that
shadow banking in the EA was less relevant than in the U.S., given the EA’s reliance on traditional
relationship banking and the relatively large share of the banking sector in overall financing in
the EA.
IV.

POLICY ISSUES

A. Spillovers from Intensification of EA Financial Market Stress
12.

Direct spillovers from further stress in the EA program countries would likely remain

manageable, but the potential to affect the rest of the world is much larger if stress
spreads to the core EA. Several methods of analyzing financial and other spillovers from the
periphery and the core support this conclusion, including analysis based on correlations of
financial market prices, bank deleveraging analysis, and macroeconomic models.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

EURO AREA POLICIES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

13.

Financial markets signal that spillovers of further stress in the EA would be large if

the core is affected (Chapter 3 of Selected
Issues Paper). The analysis uses correlations
of market CDS spreads to estimate the

constrained the number of sovereigns and banks that could be analyzed, so a geographically
diverse group of countries—and representative banks from those countries—was chosen. The
results indicate that if there is distress in a major bank from a core EA economy, the probability of
distress in many of the non-EA banks would rise to high levels (40 percent or more), and would
generally be highest in banks based in countries that are geographically close to the EA and
whose banking systems are most closely linked to that of the EA. Among the S-4, the spillover to
the U.K. would be greatest, reflecting its very strong banking links with the EA. For most non-EA
banks, the estimated conditional probability of distress given distress in a core EA bank is as high
or higher than the peak implied unconditional probability of distress in the period after the
Lehman bankruptcy. By contrast, the estimated probabilities of distress in non-EA banks
conditional on distress emerging in an EA program country sovereign, while still sizable, are
much lower than those conditional on distress in a major core EA bank.
14.

Analysis of global bank interconnectedness also suggests that further EA stress

would have negative spillovers that are sharply exacerbated if core Europe is affected (text
charts and Chapter 4 of Selected Issues Paper). The model, which uses BIS bank foreign claims
data, is based on the assumption that banks deleverage when faced with large mark-to-market
losses on their trading books. The shocks that are analyzed comprise: (i) a further decline (from
current levels) in EA program country sovereign and bank bond prices of 30 percent (Scenario 1);
and (ii) a further 30 percent decline (from current levels) in bond prices of EA program country
sovereigns and of all EA banks (Scenario 2). Results suggest that the first shock, which is confined
to the program countries, would cause some deleveraging, though mostly in the EA itself. Under
the more severe scenario, the impact would be much larger, especially in the rest of Europe and
parts of North Africa. These results are based on direct exposures; indirect exposures, including

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 12

EURO AREA POLICIES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

through guarantees via CDS contracts, may exacerbate deleveraging in a shock scenario. Recent
data from the BIS indicate that the total exposure of U.S. banks to EA program countries, for
example, may be several times as large as just the direct exposure. Moreover, actual spillovers
could easily be more severe than estimated by this exercise if other factors also intensify
deleveraging, such as a compression in non-bank wholesale funding of banks and financial
accelerator effects through impacts on non-bank private sector balance sheets, which are not
captured by the model but would be expected to be at play under such a scenario.

The importance of spillovers from shocks to the core EA are further underscored by

results from a broader macroeconomic modeling approach (Chapter 5 of Selected Issues
Paper). Two sets of illustrative simulations were run under the Fund’s Global Projections Model
(GPM; as presented in the January 2011 WEO update). These comprised, first, a “tremor” scenario
of a milder shock which may be interpreted as a shock that is largely confined to the EA program
countries, and, second, an “earthquake” scenario of a larger shock that spreads to the entire EA.
Under the first scenario, spillovers are moderate (see text table). By contrast, the second scenario,
which assumes a large shock and a policy response that falls short, leads to large financial losses
in the periphery which, in turn, result in banking problems throughout the EA. Consequently, EA
growth falls by 2½ percentage points relative to the baseline, while global growth falls by about
1 percent over 2011−12.

The authorities shared staff’s views on these dual spillover findings. They stressed

that problems confined to the periphery would have modest spillover effects. The smaller size,
and greater market knowledge, of exposures to EA program country assets than, say, subprime
assets at the outset of the 2008 crisis, implied less scope for panic than during the Lehman
episode. Also, market exposure to program country assets has been reduced over the past year,
which would also limit potential spillover effects. They acknowledged, however, that core area
involvement would have severe repercussions. They agreed, therefore, that containing peripheral
risk was critical and cited strong national policy action, effective EA crisis management, and
completing governance reforms as key ingredients of such a strategy.
B. Spillovers from Monetary and Fiscal Policies

ECB exceptional liquidity provision has helped contain deleveraging by EA banks

and corresponding spillover effects. Counterfactual scenarios used to assess the impact of
higher funding costs likely associated with the withdrawal of exceptional liquidity provision
indicate that the impact on some neighboring European countries, such as the U.K. could be
significant (text chart and Chapter 6 of Selected Issues Paper). ECB counterparts agreed that
exceptional liquidity provision had helped contain negative spillovers and stressed that it would
not be withdrawn under stressed conditions. They recognized, however, that ongoing exceptional
liquidity provision can also have drawbacks, notably that it could dilute incentives of weak banks
to pursue timely restructuring.

A slightly faster pace of monetary tightening in the EA than markets presently

expect would have generally limited spillovers (Chapter 6 of Selected Issues Paper). The
baseline scenario assumes that monetary tightening in the EA proceeds at the pace expected by
the Euribor futures market, while an alternative scenario assumes somewhat more frontloaded
rate hikes (see chart). Macroeconomic model estimates suggest that accelerated monetary
tightening in the EA will generate moderate output losses, on the order of a cumulative
additional output loss of less than 1 percent over 2011-16, built on the implicit assumption that
ongoing adjustments in the EA program countries allow them to absorb the somewhat higher
interest rates without an intensification of economic stress. This in turn is estimated to have
modest spillovers to the rest of the world, primarily reflecting reduced EA export demand,

Projected EA fiscal consolidation should have modest global demand spillovers,

and these could be more than offset by credibility gains. The modeling exercise covers
projected fiscal consolidation by EA members through 2015. To highlight the impact of fiscal
policy and its spillovers, the simulations abstract from monetary policy accommodation in the
EA as well as the rest of the world, thereby overstating somewhat the true contractionary effect
on output that would actually take place. Even so, the negative demand effects to other
countries are estimated to be relatively small since the magnitude of the consolidation for the
area as a whole is moderate (Chapter 7 of Selected Issues Paper). Moreover, if the consolidation
is accompanied by a decline in EA countries’ risk premia—only partly reversing the 150 bps
increase since late 2009—net cumulative spillovers to other countries over the medium term
could even turn positive (see text charts). The authorities agreed with staff that spillovers from
planned fiscal consolidation would be modest, but argued that the impact within the EA itself
would likely be even more modest than estimated by staff, as the fiscal multiplier would likely
be contained given the perceived permanence of the fiscal consolidation plans and since
monetary policy would take into account

C. Structural Policy Spillovers
20.

Turning to structural reforms, any deleveraging associated with higher bank

capital requirements is expected to have only modest spillovers (Chapter 8 of Selected
Issues Paper). Under Basel III, banks are expected to be subject to higher minimum core capital
requirement by 2018, and many banks are likely to implement the new requirements well in
advance of the deadline. Stronger capital requirements are expected to carry major financial
stability benefits and address current excessive leverage, but may also have short-term
contractionary effects as banks adjust, in particular if the adjustment takes the form of a rapid
reduction in credit supply. Different analytical approaches suggest that direct output losses
outside the EA—assuming that deleveraging will form the means through which EA banks meet
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

EURO AREA POLICIES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

higher capital requirements—should be modest (and well within the range of estimates
reported by the BIS Macroeconomic Assessment Group), even if the adjustment is undertaken
well in advance of the agreed deadline. In countries where EA banks’ subsidiaries account for a
sizable share of banking activity, the impact would tempered by subsidiaries’ reliance on
domestic funding (rather than funding from parents). The ECB agreed that higher capital
requirements would generate modest spillovers. On a related issue, the authorities agreed in
principle that EU bank regulations could have spillover effects. They understood concerns in
some neighboring countries over the preservation of supervisory independence in non-EA
members of the EU, but considered that enhanced supervisory effort and supervisory and
regulatory coordination (including through supervisory colleges and the newly installed EUlevel financial authorities) would help address these concerns. They also took note of staff
support for implementing Basel III swiftly and without exceptions, setting capital requirements
at an ambitiously high level—including significant top-ups for SIFIs—and allowing sufficient
flexibility for introducing macro-prudential tools (described in the 2011 Article IV Staff Report
and the European Financial Stability Framework Exercise Report, EFFE). In addition, the
authorities called on major regulatory authorities in the rest of the world to also implement
robust requirements to limit regulatory arbitrage and spillovers.

Labor and product market reforms that enhance EA growth potential would have

positive, albeit modest, spillovers to the rest of the world (Chapter 9 of Selected Issues
Paper). The analysis of the impact of reforms was based on work undertaken for the G-20
mutual assessment process, with simulations performed using the Fund’s Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF). Structural reforms covered both labor and product market

measures, along the lines of the reforms set out under the EU 2020 agenda. These include more
active labor market policies, reforms to make pension systems sustainable (including a higher
retirement age), which would have positive labor supply consequences and generate stronger
internal growth due to budget savings and crowding-in effects. Product market reforms were
assumed to result in multifactor productivity growth gains in both tradable and nontradable
sectors. This in turn would lead to positive but

Further trade liberalization would also have positive spillovers (Chapter 10 of

Selceted Issues Paper). Based on current offers in the ongoing Doha round of negotiations—
under which it is assumed there is a roughly 50 percent reduction in trade-weighted average
tariff rates applied by EA countries on imports—exports from most countries to the EA would
increase. In aggregate, preliminary results suggest that the unilateral reduction in EA tariffs
would raise total global exports to the area by more than 1 percent.

CONCLUSIONS

The prospect of large spillovers—particularly if recent stress in EA program

countries were to spread to the core—underscores the urgent need for actions to contain,
and eventually overcome, the ongoing crisis. Measures taken over the past year—including
national action in the countries facing market pressures, establishing the EFSF, and the
continuation of the ECB’s unconventional policies—may have helped contain spillovers from the
EA program countries to the rest of the EA and to countries outside the EA for now, but EA
financial markets remain under stress, underscoring the urgent need for additional strong
measures. Decisive further actions to achieve fiscal sustainability, strengthen economic
governance, introduce greater fiscal risk sharing, and address remaining banking sector
weaknesses—as outlined in the 2011 Article IV Staff Report and the accompanying EFFE
report—will, therefore, be instrumental in ending the crisis and mitigating adverse spillovers to
the rest of the world.
24.

The planned fiscal consolidation in the EA could benefit the rest of the world,

assuming it helps restore credibility. The direct effect of the consolidation on global demand
and growth in trading partner countries will likely be modest. To the extent the EA’s fiscal
adjustment credibly addresses sustainability concerns, it should help reduce spreads in the
periphery and, through confidence effects, in the area more broadly and elsewhere. This latter
effect, depending on its magnitude, could more than offset the direct demand impact.
25.

Spillovers from gradual monetary policy normalization appear manageable under

appropriate conditions. Exit from current interest rates at a slightly faster pace than markets
are presently discounting is estimated to have modest spillover effects, especially if the ongoing
adjustment in EA program countries allows them to absorb the somewhat higher interest rates
without an intensification of economic stress. Given the importance of the ECB’s extraordinary
crisis measures in limiting bank deleveraging, unwinding of extraordinary measures will need to
be timed with progress in improving banking sector health and reducing volatility in sovereign
bond markets in order to limit spillovers.
26.

Execution of the structural reform agenda will carry positive spillovers. External

effects from any temporary deleveraging that banks are forced to undergo in response to
tougher capital requirements (as part of the steps to enhance stability) would be modest, and
should be offset by positive externalities from a healthier banking system. Reforms to labor and
product markets (as laid out in the EU 2020 agenda) and in trade (per the EU’s offers under the
Doha round) are good not only for the EA itself, but also for its trading partners.

Box 1. Euro Area Spillovers to LICs
Low-income countries (LICs) are affected by developments in the Euro Area (EA) through
several channels. Direct channels include trade, remittances, FDI and aid flows. At the same time, the
EA also has indirect spillover effects on LICs, especially through global commodity prices.

The EA receives about 20 percent of LIC exports. About 30 percent of exports from LICs in
Sub-Saharan Africa and 20 percent of exports from Asia and CIS countries go to the EA.
Commodity exports, in particular, play an important role in LIC bilateral trade links with Europe
where fuel and crude material make up roughly 60 percent of LIC exports to Europe in 2008.

Remittances and FDI from the EA are particularly important for LICs in Sub-Sahara
Africa. Over 30 percent of SSA’s remittance inflows originate from EA. In other regions, the
U.S.’s remittance role is generally larger. In addition, EA FDI dominates flows to CIS and SSA
countries.



The EA is the largest donor across LICs, particularly for LAC and SSA where EA aid makes
up more than 40 percent of total aid to these regions.

Empirical evidence suggest that developments in EA could have significant spillovers on LICs.
Estimates from growth regressions suggest that trading partner growth has a significant impact on
LIC growth. An empirical study using bilateral FDI data between EA and LICs suggests that EA growth
is one driver of FDI flows to LICs, although the effect is much weaker than the size of the recipient
economy. In addition, there is evidence that aid flows are procyclical with respect to the donors’
business cycle and could be influenced by donors’ fiscal situation, particularly when donors face a
large negative shock.1

I. EURO AREA OUTPUT SPILLOVERS1
This note analyzes output spillovers from the Euro Area (EA) using a global vector
autoregression (GVAR) and a macroeconometric model of the G-20. These two approaches are
used to assess the impact of shocks in the EA on other systemically important economies.
In the first instance, a GVAR model is used to shed light on spillover effects across
countries. The approach uses a dynamic multi-country framework for the analysis of the
international transmission of shocks and is based on the GVAR toolbox, launched in December
2010, and sponsored by the ECB.2 It comprises 26 economies, with the EA as one of the
economies covered. The model is constructed by combining separate models for each of the
26 economies linking core variables within each economy with corresponding trade-weighted
foreign variables. EA variables are GDP-weighted aggregates of eight countries (Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain). The model has both real
and financial variables: real GDP, inflation, the real equity price, the real exchange rate, short
and long-term interest rates, and the oil price. All the data are observed at the quarterly
frequency, from 1979Q2 to 2009Q4.
GVAR estimates show that output spillovers from the EA to other S-4 economies are
meaningful (Figure 1). Output spillovers are measured as ratios of the peak impulse responses
of output to the peak impulse response of output in the EA. The spillover coefficients can be
thought of as elasticity measures. The EA has the strongest spillovers to the neighboring UK,
and the least to the US. These spillovers to the rest of the S-4 range from about 10 percent for
spillovers to the US to about a quarter for spillovers to UK. In turn, output spillovers from the
US to the EA are stronger than spillovers from the EA to the US. The US impact is most
pronounced on the UK.3

Japan’s spillovers to other countries might appear stronger than expected. This is likely due to the fact that the
estimates are based on long time series, which cover periods in the 1980s and 1990s when Japan’s role was larger.

To gauge the size of output spillovers from another angle, simulations are also
undertaken using a macroeconometric model.4 Estimates are derived from a
macroeconometric model which features extensive linkages between the real and financial
sectors within and across the G-20 economies. The EA is represented in the model by France,
Germany, Italy and Spain. The variables under consideration are the GDP deflator, a
consumption price index, real GDP, real domestic demand, a short term nominal interest rate, a
long term nominal interest rate, an equity price index, the nominal bilateral exchange rate, and
the prices of energy and non-energy commodities.
The macroeconometric model simulations are largely consistent with the GVAR results of
positive, but modest, spillovers, with spillover strength depending on proximity. Five
scenarios are generated with supply, demand, monetary policy, term premium, and equity risk
premium shocks in the EA. These shocks are calibrated to raise output in the EA by one
percentage point in all five scenarios. A negative equity risk premium shock, for example,
would increase wealth and demand in the EA, resulting in stronger demand for exports from
other regions via the trade channel. Through financial linkages, it would also raise output
elsewhere with the size depending on the dependence on the financial sector and the strength of
linkages with EA financial markets. The peak impulse responses from these five scenarios are
then averaged.
The results are similar to those obtained from the GVAR model (Figure 2). Spillovers from
the EA are strongest to the UK, while the US and the UK have the strongest impact on the EA.

The peak impulse responses of output to shocks in the EA are increasing with
geographical proximity to the EA, reflecting the strength of trade and financial linkages.
The highest spillovers are to Russia and the UK, but the magnitude is moderate with average
peak impulse response ratios of about a quarter (Figure 3). In the case of Russia, this results
reflects its strong trade and commodity price linkages with the EA, while for the UK it reflects
its strong trade and financial linkages. The trade channel is also important for Turkey and
Saudi Arabia, with the latter having significant exposure via the commodity price channel.

II. CONTRIBUTION OF THE EURO AREA TO COMMON RISK IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS5
This note analyzes the relative contributions of different regions and assets to common risk
across global financial markets. In doing so, it makes use of a simple principal component
analysis on the risk premiums of a variety of assets.
A simple principal component analysis is used to estimate the extent to which
unobservable shifts in common risk factors contribute to observed changes in assetspecific expected returns. As international investors react to shocks by rebalancing their
portfolios in asset markets that would otherwise be unrelated, any change in the willingness of
global investors to bear risk—or any common shock—is deemed to raise the co-movement
across asset returns. By assuming that risk premiums embedded in selected asset yields
differentials are determined jointly in the market and influenced by both asset-specific factors
and a common factor, the latter component can be identified and—thereby—stripped out. In
other words, if there is an increase in the (risk-neutral) probability of default for all asset
considered—which most likely happened during the global financial crisis—this would likely
be picked up in the principal component, along with shifts in investors’ attitude toward risk.
The methodology is used to assess the contribution of Euro Area (EA) asset markets to
the estimated common risk component by adding up the contribution to the common risk
component of all asset markets in the region. In addition, the analysis allows to gauge the
extent of volatility spillovers from individual EA asset markets across borders and across
markets, once we abstract from “risk commonalities”.
The analysis relies on the set of risk premiums embedded in the following yield
differentials:

The analysis suggests that European financial markets play an important role in
transmitting financial shocks to the rest of the world. In particular, the EA is estimated to
contribute to over one-fifth of the changes in risk commonalities—a contribution which is
second only to that of the US.

The importance of risk commonalities varies over time, being greater at time of generalized stress in financial
markets. On average, over the sample August 2007-February 2011, risk commonalities are found to explain about
one-third of the total volatility for the portfolio considered.

7
Volatility spillovers from the EA periphery sovereign bond market to the rest of the
world appear to be limited. Specifically, while looking at “raw” cross-market correlations
(blue bars in the left chart below) indicates that “observed” volatility co-movements across
assets and across borders tend to be widespread, examining cross-correlations of spreads where
the common risk component has been stripped out (red bars in the left chart below) reveals that
significant volatility spillovers from the EA sovereign bond market are likely to be felt only in
the bond market of EA financial corporations, signaling a surge in EA banks’ perceived
riskiness. To a lesser extent, increases in EA sovereign risk are also expected to adversely
affect the perceived riskiness of EA non-financial corporations and emerging European
countries.

However, if stress spreads from the periphery to core EA financial institutions, the
potential for spillovers is much larger. In particular, once the common risk component is
stripped out, specific volatility spillovers from the EA financial sector have the potential to
increase significantly the perceived riskiness of EA non-financial corporations, Japanese and
U.S. banks (red bars in the right chart above), even though “raw” conditional correlations
between spreads of EA and Japanese financial institutions are seen to remain below the
0.2 threshold. Incidentally, the analysis also seems to suggest that shocks to EA financial
corporate bond spreads tend to be negatively correlated with those to EMBI+ bond spreads,
once global risk commonalities have been set aside.7

This could either be due to investors’ hedging strategies in the asset markets considered or to (opposite)
fluctuations in the respective benchmark 10-year government bond yields.

III. MARKET ASSESSMENT OF SPILLOVERS FROM THE EURO AREA
BASED ON CONDITIONAL DISTRESS PROBABILITIES8
This note analyzes Euro Area (EA) sovereign and financial distress spillovers using market
information, including credit default swaps, equity prices and sovereign yields. The results are
presented in heat-maps showing the sensitivity of non-EA countries to developments in the EA
as well as the importance of groups of EA countries in generating spillovers to the rest of the
world. The sample consists of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, and Portugal (EA), and Brazil, China, Hungary, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Russia, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States (non-EA). When
studying banks, one major bank from each country is used.9
Spillovers are measured by averages of estimated Conditional Probabilities of Distress
(CoPoD) in non-EA sovereigns and banks given distress in EA sovereigns and banks.
Distress is defined as a (hypothetical) credit event that triggers CDS contracts.10 For example, if
the CoPoD in Bank A given distress in Sovereign B is 0.5, CDS market implied probability
suggests that there is a 50-percent probability that a (hypothetical) credit event in Sovereign B
would be followed by a CDS event in Bank A. CoPoDs represent the market’s assessment of
potential spillovers through a variety of channels such as direct exposure to governments and
banks, deleveraging and market confidence.
The CoPoDs are estimated using linear and non-linear dependence between individual
probabilities of distress.11 Probabilities of distress (PoDs) are first derived from market quotes

While the note investigates spillovers from the EA as a whole, the effects of developments in the core and
periphery EA are studied separately. Core EA, for the purposes of this analysis, comprises of Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, and the Netherlands, and EA program countries are Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. Both
sovereigns and banks are studied for all G-20 countries except India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa (due to
insufficient data for the sovereign for India and banks for others), and for Hungary (taken because of the
availability of bank CDS data as representative of new EU member states in terms of their links—and hence as
potential spillover recipients—with the Euro Area). Only one major bank from each country is used due to
technical limits of the model. The EA banks are as follows: Austria – Erste, Belgium – Dexia, France – BNP
Paribas, Germany – Deutsche, Greece – Alpha Bank, Ireland – Allied Irish, Netherlands – ING, Portugal – BCP,
Other countries’ banks are as follows: Brazil – Itau Unibanco, China – Bank of China, Hungary – OTP Bank,
India – State Bank of India, Japan – Nomura, Korea – Shinhan, Russia – Sberbank, Turkey – Akbank, UK –
Barclays , US – Citigroup.
10

A credit event could be a failure to pay on schedule, default, or, more broadly, a restructuring where
bondholders are forced to bear losses.

The CoPoDs are estimated as in Segoviano (2006), “Consistent Information Multivariate Density Optimizing
Methodology,” Financial Markets Group, London School of Economics, Discussion Paper 557; Segoviano (2006),

of five-year sovereign and bank CDS spreads in U.S. dollar.12 Pairwise CoPoDs are calculated
for a group of sovereigns and banks. A matrix of distress dependence between
sovereigns/banks can be derived. Although conditional probabilities do not imply causation,
the set of pairwise conditional probabilities can provide important insights into interlinkages
and the likelihood of contagion between the sovereigns/banks in the system. The results shown
below are taken from averages of CoPoDs from January 2010 to April 2011, covering a period
of market turmoil for European sovereigns and banks.
The analysis shows that EA spillovers can be substantial. The impact is largest in
neighboring Europe and smallest in Asia. Sovereign distress in the EA program countries could
have knock-on effects on banks, including in the core EA, which would likely in turn have
global systemic effects.
Sovereign-to-Sovereign Spillovers
Staff analysis suggests that sovereign credit events in peripheral EA program countries
have larger spillovers to neighboring sovereigns than to elsewhere. The estimated
spillovers from peripheral EA program country sovereigns tend to be largest in Eastern Europe,
reflecting close links, through market confidence, but meaningful spillovers also occur to some
other advanced and emerging markets such as Brazil (chart below).

Sovereign-to-Banks Spillovers
Sovereign credit events in the EA program countries would likely mainly affect banks in
those countries. There is a larger impact on countries with close links to the EA such as
Hungary and Turkey, while China and Japan are affected less, reflecting their lower exposure.

Bank-to-Bank Spillovers
Estimated spillovers from EA program country banks are large for other banks in the
region but smaller for banks elsewhere. The strongest distress spillovers are within Europe
itself, including in Hungary, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Brazil is also indirectly affected,
reflecting the large presence of Spanish banks. As expected, spillovers to the Asian and US
banking systems are relatively less significant, in part due to their lower direct exposures to the
program country banks but also because their earnings and profitability are supported by strong
local economic conditions (Asia) or driven by investment banking returns which remained
robust over 2010 helped by increased asset prices and renewed risk appetite (US). Conditional
probability of default for the U.S. hovers near the low end of the 0.2–0.4 range, while Brazil is
at the upper end.

Core EA bank distress would, however, be a systemic event impacting banks globally.
Spillovers from core EA banks are very large for Hungary, Turkey, the UK, Brazil and Russia.
Distress in EA core banks would represent a systemic event that could impact banking systems
far beyond the European region, including the US and Asia (The conditional probability of
default for the U.S. increases to the upper end of the 0.2–0.4 range under such conditions).

Japanese and Chinese banks remain the least affected by spillovers from the EA. The
relatively weaker impact on Japanese and Chinese banks is a result of their lower direct
exposure and limited holdings of bonds issued by European sovereigns and banks. Moreover,
they tend to have strong liquidity positions based on a substantial local deposit base, and are
therefore relatively insulated from funding withdrawal pressures due to systemic concerns.
Perhaps the most significant impact of EA banks distress on Asian banks stems from their
impact on global risk aversion, trade and growth prospects.
Summing up, the global impact of distress in program country sovereigns and banks is
potentially sizable, but much smaller than the estimated global spillovers that would arise
if stress were to also spread to core EA banks. This critical result can also be seen by
mapping unconditional distress probabilities across global banks. While implied unconditional
PoDs (derived from current market CDS in April 2011), are lower than the implied conditional
probability in the event of distress in the program countries (light blue bars in text chart
below), the implied probability in the event core EA banks are affected is much higher for all
countries (dark blue bars in text chart), and would generally be highest in countries that are
geographically close to the EA and whose banking systems are most closely linked to that of
the EA. For most non-EA banks in the sample, the estimated conditional probability of distress
given distress in a major core EA bank is as high or higher than the peak implied unconditional
probability of distress in the period after the Lehman bankruptcy.

IV. CROSS-BORDER DELEVERAGING SPILLOVERS OF THE EA SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS13
This note presents simulations of cross-border spillovers of the Euro Area (EA) sovereign debt
crisis. The simulations are performed based on BIS foreign claims data and the model of bank
deleveraging developed in Tressel (2010).14 The behavioral assumption is that banks maintain
a target minimum capital-to-asset ratio by contracting their balance sheet when experiencing
sudden losses.
Two scenarios are considered (Table 1). The events triggering these scenarios are assumed to
take place over a short time span during which banks cannot raise equity as they correspond to
episodes of market stress. In these scenarios, claims held in the trading books of international
banks bear losses of 30 percent as a result of a sudden and sharp increase in bond yields, with
20 percent of the claims assumed to be in the trading books of banks. The increase in yields
affects claims on governments and banks, with the EA program countries (Greece, Ireland, and
Portugal; GIP) affected in the first scenario and other EA banks also affected in the second.

Exposures to EA program countries suggest that the spillovers will be mainly channeled
by German and French banks. Because of their size and high leverage, French and German
banks are the main sources of spillovers within the EA and between the EA and other regions.
According to the most recently available sectoral bilateral exposures of the BIS consolidated
banking statistics, German and French banks have large exposures in percent of their equity to
the sovereigns and banks of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal (Figure 1).15

The simulations are based on Q3 of 2010 data (ultimate risk basis), including for sectoral bilateral exposures.
However, when the sectoral data were not available (for example for French banks), the simulations were based
on Q2 of 2010 data disclosed in the December 2010 BIS Quarterly Review. For German banks, Q3 of 2010 data
on immediate risk basis were used; this method may overestimate German exposure to Ireland.

1 EA3: Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.
2 Other EA includes Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, and the Netherlands.
3 The exposures are calculated in percent of the equity of banks that have foreign exposures. Banks that do not have exposures to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal
are not included in the computation.

Losses of major international banks become large when market stress spreads to more
countries. Losses of banks appear manageable as long as the crisis is contained to Greece,
Ireland and Portugal. However, losses of trading books become large and exceed 10 percent of
equity of French and German banks under scenario 2, when market sentiment about the core EA
also turns negative.
As a result, deleveraging in absolute terms would be the largest within the EA itself
(Table 2). The deleveraging would negatively affect intra-EA financial integration (Figure 2).
In absolute terms, the US and the UK would be the most affected after the EA, followed by
Central and Eastern European countries. Most of deleveraging would be caused by EA banks.

Advanced economies and emerging markets in Europe are particularly vulnerable to
deleveraging. In scenario 2, countries that are the most susceptible to experience capital
outflows by international banks outside of the EA are mostly in Europe: Poland, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Nordic and Baltic countries. Other emerging markets are resilient to such
shock. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the estimated deleveraging under scenarios 1 and 2,
respectively.

Taking account of indirect
exposures to the EA program
countries could significantly affect
the mapping of potential spillovers.
Recent data from the BIS provides
some information on total direct and
indirect gross exposure, including
through guarantees via CDS contracts
(text table). According to these data,
the total exposure U.S. banks, for
example, may be several times as large
as just the direct exposure, while the
indirect exposures of U.K. banks may
be as large as their direct exposures. In
contrast, indirect exposures of French
and German banks, while significant,
are generally several times smaller
than their direct exposures.

V. EURO AREA SPILLOVERS: GLOBAL PROJECTION MODEL ANALYSIS
This note analyzes spillovers from the Euro Area using the Fund’s Global Projection Model
(GPM) 16. The GPM model is a six-region non-linear rational expectations model comprising
the US, the Euro Area (EA), Japan, Emerging Asia, Latin America and a group of remaining
countries. It features two types of demand shocks: an idiosyncratic demand shock that
originates in a particular block and propagates to other regions via the output gap over time,
and instantaneous global shocks—e.g., the sovereign market distress in Europe—that are
applied instantaneously to all blocks in the model. Additionally, GPM incorporates realfinancial linkages—for example, bank lending tightness variables—and spillover channels such
as demand shocks, exchange rates, inflation and interest rate in its estimates.
In the EA spillover analysis, GPM constructs two scenarios:


A baseline or “tremor” scenario, analyzes spillovers to the rest of the world from the
ongoing sovereign debt problems in EA program countries. Under this scenario, shocks
to EA financial conditions (i.e., bank lending conditions) and domestic demand are
equal to about half of those experienced in the Lehman crisis.



A second, downside, “earthquake” scenario measures possible spillovers should
sovereign risk premiums, growth declines and contagion be even larger. Under this
scenario, the magnitude of the shocks are doubled from the tremor scenario. In other
words, bank lending is affected in a manner similar to Lehman episode and domestic
demand also doubled.

GPM model results from the “tremor” scenario indicate that a milder shock arising from
the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in EA program countries would elicit a GDP reduction in
the region, with only modest spillover elsewhere. The projected downturn in growth stems
primarily from program country governments’ fiscal responses, which would be expected to
play a significant role in restraining near-term growth in those countries. However, the impact
on the rest of the EA and elsewhere would be limited as the real economy of the core EA would
be little affected by financial headwinds that buffet the program countries.
In the “earthquake” scenario, GPM measures the tail downside spillover risk should a
worst case scenario occur, in which strains spread to the core EA. In this scenario,
insufficiently rapid and strong policy action would lead to significant financial market losses,
resulting in a substantial decline in capital ratios in all EA countries. Under these conditions,
the overall impact on world growth would be substantially higher. Compared to the pre-crisis
baseline, EA and U.S. growth in 2011 would be lower by 1.4 and 0.7 percentage points,
respectively. Spillover to other regions would also be higher compared to the tremor scenario
16

though the magnitude of impact would be smaller relative to the EA and the US (see table

VI. SPILLOVERS FROM THE EURO AREA’S MONETARY POLICY AND LIQUIDITY
OPERATIONS18
This note analyzes the global implications of the ECB’s policies. It considers spillovers from the
Euro Area (EA) under two scenarios: (i) faster-than-anticipated monetary policy tightening;
and (ii) a withdrawal of the ECB’s exceptional liquidity provision to banks. Staff analyses show
that the first scenario would generate modest spillovers. By contrast, the repercussions from an
early withdrawal of exceptional liquidity could be significant, especially for the UK and some
CEE countries.

20
Accelerated monetary tightening in the EA is estimated to generate moderate spillovers to
the rest of the world. Taking the difference between the alternative and baseline scenarios,
estimated cumulative output losses for other advanced economies range from 0.0 to 0.3 percent
over the period 2011−2016, while for emerging economies they range from 0.0 to 0.2 percent.
These spillovers primarily reflect reduced export demand from the EA, mitigated by real
effective currency depreciations in the rest of the world.
ECB’s liquidity provision
Simulations are first undertaken to estimate cross-border spillovers of the ECB full
allotment liquidity provision to the periphery EA’s banks. The simulations provide a
counterfactual of the positive spillover effect of full allotment liquidity provision at a fixed rate.
The analysis is performed based on the model of bank deleveraging based on the behavioral
assumption that banks maintain a target minimum leverage ratio by contracting their balance
sheet (they “deleverage”) or recapitalizing when experiencing losses or an increase in the
required minimum capital to asset ratio. 20

July 2011. As a result, the ECB’s exposures to
the periphery EA’s banks are significant.22 Other non-periphery EA banks also remain
significantly exposed to the banks of the periphery.

20

Tressel, T, 2010, “Financial Contagion through Bank Deleveraging: Stylized Facts and Simulations Applied to
the Financial Crisis”, IMF Working Paper 10/236.
21

Measures adopted by the ECB included fixed rate tenders with full allotment in all liquidity-providing
operations; additional refinancing operations with one-month and three-month maturities, as well as the provision
of funding at longer maturities of six months and one year, and a broadening of the collateral program.

22

Refinancing by the ECB is backed by the provision of collateral, including sovereign debt securities and bank
bonds. The ECB is also directly exposed to sovereigns of the periphery through the Securities Market Programme.

21
The scenario assumes that the full allotment liquidity provision by the ECB has prevented
excessive movements in the funding costs of the banks of the periphery. The liquidity
provision at full allotment is assumed to have lowered funding costs of the banks of the
periphery and of subsidiaries by 500 basis points, and overall funding needs are approximated
by the sum of (i) the liquidity provision by the ECB to these banks; and (ii) total interbank
liabilities.23 In other words, the simulation illustrates the counterfactuals, i.e. periphery banks’
funding costs, both from ECB refinancing facility and from the interbank market, would
increase by 500 bps in the absence of the ECB liquidity provision. The scenario assumes that
subsidiaries of banks of the periphery deleverage in the same proportion as their parent in
response to a withdrawal of the ECB exceptional liquidity provision. To assess robustness, we
also consider an alternative scenario in which the funding shocks differs across countries.
Funding costs are assumed to increase by 700 bps in Greece and Ireland, 400 bps in Portugal,
and 250 bps in Spain. Finally, to gauge how the simulated deleveraging is affected by the size
of the funding shock, we consider two additional scenarios, in which funding costs rise by
respectively 250 bps and 750 bps.
The funding shock is derived from the increase in credit risk premia during recent market
stress since 2008. The assumed 500 bps is within the range of the decrease in euribor in late
2008 at the time the exceptional liquidity provision was initiated and with the range of the
increase in long-term rates in 2010, both of which reflect increased credit risks (Figure 1).The
first chart shows the decline in euribor as a result of policy reactions at the onset of the financial
crisis in 2008. The second chart shows movements in government bond yields of the periphery.
The main scenario thus assumes that funding costs of ECB refinancing or the interbank market
would increase by this amount should the ECB return to competitive auctions for its refinancing
facilities. Given uncertainties in quantifying a counterfactual, we considered three additional
scenarios to ascertain robustness of the main conclusions.

23

Hence, the analysis differentiate banking systems according to their dependence on ECB refinancing and
interbank financing. Interbank liabilities of the banking systems of the four countries are approximated by the total
consolidated claims on domestic banks by banks of other nationalities (source: BIS Consolidated Banking
Statistics, Q3 of 2010, and BIS Quarterly Review Dec 2010).

The simulation shows that
exceptional liquidity provision
has helped contain funding costs
significantly. Should exceptional
liquidity provision be ended, the
funding shock would be
substantial for Greek, Portuguese
and Irish banks, resulting in losses
exceeding 20 percent of bank
capital. The shock would be more
manageable for Spanish banks.

Most spillovers would occur within the EA and between the EA and other advanced
economies (Figure 2). Spillovers within the EA would account for a large share of the
contraction in foreign activities of international banks, in particular in the second scenario in
which ECB liquidity provisioning plays a broader stabilizing role in the interbank market.
Because of its role as a financial center and interconnectedness with other European countries,
the UK would be significantly affected by the withdrawal of ECB exceptional liquidity
provision. Spillovers to emerging markets would be small on average, except for a small
number of CEE countries. While these spillovers are large, it should be recognized that ongoing
exceptional liquidity provision can also have drawbacks, notably delayed restructuring of weak
banks.

VII. EURO AREA FISCAL CONSOLIDATION: MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS25
This note analyzes spillovers from planned fiscal consolidation in the Euro Area. The analysis
is based on scenarios simulated with the latest 6-region version (including U.S., Euro Area,
Japan, China, Emerging Asia, and Rest of the World) of the IMF’s dynamic general equilibrium
model— Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF)—and a refined version of the
structural macroeconometric model of the Group of Twenty(G-20 model).26 These alternative
models provide complementary analyses of spillovers from fiscal consolidation in the Euro
Area. The GIMF model features a more detailed fiscal transmission mechanism, while the G-20
model features a higher level of disaggregation across economies.
The first scenario reflects the overall Euro Area fiscal adjustment projected by the April
2011 World Economic Outlook. Staff projects
the consolidation to be quite strong in 2011, on
the order of 1.7 percent of GDP (of which
0.9 percent is the cyclically-adjusted
component), followed by more moderate
adjustments averaging 0.5 percent of GDP in
subsequent years until 2016. In structural terms,
the implied cumulative fiscal consolidation
would amount to 2.4 percent of GDP by end2016 (see text chart). Under the baseline
scenario, the change in the structural balance is
assumed to be permanent in the year it is
implemented, but future changes in the
structural balance are not anticipated and do not
affect behavior until they actually occur.
Further, the consolidation is prevented from
having an impact on interest rates over the first
five years in all regions.

Laxton, Dirk Muir, and Susanna Mursula (2010), “The Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) –
Theoretical Structure,” International Monetary Fund Working Paper, 10/34. The structural macroeconometric
model of the Group of Twenty is documented in Vitek, F. (2010), “Monetary policy analysis and forecasting in the
Group of Twenty: A panel unobserved components approach,” International Monetary Fund Working Paper,
10/152.

25
Under the alternative scenario, the impact of the same consolidation plan is allowed to
flow through to interest rates as easing concerns about debt sustainability in the Euro
Area lower sovereign risk premia. Under this scenario, the planned fiscal adjustment is seen
as sufficiently strong to bring about a gradual and permanent reduction in sovereign risk premia,
as financial conditions and market confidence improve. Specifically, sovereign risk premia in
the Euro Area are assumed to fall gradually by a cumulative 50 basis points by 2016.
The decline of investors’ concerns regarding sovereign risk issues in the Euro Area is
assumed to spread to the rest of the world, mirrored by a cumulative reduction of other
regions’ sovereign risk premia on the order of 20 basis point by 2016—roughly one third of
what is assumed for the Euro Area. Both scenarios abstract from monetary policy
accommodation in the Euro Area and in the rest of the world over the period 2011-16, in order
to highlight the impact of fiscal policy and its spillovers. Of course, this assumption overstates
the “true” contractionary effect on output that would actually take place, since monetary policy
stabilization would moderate the impact.
According to model simulations, planned fiscal consolidation in the Euro Area will
generate meaningful output losses in this region. In particular, under the baseline scenario
where the consolidation does not bring down sovereign spreads, cumulative output losses over
2011-16 are found to range from 2.2 to 2.4 percent (see text chart below). The scenario that
incorporates lower sovereign risk premia—both in the Euro Area and elsewhere—results in
smaller cumulative output losses for the Euro Area over the same period, ranging from 0.9 to
0.8 percent. In other words, according to our model simulations, the generalized fall in risk
premia partly offsets the Euro Area output losses arising from its planned fiscal adjustment (at
least until end-2015).
Model simulations envisage moderate spillovers to the rest of the world, which are
negative in the absence of risk premia reductions and largely positive in the event that risk
premia do fall. Assuming no risk premia reductions, model simulations reckon a cumulative
output drop over 2011-16 in the rest of the world on the order of 0.5 percent—with regional
output losses ranging from

ranging from -0.3 to 0.5 percent. Differences in the magnitude of spillover effects across
countries and country groups reflect trade linkages—those with greater trade openness and a
higher share of trade with the Euro Area would tend to be affected more. The somewhat larger
spillover effects under the GIMF model simulations (relative to those simulated using the G-20
model) are largely due to the strength of trade links, which are magnified by distinguishing
between trade in final versus intermediate goods.

VIII. SPILLOVERS FROM HIGHER BANK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE EURO AREA27
This note analyzes spillovers from regulatory increases in capital adequacy requirements in the
Euro Area (EA). The novelty of this analysis is that it integrates and focuses on cross-border
spillovers, and therefore serves as a complement to the MAG studies.28 The first section
analyzes spillovers within the framework of a global model of bank balance sheets. The second
section analyzes macroeconomic spillovers with the framework of a global macroeconometric
model. In both sections, the focus is on direct potential spillovers only, abstracting from the
potentially large positive impact of new higher capital requirements on underlying bank
stability.
Bank Deleveraging Spillovers
This section presents simulations of bank deleveraging resulting from a tightening of
capital adequacy regulations that lead to a large reduction in bank leverage. The
simulations are performed in the model of bank deleveraging based on the simple behavioral
assumption that banks maintain a target minimum leverage ratio by contracting their balance
sheet (they “deleverage”), or by raising equity. 29 The calibration relies on BIS consolidated
banking statistics for the exposures of international banks to various countries.30 This reduction
in leverage is assumed to stem from higher bank capital requirements and market pressures to
reduce risk taking and leverage. To keep the exercise tractable, the risk composition of bank
portfolios is assumed to remain constant, hence deleveraging is proportionally distributed across
all asset classes. It is also assumed, for the purposes of the model, that the reduction in leverage
does not lower funding costs.
We consider three scenarios under various amplification mechanisms and transmission to
local affiliates. The main assumption, common to all scenarios, is that international banks
experience a uniform 2 percentage point increase in their minimum capital to asset ratios (to
reach a capital to asset ratio of 6 percent), resulting in a symmetric shock to all asset classes.
Another common assumption is that banks are able to realize 80 percent of the required increase
in the capital (given total assets) by increasing equity, and 20 percent by deleveraging. The
baseline scenario assumes that there is full pass-through of the deleveraging to local affiliates of
international banks. The second scenario adds moderate liquidity funding shocks to the baseline
scenario under the assumption of 20 percent haircuts

associated with fire sales. The third scenario modifies the baseline scenario by assuming only a
30 percent pass-through of the deleveraging to local affiliates, as opposed to 100 percent under
the baseline.31
In the baseline scenario, the deleveraging is broad-based, and affects mostly large
European financial institutions. The reduction in total assets is significant for French,
German, Swiss and Swedish banks, where reductions equivalent to 6−8 percent of assets take
place. This reflects the very high initial leverage of these banks. By contrast, Austrian,
Canadian, U.S., Italian and Japanese banks do not deleverage significantly following the
increase in required capital.
From a host country perspective, spillover effects are large mostly in advanced economies.
The deleveraging exceeds 5 percent of GDP for a group of advanced economies (Belgium,
Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, and New Zealand), a few emerging markets (the three Baltic countries,
Hong Kong SAR), and several small countries (see Table 1).
Spillovers under this scenario take
place mostly within the EA. Most of the
deleveraging would be driven by EA
banks and would, therefore, affect other
EA countries (Figure 1). In absolute
terms, the US and the UK would
experience the second largest
deleveraging, but the spillover would
remain small in percent of their GDP.
While small in absolute terms, the
spillovers would be the largest for Central
and Eastern European countries in
percent of their GDP (Table). Spillovers
to the rest of the world would remain
small.

Country of Banks

Liquidity funding shocks (scenario 2) only marginally increase spillovers to other
countries. With 20 percent haircuts on fire sales of assets, the amplification of deleveraging
caused by the reduction in interbank funding remains small, but higher haircuts would have
much larger effects, as the amplification effect is highly non-linear (see Table).
Partial transmission to local affiliates of international banks significantly reduces crosscountry spillovers (scenario 3). If the shock is only partially transmitted to local affiliates, the
reduction in foreign claims of international banks exceeds or is about 5 percent of GDP in a few
countries.

31

The pass-through to subsidiaries may be partial because they are significantly financed by local deposits.

Macroeconomic Spillovers
This section analyzes spillovers from a regulatory increase in capital adequacy
requirements in the EA. The focus is on the transitional costs of higher capital requirements,
as opposed to the permanent net benefits accruing from less frequent and severe banking crises.
This analysis is based on scenarios simulated with an extended and refined version of the
macroeconometric model of the world economy, disaggregated into its fifteen largest national
economies, documented in Vitek (2009).32 These scenarios abstract from monetary policy
stabilization and assume that the macroeconomic effects of this regulatory measure are
transmitted exclusively via a permanent increase in the spread between commercial bank
lending and deposit rates.

advanced economies, estimated peak output losses range from 0.01 to 0.09 percent, while in
emerging economies they range from 0.02 to 0.14 percent, reflecting their greater trade
openness and less flexible exchange rate regimes. These output losses primarily reflect reduced
export demand from the EA, mitigated by real effective currency depreciations in the rest of the
world.

IX. SPILLOVERS FROM STRUCTURAL REFORMS34
This note analyzes spillovers from structural reforms in the Euro Area (EA). It is based on
the exercise undertaken for the G-20 mutual assessment process. Simulations are performed
using the IMF’s dynamic general equilibrium model, the Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal Model (GIMF).35 Structural reforms covered comprise labor and product market
reforms. The combined reforms are estimated to raise the steady state level of EA real GDP
by almost 6 percent. Spillovers to the rest of the world depend heavily on the strength of
trading relationships. Those to the United States and Japan, although nontrivial, are modest.
Spillovers to emerging Asia and the “rest of world” block, however, are more substantial. 36
Labor Market Reforms
The labor market reform scenarios are based on recent work by the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 37. Four components of the OECD labor
market reforms were included: an increase in active labor market policies (ALMP), a
reduction of the average replacement rate (ARR), an increase in the standard retirement age
by two years, and a move to actuarial neutrality for worker ages 60-65. In particular:


The ALMP reform increases ALMP spending per unemployed worker relative to
GDP per capita to the average level prevailing in a group of high ALMP spending
OECD countries (Denmark, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and
Switzerland).



The ARR reform implies a cut in average replacement rates to the average prevailing
in a group of low ARR spending OECD countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, NewZealand, United Kingdom, and United States).



The move to actuarial neutrality implies that the implicit tax rate on continued
employment is reduced to zero. The pension system is said to be “actuarially neutral”
if the cost in terms of foregone pensions and contributions paid is exactly offset by an

The model contains 5 blocks: the US, the EA, Japan, emerging Asia and the rest of the world. Emerging Asia
block comprises China, Hong Kong S.A.R., India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand. The rest of the world block comprises the remaining 167 countries in the world.

increase in future pension benefits. If this cost is not offset, there is an implicit tax on
continued work.


The ALMP labor market reforms are implemented in 2011; whereas, the other
reforms are implemented gradually starting in 2012. All reforms are perceived to be
fully credible by 2012.

The fiscal impact of the labor reforms are based upon IMF staff estimates. The fiscal savings
in pension outlays and ARR reforms constitute a reduction in government transfers. The
ALMP reforms require an increase in government consumption expenditure to implement the
programs. The increase in labor tax revenues that results from the higher employment
induced by the reforms occurs endogenously in the GIMF simulation analysis. The overall
impact on the fiscal balance of the ARR, ALMP, and pension reform are roughly neutral in
the first few years. However, fiscal gains are realized gradually from a reduction in transfer
outlays and higher labor income tax revenue.
The ALMP reform has the largest direct impact on real GDP in the first few years due to the
increase in government consumption expenditure and the relatively quick response of
household labor supply. The gains from the pension reforms are realized over several years
as the effects on labor supply are more gradual. The implementation of the ARR reforms was
delayed to mitigate the negative income effect in the first few years from the reduction in
transfer outlays and the slow reaction of labor supply to this reform measure.
Product Market Reforms
Product market reforms result in multifactor productivity growth gains in both the tradable
and nontradable sectors that are calibrated to match OECD estimates38. The reforms include
countries moving to the best regulatory practices in upstream sectors observed in the average
of the three most competitive countries in the OECD. The reforms are implemented in 2012,
and the productivity growth gains are realized over a 10-year period. The OECD reforms are
scaled depending on how much of the reforms have already been already implemented.
Spillovers of the Reforms onto the Rest of the
World
The implementation of the labor and product
market reforms, detailed above, increase
productivity and employment permanently in the
EA. This results in higher average household
incomes and an increase in the demand for
goods. Some of the higher demand spills over

into imports and increases exports in all other regions. In the medium term, the spillovers are
small as the rise in EA and world interest rates offset the boost from the trade channel. In the
long run, however, the spillovers become more significant as the supply response in the EA
kicks in and crowding-out effects fade. The effects, while modest in the US and Japan, are
more substantial in emerging Asia and quite significant in the “rest of the world” block. This
is likely due to the fact that neighboring countries (e.g. non-EA EU countries, Turkey and
Russia) which have strong trade ties to the EA account for about 40 percent of the rest of the
world block (in 2007 GDP in US dollar).
The estimated spillover coefficients to the U.S. and Japan are broadly in line with earlier
work assessing the impact of increasing euro area product and labor market competition to
U.S. levels.39 That analysis concluded that such increase would raise long-run output in the
EA by about 12 percent, while the impact on the rest of the world, calibrated using features
of the U.S. economy, would amount to just under 1 percent. International spillovers arise in
the model from the appreciation of the rest of the world’s terms of trade resulting from the
EA’s increased output and exports, as well as higher EA propensity to import due to a shift in
spending from consumption toward investment (which has a higher foreign component).
Reduced goods markups—reflecting improved product market competition—account for
around two thirds of the gains. The spillover coefficient, which may be measured as the
estimated gain in the rest of the world relative to that in the EA, was found to be larger for
cuts in goods markups than for wage markups because of the former’s relatively stronger
output—and hence terms of trade—impact.

X. SPILLOVERS FROM A REDUCTION IN TARIFF PROTECTION IN THE EURO AREA40
This note assesses the impact of tariff reductions in the Euro Area on trading partners’
exports. The tariff cuts considered for this exercise are based on current offers in the
ongoing Doha round, but other countries’ tariffs are held fixed for this analysis in order to
focus on the spillover effects of EA tariff policy. The results indicate that a 50 percent
reduction in EA tariffs would raise global exports to the EA by more than 1 percent.
A partial-equilibrium model of international trade is used to assess the likely impact of
a reduction in tariff protection in Euro Area (EA) countries on trading partners. The
model consists of a large number of exporting countries. Each exporter decides how much to
sell to the rest of the world based on the net-of-tariff price received by exporting to a
particular importing region. In each importing region, the demand for imports from a given
exporting country depends on the price of imports (inclusive of the tariff) from a particular
exporter, as well as the tariff-inclusive price of imports from other, competing exporters. In
equilibrium, the quantity of exports from a given country must equal the quantity of imports
demanded by an importing region.
The model is used to simulate the impact of tariff reductions being considered under the
Doha Round. Specifically, the model assesses the impact of a 50 percent reduction in tradeweighted average tariff rates applied by EA countries on exports and real GDP in
155 exporting countries.41 Tariff rates applied by importers in the rest of the world are
assumed to remain unchanged.42

This is the average reduction in EU tariffs used by Laborde, D., W. Martin, and D. van der Mensbrugghe,
(2010), “Implications of the 2008 Doha Draft Agricultural and Non-agricultural Market Access Modalities for
Developing Countries,” Washington: World Bank, to assess the likely impact of the December 2008 draft
modalities being considered in the Doha Round.

The 11 EU member countries that do not use the euro were excluded from this analysis due to likely
conflicting effects on exports and GDP. On the negative side, these 11 EU countries would suffer from relative
preference erosion under the proposed EU-wide tariff reductions. However they could benefit indirectly from
their own reduced tariff rates.

Preliminary estimates suggest that a 50 percent reduction in average tariff rates by EA
countries would result in an increase in aggregate exports to the area by more than
1 percent, (Figure 2). Overall, export volume to the EA would increase the most for
countries that currently face the highest tariff rates in the EA, such as China, Pakistan, Brazil,
Vietnam, New Zealand, and Australia. The majority of countries would experience an
increase in export volume to the EA. For these countries, export volume declines to the rest
of the world, as tariff rates there remain unchanged, but aggregate export volume increases.
Countries with relatively large export shares to the EA would experience the largest growth
increase.
However, some countries would end up exporting less to the EA following such a
unilateral tariff reduction because of preference erosion. The latter is due to the
“Everything But Arms” (EBA) initiative of the European Union (EU), which allows exports
from 49 developing economies to enter the EU duty free and quota free.43 As a consequence,
43

Countries eligible under the EBA are: Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Djibouti, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti,
Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger,
Rwanda, Samoa, São Tomé and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania,
Tuvalu, Togo, Uganda, Vanuatu, Yemen, and Zambia. Only 43 of these countries are included in the model, due
to data limitations.

36
if the EA countries were to reduce their most-favored nation (MFN) tariff rates, the margin of
preference enjoyed by the EBA countries in the EU market would become smaller or
“eroded.” In addition, export volume from 16 countries that are not eligible for preferences
under the EBA would decline, as these countries have a preferential trade agreement with EU
countries or face tariff rates that are below MFN rates.44 These negative impacts should not,
however, be exaggerated as in practice nearly all EU trading partners get some sort of
preference in the EU market, reducing the “effective” preference margins for many LICs.
Also, due to the bureaucratic hurdles of complying with EU rules of origin, exporters are
discouraged from claiming preferences on a substantial proportion of products. Finally, many
LICs will benefit from the sharper cuts under Doha for items such as agricultural products
and textiles.

Even though exports from a given country to the EA might decline, real GDP in that country could rise,
depending on whether exports to other markets rise and the relative importance of exports to different
destinations, as can be seen by comparing Figures 2 and 3.
