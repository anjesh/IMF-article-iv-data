MONGOLIA
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Post-Program Monitoring
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Approved by Nigel Chalk and James Roaf
March 1, 2011
Context. An 18-month Stand-By Arrangement was successfully completed in October 2010. The
economy is growing robustly and mineral exports are booming. However, a highly expansionary 2011
budget has put the recovery at risk of overheating. Inflation ended last year at 14 percent and could
reach 20 percent later this year. Surging export receipts helped push international reserves to an all
time high and also fueled a sharp appreciation of the real exchange rate last year. Elections are set for
June 2012.
Summary. The discussions focused on the following:


Fiscal spending. The 2011 budget increased spending by nearly 7 percent of GDP more than the
authorities’ commitment under the Stand-By Arrangement. The budget represents a return to the
boom-bust fiscal policies of the past, threatening macro-stability and fueling inflation. This
combination of policies will take an especially hard toll on the poor. Staff advised amending the
budget to substantially reduce spending.



Monetary policy. The central bank can only do so much to counteract the inflationary pressures
arising from fiscal policy. Nevertheless, staff advised it should actively use the tools at its
disposal, starting with an increase in interest rates.



Exchange rate policy. There was agreement that the flexible exchange rate regime is working
well and should be continued.



Medium-term policies. With two large mining projects in the pipeline, a substantial increase in
mineral exports is projected for the coming years. This mineral wealth, however, will only lead
to lasting prosperity if accompanied by sound macro-economic management, including strictly
adhering to the Fiscal Responsibility Law, gearing monetary policy toward containing inflation,
and safeguarding the banking system.

Discussions. A staff team visited Ulaanbaatar, January 20–February 1, 2011, consisting of S. Barnett
(Head), Y. Ojima (APD), S. Park (FAD), F. Ramirez (APD), and P. Ramlogan (Resident
Representative).

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Context. The Mongolian economy was hit hard by the global economic crisis, due to
its high dependence on mineral exports and a history of pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies.
By early 2009, the economy was on the verge of collapse: the central bank was running out
of international reserves, the budget deficit was not financed, inflation was in the double
digits, and the banking system was under stress. An 18-month Stand-by Arrangement (SBA)
was approved on April 1, 2009, which succeeded in quickly stabilizing the economy thanks
to the authorities’ steadfast policy implementation, financial support from the donor
community, and a rebound in global copper prices.
2.
Past advice. The authorities have a mixed record with implementing past advice.
Fiscal policy in 2010 was prudent, the central bank maintained a flexible exchange rate
regime, a landmark Fiscal Responsibility Law was passed, and the SBA was successfully
completed. In contrast, the 2011 budget increased spending sharply, a targeted poverty
benefit has not been introduced, and a bank restructuring program is not in place.

prices and a rapid increase in coal
production are fueling strong export growth that has helped boost international reserves to an
all-time high.
4.
Outlook. Growth this year is projected to remain strong and accelerate to around
10 percent. The large increase in fiscal spending underway, however, is creating excess
demand that will result in higher inflation and surging imports. Inflation could reach some
20 percent by year-end (Figure 1). The medium-term outlook is favorable, as production
from Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi (a large coal project) is expected to start by 2013.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Fiscal policy is being loosened considerably in 2011, fueling inflation and signaling a return
to boom-bust policies. Plans to open a development bank and once again permit government
guarantees pose additional fiscal risks.

Fiscal policy. The government adopted a 2011 budget that substantially increased
spending (by nearly 7 percent of GDP) relative to their commitment in the SBA. In order to
fulfill a campaign promise, universal cash transfers are being increased by some 4 percent of
GDP relative to 2010. Staff argued that the budget will prove costly to the economy by
leading to higher inflation that is especially hard on the poor, driving up imports, and
ultimately squeezing the private sector. The authorities agreed that the budget was risky, but
highlighted the political necessity of fulfilling their campaign promise. The underlying fiscal
position will deteriorate significantly in 2011. Nominal spending, which already accounts for
more than 60 percent of non-mineral GDP, is set to increase by some 35 percent. In addition,
the welcome replacement of the windfall profits tax with a less burdensome resource tax
regime will reduce revenue by some 3½–4 percent of GDP.

6.
Fiscal Responsibility Law. There was agreement on the importance of strictly
adhering to the landmark Fiscal Responsibility Law adopted last summer. Unfortunately, the
2011 budget was inconsistent with the spirit as well as the letter of the law (since, as required
by law, it was not in line with the medium-term fiscal framework that was submitted to
parliament). The authorities, however, underscored their commitment to the Fiscal
Responsibility Law and emphasized that they would fully comply with the law’s numerical
targets that take effect in 2013. They were prepared to exercise the necessary expenditure
restraint, and noted that by simply scaling back the universal cash transfers—which are set to
expire after the 2012 elections—they could achieve the needed adjustment. Consistent with
this, staff fiscal projections assume that spending is sufficiently restrained in 2012–13 to
meet the 2013 structural deficit target in the Fiscal Responsibility Law. More broadly, there
was agreement that the Fiscal Responsibility Law would provide a welcome anchor for fiscal
policy over the medium term.
7.
Fiscal risks. The authorities are planning to end the ban on government guarantees,
start implementing public-private partnerships (PPPs), and establish a development bank.
Staff emphasized that these tools should not be used as a vehicle to circumvent the Fiscal
Responsibility Law and highlighted how their use could increase fiscal risks, create large
contingent liabilities, and reduce transparency. The authorities understood these risks, are

7
cooperating with donors to follow international good practices, and would proceed prudently
by, for example, fully reporting all government guarantees as part of the government debt
stock.
8.
Structural fiscal reforms. There was agreement on the benefits of introducing a
targeted poverty benefit to strengthen the social safety net, increase fiscal flexibility, and
replace the inefficient system of universal transfers. With some one-third of Mongolians’
living in poverty, it is essential to have a well-functioning targeted benefit in place. The
authorities, with support from the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, are working to
forge the parliamentary consensus needed to pass the social transfer reform law that was
submitted last summer. The authorities also aim to adopt a modern integrated budget law this
year—FAD and the World Bank have provided technical assistance—that would provide a
new financial framework for intergovernmental relations, direct central government budget
planning towards a medium-term and programmatic orientation, outline a new public
investment planning and budgeting process with clear responsibilities among agencies, and
provide greater flexibility for line ministries and agencies in implementation of their budgets.
In addition, the authorities have made progress in strengthening the large taxpayers’ office
and are committed to press ahead with these reforms, including further increasing the office’s
staffing with the aim to improve taxpayer services and increase revenue collection efficiency.
Some parliamentarians are pushing to replace or weaken the VAT. Staff discussed the
benefits of the VAT and emphasized that increasing exemptions or otherwise using the VAT
to target preferred sectors would prove to be highly inefficient—as well as ineffective—yet
come with the costs of substantially complicating tax administration and risking revenue
leakage.
9.
Debt sustainability analysis. The updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
concludes that Mongolia continues to be classified as low risk of debt distress. Mongolia has
a strong capacity to repay the Fund, as supported by the DSA, the favorable medium-term
growth prospects, and projections of a continued rise in international reserves.
The central bank has not adjusted interest rates, even though inflation is already high and, as
a result of the 2011 budget, price pressures are building. The flexible exchange rate,
meanwhile, continues to work well and has helped tighten monetary conditions.
10.
Inflation. Inflation has remained in the
double digits for the past few months and is
becoming more broad-based. Price pressures are
likely to continue given strong demand, the
30 percent increase in pensions and civil servant
wages implemented in October, and the large
increase in budget spending planned for this
year. On top of this, rising global and Chinese
food prices, signs of resurgent credit growth, and
the booming mineral sector would all add to

8
pressures. Staff projects that without scaling back budget spending, inflation would surpass
20 percent later this year. The authorities agreed that such a rise in inflation would impose
significant economic and social costs, which fall disproportionately on the poor, but the
central bank highlighted that there were limits to how much monetary policy could do to
offset the fiscal impulse.
11.
Monetary policy. The central bank
policy rate has not been increased in line with
the outlook for higher inflation, partly reflecting
the public pressure for lower interest rates to
help boost credit (Box 1). Staff argued that
monetary policy has been too passive and a
tightening was called for, starting with an
immediate hike in interest rates, especially as the
policy interest rate is negative in real terms. The
central bank was hopeful that it could contain
inflation pressures and would continue to watch
incoming data to determine its next steps. There was agreement on the benefits of moving to
a monetary policy regime with a more explicit focus on inflation, as the authorities plan to do
in the medium term.
12.
Exchange rate policy. The authorities remain committed to the flexible exchange rate
regime, which has been working well over the past two years. There was agreement that
intervention is necessary given the large and lumpy nature of foreign exchange inflows and
the relatively thin interbank market. The foreign currency auction system has provided an
effective means for central bank intervention and the authorities are now considering reforms
that would help to better develop the interbank market. The nominal appreciation which took
place in 2010 was also helpful in tightening monetary conditions and reducing inflation by
allowing the adjustment in the real exchange rate to feed through the nominal exchange rate
instead of prices (Box 2). The depreciation late last year was due in part to seasonal factors
and the exchange rate has been fairly stable this year and the central bank has intervened
sparingly.
13.
Real exchange rate. Compared to many other resource dependent economies,
Mongolia experienced relatively more real appreciation of the currency over the past five
years, with the adjustment coming largely through inflation (Figure 3). The appreciation last
year, moreover, was particularly sharp and the authorities understood the challenges this
posed for the competitiveness and development of the non-mineral economy. They aim to
pursue macroeconomic and structural policies that create an environment conducive to
private sector development, including by smoothing the real exchange rate adjustment by
restraining fiscal spending (per the Fiscal Responsibility Law), substantially improving
infrastructure, and building up human capital. With the caveat that it is difficult to assess the

Is output growing faster than potential?
Measuring the output gap in Mongolia is
challenging given data shortcomings, the
volatility of output, structural changes, and the
seemingly large role for supply shocks. With
those caveats, the Blanchard-Quah method, which
links the output gap directly with inflation,
appears to perform better than standard filters.1
According to this measure, the output gap, though
negative at the end of last year, is projected to rise
significantly in 2011.

Does food inflation reflect demand or supply shocks? Food prices are a key driver of inflation,
and clearly the severe winter and rising global and Chinese food prices are behind a good part
of the current food inflation. However, econometric evidence finds that demand factors also
play a role. Specifically, spending on social transfers is found to increase food prices and that
the increase in universal transfers planned for 2011 could push up food prices by as much
as10 percentage points.
Are interest rates already too high? Interest rates
in Mongolia are structurally high reflecting
weaknesses in the banking system (as exemplified
by high U.S. dollar interest rates) and inflation
volatility. Thus, the best way to redress this is
through reducing inflation volatility and
strengthening the banking system. Moreover, the
policy rate is negative in real terms (inflation was
14 percent in December a full 3 percentage points
above the prevailing policy rate).
Higher interest rates would attract more capital
inflows? This is a possibility, but at the moment
there are no signs of widespread speculative
inflows. For example, the loan to deposit ratio in
foreign currency is falling (suggesting that agents
are not shorting the U.S. dollar via domestic
banks) and the exchange rate has been fairly stable
the last few months during a period when
intervention was minimal.

Box 2. Mongolia––General Equilibrium Model: Simulating a Mineral Boom
The Gleaneagles model of scaling up aid is used to simulate a mineral boom.1 Export earnings
in Mongolia are set to increase rapidly when the Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi mines start
production in a few years. A large increase in foreign currency earnings, whether from scaling
up aid or exports, will have similar economic effects that, in turn, depend on fiscal and
monetary policies. The model helps illustrate the impact of the export boom, but the
quantitative findings should be discounted as available research makes it difficult to caliberate
the deep parameters more specifically to Mongolia.
The model looks at an increase in government spending financed by fiscal revenue from a
surge in mineral exports. The first simulations examine central bank sterilization and find:

A second simulation looks at how the composition of fiscal spending. In particular, a scenario
based on the increase in spending in the 2011 budget, which is tilted to cash transfers, is
compared to one where a larger share of spending is on public capital expenditure
(“Benchmark” in text figure). The main conclusion is:


Tilting fiscal spending toward capital
expenditure would yield higher growth.
This derives from the model’s inclusion
of public capital as input to production. In
the end, though, it is not public spending
on capital that matters but rather how that
spending is turned into productive public
capital, which depends on the strength of
governance, project selection, and
procurement practices.

real exchange with such major structural transformations taking place, application of the
CGER toolkit suggests that the real exchange
rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. The current account, which had a
sizeable deficit last year due to mining related
imports, is expected to move to a considerable
surplus over the medium term as exports from
the new mines begin. However, for purposes of
the exchange rate assessment, mineral exports
are treated as part of the oil balance and therefore
the currency is not considered to be undervalued
despite the large current account surpluses
projected for 2016.
14.
Multiple currency practices. Mongolia maintains two multiple currency practices
(MCPs) subject to Fund jurisdiction. One arises from the multi-price auction system since
there is no mechanism in place that ensures the exchange rates of accepted bids at the
multi-price auction do not deviate by more than 2 percent from the commercial rates.1 Given
that this MCP is non-discriminatory among IMF members, retained for balance of payment
reasons, and temporary, staff recommends the Executive Board to approve a further
extension of the maintenance by Mongolia of this measure until March 15, 2012, or the next
Article IV consultation, whichever is earlier. The other MCP arises from the official
exchange rate (reference rate), which the government is required to use for its transactions,
because it lacks a mechanism to ensure that the commercial rates and the reference rate do
not deviate by more than 2 percent. Given that the criteria for approval of this MCP are not
present, staff does not recommend Executive Board approval of said measure.
Financial sector reform is moving ahead on some fronts, but the bank restructuring program
has stalled in parliament.
15.
Banking system. Although indicators of
banking system soundness had improved by end2010, these ratios are likely to deteriorate with the
tighter rules on the treatment of lending to related
parties and restructured loans that took effect
January 1. Staff argued that implementation of the
Empowering the Banking Sector and Capital
Support Program would offer a transparent and fair
means of providing temporary government capital
1

The Executive Board approved the multi-price auction MCP until June 22, 2010 (Decision No. 14365 of June
23, 2009), and its further extension until June 22, 2011 or the next Article IV consultation whichever is earlier
(Decision No. 14669 of June 23, 2010).

13
support to any bank that needs time to come into full compliance. The authorities agreed on
the merits of the plan submitted to parliament, but explained that it lacks parliamentary
support. As a second best, the central bank would start bank-by-bank negotiations with any
banks that are out of compliance with prudential requirements and agree to time-bound
restructuring plans. Staff emphasized the importance of strict enforcement of bank
supervision regulations, which means replacing supervisory forbearance with resolute action
to deal with distressed banks. Moreover, staff engaged in detailed discussions with the
authorities as part of a Financial Sector Assessment Program update (see corresponding
Financial System Stability Assessment). The authorities intend to have the budget cover all
bank restructuring costs and reimburse the central bank for expenses already incurred.2
16.
Financial sector reform. The authorities are working to strengthen the financial
system. Planning has begun to replace the blanket deposit guarantee with a deposit insurance
system as market conditions allow. At the same time, the authorities are working to expand
and deepen the non-bank financial sector. This includes plans to strengthen the local equity
market by partnering with a foreign stock exchange, improve the legal environment, and
foster development of the insurance market.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
17.
2011 budget. The large increase in fiscal spending this year will do more economic
harm than good. Any immediate benefits will be dissipated through higher inflation,
crowding out of private sector activity, and faster real exchange rate appreciation. So, in the
end, real household purchasing power could actually go down, imports will surge as they
become cheaper relative to domestically produced goods, and local business will become less
competitive with knock-on effects for investment and employment. International experience
also shows that such high inflation—particularly given its concentration in staple food
items—will have an especially hard impact on the poor whose consumption basket contains a
high share of such foods and who have little means to shield themselves from the impact
inflation has in eroding their real incomes. Therefore, the 2011 budget should be amended to
reduce spending substantially.
18.
Medium-term fiscal framework. A sound fiscal policy is necessary for ensuring that
Mongolia’s mineral wealth leads to lasting prosperity for all Mongolians. In practical terms,
this means managing public spending growth in a way that (i) helps smooth economic growth
(through a counter-cyclical fiscal policy); (ii) leaves room for the private sector to thrive; and
(iii) provides buffers to insulate the budget—and the economy—against a downturn in global
commodity prices. The adoption of the Fiscal Responsibility Law last year was a landmark
achievement in this regard. However, the 2011 budget is a big step backwards. The Fiscal
2

The costs of resolving the two intervened banks are included in the fiscal projections, but, in contrast to
previous staff reports, in line with the authorities’ plans, the staff projections no longer include any additional
costs for bank restructuring.

14
Responsibility Law will succeed only if it is strictly adhered to in letter and spirit; failure to
do so will undermine its credibility and limits its effectiveness in preventing a recurrence of
the policy driven, boom-bust cycles that Mongolia has experienced in the past. Compliance
will entail expenditure restraint in the coming years, for example, by keeping spending
roughly frozen in real terms in order to reach the 2013 structural deficit target. Moreover, it is
equally important not to circumvent the law by using off-budget vehicles or government
guarantees that would, in effect, undo the economic benefits of adhering to the law and come
with the additional costs of an increase in fiscal risks and a loss of transparency. The
Development Bank, public-private partnerships, and public guarantees are sources of such
quasi-fiscal risk and, if such operations are to proceed, need to be managed prudently and in
line with international good practices.
19.
Structural fiscal reforms. The efforts underway to advance structural fiscal reforms
are welcome and should proceed. A top priority is the introduction of a targeted poverty
benefit, as part of social transfer reform that would help Mongolia’s most vulnerable citizens
and increase fiscal flexibility. Other priority areas include plans to adopt an integrated budget
law and strengthen the large taxpayer office.
20.
Monetary policy. Inflation is already too high, and the substantial increase in fiscal
spending underway will push it up further. There are limits to what monetary policy can
achieve if budget spending this year is not scaled back. Nonetheless, the central bank should
be more proactive in fighting inflation and promptly initiate a tightening cycle, starting with
an up-front hike in interest rates. Inevitably, such a tighter monetary policy stance will lessen
the availability of credit to the private sector and slow private activity. This crowding out of
the private sector, while undesirable, is better than the alternative of allowing inflation
pressures to build up further. However, responsibility for such crowding out lies firmly in the
decision to put in place a very loose fiscal policy that the monetary authorities now need to
offset with the tools at their disposal. This ongoing fight against inflation would be greatly
helped by giving the central bank a more explicit mandate to make inflation the primary
objective of monetary policy.
21.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The expansionary fiscal policy and concomitant need for
a tighter monetary policy is an inefficient policy mix. It results in macroeconomic volatility
and higher inflation. The higher inflation also carries large social costs and it takes an
especially hard toll on those already living in poverty, as the spike in prices reduces their
purchasing power significantly. It also erodes the real value of savings and hurts those on a
fixed income, such as retirees. A better macroeconomic mix would significantly scale back
the increase in government spending this year and thereby reduce the amount of monetary
tightening needed. This mix would result in lower inflation this year and next, a smoother
growth path, lower interest rates, and less real exchange rate appreciation. Outcomes that
would help improve the competitiveness of the local economy and create a better
environment for the private sector.

15
22.
Exchange rate policy. The flexible exchange rate regime has been working well over
the past 1½ years. International reserves are at an all time high, and the nominal exchange
rate has evolved in line with market conditions. The central bank has succeeded in
dampening excess volatility in the exchange rate stemming from large and lumpy foreign
exchange flows, and this intervention strategy remains fully appropriate for the period ahead.
Moreover, the nominal appreciation that took place last year helped to tighten monetary
conditions and reduced the increase in inflation. Looking forward, the flexible exchange rate
regime will continue to be well suited for the Mongolian economy. Specifically, it will help
control inflation, provide a shock absorber against external shocks, and facilitate the real
exchange rate adjustment that is likely to take place over the medium term with the rapid
growth in the mineral sector.
23.
Banking system. A healthy banking system is important for promoting the
development of the private sector. This includes ensuring that entrepreneurs, farmers, and
businesses all have access to credit on reasonable terms while safeguarding depositors’
money through effective supervision and regulation. The recent progress, therefore, in
strengthening the framework for banking supervision is welcome. Now, it is critical to
strictly enforce existing regulations and replace supervisory forbearance with resolute action
against any banks that are not in compliance. In addition, prompt passage of Empowering the
Banking Sector and Capital Support Program should be a top priority.
24.
Medium-term outlook. The Mongolian economy has a bright economic future, as
development of the mineral sector will lead to a substantial growth and an opportunity to
spread prosperity to all Mongolian citizens. Such prosperity, however, is not guaranteed.
Many countries have experienced the “resource curse” which underscores that the risk of
failure is real, and Mongolia’s recent crisis illustrates that the cost of failure is high. Success
will require disciplined macroeconomic policies, including (i) containing fiscal spending
pressures and strictly adhering to the Fiscal Responsibility Law; (ii) gearing monetary policy
toward containing inflation, including by timely adjusting interest rates in line with the
evolving price pressures; (iii) maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime; and (iv)
safeguarding the banking system through strict supervision and enforcement of existing
prudential regulations. Pursuing such a combination of policies would leave Mongolia well
poised to ensure that its mineral wealth translates into strong, sustained, and equitable
growth.
25.
Other. Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the
standard 12-month cycle and extension of the approval of Mongolia’s MCP arising from the
multi-price auction system.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), conducted with
respect to the Stand-by Arrangement approved in April 2009 was finalized on
June 17, 2009. Previous safeguards assessments were completed in March 2002 and
November 2003. The 2009 update assessment found that the BOM has continued to

3

improve its safeguards framework since the 2003 assessment. The BOM’s financial
reporting and audit practices generally comply with international standards. The
assessment made recommendations to (i) strengthen certain aspects of the BOM’s
oversight mechanism, (ii) remove external audit qualifications caused by lack of
access to central bank’s vaults, and (iii) improve the timeliness of audit completion
and publication of the bank’s financial statements. The authorities have since
confirmed that the auditors were granted access to its vaults at end-2009 and end2010, and the timing of audit completion has improved.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:
On May 27, 1993, Mongolia moved from a fixed exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar to a floating exchange rate system. The de jure exchange rate arrangement
is floating. BOM’s official exchange rate is the midpoint of the same days’ average
buying and selling rates of transactions in the interbank market and transactions
between banks and their clients. The official rate is announced each weekday except
for national public holidays, and the BOM reserves the right to intervene in the
foreign exchange market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto
exchange rate arrangement had been changed from a conventional pegged
arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the
revision of the classification methodology. This change reflected only a
methodological modification and did not imply a judgment that there had been a
substantive alteration in the country’s exchange arrangement or other policies. Due to
rapid currency depreciation between October 2008 and February 2009, the exchange
rate arrangement was reclassified to “other managed arrangement” from a stabilized
arrangement as of November 1, 2008. On March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a
foreign exchange auction allowing the determination of the exchange rate mainly by
market forces and therefore, effective March 24, 2009, the de facto exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified to floating. Since 2011, the authorities no longer
disclose the quantity of foreign exchange bought or sold in the auction and just
publish the cut off rate. Mongolia has no explicitly stated specific nominal anchor,
but rather monitors various indicators in conducting monetary policy.
Mongolia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on
February 1, 1996. Mongolia maintains two multiple currency practices (MCPs)
subject to Fund jurisdiction. First, the modalities of the multi-price auction system
give rise to an MCP since there is no mechanism in place that ensures that exchange
rates of accepted bids at the multi-price auction do not deviate by more than
2 percent. The Executive Board approved the multi-price auction MCP until June 22,
2010 (Decision No. 14365 of June 23, 2009), and its further extension until June 22,
2011 or the next Article IV consultation whichever is earlier (Decision No. 14669 of
June 23, 2010). Staff recommends the Executive Board to approve a further extension

4
of the maintenance by Mongolia of this measure until March 15, 2012, or the next
Article IV consultation, whichever is earlier. In addition, Mongolia has an official
exchange rate (reference rate) that is mandatorily used for government transactions
(as opposed to the commercial market rate). Therefore, by way of official action, the
authorities have created a market segmentation. While the recently approved Order
No. 699 of the Central Bank of Mongolia sets forth that the reference rate is
determined based on the weighted average of market rates used from 4 PM of the
previous day to 4 PM of the current day, staff is of the view that this Order does not
eliminate the market segmentation and the multiplicity of effective rates arising from
it. Accordingly, in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that the commercial rates
and the reference rate do not deviate by more than 2 percent, the way the reference
rate is used in government transaction gives rise to an MCP subject to Fund approval.
Since the criteria for approval of this MCP are not in place, it remains unapproved.
Mongolia imposes exchange restrictions for security reasons in accordance with
United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 92/757 concerning certain
transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) that
have been notified to the Fund under Decision 144 (11/4/94).
IX.

Article IV Consultation:
The 2009 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 10/52) was concluded by
the Executive Board on December 22, 2009. Mongolia is on a 12–month cycle.

Recent Financial Arrangements:
An 18- month Stand-by Arrangement in an amount of equivalent to
SDR 153.3 million (300 percent of quota) was approved on April 1, 2009. Following
the first review completed on June 23, 2009, the second on September 21, 2009, the
third on December 22, 2009, the fourth on March 19, 2010, and the combined fifth
and sixth on September 8, 2010, the program was successfully completed on
October 1, 2010.
A three-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
in an amount equivalent to SDR 40.81 million (80 percent of quota), with a first
annual arrangement in an amount of SDR 18.55 million (36.3 percent of quota), was

5
approved on June 25, 1993. The second annual arrangement in an amount of
SDR 11.13 million (21.8 percent of quota) was approved on November 23, 1994. The
ESAF arrangement lapsed on June 24, 1996.
A three-year arrangement under the ESAF/PRGF in an amount equivalent to
SDR 33.4 million (65.4 percent of quota), with a first annual arrangement in an
amount of SDR 11.13 million (21.8 percent of quota), was approved by the Executive
Board on July 30, 1997. The first year arrangement lapsed on July 30, 1998. The
second annual arrangement of SDR 14.8 million (29 percent of quota) was approved
on June 16, 1999. The first review under that arrangement was completed in
January 2000 and the arrangement lapsed on June 15, 2000. The ESAF/PRGF
arrangement lapsed on July 29, 2000.
A three-year arrangement under the PRGF in an amount equivalent to
SDR 28.49 million (55.8 percent of quota), with the first year of the arrangement in
an amount of SDR 12.21 million (23.9 percent of quota), was approved by the
Executive Board on September 28, 2001. The first and second review under the
PRGF was completed on September 12, 2003, and the Executive Board approved the
extension of the PRGF through July 31, 2005. The arrangement expired on that date
without the completion of the third and subsequent reviews.

ANNEX II. MONGOLIA––WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Bank and the Fund country teams led by Mr. Rogier van den Brink (Lead
Economist, EASPR) and Mr. Steven Barnett (Mission Chief to Mongolia) maintain a
close working relationship and have an ongoing dialog on a range of macroeconomic and
structural issues.
2.
The level of cooperation and coordination is exemplary in many respects and
includes the following:


Stand-by Arrangement. The World Bank participated in virtually all the negotiating
missions’ meetings with the authorities. This facilitated the discussions, especially as
regards policies in areas of mutual interest such as bank restructuring, social welfare
reform, and fiscal policy. The teams have also jointly participated in media events.



Development Policy Credits. In turn, the IMF participated in the design and review
of the Bank’s Development Policy Credits. For instance, the IMF Mission Chiefs
were peer reviewers for the two Mongolia Development Policy Credits.



Economic updates. Fund staff regularly contributed text boxes to the World Bank
Monthly Updates. These are public documents that inform the public about recent
economic trends and selected topics. The Updates are an important tool to improve
the public’s understanding of the economic situation and the rationale of the
government’s policy reforms, thus helping to forge consensus around the policy
reform agenda.



Bank restructuring. Both the World Bank and Fund country teams have been active
in this area, including fielding numerous technical assistance missions. The teams
coordinated closely to provide the authorities with consistent advice while avoiding
unnecessary duplication of efforts. These efforts helped the authorities in passing a
new Banking Law, adopting new banking regulations, strengthening supervision, and
drafting the Banking Sector and Capital Support Program that was submitted to
parliament in August 2010. The two teams have also worked to help educate the
public and parliamentarians on the banking sector issues in an effort to build support
for reform.



Structural fiscal reforms. Fund staff and the World Bank team have worked
together successfully to provide technical assistance in expenditure management, the
recently adopted Fiscal Responsibility Law, and taxation of the mineral sector. This
included participation of World Bank staff in FAD technical assistance missions, and
FAD backstopping of a World Bank financed long-term advisor. The efforts also
include a broad outreach effort to the public and parliamentarians, including several
workshops jointly organized by the World Bank and the IMF in DC for government
officials and parliamentarians, and a high-level workshop in Mongolia attended by
about one-half of parliament.

9

3.
Based on the above intensive partnership, the Bank and the Fund share a
common view about Mongolia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These
include:


Promoting long-term growth. Managing the mineral wealth to ensure strong,
sustainable, and equitable growth with low inflation. This includes the importance of
avoiding the “resource curse” and minimizing “Dutch disease” effects.



Sustaining the recovery. This includes ensuring that the boom-bust policies of the
past are not repeated. The recently adopted Fiscal Responsibility Law is a key step,
and it is critical that it be strictly adhered to. At the same time, fiscal policy also has
to be mindful of the macroeconomic policy mix and not over-burden monetary
policy.



Monetary policy. The central bank should continue to gear monetary policy to
controlling inflation. The flexible exchange rate regime is working well and should
also be maintained. Monetary and exchange rate policy could be strengthened by
giving the central bank more independence.



Protecting the poor. Introduction of a targeted poverty benefit remains a priority and
would be a big step forward in strengthening the social safety net and increasing
fiscal flexibility.



Strengthening the banking system. Key steps include passage and implementation
of the bank restructuring program, continued improvement in bank regulation and
supervision, and eventual introduction of deposit insurance to replace the blanket
guarantee.

4.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Appendix I
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period
September 2010–August 2011 along with their expected deliveries. It was also agreed that
further details on collaboration, as necessary, would be agreed at the technical level as work
progresses.

ANNEX III. MONGOLIA––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1

Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in February 1991. In
line with AsDB’s poverty reduction strategy, AsDB entered into a Poverty Partnership
Agreement (PPA) with the Government of Mongolia in 2000. Within the framework of the
PPA, in October 2005, AsDB formulated its Country Strategy and Program for 2006−08. The
2006–08 country strategy and program focused on support for stable broad-based economic
growth and inclusive social development. Currently AsDB is working on preparation of the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) through 2015.
AsDB has been a leading development partner in Mongolia, which is eligible for, and
borrows from AsDB's concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. AsDB
allocates its concessional special fund resources to eligible member countries, including
Mongolia, based on an annual country performance assessment. The assessment focuses on
indicators of sustainable economic growth, socially inclusive development, governance and
public sector management, and portfolio performance.
AsDB has provided loans for 37 projects totaling $734.7 million in the agriculture, education,
energy, financial, health, industry, telecommunications, transport, and urban development
sectors as of December 15, 2010. AsDB also has an active technical assistance (TA) portfolio
consisted of 25 TA projects totaling $23.4 million and 11 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction
(JFPR) projects totaling $24.79 million as of December 15, 2010.
Mongolia became eligible for ADF grant financing for the period 2007–10. Twelve grant
projects/programs, totaling $169.7 million, have been approved as of December15, 2010. The
total active loan and grant portfolio as of December 15, 2010 consists of 8 loans amounting
to a net total of $182.6 million and 12 grants totaling $156.2 million.
All of the ongoing AsDB projects are expected to achieve their development outcomes. A
total of 30 projects were completed and closed as of December 31, 2009. Of the 25 project
completion reports, 8 of these have been rated as generally or highly successful, 10 as
successful, 5 as partly successful, and one as unsuccessful; one had no rating. Project
performance evaluations were conducted by AsDB’s Independent Evaluation Department for
16 projects during 1996–2009. Out of these 16 projects, 3 were rated as highly successful,
7 as successful and 6 as partly successful.
Since late 2008, AsDB has worked with the government to formulate a response to the global
economic crisis, in close cooperation with other development partners. When the economic

12

crisis struck, a new CPS covering the period 2009–13 was at an advanced stage of
preparation. AsDB and the government agreed to postpone finalization of the CPS until the
economy had stabilized and implementation of the government's medium-term plans
resumed. Instead, the Country Operations Business Plan 2009–12 was prepared, which is
specifically designed to address challenges posed by Mongolia's deteriorating economic
environment.
A Social Sector Support Program (SSSP) was approved by AsDB on June 24, 2009 and has
been effective since 15 July 2009. The SSSP aims at protecting the poor during the financial
crisis by implementing a set of policy measures in the social welfare, health, and education
sectors to provide essential social services, and to initiate longer-term reforms to improve the
targeting of social assistance and living conditions of the poor, especially in ger areas of
Ulaanbaatar. The Program is co-financed by AsDB and JICA. AsDB released its first tranche
of $40 million in July 2009. The second tranche is pending subject to passage of the social
welfare law and completion of the nationwide identification of poor households through the
proxy means test.
A total lending program of $530 million for the initial period of 2010–13 is envisaged, of
which $200 million would be provided from ADF resources and $184 million provided from
OCR financing subject to Mongolia’s reclassification from Group A to B, resource
availability, access to regional ADF allocation and country-performance based allocation. An
average of $6 million in TA resources is expected to be provided annually.

ANNEX IV. MONGOLIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of January 31, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance. The priority areas for
improvement are national accounts and government finance statistics.
National Accounts: The national accounts statistics compiled by the National Statistics Office (NSO) are
broadly in line with the guidelines of the 1993 SNA. They have improved the quality of national accounts
data, but weaknesses remain, including in the estimation of capital formation, estimation of GDP price
deflators, and coverage of the informal sector and small-scale activity (especially in the services sector). The
compilation of constant price expenditure-based national accounts, in line with the pilot done in 2008, would
serve as a useful check for the production side estimates. NSO plans to disseminate annual expenditurebased GDP series in value terms and to pilot quarterly estimates of GDP by expenditure in 2011.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) was rebased in January 2008 with expenditure-derived
weights from the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. NSO has published a national CPI for
Ulaanbaatar and 21 aimags (provinces) since January 2008, and a housing price index since October 2008.
Priority areas for improvement are data on wages and earnings. NSO plans to disseminate a producer price
index and a retail price index in 2011.
External Sector Statistics: The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) follows the concepts and methods in the Balance
of Payment Manual fifth edition and is expected to begin implementing the recommendations of the sixth
edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in 2012. The
BOM disseminates the data according to the IMF standard presentation table. The coverage of the balance of
payments statistics has been broadened by extending the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS)
to nonbank financial institutions and by increasing the number of direct reporting private enterprises.
Priorities for improvement are in the analysis of balance of payments and the quarterly survey of foreign
investment enterprises. The BOM compiled an experimental International Investment Position (IIP) for
2007, and plans to publish IIP in 2011.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: BOM’s monetary and financial statistics conform to the concepts and
definitions of the MFSM methodology as the authorities implemented recommendations of the June 2008
and September 2009 missions. In particular, the monetary data were improved by the proper classification of
repurchase agreements, accrued interest, and financial derivatives. The coverage of monetary statistics was
expanded beginning in February 2010 to include data of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCs) that
collect deposits and since May 2010 data for other financial corporations (NBFIs) have been disseminated
in the BOM monthly statistical bulletin. The September 2009 mission also provided recommendations to
reconcile the BOM and the Ministry of Finance data on government financing, and finalized the
standardized report forms for the data of the BOM and other depository corporations in International
Financial Statistics beginning in November 2009.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used to compile fiscal statistics generally
follow the guidelines of the GFSM 1986. The classifications used for sub-annual and annual fiscal statistics
also follow broadly its classifications. No formal decision has yet been taken on adopting a migration path to
the GFSM 2001 methodology, but Mongolia has over several years availed itself on training, TA, and thus
no substantial problems for achieving a GFSM 2001 presentation are anticipated
II. Data Standards and Quality
A data ROSC mission visited Mongolia in September 2007
Mongolia participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), and maintains to update the May 2000 assessment of the macroeconomic
statistics, complemented by an assessment of data quality
its efforts to subscribe the Special Data
based on the IMF’s Data Quality Assessment Framework.
Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
The report was published in April 2008.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries1
Approved by Nigel Chalk and James Roaf (IMF)
and Jeffrey Lewis and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
March 1, 2011
Mongolia’s risk of debt distress is low based on indicators of external and public debt.
External and public debt ratios had risen during 2009 due to the government receiving
front-loaded foreign financing to recover from major terms of trade shock in late 2008. With
the economic recovery entrenched and a several large mining projects on the horizon,
external and public debt ratios are projected to improve substantially over the medium term.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)2 update reflects the latest fiscal
developments and new assumptions on the development of the Tavan Tolgoi mine. A
landmark Fiscal Stability Law (FSL)3 was adopted in 2010 and adherence to it will help
anchor fiscal discipline, prevent a repeat of boom-bust fiscal policy, and contribute toward
achieving sustainable growth. Specifically the FSL calls for a 2 percent ceiling on the
structural fiscal deficit, which is defined using smoothed mineral prices (based on a more
1

The DSA has been produced jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in
consultation with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and the Mongolian authorities (Debt Management
Department and Aid Coordination Department of the Ministry of Finance). The fiscal year for Mongolia is
January–December.

2

The DSAs presented in this document are based on the common standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA
framework. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Mongolia is rated as a medium
performer with an average rating of 3.4 between 2007–09, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators
for countries in this category. See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational
Framework and Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and
IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04), “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an
Operational Framework, Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm
and IDA/SECM2004/0629, 9/10/04), and “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income
Countries Post Debt Relief,” (8/11/06).

than 10 year moving average) to calculate revenue, limits expenditure growth, and has a
ceiling on debt (Box 1). The projections also incorporate updated assumptions on
development of Tavan Tolgoi and fiscal projections based on the 2011 budget.

Box 1: Three Ceilings in the FSL


The floor of structural balance is the deficit of 2 percent of GDP. The structural balance is
calculated by using the moving average price of major minerals—currently copper and
coal—over 16 years (past 12 years, current year, and future three years). This provision takes
effect in 2013.



The ceiling of expenditure growth is the non-mineral GDP growth rate, determined as the
greater between its 12-year moving average value and the budget year’s GDP growth rate.
This provision takes effect in 2013.



Net present value of public debt cannot exceed 40 percent of GDP. This excludes any
borrowing in which the government has agreed to contribute into the paid-in capital of a
foreign invested mining entity and which is repayable from the future profits of the entity.4
The provision takes effect from 2014, with a transition period specified for the preceding
years.

commercial banks.

Although no government guarantees arising from public-private partnerships and development banks have yet
been issued, they are required to be treated as part of the public debt stock.

3.
As in the previous DSA, the medium-term macroeconomic outlook remains
bright, although an expansionary fiscal stance for 2011 poses a risk of overheating. The
economy has rebounded considerably since the last DSA, and growth has extended beyond
the mineral sector to become more broad based. The IMF SBA-supported program was
successfully completed on October 1, 2010. The overall fiscal balance recorded a small
surplus at the end of 2010, the first since 2007, and international reserves are at an all time
high. The growth profile has been updated in line with revised production estimates for the
Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine and incorporation of the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine (Box 2).
Government spending and the deficit are set to rise under the 2011 budget passed. The deficit
will be financed through domestic borrowing, and prepayments from Oyu Tolgoi
(US$100 million) and Tavan Tolgoi (yet to be negotiated). A return to fiscal restraint is
expected in 2012 as the budget transitions to the numerical targets set out under the FSL.
4.
This update continues to reflect the fiscalization of banking sector restructuring.
In 2010, the government issued bonds amounting to Tog 100 billion to recapitalize a bank. In
2011, the authorities plan to fiscalize the restructuring cost associated with Anod Bank,
estimated to be around Tog 120 billion. No other costs of bank restructuring are included in
the projections.
5.
During 2010, there have been some important improvements in debt
management. The MoF revised its debt management strategy, developing it as a formal
medium-term strategy for 2010–12, which has been approved by Cabinet and published. In
addition to external audits (including on performance), internal audits have also been
introduced. Other key strengths in debt management include the provision of inputs on debt
and borrowing from the debt management department during budget preparation, a clear
separation between monetary policy and debt management, and information sharing between
the MoF and the central bank. An area for improvement includes making more information
publicly available. A Debt Management Performance Assessment is currently underway.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The baseline assumptions are similar to the previous DSA, but now include
output from Tavan Tolgoi. In particular, the assumptions of a strong institutional
framework and macroeconomic policies to minimize Dutch Disease are maintained (Box 3).
A restrained fiscal policy is projected over the medium to long term, supported by the FSL
adopted in July 2010. As in the previous DSA, the baseline assumes that structural fiscal
reforms including pensions, civil service, social transfers, and public investment management

Box 2. Mongolia—The Tavan Tolgoi Mining Project
Tavan Tolgoi is one of the largest undeveloped coking and thermal coal deposits in the world with
total resources estimated in the range 6.0–6.5 billion tonnes. Development of the deposit, which is
close to the border with China, would make Mongolia a major world coal producer. Initially, its
development will increase equipment imports, FDI, and loan inflows, but soon after it will lead to a
large increase in exports and corresponding improvement in the current account balance.
The deposit was discovered in the 1950s and drilled through the 1960s and 1970s, and during the
economic transition, the area became available for private sector exploration. It was held initially by
BHP but later acquired by Energy Resources LLC, a consortium of top Mongolian companies. In
2006, the government passed amendments to the Mineral Law creating a category of Strategic
Deposits which included Tavan Tolgoi. These same amendments provided for the State to have a
right to take up to 50 percent of any mine developed on deposits discovered using state-funded
exploration.
In March 2008 the government assumed ownership of the majority of the Tavan Tolgoi deposit from
Energy Resources LLC and placed the asset into a state-owned mining company: Erdenes MGL LLC.
In 2009, expressions of interest were sought from major mine developers to take up a 49 percent
interest in the deposit but these were not successful and in early 2010 the government announced that
it would retain 100 percent ownership of the resource, seeking to enter into contract mining
arrangements to develop the mine.
The government plans to develop the deposit initially in two different blocks, each potentially
operating under different contracting arrangements. The first block is to be developed by Erdenes
Tavan Tolgoi LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Erdenes MGL, which will own and market the coal
produced under a fee based contract. It is not clear yet how the infrastructure and working capital for
the development of this first block will be financed. Currently Energy Resources LLC and Tavan
Tolgoi LLC are exporting close to 3 million tonnes per year. Production is expected to quickly ramp
up to over 10 million tonnes per year by 2014.
The second block is planned to be developed under a contract where the developer invests in the mine
infrastructure, markets the coal independently, and provides a share of production to the license
holder. Essentially the government would not have to provide any financing to develop the mine. The
Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy recently stated that selection of this second contractor
would also take into account infrastructure and possible downstream processing issues supporting the
mine development. Key challenges include the completion of a draft contract and the competitive
bidding process.

Box 3. Mongolia—Macroeconomic Assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes that the economy will be underpinned by the
investment in the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine and an expansion in output from the Tavan
Tolgoi coal mine. The construction and exploitation of Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi are expected to
lead to significant structural changes in the economy.


The outlook for real GDP growth is dominated by Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi. The
scaling up of mining will increase mineral GDP and will have significant knock-on effects on
other sectors through a reallocation of resources and changes in relative prices. After
bottoming out at minus 1.3 percent in 2009, real GDP growth hit 6.1 percent in 2010, fueled
by mineral exports notably for copper and coal. Production from the Oyu Tolgoi mine is
expected to start by 2013, while that from Tavan Tolgoi is expected to be gradually scaled up
and to reach full capacity by 2016. GDP growth is expected to rise to over 20 percent in
2013 mainly as Oyu Tolgoi comes on stream and a further boost to GDP is expected when
Tavan Tolgoi reaches full capacity. Real GDP growth is expected to average 13 percent over
the medium term (2013–18), taking into account the impact on the non-mineral economy.



The copper and coal price projections through 2016 are based on the WEO projections as of
December 17, 2010 and are assumed constant in real terms afterwards, but take into account
transportation costs for Mongolia which reduce the price received by the country.



In the near term, with the economy currently operating close to capacity and an expansionary
fiscal stance envisaged for 2011, inflation will rise sharply in the near term. But with
medium-term fiscal sustainability ensured by the FSL, and a tightening of monetary policy, it
is projected to converge to about 5 percent over the long term.



The balance of payments will go through large swings. The current account will remain in a
deficit of around 14 percent in 2011 and 2012 due to large imports of mining-related
investment goods and partly as expansionary fiscal policy feeds into higher non-mineral
sector related imports. Once the Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi projects start producing, the
current account will jump into a large surplus.



The fiscal deficit is expected to converge to the numerical targets specified in the FSL
starting from 2013 (when the structural deficit and spending growth rules take effect).
Fiscal revenues will be boosted by the Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi project and are
expected to reach around 35.5 percent of GDP in 2020. The Fiscal Stability Law will reduce
pro-cyclicality by restraining expenditure growth during periods of high mineral revenues
and enable the authorities to save a substantial fraction of mineral revenues in a Stabilization
Fund to be established in 2011. As a result, the overall balance would gradually converge
from surpluses to around zero by 2030.



Prepayments for budget support from Tavan Tolgoi in 2011 are included, in line with the
2011 budget financing plans. The terms and repayment are assumed identical to those for
Oyu Tolgoi.

6

reforms will contribute to an improved business climate and overall competitiveness of the
economy.5
7.
With Mongolia rapidly moving towards middle-income status, non-concessional
financing will replace concessional lending. As the large mining projects come on stream,
Mongolia is expected to become eligible for non-concessional borrowing from both the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB), which would be phased in starting in 2013. After that point, the grant element of
new external borrowing—as reflected by the grant-equivalent financing component—is
projected to decline from 35 percent in 2011 to 24 percent by 2030.6 Interest rates reflect
International Development Association (IDA) blend terms and AsDB terms for concessional
borrowing and market conditions for commercial loans (although, with global financial
markets still uncertain, present conditions on the international capital markets for low-rated,
first-time issuers may not be favorable).
III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External DSA
8.
Mongolia remains at low risk of debt distress. A brighter medium-term
macroeconomic outlook supported by a big increase in mineral production means that debt
indicators remain below the relevant thresholds.7 This is mainly due to the fact that the
country is undergoing a major structural shift with real GDP growth expected to rise sharply
over the medium term with a concomitant impact on exports and revenues. The debt stock
also falls sharply from 2013 as loan repayments come due, in particular to the Fund. The
present value (PV) of external public debt is forecast to fall from 22.4 percent in 2010 to
6.4 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period.8
5

Note that in contrast to the previous DSA, current mineral GDP estimates are based on more improved
mineral export methodology rather than mineral production estimates.
6

The process for IDA transition begins when a country exceeds its operational per capita income guidelines for
a few years in a row. In Mongolia's case, 2009 was the third year in a row that it exceeded the minimum cutoff.

7

The Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries defines a “low risk of debt distress” when: All debt indicators are well below relevant
country-specific debt-burden thresholds. Stress testing and country-specific alternative scenarios do not result in
indicators significantly breaching thresholds. In case where only one indicator is above its benchmark, judgment
is needed to determine whether there is a debt sustainability problem or some other issues.
8

The debt burden thresholds for medium policy performer are 150, 40, and 250 for the PV of debt in percent of
exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively. Under the same medium policy classification, thresholds for debt
service are 20 percent and 30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively.

7
9.
Stress tests do not indicate any breach of the relevant debt thresholds. Under the
most extreme test—a combination of shocks including real GDP and export growth one-half
of a standard deviation below historical averages in 2011–12—the PV of debt-GDP ratio
climbs to 39 percent in 2012 but then falls back over the remainder of the projection period.
As indicated in the previous DSA, the historical scenario with key variables at their historical
averages is not especially relevant to Mongolia as the country is undergoing a major
structural shift in terms of real GDP growth and current account balance. With the
development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine advancing well, a slight delay in the Tavan Tolgoi mine
reaching full capacity should not significantly impact the risk assessment.
B. Public DSA
10.
Baseline. The public debt ratio peaked in 2009 at just below 50 percent of GDP, and
is projected to fall substantially over the medium term as the budget benefits directly and
indirectly from the increase in mineral output. Debt rose last year, in part, due to loans to the
government from the local subsidiary of the Oyu Tolgoi mining conglomerate to finance the
government’s investment share in Oyu Tolgoi; the 2011 budget plan includes advance
payments from both Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi. The investment share borrowing will be
repaid from expected dividends9 and the prepayments from the general budget. The baseline
includes fiscalization of banking sector restructuring costs through domestic bond issuances,
as described above. As a result, public sector domestic debt service ratios are projected to
increase around 2014 when these payments fall due.
11.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests. Under the most extreme test— GDP growth
in 2011–12 is one standard deviation below its historical average —the PV of debt-GDP ratio
rises from 35 percent in 2010 to 63 percent in 2030. In the near term it is more likely that the
economy will overheat given budgetary spending plans for 2011, but downside risks still
remain relating to volatility in commodity prices. This suggests that, before increased output
and revenues from Oyu Togloi and Tavan Tolgoi materialize, fiscal policy should continue to
adhere to the framework set out in the FSL.
IV. AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
12.
The authorities concurred with the overall assessment. They acknowledged that
the bridging period till revenues from Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi enter the budget
warrants a cautious approach and that fiscal consolidation will be needed. They recognized
that high public debt makes the economy vulnerable to commodity price changes or
financing constraints. At the same time, they also acknowledged that a debt ceiling rule in the
FSL will help prevent excessive borrowing and that adherence to the numerical targets in the
FSL will reinforce the government’s commitment to fiscal sustainability.
9

The government will not be liable for the loan in the unlikely event that dividends are insufficient.

8
V. CONCLUSIONS
13.
The overall assessment has not changed since the last DSA and the external DSA
indicates that Mongolia remains at low risk of external debt distress. Compared to the
previous DSA, the overall medium- to long-term macroeconomic outlook has improved, as
development of Tavan Tolgoi becomes nearer and is thus included in the projections.
However, short-term risks remain, notably the budget remains vulnerable to financing shocks
in the period before increased mining production (2013) and the expansionary 2011 fiscal
stance risks overheating the economy. Meanwhile, public debt ratios are projected to have
peaked last year and then fall steadily over the medium term with the rapid growth in the
economy. They do not lead to a different assessment from external DSA.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 23, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation, Post
Program Monitoring, and Ex Post Evaluation with Mongolia
On March 16, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation, Post Program Monitoring, and Ex Post Evaluation
with Mongolia.1
Background
The Mongolian economy was hit hard by the global economic crisis, due to its high
dependence on mineral exports and a history of pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies. By
early 2009, the economy was on the verge of collapse: the central bank was running out
of international reserves, the budget deficit was not financed, inflation was in the doubledigits, and the banking system was under stress. An 18-month Stand-by Arrangement
(SBA) was approved on April 1, 2009, which succeeded in quickly stabilizing the economy
thanks to the authorities’ steadfast policy implementation, financial support from the donor
community, and a rebound in global copper prices.
Growth rebounded strongly in 2010 and reached 6 percent. This recovery is all the more
impressive in light of the severe winter that led to a sharp contraction in agriculture,
especially animal husbandry. The shock to food supply, however, helped drive inflation
into the double digits for much of the year, led by rising meat prices. Higher copper prices
and a rapid increase in coal production are fueling strong export growth that has helped
boost international reserves to an all-time high.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Growth this year is projected to remain strong and accelerate to around 10 percent. The
large increase in fiscal spending underway, however, is creating excess demand that will
result in higher inflation and surging imports. The medium-term growth prospects continue
to be favorable, as production from two large mining projects is expected to start by 2013
and lead to a substantial increase in output.
In accordance with IMF procedures, the Executive Board also reviewed an Ex Post
Evaluation (EPE) of Mongolia’s experience with the exceptional access Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) approved in April 2009, the first Fund SBA in Asia since the Asian
financial crisis. The EPE focused on program design and implementation, as well as key
lessons from the experience. The report found that the SBA contributed to stabilizing a
rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic situation during the global crisis, as well as facilitating
structural reforms to strengthen the policy framework. Lessons learned include that large
financing packages, combined with appropriately streamlined conditionality, can effectively
stabilize crises; that timely technical assistance can greatly facilitate program
implementation; and that securing a durable commitment to post-program reforms remains
a future challenge.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the turnaround in economic growth following the completion
of the Fund-supported program. Directors observed, however, that pro-cyclical policies are
undermining hard-won macroeconomic stability, and overheating has become a key policy
concern. This calls for fiscal restraint and tightened monetary conditions. Looking ahead,
Directors considered that medium-term prospects are favorable but that a prudent
management of Mongolia’s vast mineral resources is necessary for sustainable growth
and lasting prosperity.
Directors expressed concern that the large increase in fiscal spending envisaged for this
year will further drive up inflation, with an adverse impact on the poor. They called on the
authorities to amend the 2011 budget and cut public spending to bring the fiscal stance
back in line with the cyclical requirements and the medium-term objectives of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. Directors also considered the adoption of a better targeted social
transfer system to be a priority for the period ahead. Noting the potential for large quasifiscal liabilities, they urged caution with the planned establishment of a development bank,
the provision of government guarantees, and the implementation of public-private
partnerships.
Directors saw considerable scope for a more proactive monetary management to curb
inflation, starting with an immediate hike in the policy interest rate. They also generally
supported a move over the medium term toward a monetary framework with a more
explicit focus on inflation. Measures to improve liquidity management and the economy’s
capacity to absorb capital inflows are also necessary.
Directors agreed that the flexible exchange rate regime has worked well. They welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to allow the exchange rate to adjust with market conditions,
noting its benefits in providing a cushion against external shocks and the structural

3
changes underway. Directors encouraged the authorities to remove the remaining multiple
currency practices as soon as conditions permit.
Directors welcomed progress in strengthening financial oversight and implementing the
recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program. They highlighted the
importance of strict enforcement of existing regulations, and looked forward to the
enactment of a law governing the provision of public support for bank restructuring and
recapitalization. Directors also encouraged an early establishment of a deposit insurance
system to replace the blanket deposit guarantee.
Directors concurred with the key messages of the ex post evaluation report. They noted
that the Stand-By Arrangement had helped alleviate the effects of external shocks, by
combining strong policy adjustment and a front-loaded use of Fund resources, catalyzing
donor support for Mongolia. Advances had also been made in structural reforms. Going
forward, Directors urged sustained efforts to complete the reforms initiated under the
program in order to strengthen the resilience of the Mongolian economy. They welcomed
the authorities’ intention to remain closely engaged with the Fund under post-program
monitoring.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Heenam Choi, Alternate Executive Director for Mongolia
and Hoseung Lee, Senior Advisor
March 16, 2011
The Mongolian economy has made a remarkable turnaround fueled by investment in the
mining sector and rebound of copper and coal prices, following a sharp drop in the output in
late 2008 and early 2009. The 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for Mongolia
completed successfully in October 2010. The 2011 Article IV Consultation took place
against the backdrop of such a strong recovery and emerging signs of overheating.
Discussions focused on the policies for avoiding a return to the boom and bust policies of the
past and for ensuring the country’s huge mineral deposits lead to sustainable and equitable
growth. The authorities concede the risks to the outlook and share the staff’s policy advice.
They are trying to respond preemptively to rising inflation and capital inflows through fiscal,
monetary and macro-prudential policy measures accompanied by structural reforms.
Recent Developments
Growth rebounded strongly in 2010 to 6.1 percent, following an outturn of minus 1.3 percent
in 2009. The 2010 growth is a lot more impressive, given the fact that the last year’s
devastating winter conditions (a so-called “dzud”) wiped out almost one-fourth of livestock.
The shock to food supply, however, drove inflation into double digits, with January data
showing a rise in the headline inflation to 14.8 percent year on year, following 14 percent
increase in the previous month. Higher copper prices and surging coal exports to China have
helped boost net international reserves to an all time high.
Outlook
This year’s growth is projected to accelerate to around 10 percent, driven by the construction
of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine and related infrastructure projects, as well as base effects
favorable to agricultural sector, accounting for over 20 percent of GDP. On the inflation
front, the staff expected that inflation could reach 20 percent by year-end due to a
combination of rising global food prices, expansionary 2011 budget, including cash handouts
to the population, and mineral sector boom. On the other hand, the authorities expected that
inflation might remain within 12 to 20 percent range, while they understood the high risks to
inflation. They are planning to update their inflation forecast and adjust the scope and pace of
policy response after confirming the inflation data of early months of 2011. The most
recently released inflation data is 10.9 percent for February on a year on year basis.
Fiscal Policy
1. 2011 Budget. The 2011 budget approved 35 percent increase in nominal spending.
The staff claimed that the large increase in spending would do more economic harm
than good through higher inflation and crowding out private sector activity. The
authorities acknowledge that such an expansion of government expenditures may

2
have negative effects on macroeconomic stability. However, they view that they have
made their efforts to secure medium-term fiscal sustainability under inevitable
political pressure on spending increase, which had largely been incurred by the
promise of the previous election campaign. Furthermore, the authorities are planning
to amend the 2011 budget to secure more fiscal restraint if inflationary risks are
aggravated. They are also committed to meeting the numerical target for structural
budget deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2013. When considering that universal cash
transfers are increased by around 4 percent of GDP in 2011, and that those cash
transfers will be expired after the 2012 elections, they have ample room to achieve
the needed fiscal adjustment.
2. Medium-term Fiscal Framework. The adoption of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL)
last year was a landmark achievement for avoiding the boom and bust policies of the
past. The staff assessed that the 2011 budget could be a big step backward and it
could undermine the law’s credibility. On the other hand, the authorities indicated
that they are still committed to observing the FSL to enhance medium-term fiscal
credibility and sustainability. They have tried to balance the economic and political
considerations under the great pressure to show tangible benefits from the signing of
the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement in the aftermath of the hardship from the crisis.
As shown in Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), Mongolia remains low risk of debt
distress supported by a bright medium and long-term macroeconomic outlook, and
public debt ratios are projected to fall steadily from 2011. In addition, the authorities
have greatly improved debt management through introduction of internal audits, clear
separation between monetary policy and debt management, and information sharing
between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mongolia.
3. Structural Fiscal Reform. Mongolia has made significant progress in improving
budget transparency, but there is still a considerable room for improvement in public
investment management. Several draft laws on public finance issues – the Integrated
Budget Law and the Law on Development Policy and Planning, and a revised Law on
Public Procurement – are under discussion, and implementation of public-privatepartnerships (PPPs) is being considered. The authorities also plan to establish a
Development Bank during this year. The bank will use a portion of the proceeds from
the Fiscal Stability Fund to finance the country’s essential infrastructure needs. The
authorities concur with staff that PPPs and the Development Bank should not be used
as a measure to increase off-budget activities and should be set up based on
international good practices and transparency. On the other hand, the approval of the
Social Transfer Reform Law, which was submitted to the parliament last year, will
substantially strengthen the social safety net through introduction of a more targeted
poverty benefit transfer system.

3
Monetary Policy
Although the Bank of Mongolia well recognizes the threat of escalating inflation, there are
some limits to what monetary policy can contain inflation, given the substantial increase in
fiscal spending and considerable pressure of capital inflows. The staff assessed that the
crowding out effect of higher interest rate, while undesirable, would be better than the
alternative of allowing inflation pressures to build up further. They supported giving the
central bank a more explicit mandate to make inflation the primary objective of monetary
policy. The central bank has sought to strike the right balance between various measures in
its toolkit for combating inflation and managing capital inflows, which includes increasing
reserve requirements of banks, raising the policy rate, and allowing greater exchange rate
flexibility. In its meeting at the end of February, the Bank of Mongolia Board decided to
keep the policy rate unchanged and increase the rate of reserve requirements by 400 basis
points to 9 percent in order to tighten monetary policy stance and strengthen the banking
sector’s risk-resistance.
Exchange Rate Policy
The central bank has been trying to dampen excess volatility in exchange rate stemming from
large and volatile capital inflows. The real appreciation of the Mongolian currency (MNT)
last year was about 20 percent, which was helpful in reducing inflation. The exchange rate
has been fairly stable this year, and foreign reserves have been maintained at an all time high.
The authorities concur with staff that the flexible exchange rate regime will continue to be
appropriate for the Mongolian economy, in terms of containing inflationary pressure and
providing a buffer to external shock. At the same time, they are looking for structural ways to
enhance the absorptive capacity of the economy and harness capital flows to support
productive investment and potential growth through deepening financial markets and
strengthening the institutional framework.
Banking System
Indicators for banking system health have improved and bank loans as a share of GDP has
declined since the 2008 crisis thanks to a strong economic recovery, but NPLs and loans in
arrear still stand high. While real interest rates on deposits are falling, MNT deposits
continue to rise, fuelled by currency appreciation expectations under the blanket deposit
guarantee system which was adopted during the crisis. At the same time interest rates on US
dollar deposits are high, with time deposits offering rates reaching 14 percent, reflecting the
continued perception of risk in the market.
The framework for banking supervision and restructuring has been strengthened as part of
structural benchmarks under the SBA. The authorities are moving ahead with strict
enforcement of prudential regulations against any banks that are not in compliance. A prompt
passage of the Empowering the Banking Sector and Capital Support Program will offer a
transparent means to provide a temporary financial support to the bank that needs time to
come into full compliance. While fully agreeing with the importance of a speedy legislation
to make progress in restructuring banking sector, the authorities admitted that their

4
fragmented decision-making system and the turnaround of economic situation could cause
some delay in executing reform measures.
Medium-term Outlook
The Mongolian economy has a bright economic future, as development of the mineral sector
will lead to a substantial growth and an opportunity to spread benefits from resource wealth
to all Mongolian people, without harmful effect from “Resource Curse”. According to staff’s
projection, per capita income of Mongolia will almost quadruple in 8~10 years, from current
amount of just above US$2,000, based on rapid growth in mining sector and currency
appreciation. Such prosperity, however, is not guaranteed. The Mongolia’s recent crisis
illustrates that so-called “Resource Curse” could not be ruled out. Increasing public
awareness of such risks would be helpful in controlling excess demands from the people and
focusing on macroeconomic stability in the long run.
Conclusion
Although Mongolian economy has succeeded in rapidly recovering from a severe downturn
due to the global financial crisis and the country’s medium-term prospects are much
favorable, the pro-cyclical fiscal stance in the pre-election period and ailing momentum for
institutional reforms are challenging the authorities’ policy framework. The authorities admit
that they have been recently under pressure to increase government spending, when the
build-up fiscal financing constraints were alleviated by higher resource prices and a
substantial payment from a major mining development project. The authorities remain,
however, committed to continue implementing sound macroeconomic policies and a broad
range of structural reforms. They are keenly aware of future opportunities and challenges
from their abundant resource deposit. The Mongolian authorities, therefore, request
continuous engagement and policy advice of the Fund to strengthen macroeconomic stability
and sustain high growth with low inflation for poverty reduction and job creation, with
keeping imminent overheating pressures in check.
