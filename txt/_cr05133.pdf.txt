EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic recovery is underway after a prolonged recession. Growth is supported by more
favorable global economic conditions, an improvement in the security situation, and
appropriate policies, which have involved tightening the fiscal stance and easing monetary
policy somewhat. Real GDP grew by an estimated 4.3 percent in 2004, with exports and
private consumption leading the way. The economy is expected to continue to strengthen,
albeit at a slightly lower growth rate this year. Unemployment remains high, but is on a
declining path. The exchange rate is stable and inflation is low.
Continued fiscal consolidation is essential. The authorities face the difficult task of adhering
to the strategy of reducing the government size and public debt. In order to pay down the
debt faster, the authorities should refrain from unplanned tax cuts should revenue over
perform. Over the medium term the authorities need to strictly observe the deficit target of 3
percent of GDP and limit expenditure growth, in real terms, to no more than 1 percent a year.
The easing of the monetary stance was appropriate, but there is further scope for
strengthening the implementation of monetary policy in the inflation targeting regime. The
authorities should continue to enhance transparency regarding their views about the
inflationary environment and the Bank of Israel law should be updated.
Development of the capital markets should be promoted by a wide range of measures. The
authorities are already in the process of removing barriers to such development. The plan to
require banks to divest themselves of mutual and provident funds could strengthen
competition, but goes against trends elsewhere towards universal banking and entails risks.
Improving the regulatory framework and strengthening supervisory enforcement will hence
need to be an important part of the package.
The authorities’ commitment to boost competition and efficiency have laid the foundations
for future growth and enhanced market confidence. Welfare reform will improve the
functioning of the labor market, privatization will improve competition and market
efficiency, tax reform will increase competitiveness, and pension reform should aid the
development of the capital market.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After nearly three years of depressed activity, growth has rebounded, supported
by a favorable global environment, improvement in the security situation, and
appropriate policies (Box 1). Over the medium term, growth is projected to be around
4 percent, a rate that, by itself, is insufficient to significantly reduce either the high
unemployment rate or the substantial public debt (relative to GDP), both of which
deteriorated substantially during the recession years. The key challenges facing Israel are to
adhere to the ambitious agenda of limiting the fiscal deficit and thereby reducing the size of
the public debt, to further reform the labor market to increase employment, and to carefully
promote the development of the capital markets.
Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal consolidation: During the 2003 Article IV consultation, the Executive Board
considered the 2004 fiscal stance to be broadly appropriate. However, Directors noted
that given the high public debt as a share of GDP it was important that any windfall
revenues be used to lower the deficit and curb the public debt. In the event, the
authorities’ decided to reduce taxes, based on higher revenue collection than budgeted.
Monetary policy: Consistent with the Fund’s recommendation last year, the BoI
continued to gradually lower its policy rate and has taken steps to increase the
transparency of its semi-annual Inflation Report, including by giving more attention to
the dynamics of future inflation.
Structural fiscal reforms: During the 2003 Article IV consultation, Directors stressed
a number of steps that the government should take to enhance the credibility of the
fiscal adjustment process, including the adoption of a medium term spending plan and
semi annual reports on achieving other public finance goals. The authorities are
concerned about loss of budget flexibility, but have agreed in principle to explore these
recommendations further.
Labor market reforms: These are proceeding in line with previous recommendations.
The authorities are in the process of complementing the reduction in welfare benefits
with steps such as increasing job training and education, in order to assist the rapid
absorption of the unemployed and income support recipients in the labor market.
2.
Political uncertainty surrounding the Gaza disengagement plan has altered
the make-up of the coalition government and delayed the approval of the 2005 budget.
In early 2004, Prime Minister Sharon officially presented a plan to withdraw from Gaza.
Although the plan passed in the Knesset by a large margin, some members of the coalition
did not support the plan, forcing PM Sharon to form a new coalition with the Labor party.
While the Knesset approved the 2005 budget on its first reading, uncertainty remains about

-5-

whether the coalition will muster enough support to pass the budget on its final reading. In
the meantime, the government is operating using the 2004 budget framework which allows
1/12 of that budget to be spent each month. If the Knesset fails to pass the budget by
March 31, new elections must be held within 3 months.
II. THE CURRENT SETTING AND OUTLOOK
3.
The upturn in economic activity began in mid 2003 and strengthened in 2004;
the economy grew by an estimated 4.3 percent in 2004 with exports and private
consumption leading the way (Figure 1). Exports surged by 14.6 percent (year-on-year),
led by the rapid growth of high tech exports in an improved global environment and a
rebound in tourism as the security situation improved (Figure 2). Private disposable income
increased with rising employment, pushing up private consumption by 5.2 percent. Despite
these positive signs, fixed investment remains weak, reflecting continued uncertainty about
the global environment as well as the political and security situation, limited construction,
and a low domestic savings rate. Furthermore, unemployment and labor market participation
rates, while responding to the economic recovery and welfare reforms, are still worrisome at
10 and 54.5 percent, respectively.

The recovery has proceeded hand in hand with a consolidation of the fiscal
stance, an easing of monetary policy, and the implementation of key structural reforms.
The government is establishing a credible commitment to maintain future deficits below

-6-

(In millions of NIS)

three percent of GDP and to limit government
expenditure growth, in real terms, to no more
than one percent a year. The 2004 budget deficit
reached 3.9 percent of GDP.2 Although such a
deficit is still relatively high, particularly in light
of the large public sector debt— about
105 percent of GDP—it represents a marked
improvement compared to 2003 when the deficit
was 5.6 percent of GDP. The fiscal effort is
noteworthy because, in large part, it is based on
curtailing government expenditures, which were
estimated to decline by 2.4 percent of GDP
in 2004 (Table 2).

The relaxation of monetary policy continued during the first few months of 2004
and, again, more recently. The BoI continued the gradual reduction of its policy rate,
lowering it from 5.2 percent in December 2003 to 4.1 percent in April 2004. The BoI kept
the rate unchanged for the next six months arguing that inflation expectations were in the
middle of the 1–3 percent target range. However, despite a one-off price increase in April,
CPI inflation in 2004 was close to the lower bound of the inflation target (Figure 3). Subdued
inflation against a background of sheqel appreciation during the second half of the year

The deficit would have been lower, perhaps by an estimated 0.5 percent of GDP, had the government not

While rebalancing their macroeconomic policy mix, the authorities have also
embarked on structural reform policies aimed at boosting competition and efficiency.
Privatization of the national airline (El–Al) and the shipping entity Zim was completed
in 2004, the sale of the third largest bank, Bank Discount, was finalized early this year, and
the government has taken steps towards privatizing the telephone monopoly, ports, oil
refineries, and water and electricity distribution. In addition, pension reform has improved
the solvency of the system and should aid the development of capital markets, and welfare
reform reduced expenditures and decreased distortions in the labor market.
7.
The authorities are in the process of reducing the dominance of the two largest
banks in order to improve the capital market. They have long been concerned that
domination of the financial system by the banks restricts competition and inhibits the capital
market (Box 2). Early in 2004, the government formed a high-level committee to address
these issues (the Bachar committee), and their report was made public late in the year. The
key recommendations include requiring banks to divest themselves of their mutual and
provident fund activities and restrictions on the maximum market share of individual firms.
8.
Most financial soundness
indicators for the banking system
have improved, albeit marginally,
due to the strengthened
macroeconomic environment.
While the quality of banks’ loan
portfolios has yet to improve, we
expect it to strengthen further as the
recovery takes hold.

Box 2. Israel’s Capital Markets
This box provides an overview of the current Israeli financial system, which is dominated by banks that provide
most of the financing for the private sector; while capital markets are relatively undeveloped. The factors that
have inhibited capital market development and the various actions the authorities have taken – and are taking –
to address the situation are also discussed.
The financial system in Israel is highly concentrated among three banks, particularly within the largest
two (Hapoalim and Leumi). By end-2003, the largest three banks (Hapoalim, Leumi and Discount) had
78 percent of bank deposits, managed 80 percent of mutual fund assets and 85 percent of provident fund3 assets,
and dominated the underwriting of new equity issues. More generally, the banking system provides 95 percent
of all financing to the private sector, whether in the form of credit, investments through mutual funds, or the
underwriting of corporate financing.4

The capital markets, particularly the corporate bond and money markets, remain underdeveloped and
unbalanced. The corporate bond market accounts for only 3 percent of GDP (2003), and the size of the money
market is also relatively small. In contrast, a wide variety of non-tradable and tradable government securities
dominate the fixed income markets. Other instruments that are common in other developed markets, such as real
estate investment trusts, municipal bonds, funds of funds, and foreign based mutual funds are largely absent
from the Israeli capital markets. Finally, total market capitalization of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, equivalent
to about 39 percent of GDP, is also small in comparison to other advanced economies (e.g., in recent years, the
equivalent figures were about 110% for France, 60% for Germany; 70% for Italy, 150% for the U.S. and 185%
for the U.K.).
Specific factors appear to have frustrated the development of the Israeli capital markets: First, the extent
of government bonds and the allocation of non-traded real indexed bonds to institutional investors have reduced
the demand for alternative assets and risk management and diverted the supply of institutional savings. Second,
a 35 percent tax on investment in foreign securities made foreign mutual funds relatively unattractive, as has the
requirement that such funds register in Israel and meet local prospectus requirements. Third, Israeli prospectus
requirements more generally may have added high fixed costs that discouraged the development of the corporate
bond market and asset-backed securities. Fourth, legislation did not permit municipal bonds or funds of funds.
Fifth, the rights of participants in REPO transactions are not well defined. Sixth, the bankruptcy law appears
outdated. Finally, high costs associated with the issuance of corporate paper have frustrated a more rapid
development of that important market.

A provident fund is a long term investment, which enjoys tax incentives designed to encourage long term
savings for contingencies such as hospitalization, redundancy and retirement.

The authorities have recently taken actions to remove the barriers to the development of new products
and to enhance the development of capital markets in general.

The pension reform has started a process of reducing the proportion of pension funds held in nontradable government bonds (see table below) and established professional managers for the old and
under-capitalized funds.
The new pension funds that were controlled by the old pension funds were recently sold to insurance
companies and brokerage firms.
The authorities have introduced a new law that clarifies the rules governing market makers for
government bonds. Additionally, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange recently designated one bank to act as a
market maker in foreign currency derivative products.
The authorities are in the process of removing barriers that would simplify and reduce the costs
associated of issuing corporate paper.
The authorities amended important regulatory changes in banking, such as the limit on a bank’s credit
to a single borrower and a directive aimed at improving the management of liquidity risks.
The commission structure for insurance was reformed in a way that introduces greater transparency and
incentives for insurance companies and their agents to sell mutual and provident funds.
The government has proposed legislative and regulatory changes to encourage corporate bonds, short
term commercial paper, foreign funds, funds of funds, real estate investment trusts, exchange traded
funds and other instruments.
The government is putting in place measures designed to encourage customers to switch more readily
between banks.
The authorities are moving towards the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The regulators have shown a determination to enforce the regulatory regime and the requirements
designed to deal with conflicts of interest, in a way that has been successfully achieved elsewhere.
The tax reform of reducing and equalizing the tax rates applied to securities traded abroad with those
traded in Israel, which took effect in January 2005, removes a key obstacle for the entry of foreign
mutual funds.

Indeed, the development of the capital markets appears to have accelerated recently, albeit from a very
small base. The corporate bond market has significantly increased since 2000, with an increase in both issuance
and a shift of institutional investors from non-traded government bonds to corporate bonds. This trend is
particularly apparent at the pension funds where there have been falling share of government bonds and rising
share of corporate bonds.

The sheqel has been relatively stable over the past year, balanced by the drop
in interest rates on the one hand, and the rebound in economic activity on the other
(Figure 4). In principle the exchange rate system in Israel is a crawling peg; in practice the
bands around the peg are sufficiently wide that the system is effectively a float consistent
with the inflation targeting regime the BoI has adopted. Indeed, since 1997, the BOI has not
intervened in the foreign exchange market to influence the exchange rate. This system has

- 10 -

served the country well. Owing largely to the low inflation rate, competitiveness has
improved somewhat as evidenced by a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, and
has remained in line with economic fundamentals. The decline in interest rates prompted
some short-term capital outflows, but these were offset by long-term capital inflows attracted
by the improved outlook. Moreover, the implied volatility of the NIS/US$ exchange rate,
based on the pricing of put and call options, has been low, and Israel’s risk premium, as
measured by the yield spread on its 10 year foreign-currency denominated sovereign bonds,
has remained low at about 75 basis points over U.S. treasuries.6
10.
Key external vulnerability indicators suggest that near-term balance of
payments risks are manageable. The current account remains near balance and the net
external asset position is $12 billion. Foreign reserves—totaling around US$26 billion—
cover 91 percent of gross short-term external debt. About 43 percent of total external public
debt is held by the Jewish Diaspora (33 percent) or backed by U.S. government guarantees
(10 percent), while short-term external public debt is very low at roughly 2 percent of GDP,
all of which mitigate rollover risks.
11.
Israel has taken steps to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers. In 2004, some
tariffs were cut and import licensing requirements were reduced. Tariffs remain for certain
goods, e.g., electronics, wood and agricultural products, but the authorities plan to further
reduce them. Most trade is already covered by bilateral free trade agreements, and additional
free trade agreements with neighboring countries are under consideration.
12.
While there was a consensus between the authorities and the mission that nearand medium-term outlook is favorable, there are several downside risks. After the strong
rebound in 2004, real GDP growth in 2005 is expected to decelerate somewhat to just under
4 percent. In the medium-term, as the labor market situation improves after the reforms of the
recent years and as productivity increases, especially in the newly privatized state
monopolies, growth in the order of 4 percent is expected to be maintained. Barring external
shocks, inflation is expected to remain in the target range, around 2 percent. The fiscal
consolidation in 2005, accompanied by an improvement in the current account, is expected to
continue in 2006, consistent with the fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP. The economy
remains, however, vulnerable to the possibility of a worsening global environment,
especially in the market for high tech exports, political volatility in the region, and a
deterioration of the security situation. Should real interest rates rise, the exchange rate
depreciate rapidly, or real GDP growth slow substantially, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio risks
becoming entrenched at around 110 percent or higher (Table 6), making the fiscal
consolidation all the more difficult.

Recently, the rating agency S&P raised Israel’s country outlook from negative to stable.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions focused on four main areas: fiscal policy, the planned reform of the
capital market, monetary policy, and the labor market. The mission shared the
authorities’ view that that fiscal consolidation was essential as was the authorities’ ambitious
structural reform agenda. Staff was more concerned than the authorities about the high level
of public sector debt and suggested that the authorities refrain from unplanned tax cuts. On
promoting capital market development, the discussions focused on the various steps
underway and planned, especially the need to strengthen regulation and improve enforcement
if the authorities proceed as planned with the divestiture of mutual and provident funds from
the banks. Staff welcomed the easing of monetary policy and urged the authorities to
continue to develop their inflation forecasting tools and enhance transparency regarding their
views about the inflationary environment. Finally, both staff and the authorities agreed that
the welfare reform had contributed to the recent improvement in the labor market and that
active labor market policies could help absorb some of the unemployed.
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
The authorities stressed their determination to continue to reduce the size of the
public sector, the tax burden, and the welfare system. The Minister of Finance described
Israel’s economy as trapped between high taxation, a generous welfare system, and strong
state monopolies. As a consequence, the private sector is being suffocated. To reverse that
trend, the government has embarked on a series of fiscal and structural reforms aimed at
reducing the public sector and its drag on private sector growth.
15.
The authorities explained that the 2005 budget, which initially adhered to the
government’s commitments to limit the growth in expenditures and the deficit, has
been adjusted to accommodate spending associated with the Gaza disengagement plan.
After presenting a budget consistent with the government commitments to limit real
expenditure growth to 1 percent and the deficit to 3 percent of GDP, the government
announced its plan to raise the deficit target to 3.4 percent of GDP and real expenditure
growth to 2 percent in 2005 as a one-time adjustment to accommodate the cost of the Gaza
disengagement plan—estimated at about one percent of GDP.7 The authorities are fully
aware of the need to revert back to the original fiscal path in 2006. The mission agreed that a
temporary—and capped—deviation of up to 0.4 percent of GDP for an exceptional expense
should not raise undue concerns about the government’s commitment to fiscal discipline.
However, the mission argued that given the high level of public debt and in the absence of
established fiscal credibility, the authorities needed to make a concerted effort to adhere to
the budget framework and resist any further deviations from their fiscal targets.

7

The cost of the disengagement plan is expected to be spread over 2005-2007.

- 12 -

16.
The mission took the position that the authorities should accelerate debt
reduction by abstaining from further tax cuts, by broadening the tax base through the
elimination of various tax exemptions, and allowing the automatic stabilizers to operate
fully should revenues over perform. The authorities agreed that more attention should be
given to lowering the deficit and public debt, but maintained that the tax burden is high and
that cutting taxes is essential to promote private sector led growth. The mission noted that the
planned central government deficits of 3 percent of GDP would result in a decline in the
public debt to GDP ratio of only about 2 percentage points a year, given current growth
forecasts. Indeed, as the debt sustainability assessment shows (Table 6), the baseline scenario
implies only a gradual reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio—from 105 percent today to
97 percent in four years. By contrast, if real GDP growth, real interest rate, and the primary
balance were to remain at their historical averages, Israel’s public debt would rise to
108 percent of GDP by 2009. The mission further argued that a more ambitious fiscal goal
would help reduce interest rates, aid capital market development, and increase the scope for
countercyclical fiscal policy.
17.
The mission encouraged the authorities to present a medium-term budget
framework with detailed expenditure plans consistent with the overall expenditure
ceiling. International experience suggests that multi-year budget plans buttress fiscal
consolidation, minimize expenditure growth, and strengthen adjustment. Furthermore, setting
a multi-year budget would enhance the government’s credibility, diminish political pressure
to raise expenditures, and avoid allocations based on short-term budget rigidities rather than
according to longer-term policy objectives. In addition, the mission recommended presenting
mid-year reports covering the budget developments and progress in achieving the economic
agenda. The authorities agreed, in principle, with multi-year budgeting, but were concerned
that it might reduce budget flexibility.
B. Capital Market Reform
18.
The authorities are concerned that capital markets are underdeveloped and
financial markets, more generally, are subject to excessive concentration, inadequate
competition, and conflicts of interest. Corporate bond issues are very limited, there is little
securitization of bank assets, and instruments that are common in developed markets—such
as real estate investment trusts, municipal bonds, funds of funds, foreign based mutual
funds—are almost non-existent. The mission shared the authorities’ view of the current
situation as well as their goal of fostering a stable, competitive financial system with a welldeveloped capital market.
19.
The authorities attributed the underdeveloped capital markets to the dominance
of the two largest banks–Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi—in the financial markets.
The authorities are concerned that the dominant position of these banks has hindered the
development of capital markets and exacerbated the conflicts of interest that exist in
universal banking in the following ways:

- 13 -

•
•
•
•

Banks, despite being legally bound to offer objective advice to investors, in practice
persuade the majority of their customers to buy the mutual and provident funds in
which they have a direct interest.
Banks may encourage their customers to borrow excessively for the purpose of
investment in their own funds.
The managers of mutual and provident funds may be inclined to channel their
investments to equity issues for which the bank is the underwriter.
A bank may encourage a corporate customer in financial difficulty to repay loans to
the bank using funds raised through debt or equity issues underwritten by the bank,
thus transferring the risk of default by the company from the bank to the investors in
its funds.

Furthermore, the authorities noted that their experience with earlier capital market reforms
indicated that banks would derail gradual capital market reform measures and, therefore, it
was necessary to radically restrict their activities in order to enhance capital market
development and decrease concentration in the financial system.
20.
Accordingly, the authorities believe it is essential to divest banks of any
holdings in mutual or provident funds. Specifically, they note that this will reduce
conflicts of interest, open the system to competition, improve the quality of financial
services, increase returns on savings, and, importantly, remove major obstacles to the
development of non-banking financial intermediaries. Thus, the key steps planned by the
authorities to address existing deficiencies include:
•

•

•
•
•
•

Banks would be prohibited from managing mutual and provident funds and would be
obliged to sell their interests in such funds over a four-year period. There would be
limits on the maximum share of the market that any buyer could acquire at the time of
purchase.
Banks would not be permitted to act as pricing underwriters for public offerings of
securities where the issuer (or entities it controls) owes the banks (or related parties)
more than NIS 5 million or a sum equivalent to 10 per cent of its total financial
liabilities.8
The introduction of a law to regulate provident funds and a review of the regulatory
supervisory structure to ensure consistency, better coordination, and greater
effectiveness.
Measures to enhance liquidity using market makers in the secondary markets.
Measures to facilitate bank customers switching between banks.
An examination of deposit insurance.

Inter Ministerial Committee Report.

- 14 -

21.
The mission agreed with a number of the planned measures, but noted that the
plan to force banks to divest themselves of the mutual and provident fund business
involves risks. The mission acknowledged that the concentration of banks was high, but
suggested that it would be wrong to view the Israeli experience as wholly unique, and that
divestiture represented a step away from the strategies in other countries, where there is a
clear trend towards universal banking. In this regard, the mission warned against the risks
associated with forcing the banks to divest themselves of their mutual and provident fund
activities. For example, forced divestiture may discourage potential new participants from
entering the market—in part because a decision by the authorities to intervene in the capital
markets to impose restrictions that are being lifted elsewhere in the world may create
uncertainty about the authorities’ future intentions. Divestiture could also potentially reduce
the diversification of banks’ exposure by reducing fee based income and thereby making
profits more dependant on interest rate developments. There is also the risk that banks would
take actions to circumvent the restrictions as well as test the new restrictions, thereby
creating new regulatory challenges for the authorities. Finally, regulation and supervision of
provident funds are, in practice, currently inadequate to ensure an informed and wellfunctioning market. It is, therefore, important that the new managers of these provident funds
be well regulated lest systemic risks increase.
22.
The authorities acknowledged these risks but argued that they are manageable
and that there is little chance of achieving the agreed goals without the planned “onetime intervention” aimed at changing the structure of the Israeli financial system.
23.
The mission also noted that capital market development was hindered by
obstacles other than bank dominance in financial markets—many of which are already
being addressed by the authorities. First, persistently high fiscal deficits in the past
absorbed a large share of institutional savings, especially as, until recently, the government
had directed a high proportion of the assets of the pension funds, provident funds and
insurance companies into special non-traded, index-linked government bonds. The
government’s use of institutional funds in such a manner may well have helped hinder the
development of capital markets. Second, other factors, identified by the authorities, have also
frustrated the development of the capital markets. For example, the 35 per cent tax on
investment in foreign securities has made foreign mutual funds relatively unattractive; as
noted in the 2001 ROSC, Israel requires foreign funds to register in Israel and bear the often
prohibitive cost of restructuring a fund or rewriting a prospectus to meet local requirements;
and legislation that does not permit the development of municipal bonds or funds of funds
(Box 2). The mission agreed with the authorities that regulatory measures had not been
successful in addressing the issues in the past, and the authorities pointed out that banks had
sought to block such action through appeals to the courts. The mission observed that this
experience suggested that regulatory powers of enforcement should be strengthened.
24.
The authorities responded that many of these changes are not complete yet, and
in any case will not be sufficient to ensure their ultimate goal of a developed capital
market. Therefore, they viewed legislation to divest banks of their mutual and provident
fund activities as a crucial element in restructuring Israel’s financial system. Overall, they

- 15 -

saw the benefits of this approach—which takes into account the history of financial markets
and the banking industry in Israel—as far outweighing the potential risks. The mission
pointed out that a number of the reforms cited above have only been recently undertaken or
are, as yet, in the form of proposals, but those that have been implemented are already
showing some results and ought to be given time to work before restricting the operations of
banks (Box 2). Although the necessary legislation for divestiture has yet to be forwarded to
the Knesset, this is just a matter of time. The general expectation is that the legislation will
be submitted and passed.
C. Monetary Policy
25.
The BoI emphasized that the primary objective of monetary policy is price
stability with allowance for maintaining financial sector stability. The BoI explained that
the price stability objective, as opposed to the inflation target, is ongoing and does not refer
to a specific calendar period. Subject to the price stability objective, the BoI also takes into
account real growth and employment when setting monetary policy.
26.
The BoI explained that its monetary policy decisions in 2004 were mostly based
on market assessments of inflation. The large forecast errors from their econometric
models had prompted them to base recent interest rate decisions primarily on market
expectations of low inflation. The measures of inflationary expectations they used included
the yield spread between CPI-indexed and non-indexed bonds and inflation forecasts of
professional private sector forecasters.
27.
The mission agreed that the recent interest rate reductions had been
appropriate given the subdued inflation environment, but recommended developing
additional tools to gauge inflation. Market measures of expectations and real interest rates
may be biased and inefficient because they reflect a certain degree of circularity: markets
look to the central bank to forecast inflationary prospects, but, in turn, the central bank relies
on market-derived measures to help assess those prospects (Box 3). The BoI’s emphasis on
measures of inflation expectations and real interest rates that are derived from the markets
rather than its own forecasts could potentially contribute to price instability. The mission
argued, therefore, that in addition to the use of market expectations, more emphasis could be
placed on utilizing improved forecast models that do not rely primarily on market
expectations as a framework for policy decisions (see also Selected Issues paper).
28.
The mission also pointed out that supplementing the BoI’s semiannual
inflation report with interim quarterly updates that reflect the BoI’s expectation of
future inflation dynamics would further enhance the framework. The inclusion of a ‘fan
chart’ of future inflation outlook in the two most recent BoI’s inflation reports was a
welcome step. Nevertheless, the inflation outlook shown in the chart is only one among
many measures of inflation expectations quoted by the BoI and does not appear to be the one
underlying BoI’s monetary policy decisions. The BoI contended that the only forecast it can
publish is the inflation target itself, any other forecast would be inconsistent and could
confuse the market.

- 16 -

29.
An update of the BoI law to reflect international best practices is also
warranted. The mission noted that Israel is the only emerging market country with an
inflation targeting regime that does not have a monetary policy committee. The BoI
supported fully the mission’s call to amend the Bank of Israel law and was already working

Box 3. Potential Difficulties with Inflation Targeting Rules
Inflation targeting can be viewed as setting the policy interest rate as follows:

iT = rr + π T + λ (π E − π T )
where i is the policy rate, rr is the long-run real interest rate, π is the inflation target, π is a measure of
the expected inflation, and λ is a parameter representing the degree to which the central bank addresses
emerging inflationary or deflationary pressures.
T

T

E

There are two implementation issues with this rule: determining the long-run real interest rate and ascertaining
future inflationary environment (expected inflation).
1.
The BoI relies on a CPI-indexed ten-year government bond as a proxy for the long-run real interest
rate, but this measure could misstate the actual real rate, especially in a country with a high public debt and a
history of past inflation. Not surprisingly, the real ten-year interest rate has fluctuated between 2 and 6 percent
over the past ten years.
2.
With regard to the inflationary environment (expected inflation), the BoI relies heavily on private
forecasts and capital markets expectations. These measures may be biased since they incorporate confidence in
the BoI’s policies, the difficulty in predicting a controlled variable, i.e., the Bernanke-Woodford (1997)
problem, which argues that in a credible inflation targeting regime, both market-based and professional inflation
forecasts will not be informative as they will simply reflect the target, and the existence of a risk premium.
Indeed, over the past decade, market participants have over-predicted inflation by 1 percentage point, on
average, and their forecast errors are highly correlated with information that was available at the time of the
forecast.

on a new proposal. However, the Minister of Finance wondered if monetary policy should
have economic growth, in addition to price stability, as a primary objective. The mission
argued that monetary policy cannot impact long-term economic growth and that adding an
economic growth target to the BoI’s objective might undermine the bank’s credibility and
thus its ability to maintain stable prices.
D. Labor Market

30.
The authorities noted that welfare reform has already led to a marked
improvement in the labor market. The participation rate in 2004 has increased by roughly
one half a percentage point to 54.9 percent, while employment has risen by 3.0 percent. The
mission concurred, but expressed concern that the recent welfare reforms may have hurt
some vulnerable groups, including the elderly and disabled. The authorities shared the
mission’s

- 17 -

31.
concern about adequate protection for these groups and pointed to plans to increase
support for the truly needy.
32.
The authorities are also undertaking steps to improve existing active labor
market policies. These include initiating pilot welfare-to-work centers, wage subsidies to

- 18 -

single mothers and enhanced employment services (for details see Selected Issues paper).
The mission welcomed these steps, but noted that the persistently high unemployment,
especially among the long-term unemployed, indicated the need for additional steps to
facilitate labor market absorption. Such steps could include improving the effectiveness and
scope of existing programs, an expansion of the pilot programs, and carefully designed
additional vocational training programs. The authorities largely agreed and noted that
vocational training programs had already been focused on the needs of the longer-term
unemployed and that a wage subsidy pilot program was under preparation.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

33.
Notable improvements in policies are prompting improved economic
performance in Israel. Economic growth has revived and prices and the exchange rate are
stable. While a favorable external environment and a better security situation have been
important factors, appropriate policies have been instrumental in contributing to growth. In
particular, the authorities have rebalanced macro policies and undertaken an ambitious fiscal
consolidation while appropriately easing monetary policy. Furthermore, the government’s
commitment to boost competition and efficiency have enhanced market confidence and laid
the foundations for future growth. Welfare reform will improve the functioning of the labor
market, privatization will improve competition and market efficiency, tax reform will
increase competitiveness, and pension reform, while assuring solvency of the system, should
aid the development of the capital market.
34.
The welcome commitment to limit the growth of public expenditure to
one percent in real terms requires medium-term planning and a detailed spending plan.
Developing a detailed medium-term spending plan would enhance credibility and ensure that
future budgets are allocated according to long term priorities. In addition, to enhance
transparency and planning, the government should present a detailed semi-annual report on
progress in achieving its fiscal objectives as well as in implementing various structural
measures.
35.
It is important to accelerate the path of debt reduction by abstaining from
further unplanned tax cuts and by broadening the tax base through the elimination of
various tax exemptions. Maintaining a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in the years ahead
implies but a modest decline in public debt, relative to GDP, and is insufficiently ambitious.
A smaller fiscal deficit would be preferable as the correspondingly more pronounced
decrease in the stock of public debt would allow for lower interest rates, increased private
investment, lower taxes in the future, and higher medium-term growth. Accordingly, the
automatic stabilizers ought to be allowed to operate fully should revenues over perform, and
should be reined in partially should revenues under perform.
36.
The BoI success in maintaining low inflation is commendable. The reductions in
interest rates of the past year were warranted. Given that inflationary pressures are subdued
and the inflation outlook well within the BoI target range, the policy rate appears appropriate
provided the external environment remains stable.

- 19 -

37.
It will be important to update the current Bank of Israel Law to reflect
international best practices. This would help reinforce central bank independence and
enhance transparency and accountability. The new law should clearly specify that the
primary function of the central bank is to ensure price stability. The law should also provide
for instrument independence and the establishment of a committee to set monetary policy.
38.
There is also scope for the BoI to enhance its tools and procedures for
implementing inflation targeting. Placing too much emphasis on measures derived from
markets of long-term real interest rates and inflation expectations could potentially contribute
to price volatility. Developing and improving statistical forecasting models for assessing the
inflationary outlook is therefore warranted. Furthermore, to increase transparency and
accountability, it is also recommended that the authorities develop and present their view of
the inflation outlook, and that the semi-annual Inflation Reports be supplemented with
interim quarterly updates explaining unexpected developments.
39.
With the high level of concentration in the banking sector and the
underdeveloped capital market, many of the steps being taken to remove obstacles to
capital market development are to be applauded. Reducing the use of non-tradable,
indexed government bonds will stimulate the demand for capital market instruments, as will
limiting banks’ exposure to individual and connected lenders. The authorities are already in
the process of removing barriers to capital market development, such as the unequal tax
treatment on different instruments, excessive stamp taxes, excessively onerous prospectus
requirements on commercial paper and asset backed securities, inadequate rights for
participants in repo markets, the regulatory prohibition on funds of funds, and legal
restrictions on the issue of municipal bonds. The removal of these barriers and the move
towards the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards will have a
substantial beneficial effect on the development of the capital market. The plan to force
banks to divest themselves of mutual and provident funds could strengthen competition, but
goes against trends elsewhere towards universal banking and involves risks.
40.
If the authorities proceed to legislate the divestiture of mutual and provident
fund activity by banks, there will be a need to strengthen regulation and improve
enforcement. Specifically, it is important that they vigorously enforce the regulations
already on the books and ensure that the supervisory and regulatory functions are sufficiently
enhanced to ensure that transferring mutual and provident funds to the non-bank sector does
not result in increased systemic risk. In particular, the introduction of an effective regulatory
law for provident funds will be critical. Currently, the poorly enforced regulation of
provident and pension funds does not, in practice, result in suppliers disclosing their
investment policies and the attendant risks with sufficient detail and clarity to allow the
investor to make an informed choice. Enforcement of full disclosure is essential as the
investor’s previous expectations that these funds were essentially risk-free are no longer
valid. Monitoring of the implementation of such investment policies by independent
custodians is an international best practice and should be adopted by the authorities. It is also
important to reassure potential market participants that the measures are a “once and for all”
event to encourage future market entry and thus more competition. Finally, it will be

- 20 -

important to proceed diligently with the other, more conventional capital market reform
measures already underway and planned, since divestiture can not be a substitute for such
measures.
41.
Welfare reform, which has started to bear fruit as indicated by the reduction in
unemployment and the increase in labor force participation, should be supported by
further active labor market policies. The recent strengthening of existing active labor
market programs and the new pilot initiatives are encouraging. Yet, spending on active labor
market policies, as a share of GDP, remains small in comparison to OECD countries and the
absorption of new job seekers into the labor market could be improved by expanding
vocational training and employment services in a carefully targeted way while enhancing
their effectiveness.
42.
Israel has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. The
periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of Israel’s economic data are generally
adequate for Fund surveillance. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

I. Baseline Projections

2005

1/ Gross central government debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2005 9/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2005

B. Bound Tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2005-09 8/
A2. No policy change (constant primary balance) in 2005-09

A. Alternative Scenarios

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 7/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)

Israel has a de facto floating exchange rate regime. In principle, the exchange rate of
the new sheqel is managed against a basket of currencies comprising the dollar, the
euro, the pound sterling, and the yen. But without intervention by the BOI during the
past several years, the exchange rate has fluctuated freely within a crawling band in

- 36 -

APPENDIX I

response to market forces. The upper and lower limits of the band, which are adjusted
daily, were originally derived to reflect the annual difference between the domestic
inflation target and the projected inflation of the main trading partners. In the past few
years, however, the practice has changed, such that only the slope of the lower limit
has been reduced, whenever possible, while the upper limit has remained unchanged
at a steeper slope. The slope of the upper limit has been 6 percent on an annual basis
since July 26, 1993; the slope of the lower limit has been 2 percent since
August 6, 1998. On December 23, 2001, the lower limit became flat and, on
November 11, 2004, the width of the band, based on the average of the upper and
lower limits, was about 60 percent.

APPENDIX II

STATISTICAL ISSUES

Israel has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. The periodicity, timeliness,
coverage, and quality of Israel’s economic data are generally adequate for surveillance. The
methodology underlying the reported overall annual fiscal balance is not in conformity with
internationally accepted practice as interest costs exclude the inflation component of such
payments. The authorities are gradually moving toward the methodology that is standard in
other countries, so that the discrepancy will decline over time. Data submitted for the 2004
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook now present cash and accrual data for revenue and
expense, following the GFSM 2001 format. However, no data on transactions and stocks of
financial assets and liabilities were submitted. Within-year monthly reports on central
government operations cover only the main aggregates of budgetary accounts, not broken
down by composition.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 21, 2005
1.
This supplement contains information on recent economic developments in Israel that
has become available since the circulation of the staff report for the Article IV consultation.
The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The Bank of Israel (BoI) kept its policy rate unchanged for the month of March at
3.5 percent. The BoI in its press statement noted that the decision was based on the
assessment that the current level of short-term interest is consistent with the inflation
targeting range of 1-3 percent a year.
3.
The latest reading of the consumer price index (CPI) showed that inflationary
pressures remain subdued, with the January and February CPIs registering a decline of
0.6 percent m/m and a rise of 0.2 percent m/m, respectively. During the last 12 months, the
CPI undershot the lower bound of the inflation targeting range, rising by 0.8 percent.
4.
As of March 17, the 2005 budget has yet to be approved by the Knesset. Since the
beginning of the year, the government has operated using the 2004 budget framework which
allows 1/12 of that budget to be spent each month. If the Knesset fails to pass the budget by
March 31, new elections must be held within 3 months.
5.
The authorities initiated an investigation of Bank Hapoalim regarding money
laundering activity amounting to several hundred million dollars and which involved certain
customers and employees of a particular branch.
6.
The government sold 6.5 percent of Bank Leumi to institutional investors. The
government’s remaining holdings of Leumi stand at about 28 percent.
7.
Following the completion of negotiations between the government and the ports’
labor unions, the authorities last month launched the separation of the two ports with the
intention to privatize them in the future.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On March 21, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Israel.1
Background
Economic recovery is underway after a prolonged recession. Growth is being supported by more
favorable global economic conditions, an improvement in the security situation, and appropriate
policies, which have included tightening the fiscal stance and easing monetary policy.
Real GDP grew by an estimated 4.3 percent in 2004, with exports and private consumption leading
the way. The economy is expected to continue to strengthen, albeit at a slightly lower growth rate
this year. Unemployment remains high, but is on a declining path. The exchange rate was stable
throughout 2004, balanced by the drop in interest rates and the rebound in economic activity.
The current account remained near balance.
The recovery has proceeded hand in hand with a consolidation of the fiscal stance, an easing of
monetary policy, and the implementation of key structural reforms. The government is establishing a
credible commitment to maintain future deficits below 3 percent of GDP and to limit government
expenditure growth, in real terms, to no more than 1 percent a year. While such a deficit is still
relatively high, particularly in light of the large public sector debt—105 percent of GDP—it represents
a marked improvement compared to 2003.
Monetary policy loosened during the first few months of 2004, as inflationary pressures continued to
ease. Subdued inflation amid sheqel appreciation against the U.S. dollar during the second half of
the year prompted the Bank of Israel to lower its policy rate by 20 basis points in December 2004
and again in January and February of 2005 to 3.5 percent.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2While rebalancing their macroeconomic policy mix, the authorities have also embarked on structural
reform policies aimed at boosting competition and efficiency. These included privatization in key
sectors as well as further labor market initiatives. The authorities are also considering a major
capital market reform in addition to other measures designed to enhance capital market
development already underway.
Most financial soundness indicators for the banking system have improved, albeit marginally, due to
the strengthened macroeconomic environment. While the quality of banks’ loan portfolios has yet to
improve, it is expected to strengthen further as the recovery takes hold.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvements in policies that have helped strengthen Israel’s
economic performance. Economic growth has resumed, prices and the exchange rate are stable,
and competitiveness has increased. While a favorable external environment and a better security
situation have been important factors, prudent policies have been instrumental in this outcome.
In particular, the authorities have rebalanced macro policies and undertaken an ambitious fiscal
consolidation, while easing monetary policy. The government’s commitment to boost competition
and efficiency, including through welfare reforms and privatization, has enhanced market confidence
and laid the foundations for future growth. Directors considered that the policy agenda ahead should
continue to focus on strengthening the fiscal position, reducing the high level of public debt, and
implementing key structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to limit the growth of public expenditure. To that
end, they urged the authorities to adopt a multi-year budgetary framework and a detailed spending
plan to enhance credibility, and to help ensure that future budgets are more insulated from political
pressures and reflect long-term priorities.
Directors emphasized the importance of accelerating debt reduction by abstaining from further
unplanned tax cuts and broadening the tax base through the elimination of various tax exemptions.
They encouraged the authorities to implement steadfastly their fiscal deficit target and respect the
expenditure growth limit for the years ahead. Some Directors felt that the fiscal deficit and
expenditure rules should be more ambitious in order to achieve a more pronounced decline in the
stock of public debt than presently planned that would underpin lower interest rates, greater private
investment, lower future taxes, and faster medium-term growth. Accordingly, the automatic
stabilizers ought to be allowed to operate fully should revenues overperform, and should be reined
in partially should revenues underperform.
Directors commended the Bank of Israel’s (BoI) success in maintaining low inflation, and welcomed
the reductions in interest rates last year. Given that inflationary pressures are subdued and the
inflation outlook is well within the BoI target range, the current policy rate appears appropriate,
provided the external environment remains stable.
Directors recommended that the authorities update the Bank of Israel Law to reflect international
best practices, in order to reinforce the central bank’s independence and enhance its transparency
and accountability. The updated law should specify that the primary function of the central bank is to
ensure price stability. It should also provide for instrument independence and the establishment of a
committee to set monetary policy.

-3Directors considered that the BoI’s current practice of using market-based indicators for
implementing inflation targeting is broadly appropriate, but they saw scope for further enhancing
inflation targeting tools and procedures. A few Directors cautioned that overreliance on market
expectations of long-term real interest rates and inflation could contribute to price volatility. Directors
welcomed the BoI’s intention to strengthen its statistical forecasting models for assessing the
inflationary outlook.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to strengthen competition in the financial sector and
the steps being taken to remove obstacles to capital market development. Regarding the authorities’
plan to require banks to divest themselves of their mutual and provident funds, a number of
Directors understood the authorities’ preference for such a strong measure given Israel’s highly
concentrated financial system. Other Directors, however, recommended that the risks of the
divestiture strategy be carefully weighed. These Directors noted that the plan might go against
trends elsewhere toward universal banking and that other more conventional measures being
undertaken to open up the sector could meet the same objective. In any case, it was broadly agreed
that if the authorities proceed with the plan, the regulations already on the books should be
vigorously enforced and the supervisory and regulatory functions enhanced, in order to mitigate
systemic risk from the transfer of mutual and provident funds to the non-bank sector. It will also be
important to proceed rapidly with the other capital market reform measures under way or planned.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of Israel’s regime to counter money laundering and the
financing of terrorism to a level comparable to best international practices. They noted the
heightened cooperation between the relevant Israeli supervisory authorities and their counterparts in
other countries.
Directors took note of the progress made in structural reforms, in particular the successful
privatization of the national airline and the shipping entity in 2004. They concurred with the
authorities’ plans for privatization of the ports, utilities, and oil refineries in the period ahead.
Directors agreed that welfare reform has started to bear fruit, as indicated by the reduction in
unemployment and the increase in labor force participation. They welcomed the recent
strengthening of existing active labor market programs and new pilot initiatives, but noted the scope
for increasing spending in this area, which remains low in comparison to that in OECD countries.
Directors considered that expanded and well-targeted vocational training and employment services
could further assist new job seekers in entering the labor market.
Directors observed that Israel meets the Special Data Dissemination Standard specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and that quality of the data is adequate for the
purpose of surveillance.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Israel
and Herman Litman, Advisor to Executive Director
March 21, 2005
General remarks
The authorities believe in “expansionary fiscal contraction” within the current Israeli
economic circumstances, i.e. that tax cuts and curbs on public spending stimulate private
sector effort via supply, given that spending and taxes are high and supply thus constrained.
The authorities clearly signaled to the markets a break with the past. A fiscal adjustment has
been realized of almost 3 percent of GDP from 2002 to 2004. The fiscal effort has been
accompanied by easing monetary policy. The key policy interest rate has been cut from
8.9 percent in March 2003 to 3.5 percent in February 2005. To strengthen a virtuous circle,
the authorities have reduced distortionary taxes and strengthened fiscal transparency and
accountability to bolster confidence in the authorities’ fiscal program. Furthermore, the
authorities laid down the basis for sustainable noninflationary growth through privatization
and other structural reforms.
By demonstration of credibility and commitment, the authorities have succeeded in
changing market expectations. The public perception of the authorities’ policies is that they
are prudent, and that the government is committed to structural reforms. The change in
market expectations is visible in the favorable responses of stock, foreign exchange and longterm bond markets, and in the reduction of the country risk premium.
GDP
After negative growth in 2001-02 and timid growth in 2003, GDP grew 4.3 percent in
2004. The security situation which has improved markedly, renewed US demand for
technological products1, prudent fiscal policy and the easing of monetary policy have spurred
growth. As the public sector is shrinking due to structural reforms and the intentional policy
of the government, business-sector product is a better indication of economic performance.
Business-sector product grew 6.1 percent. Exports (excluding diamonds and start-ups) which
rose 16.3 percent, domestic private consumption, which rose 5.7 percent, and investment,
which rose 6.4 percent, all contributed to robust GDP growth. The 12.3 percent growth of
imports provided an additional indication that domestic demand has picked up. The State of
Economy Index (which combines leading economic indicators) rose 5.2 percent in 2004, the
highest rise in 10 years.
Almost 70,000 new jobs have been created in the private sector, an increase of
4.5 percent. As a consequence of government policies, the government is no longer perceived
as “an employer of the last resort” and the number of jobs in the public sector declined. In
2004 unemployment fell from 10.9 percent to 10.0 percent.
Monetary issues
1

Electronic communication equipment, scientific equipment, control and supervision equipment, and electronic
components.

-2Staff commends the BoI for maintaining low inflation and finds the recent cuts of its
key policy rate appropriate. In February 2005 the interest rate stood at 3.5 percent, a record
low in the history of Israel, after it had been cut three times, each by 20bp, since November
2004. Only in March 2003 it stood at 8.9 percent. Nevertheless staff finds models and
communication policy, which underpin monetary policy, wanting.
The BoI conducts simulations of two policy-oriented macro econometric models for
briefing materials, which are presented at monthly interest rate meetings. The reason for
basing decisions more heavily on market-based expectations is not for lack of models, but
because the simulation results do not always seem reasonable. The available models
developed at the BoI reflect state-of-the-art methodology as well as the difficulties of
modeling an economy as noisy as Israel's. Therefore, there is a fundamental problem with
available models and they should be underweighted relative to market-based information and
informed judgment. The BoI is actively seeking, devoting considerable resources, to produce
an improved forecasting framework, and hopes to benefit from the lessons to be drawn from
the Fund’s survey of all countries that have adopted inflation targeting. Until such a
framework is available, the current use of market-based measures and, especially, informed
judgment seems appropriate.
As regards communication policy, transparency is not an end in itself but a means to
enhance credibility of the central bank. Concerning the issue of publication of forecasts, there
is the logical difficulty of publishing an inflation forecast that is potentially different from the
target. The publication of forecasts for a relevant horizon that are different from the target
would damage credibility. Logical consistency is likely to be as important as transparency in
promoting credibility of policies. Based in large part on the recommendations of the previous
mission, the BoI did publish in its mid-2004 Inflation Report a general direction of interest
rates for the half year till the next Report and it turned out to be wrong. Such forecasts would
be wrong about as often as they are right.
Fiscal issues
The cap on government spending growth of 1 percent (in real terms) together with the
growing economy, downsize the weight of the public sector in the economy: the public sector
expenditure-to-GDP ratio has declined from 54.3 in 2002 to 51.6 percent in 2004, and the
authorities plan to reach 40 percent in 2010. This way, Israel will move from one of the
highest ratios in OECD to around average OECD level. The authorities not only capped the
total expenses, but also conducted a minute examination of all expenditures in order to cut
waste and inefficiencies, especially in wages, which amount to 27 percent of total
expenditures. The departments of direct and indirect taxations have been unified. The unified
procurement department, which started operation in 2005, is projected to save, in the medium
term, between 10 to 20 percent on the procurement bill of NIS 30 billion. In late 2004,
monitoring of transfers was unified. A better discipline of payments for goods and services
should also cut costs. The authorities continue to broaden the tax base. The 2005 budget
includes elimination of various tax exemptions.
The 1 percent cap on public expenditure growth allowed the authorities to fulfill their
commitment to decrease the general government debt ratio, and to continue with gradual

-3implementation of tax reform, in order to reduce distortionary taxes. The debt decreased from
106.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 104.9 percent in 2004. Within the framework of the tax
reform, the maximum tax rate on wages has been cut from 60 to 49 percent, and the
corporate tax will be gradually cut from 36 to 30 percent.
The 2004 fiscal deficit was 3.9 percent of GDP, lower than the target of 4 percent,
compared to 5.6 percent in 2003. Without the disengagement cost, the 2005 fiscal deficit is
targeted at 3 percent of GDP. The cost of the disengagement plan, to be implemented in
2005 -07, amounts to 1 percent of GDP.
Capital market reform
The concentration of the Israeli capital markets is unique not only by its level, but
also by its characteristics. It is dominated by two large banks. The Israeli banks almost
completely dominate the country's provident funds (providing management), which comprise
a significant component of pension savings in Israel. Non-bank intermediaries which provide
a viable alternative to banking services are virtually absent in Israel. The Israeli banks do not
face competitive “threats” from abroad. Therefore, the concentration of the Israeli capital
markets has much greater adverse effect on their competitiveness.
The authorities believe that development of the capital markets should be promoted
by a wide range of measures, and they are convinced that the divesture of provident and
mutual funds from the banks is a condition for all the additional measures to achieve effect.
There is no evidence to substantiate staff’s hesitation that the reform may deter
potential players from entering the Israeli capital markets. On the contrary, evidence
supports the view that the reform will prompt new players to join the markets. This is
based, inter alia, on the outcome of the decision from 1996 to restrict banks from holding
substantial interests in insurance companies. This decision has prompted foreign
insurance companies to enter the insurance sector. In addition, following the proposed
reform (which is now in the public domain), there has been a rise in foreign interest in the
Israeli financial markets: e.g. the recent sale of the controlling share in the Israel Discount
Bank and of 6.5 percent of Bank Leumi’s shares to a foreign institutional investor.
Therefore, the authorities believe that the sale of provident and mutual funds by the banks
will present opportunities for foreign financial institutions. Such institutions, that are not
attracted by direct investment in banking activity, per se, can realize their competitive
advantage in the asset management field. From discussions held with foreign financial
institutions, it is clear that such parties do not fear the authorities’ regulative intervention,
as long as it is clear and consistent. There is no uncertainty about the authorities’ future
intentions: once competition is established, the restrictions will be lifted.
The reform will not “radically restrict” banking activity. The banks will be
allowed to continue to sell provident and mutual funds, and will, for the first time, be
allowed to sell pension and life insurance products in their branches. Therefore, the
authorities believe that it is possible that the volume of activity of the banks will even
broaden.

-4The authorities intend to proceed to legislate the divestiture of mutual and
provident funds. The authorities are aware of risks but think they are containable. Having
in mind that the proposed reform constitutes a major change, they will implement it in a
controlled, cautious and gradual way, and will strengthen regulation (among others,
through the adoption of a new provident law) and improve enforcement.
Labor markets and structural reforms
As economic growth is not yet sufficient for substantially reducing unemployment –
many of the new jobs were created in the high-tech sector, and many of other new jobs were
part-time jobs - the authorities have improved the existing and launched new active labor
market policies. One of the new programs aims at increasing employment in the periphery
which suffers from higher than average unemployment rates. The program subsidizes the
creation of new, better-paid jobs, through one-stop employment centers, operated by foreign
companies. The centers will cover 14,000 households in the first stage. There was also a
significant improvement in the existing employment service: the employment placement rose
30 percent compared to 2003.
The authorities have continued with implementation of their ambitious agenda of
boosting competition and efficiency. The shipping company ZIM, the national airline El-AL,
the new pension funds, and the third largest bank, the Israel Discount Bank, have been
privatized. The authorities launched the gradual opening of mail services to competition,
privatization of the refineries, and the separation and privatization of the two sea ports. The
authorities sold 6.5 percent of shares of Bank Leumi, the last publicly owned bank, to an
international institutional investor, and they consider various ways to dispose of the
remaining 28.5 percent of the shares.
ALM/CFT
In June 2002, Israel was removed from FATF’s list of “noncooperative countries”,
and following further examination, also from its “monitoring list”. Israel’s progress in
strengthening its ALM/CFT regime had been confirmed by the MFD-led mission, which
visited Israel at the end of 2002. The ALM/CFT regime has been further strengthened by
implementation of the mission’s recommendations, including, inter alia, cooperation among
the relevant supervisory authorities and information exchange between domestic and
overseas supervisors.
The authorities carried out inspections in the last few years in order to ensure that all
tools were put in place to implement the Prohibition on Money Laundering Law. The joint
efforts of the authorities and the financial institutions over the last few years brought the
Israeli AML/CFT regime to a level comparable to best international practice. In parallel, the
enforcement authorities carry out investigations and inspections of specific centers of activity
in order to identify breaches of the law, law-breakers and exceptional activities.
The recent widely publicized police investigation is part of this fight against money
laundering. The authorities’ investigation in one branch of Bank Hapoalim and Bank
Hapoalim’s subsidiary, the Bank Hapoalim Trust Company, brought to light findings that
appeared to constitute exceptional activity that bypassed the management team and the

-5controls practiced by the Bank Hapoalim. It is suspected that the sums involved in this
activity amounted to several hundred million dollars and involved certain customers and
employees of the branch and the Trust Company. The relevant overseas supervisors were
also notified.
