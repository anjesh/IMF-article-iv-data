IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2016 Article IV Consultation with Guinea

On July 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2016 Article IV consultation1 with Guinea.
Guinea’s economic performance over the past four years fell significantly short of the
authorities’ ambitious projections. After a period of early gains (2012–13), the country was
buffeted by the Ebola epidemic, a sharp decline in commodity prices, and political
uncertainty. Economic growth averaged 1.8 percent during 2012–15, significantly below the
performance of peers, and GDP per capita is estimated to have fallen, likely inducing an
increase in poverty
The economy is recovering from the effects of the Ebola epidemic. Growth is projected to
rebound to 3.7 percent in 2016, on the back of higher electricity provision from the Kaleta
hydroelectric dam and a strong increase in bauxite production. Inflation increased to
7.9 percent in April 2016 driven by stronger domestic demand, and a weaker exchange rate.
Bank credit to the private sector continued to grow at rapid rates, and reserve buffers
increased and stabilized at 2.4 months of imports, after significant losses in 2014–15.
The medium-term outlook is favorable, but continues to be clouded by downside risks.
Growth is projected to average 4.5 percent over the next five years, and inflation would
decline gradually to 5 percent by 2019. The basic fiscal balance is projected to remain around
½ percent of GDP, reflecting financing constraints and prudent policies to strengthen
reserves. The main risks to the outlook stem from a sharper-than expected global growth

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

slowdown that would delay mining projects, a deterioration in the region’s security, a
resurgence of the Ebola epidemic, and political uncertainty.
The authorities’ economic strategy for 2016–22, under preparation, aims at unlocking
broad-based and inclusive growth driven by investments in electricity, roads, and agriculture.
The private sector would also play a role through new mining projects, new transformation
units of agricultural products, and large residential housing projects and administrative
buildings through PPPs.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Guinea’s ongoing recovery from the Ebola epidemic and the
authorities’ progress under their Fund supported program, including a strong fiscal
adjustment in the first quarter of 2016. Nonetheless, the epidemic and the decline in
commodity prices have caused a serious socio economic setback. Directors took note of the
authorities’ plan to foster broad based growth and improve the population’s living conditions
by scaling up public investment. They underscored the need to safeguard fiscal sustainability
and urged implementation of structural reforms to strengthen resilience and bolster long term
growth and poverty reduction.
Directors stressed the importance of implementing the planned fiscal adjustment this year to
further strengthen fiscal buffers, including in view of fiscal risks from the energy sector.
They emphasized the need to build fiscal space for priority investment and social spending
by improving tax administration and compliance, tapping the unrealized tax potential,
containing the government wage bill and energy subsidies, enhancing the efficiency of public
spending, and pursuing improvements in public financial management. While better
infrastructure services can help unlock higher growth, Directors recommended caution in
undertaking large public investments, and urged the authorities to take into account available
financing and the need for a strong process for selecting and managing investment projects.
They noted the importance of limiting recourse to nonconcessional finance, welcoming in
this regard the authorities’ intention to seek concessional financing to the extent possible.
Directors urged the authorities to redouble efforts to strengthen debt management and reduce
domestic arrears.
Directors supported the prudent monetary policy stance aimed at raising the international
reserves cover and containing inflation. They welcomed the work on a draft central bank law
intended to reduce fiscal dominance and facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, and
encouraged the authorities to consider the other recommendations of the updated Safeguards
Assessment. They welcomed the reform of the foreign exchange system and recommended

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

moving ahead with the next steps of the reform in order to close the remaining exchange rate
misalignment. They noted that transitioning to exchange rate flexibility in the medium term
will help safeguard competitiveness and international reserves.
Directors called for enhancing risk-based supervision in the financial sector and improving
financial intermediation and inclusion. They looked forward to the reform of the National
Strategy for Financial Inclusion and a strengthening of the AML/CFT regime.
Directors emphasized the importance of addressing structural impediments to higher growth
and diversification. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to enact a new mining code and
reform agriculture. They urged them to complete the reforms under the ECF-supported
arrangement, and highlighted the need to continue to enhance the business climate,
strengthen governance, and improve public service delivery.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 6, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is recovering from the effects of the Ebola epidemic but is
facing severe headwinds from the decline in commodity prices. The authorities’
economic strategy for 2016–22 rests on large investments in electricity, transport, and
agriculture, and aims at unlocking shared and broad-based growth. GDP per capita is
expected to grow by 1½ percent on average per year during the next five years, after
remaining broadly stagnant over the last five years.
Challenge: The authorities will need to deliver socioeconomic gains while safeguarding
fiscal sustainability, strengthening the central bank’s reserves and reducing inflation.
This will require prioritizing projects, mobilizing adequate financing, and better
governance.
Policy recommendations:


Effect the 2016 fiscal consolidation consistent with the available financing
envelope.



Anchor the medium-term fiscal deficit to available concessional financing. Tap
the property tax base and enforce the automatic fuel pricing mechanism.
Rationalize subsidies to reduce them by 1 percentage point of GDP and cap the
wage bill to 6 percent of GDP.



Prioritize investment projects and concessional financing, and enforce the public
finance management organic law and the procurement code.



Implement the Safeguards Assessment’s recommendations to strengthen the
independence of the central bank. Finalize the foreign exchange market reform to
support exchange rate flexibility.



Finalize the ECF arrangement’s structural reform agenda and develop a new set
of reforms in the area of inclusive finance, agriculture, electricity, and justice to
strengthen Guinea’s external competitiveness and resilience to shocks.

A Missed Opportunity

1.
Guinea’s 2012 Article IV (AIV) consultation was held amidst a favorable environment
and outlook. A long history of weak governance, thin state capacity and political instability had left
the country as one of the poorest in the world, unable to tap its abundant natural resources and exit
fragility. Guinea’s prospects improved markedly in 2011 with the inauguration of its first
democratically-elected president amidst high and soaring prices of its natural resources
(Text Figure 1). In addition, the government’s commitment to economic stability and structural
transformation, the support of donors, the high appetite of mining investors searching for
investment opportunities to meet an increasing demand from emerging markets, the receipt of a
15 percent of GDP revenue windfall (to settle a dispute over transactions on the Simandou iron-ore
asset), and substantial debt relief under the HIPC/MDRI initiative paved the way for unlocking
significant socioeconomic gains.

However, economic performance fell short of expectations as a result of domestic and
external factors. After a period of early gains (2012–13), Guinea was buffeted by a series of shocks
that hampered growth, including the political turmoil ahead of the 2013 legislative and the 2015
presidential elections, the Ebola epidemic, and more recently a sharp decline in commodity prices.
Economic growth averaged 1.8 percent during 2012–15 (Table 1), significantly below the
performance of peers (Text Figure 2), including those hit by similar shocks. GDP per capita is
estimated to have fallen, likely inducing an increase in poverty.1 Despite large investments in the
energy sector, electricity provision remains low, as well as access to water services. While most of
the growth underperformance can be attributed to the effects of the shocks, delayed policy
decisions to unlock the Simandou project, policy slippages and delays in structural reform
implementation also played a role (Box 1).

About half of the revisions to GDP forecasts are
estimated to accrue from delays in the
development of the Simandou iron-ore deposit.
In 2011 the government signed a deal with Rio
Tinto to start exporting iron ore by 2015.
However, as negotiations over the conditions
dragged (660 km of the trans-Guinea railway,
majority ownership of the infrastructure, state
enablers, etc), iron ore prices fell below the
project’s breakeven price (estimated at around
$70 per ton) in 2014. Investor appetite also
declined reflecting lower emerging markets’
growth and higher country risk, effectively
closing the 2011 window of opportunity. In
May 2016, Rio Tinto announced a large
downsizing of the project’s workforce after the
release of its bankable feasibility study, with an
$18 billion cost for the project. Developing the
project under current market conditions will be
difficult, unless new measures (shorter export
routes for example) are taken to lower its cost.
The entry on-stream of two other world-class
projects in 2016 and China’s plans to reduce its
annual steel capacity further limit the prospects
for developing the project in the medium term.
The decline in commodity prices has also
affected other mining projects and none of the
projects planned to be implemented at the time
of the 2012 article IV has started operating.

Efforts to improve the economy’s competitiveness have also lagged. Despite early advances in structural
reforms (Annex I), progress slowed down as a result of limited absorptive capacity and a weak institutional
framework. Performance in implementing the structural reform agenda under the ECF arrangement was
mixed at best. Guinea made no advances since 2002 in the CPIA rating (lower that the SSA IDA average),
Doing Business indicators remain poor (Guinea ranks 165/189), and the country has ranked last in the World
Economic Forum’s Competitiveness Index in the past two years. Access to finance, corruption, policy
instability and an inadequately educated labor force are considered to be the major obstacles for doing
business (Figure 4).

Recent Economic Developments

3.
The economy is recovering from the effects of the Ebola outbreak (Table 1).2 Guinea
was declared free of Ebola by the World Health Organization on June 1st 2016, 42 days after its last
confirmed case. The disease claimed 2,544 lives and had devastating socioeconomic effects (Country
Report 16/95). Growth is projected to rebound to 3.7 percent in 2016, on the back of higher
electricity provision from the Kaleta hydroelectric dam (240 MW), a rapid increase in production
from a bauxite company that started operations in 2015 (Box 2), and the execution of construction
contracts (15 percent of GDP) signed in 2014–15. Inflation increased to 7.9 percent in April driven by
stronger domestic demand, and a weaker exchange rate. Bank credit to the private sector continued
to grow at rapid rates (24 percent on annual terms as of April 2016), and reserve buffers increased
and stabilized at 2.4 months of imports, after significant losses in 2014–15.
4.
Socio-political tensions remain elevated. Opposition parties are demanding the
restructuring of the electoral commission to make it more independent before the local elections
scheduled in the second half of 2016. Labor unions organized strikes against elements of the 2016
budget, and for a reduction in pump prices. Debates are ongoing on President Condé’s alleged
interest in seeking a third term in office despite the constitutional two-term limit. Finally, the attacks
in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d’Ivoire have heightened the domestic security situation.
5.
The government appointed in January 2016 is developing an ambitious five-year plan.
Consultations within the government and with other stakeholders have led to the prioritization of
the electricity and agriculture sectors and a consensus on priority projects for the medium-term. The
Prime Minister outlined the economic strategy to the National Assembly on May 4, 2016 in his
Statement of Economic Policies. The strategy, which foreshadows the forthcoming five-year plan
expected by year-end, is more ambitious than its predecessors (PRSP, and post-Ebola recovery plan).
It aims to transform Guinea’s economy into a modern emerging one on the back of large investment
projects in electricity generation, roads, education and health.
6.
Short-term risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. The main risks stem from
(i) the possible inability to deliver the adjustment planned for 2016 (Table 2) leading to a depletion
of the central bank’s international reserves; (ii) further declines in commodity prices, which could
jeopardize mining sector prospects; and (iii) increased political instability and country risk ahead of
the local elections. A resurgence of Ebola could also derail economic prospects, while continued
weakness in advanced (Euro zone) and emerging economies (China) could delay expansion projects
in the mining sector, notably at SMB and CBG,3 and financing for public infrastructure projects.
Additional sources of downside risks include the potential deterioration and spillover effects from
the security dislocations in North Africa. These risks could be exacerbated if structural reforms
continue to stall, especially in the PFM area.

Guinea was first declared Ebola-free in end-2015, but seven new cases occurred in end-March and early April 2016.
On June 1, Guinea was declared Ebola-free for a second time.

Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée, a joint venture between the Guinean government, Alcoa and Rio Tinto, plans a
$752 million expansion to increase its production capacity by 40 percent to 18.5 million tons per year by 2018.

ban on exports of bauxite ore and
Australia’s environmental restrictions on bauxite mining led the Chinese partner company to seek alternative
supply sources while Guinea’s new mining code enhanced the profitability of new mining ventures. Exports
are projected to reach 10–13 million tons in 2016, which would make Guinea the 3rd largest bauxite producer
in the world.1 While initial production forecasts pointed to 410k tons/month, SMB has accelerated its
expansion and output has averaged 800k tons/month (partly owing to seasonal factors as the company
stockpiles in advance of the rainy season). Company guidance indicates that 2016 production could reach
13 million tons, notwithstanding capacity constraints and labor tensions. Furthermore, the outlook for the
aluminum market is still uncertain as suggested by China’s reported aluminum inventory overhang,
Indonesia’s expected resumption of exports in the second half of 2016, and Malaysia’s recent ban on bauxite
mining (to clear stockpiles, and address environmental damages).

Program Implementation and Risks

7.
The authorities are adhering to the agreed adjustment measures to successfully
complete the ECF-supported arrangement. To redress the slippages that led to delays in the
completion of the 6th review, the authorities adopted a significant fiscal adjustment and
deep-rooted reforms to the foreign exchange (FX) market. The fiscal deficit is projected to contract
to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2016 from 7.1 percent in 2015, the exchange rate has been allowed to
depreciate by about 12 percent since January, and the introduction of a new bilateral FX auction
mechanism eliminated the premium between the official and bureaus’ exchange rates. Preliminary
data indicate that all end-March indicative targets were met with a sizable margin, with the
exception of priority sector spending (Table 5).4 The end-June and end-2016 objectives are on track
to being met if risks to the budget (¶9) are addressed.

The end-April structural benchmark on the audit of domestic arrears was not met, but prospects for implementing
the measure are good.

The energy sector is the source of the most significant risks to the budget. The 2016
budget was prepared under the assumption that oil prices would be in the range of $35–$40 per
barrel. With current prices significantly above this range, revenue losses would emerge if pump
prices remain unchanged.5 In addition, the authorities have increased the installed thermal electricity
capacity to ensure a constant power supply during the dry season. At the current pace of electricity
production, the total cost of electricity production would increase by 2.1 percent of GDP in 2016,
which would translate into higher subsidies and/or arrears baring an increase in electricity tariffs.

the central bank’s target on net
international reserves (Table 3). The

rate on its new liquidity absorbing

rate, the pension rate, from 11 to

had already tightened with the depreciation of the GNF in early-2016.6 As a result of the tighter
liquidity, interest rates on Treasury bills increased by 300bp, and banks increased massively their use
of the BCRG refinancing facilities, including the Overnight window (Text Figure 3) to revamp their
liquidity in local currency.
11.
Financial soundness indicators deteriorated in 2015 as a result of the rapid credit
expansion linked to the guaranteed loans program (Table 6). The NPL ratio reached a 6-year
high in April reflecting partly the cascading effects of the rescheduling of loans guaranteed by the
central bank and two years of weak economic growth. The rapid expansion in credit also reduced
banks’ equity-to-risk weighted assets while liquidity indicators, including in foreign currency,
deteriorated as evidenced by the nonobservance by several major banks of the FX liquidity ratio.7,8
However, net banking income (NBI) increased by more than 23 percent in 2015 on the back of the
guaranteed loans program,9 as well as the associated waivers on equity capital and reserve
requirements, and preferential refinancing rates.10

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
12.
The authorities’ baseline scenario envisions a strong economic recovery over the
medium term. The authorities’ baseline projections, consistent with policies under the post-Ebola
Recovery Plan (Box 3), assume growth would rebound to 5.1 percent from 2.2 percent on average
during 2011–15. The growth performance is to be driven by improved infrastructure
services—notably, health, energy and transport infrastructure—to reduce Guinea’s infrastructure
service gap and catch up with peers (Figure 1), and continued support for the agricultural sector to
exploit Guinea’s comparative advantage. Mining sector projections assume resumption in 2016 of
operations at the Simandou iron ore project, and successful expansion projects for the two largest
bauxite exporters (CBG and SMB). Inflation would decline gradually to 5 percent in 2019 and
stabilize at that level onwards. The current account deficit would increase to around 17 percent of
GDP reflecting the deterioration of Guinea’s terms of trade and imports linked to large mining
projects, and would be financed by FDI. Reserve coverage would increase to 3.8 months of imports.

6

For banks holding foreign currency deposits, a depreciation of the GNF mechanically raises reserve requirements as
these are constituted in local currency.
7

Part of these liquidity problems result from rescheduling of FX loans guaranteed by the central bank. For instance,
as of early May, the Treasury owed 2.6 million euro to a bank due mid-April 2016, and $20.8 million to another bank
falling due early March 2016.
8

On-site inspections are envisioned to examine the nature of the problem and take corrective measures.

9

Banks generated income mainly from credit with their clientele (representing 41 percent of the NBI in 2015). Other
contributions to the NBI in 2015 included: banking fees (26 percent, mainly on FX operations); cash and interbank
transactions (22 percent, notably interest on Treasury bills); and other products (11 percent).
10

Banks involved in the central bank-guaranteed loans for a road project obtained uncollateralized refinancing at the
central bank at 6 percent interest rates, compared with 11 percent for other banks. Some of these banks were also
granted waivers for non-compliance on the reserve requirements.

environment, accelerating the diversification of the economy; renewing support for agricultural intensification;
building economic infrastructure; supporting the processing and storage of agricultural products; and revitalizing
and rationalizing advisory support, the organization of producers, and research in the agricultural sector. However,
the plan is under-financed as identified financing covers less than half of the estimated costs, highlighting the need
to step-up domestic revenue mobilization efforts. The authorities are drumming up support from donors, including
by following up on financial pledges made in the context of the 2014–15 donor conferences in Washington,
Conakry, and Brussels.

13.
The authorities are also working on an alternative macroeconomic scenario that will
reflect the new government’s objectives and development strategy (¶5). Under this scenario,
growth is projected to reach 8.6 percent on average based on more ambitious investment plans.11
Compared with the authorities’ baseline scenario, the new PIP under the alternative scenario
includes the Souapiti project (Box 4), faster upgrades of the country’s road infrastructure (3 percent
of GDP), and higher investments in irrigation, land fertilization and agricultural equipment. The
private sector would also play a role through the execution of 7 projects12 in the bauxite, iron-ore
and gold sectors, the establishment of transformation units of agricultural products to increase the
value added of Guinea’s exports, and the development of large residential housing projects and
administrative buildings through PPPs. The authorities insist that an ambitious investment program
is necessary to fulfill the population massive social demands (Figure 1). In addition, the authorities
emphasize the importance of good public infrastructure services to attract private investment.

11

As spelled out in the Prime Minister’s statement of economic policies to the National Assembly. The projects
underpinning this strategy as regards the agriculture sector, the Souapiti project, and the education and health
sectors were also presented by the relevant ministers to the mission as priority projects for the years ahead.
12

By 2021, these projects would lead to (i) a doubling of the current 20 million tons installed bauxite production
capacity; (ii) a slight increase in the installed capacity for gold production; and (iii) the ramping up of iron ore
production from 0 to 16 million tons. The cost of these projects is estimated at $17 billion (260 percent of 2016 GDP).

Staff’s more conservative scenario takes into account the limited financing available
and structural bottlenecks to higher growth (Table 1–5). While higher public investment would
indeed be desirable, the authorities’ ambitious new plan is not linked to any sustainable source of
financing, leaving the projected overall budget deficit above 5 percent of GDP (Text Figure 4). In
addition, deep-seated impediments to private investment that are holding back Guinea’s
competitiveness need to be removed for a noticeable increase in private investment to be realistic.
To support the policy discussions, staff prepared a more conservative scenario based on identified
financing, the continuation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies (see section on policy
discussions below) and capacity constraints.13 The scenario does not include the Simandou and
Souapiti projects (the financing for the former is uncertain, and is under discussion for the latter),
and assumes a less optimistic path for the expansion of capacity in several mining projects (notably
SMB and CBG’s). Under this scenario, growth would average 4.5 percent over the next five years, and
inflation would decline gradually to 5 percent by 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. Given
historical external financing trends Guinea would only be able to maintain its public investment rate
at 9 percent. The current account would deteriorate reflecting the worsening terms of trade and
higher imports to sustain higher economic activity, and would be financed by debt and FDI. The
overall balance will improve, allowing reserve coverage to increase gradually to around 3 months of
imports.

The authorities are confident in their capacity to mobilize funding for their ambitious
PIP. Over the medium term, they project tax revenue to increase significantly, buoyed by high
growth, the full application of the VAT increase, the creation of the property taxation unit, higher
mining sector revenue from the expansion of existing bauxite production capacity, and closer
coordination between the Tax and Customs departments. Additional fiscal space would be
mobilized thanks to savings on public pensions and electricity subsidies resulting from the biometric
census of pensioners and the deployment of pre-paid electricity meters, respectively. The remaining
financing would come from pledges under the Ebola Recovery Plan.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: ADDRESSING DEVELOPMENT NEEDS
IN A CONTEXT OF LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Short-term policy discussions focused on policies to rebuild buffers. Medium term discussions centered
on creating fiscal space to scale-up infrastructure spending and maintaining fiscal sustainability,
sustaining exchange rate flexibility, and rebuilding the momentum for structural reforms to encourage
private sector development and economic diversification.

A. Near-term Priorities: Rebuilding Policy Buffers
16.
Authorities and staff concurred that the focus in the near-term should continue to be
on rebuilding policy buffers. Given limited financing prospects, the ongoing fiscal consolidation
(see ¶15-¶16 Country Report No. 16/95) will preserve macroeconomic stability while putting
Guinea’s economy on a stronger footing for the medium-term. Staff advised the authorities to
address the looming fiscal risks. The authorities ruled-out the possibility of cuts in fuel prices before
the end of the year, but did not commit to raising fuel pump prices if international oil prices
continue to increase.14 Staff welcomed their intention to raise electricity tariffs this year to contain
electricity subsidies, and encouraged them to keep electricity production at levels consistent with
available government support to the loss-making public electricity company. Authorities indicated
the willingness to offset any potential revenue losses on petroleum revenue, and reducing arrears to
the electricity company.15
17.
Staff urged the authorities to continue negotiations to increase the grant element of a
loan to finance the Souapiti dam, currently at 22 percent, and to invite other development
partners to contribute to the project’s finance in order to limit its impact on Guinea’s fiscal and debt
sustainability. The authorities indicated they will not sign the loan this year, and are considering
hosting a donor roundtable to tap donors’ competencies and seek financial support. They will
pursue discussions with the lender, while awaiting the results of the valuation of the Kaleta dam,
which could reduce the residual financing requirement and debt.

14

In February 2016 the authorities and labor unions agreed that fuel prices will not be raised in 2016.

15

In 2014, the ministry of finance put on the government’s books a domestic debt (0.5 percent of GDP) contracted
by the electricity company. The debt—to be paid off by 2018 in three equal tranches—was not included in the 2016
budget, will be included in the 2016 supplementary budget.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

18.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Staff and the authorities concurred
that given the pick-up in inflation,16 the monetary policy stance should remain with a tightening
bias. While a loosening of monetary policy would provide a stimulus to growth, it could fuel
inflationary pressures and prevent the achievement of the end-year international reserve targets.
Policy action to improve banks’ liquidity in local currency should be limited to allowing them to
constitute reserves in FX on their FX-denominated deposits. Staff noted that maintaining excess
reserves low (Text Figure 5) will improve the transmission of monetary policy and support an orderly
adjustment of the exchange rate. This will also incite banks to tap alternative sources of GNF
liquidity, including by (i) raising interest rates on deposits; (ii) using the BCRG’s credit facilities;17
(iii) tapping the nascent interbank market; and (iv) selling FX to the central bank against local
currency.

19.
There are indications of overvaluation of the GNF. Staff’s external stability assessment
points to a significant appreciation of Guinea’s real effective exchange rate (REER) since the last
Article IV consultation (Annex II), largely due to the positive inflation differentials against its trading
partners and non-price structural factors. As of end-2015, model-based assessments suggest an
overvaluation of 17–32 percent that contributed to the depletion of official reserves and of the
banking sector’s net foreign assets in 2015. However, about half of this misalignment was absorbed
in early 2016 with the depreciation of the currency in the context of the reform of the exchange rate
determination mechanism aimed at enhancing the role of market forces.18
20.
Next steps in the reforms of the FX market should be geared toward developing it into
a two-sided market. Against the backdrop of tighter liquidity, staff advised the central bank to
launch a rules-based FX intervention strategy19 to rebuild reserve and facilitate an orderly correction
of the residual exchange rate misalignment (about 12 percent as of April 2016). While this would
transform the current market into a bi-lateral market and add new suppliers of FX, the central bank
believes such a program could be interpreted by economic agents as signaling FX shortages. Staff
advised improving the communication of the central bank on its policies and stressed that the
immediate priority is to strictly limit central bank FX purchases to the established market, and
discontinue purchases from FX bureaus, artisanal gold miners and private corporations. The BCRG
requested TA to improve its capacity to monitor FX bureaus’ activities and ensure they are limited to
retail transactions.

B. Medium-term Priorities: A Policy Framework to Support the Scaling-up
of Infrastructure Services and Diversify the Economy
Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
21.
In light of external financing constraints and the need to rebuild buffers, staff argued
for maintaining the basic fiscal deficit around 0.5 percent of GDP over the medium term. This
level of deficit will support Guinea’s potential growth by making room for private sector credit, and
repaying domestic arrears to the private sector.20 The authorities concurred with the need to rebuild
18

The authorities introduced in January 2016 a multiple price two-way FX auction; abolished the +/- 4 percent band
outside of which banks were not allowed to transact; and allowed banks to freely purchase and sell FX from and to
their clients. Some measures still have to be implemented including the adoption of a rule-based strategy to
calibrate central bank’s interventions on the MEBD; the limitation of FX bureaus’ activities to retail transactions; and
the replacement of central bank’s currency purchases from FX bureaus, artisanal gold miners, and large companies by
a purchase program on the MEBD.
19

The FX intervention strategy would use in the decision making the last auction price, the marginal price of the
current auction, the amounts of gross and liquid reserves, and the expected off-market FX flows as exogenous
variables, as well as an intervention trigger in terms of exchange rate volatility and the foreign reserves target as
endogenous variables. An illustration of this strategy is presented in the MCM TA report “Guinea – Foreign Exchange
Operations and Liquidity Management in Transition Toward Exchange Rate Flexibility, March 2016.

An audit of domestic arrears is being conducted by the authorities who plan to adopt a schedule of
reimbursement of these arrears (structural benchmark under the ECF arrangement). These arrears feature as an
important stumbling block for unleashing the potential of the private sector.

buffers, but would like to achieve this goal by boosting growth and exports through higher
spending on infrastructure and human capital. They acknowledged the massive financing
requirements and implications on debt sustainability of their ambitious growth strategy.21 They
concurred with staff that rebuilding buffers and improving infrastructure services would require
boosting domestic revenue mobilization (¶22 and Box 5), rationalizing expenditure, enhancing value
for money of investment spending, and improving debt management. Advances in the area of PFM
reforms, including stricter enforcement of existing regulations, will also be important.
22.
Staff presented a blueprint for tax reform that would allow Guinea to tap its
unrealized tax potential estimated at 3–5 percent of GDP (Box 5).22 The authorities stressed that
efforts are underway in several areas, notably in improving the efficiency of the Tax Department,
setting up mechanisms to cross-check and exploit the Customs and Tax databases, eliminating tax
exemptions and designing policies to register informal commercial outlets. They also indicated the
newly created property taxation unit should start delivering results soon. In view of these efforts and
given the need for a strong political and social consensus for further reforms, the baseline scenario
retains reforms that would deliver an improvement in revenue performance of 1 percentage point of
GDP over the medium term. About half of the projected improvement will come from direct taxes
collected from higher income quintiles of the population, and would have limited adverse impact on
the poor. The other half would accrue from indirect taxes, including from fuel taxes, and would also
be borne mostly by wealthier sectors of the population given the structure of consumption in
Guinea.

Box 5. Guinea: Tapping a Large Tax Potential – A Blueprint for Tax Reform
A country’s tax potential is a function of the size of the tax base and its capacity to access and control it. Various
factors affect these variables, such as income per capita, openness to trade and the share of manufacturing in the
economy. A preliminary statistical analysis of the tax performance of Sub-Saharan (SSA) countries over the period
1980–2014, suggests that given Guinea’s economic characteristics, other SSA countries would have collected on
average 1 to 2 percent of GDP more in indirect taxes, and 2 to 3 percent of GDP more in direct taxes, for a total of
3 to 5 percent of GDP in tax potential.

Tightening the control of the commercial tax base will be a crucial element to tapping this potential. Available
information suggests that over ¾ of commercial imports (on which duties are paid) do not show up in turnovers
declared to the Tax Department, pointing to a large under-declaration of sales and likely distribution through
informal and/or undeclared channels. Advances in taxpayer identification, information collection and strengthening
of the audit procedures would improve tax compliance.
Income taxes will need to be simplified and expanded to new taxpayers and the rates and thresholds will need to be
revised to increase revenue and correct the imbalances introduced in 2011. Excises will need to be streamlined and
revised upwards, and fuel taxes safeguarded within a price structure that automatically adjusts to international
prices. Selected additional revisions to mining conventions could be undertaken and the new mechanisms on
transfer prices properly implemented. A rapid roll-out of real estate taxation and a gradual elimination of tax
exemptions should also be considered.

23.
Savings in the recurrent budget can free fiscal space to finance more investment. After
large base salary adjustments since 2011, salaries as a share of GDP are now comparable to those of
many African countries (Figure 3). The authorities concurred with staff that the wage bill should be kept
below 6 percent of GDP to safeguard budget flexibility and allow savings on other spending items to be
directed to public investment program, but pointed to the risks the ongoing reform of the public
administration could put on the wage bill. Staff argued for developing as a priority a medium-term
framework for wage negotiations with unions to contain volatility from ad-hoc wage adjustments,
building from the recommendations of the 2014 AFRITAC West (AFW) technical assistance on wage
policy. Other options for reducing current spending by up to 1 percent of GDP include cutting recurrent
costs of fuel and travel, allowing EDG to automatically adjust electricity tariffs to cost recovery levels
(0.5 percent of GDP), and streamlining subsidies for universities. Staff advised directing part of these
resources to the nascent social safety net, primary education, and the health system.

24.
Strengthening Public Investment Management (PIM) institutions will improve the rates of
return of the planned investments. In light of budget rigidities and financing constraints, investment
spending should be kept at around 5 percent until fiscal space from the above-mentioned measures
materializes. Improving infrastructure services could be achieved by enhancing the quality of spending
by implementing better investment processes. The first steps are to enforce the procurement code,
including competitive bidding for investment projects,23 and reform the selection process of investment
projects to ensure that projects eligible for public funding have undergone a cost-benefits analysis. The
authorities agreed in principle with the policy proposals, but stressed the importance attached to the
priority projects in the energy, agriculture and health sectors. Staff presented the results of the DIG
model (see SIP) that show that fully implementing these projects would require an adjustment of the
consumption tax rate from 20 percent to 25 percent, and increase debt from 49 percent in 2015 to
67 percent by 2036, despite the model’s optimistic assumptions in terms of the growth impact of these
projects.
25.
Staff advised continued reliance on concessional financing, and improved debt
management to contain debt vulnerabilities. While Guinea continues to face a moderate risk of
external debt distress, short term vulnerabilities have increased significantly (See Country Report 16/95),
and could be exacerbated by the results of the ongoing audit of domestic arrears. It will be important to
finalize the reform of the institutional framework for debt policy and management and empower the
National Committee for Public Debt (CNDP) to ensure all new government borrowing is in line with the
statement on national public debt policy.24 Staff encouraged the authorities to approve the PPP law by
year-end, and strengthen capacity to conduct DSAs and annex them to the budgets, starting with the
2017 budget. The authorities indicated their intention to prioritize concessional financing as much as
possible and requested technical assistance on the management of fiscal risks from PPPs.
26.
Aligning PFM processes with the new public finance organic law (LORF) will improve
transparency and help unlock donor support (Box 6). Staff suggested priority actions toward this
goal and offered Fund support in the context of the new Capacity Building Framework (CBF) for fragile
states.25 The authorities agreed with the thrust of the advice, and suggested that after the overhaul of
the PFM framework, it is important to train users. The priority actions include:


Expanding the coverage of the Single Treasury Account to all government bodies collecting
public revenue by mid-2017.

23

An audit report on large procurement contracts is being finalized. The preliminary findings of the report suggest that
the majority of large contracts awarded during the 2014–15 did not abide with the procurement code.
24

Several measures are nearing completion, including the National Public Debt Policy Statement, a manual of operational
procedures in the debt department, and the adoption of a medium-term debt strategy (2015–19).
25

The IMF Executive Board endorsed on May 22, 2015 a proposal to pilot a more structured approach for capacity
development activities in fragile states referred to as CBF. The CBF, under which Guinea has agreed to be a pilot country,
involves agreeing with authorities and key stakeholders on a medium-term program for capacity development with
specific deliverables and periodic monitoring.

Rolling out the new budget nomenclature to improve the monitoring of priority spending with a
view to protecting them from ad-hoc adjustments to financing shortfalls.



Increasing training activities, especially to enhance the capacity of line ministries in charge of social
sectors to initiate and execute their budget appropriations according to the LORF.
Box 6. Guinea: Advancing the Public Financial Management Reform Agenda
In 2011 Guinea embarked in an ambitious overhaul of its Public Financial Management (PFM) framework. Key
milestones included the revamping of the legal framework through the adoption of the Loi organique relative aux
finances publiques (LORF) in 2012, the adoption of the General Regulations on Budget Management and Public
Accounting (RGGBCP) in 2013, the adoption in May 2015 of the law on the management of public entities, the adoption
in 2015 of a new procurement code, and the establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). The new legislations
have been complemented by regulations on fiscal policy formulation, budget preparation and classification, governance
of parastatals, and public accounting. However, compliance with the new framework has lagged. Enforcing them fully
will improve the efficiency of public spending and the delivery of public services, and facilitate the mobilization of donor
support.



A first step is to adopt a medium term budget framework, based on a consensual medium-term macroeconomic
framework that will anchor revenue projections and expenditure planning. Presently, macroeconomic forecasts are
not harmonized, and revenue projections reflect historical performance and anecdotal factors instead of an
accurate assessment of the tax base. Tracking of foreign aid involves a cumbersome process which increases
uncertainty on disbursements. Moreover, the budget envelopes are not aligned with development plans, and
hardly reflect stated priorities.



Second, budget management processes need to be streamlined. Derogatory procedures should be avoided, and all
spending must be executed in line with the spending chain. This will involve delegating most budget execution
tasks to line ministries.



Third, data management processes have to be strengthened. Information on budget execution is spread across
several IT systems and stand-alone files, which are not always consistent with the approved budget. The core
system dates to 2000 is not accessible by line ministries, and data entry can be significantly delayed or incomplete.
Financial reporting and controls should be improved, notably through a better management of invoices and
netting-out of standing balances.



Fourth, budget implementation should be fully anchored in the TSA. About 1,400 governmental bank accounts
spread in commercial banks in 2012 have been redirected to the BCRG, but the TSA is not yet fully operational in
large part due to the weak institutional framework. Many of the balances are not available or not used, and the
record-keeping and forecasting functions have shown some deficiencies.



Finally, work remains to be done regarding the census of public entities and SOEs: the current count stands at 159,
but many entities attached to line ministries have not been included.

Monetary, Financial Sector, and Exchange Rate Policies
27.
Monetary policy should focus on reducing inflation to 5 percent and on rebuilding
reserves to 3–4 months of imports. The level of reserves is in line with the ECOWAS goal and strikes a
good balance between the costs and benefits of holding reserves (Box 7). Inflation is projected to be
driven mainly by fiscal and monetary developments, given Guinea’s robust agricultural potential and
projected food production. Against this backdrop, staff and the authorities concurred that loosening
monetary policy should only be considered once the 2016 fiscal consolidation is effected and after

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

GUINEA

international reserves reach the target of 3 months of imports. Other triggers for cutting the reserve
requirement rate should be a drying up of banks liquidity combined with a slowdown in private sector
credit growth below that of nominal GDP, in a context of downward trending inflation. In the meantime,
banks should continue to use the BCRG’s refinancing facilities, interbank lending, and FX sales for their
liquidity management. Staff stressed that transitioning to exchange rate flexibility over the medium term
will support reserves, competitiveness, and economic diversification. Priority actions were specified in
the December 2015 MCM technical assistance recommendations and include (i) developing liquidity
forecasting based on sound calibration of the BCRG’s open market operations; (ii) supporting the
development of a yield curve through more regular government security issuances and the publication
of reference rates for interbank transactions; and (iii) addressing market segmentation by introducing a
two-way FX auction and promoting collateralized transactions in the GNF interbank market to mitigate
the perceived counterparty risk.
Box 7. Guinea: Estimates of Reserve Adequacy
This box presents estimates the optimal level of international reserves for Guinea using the new Fund approach for
LICs, “Assessing Reserve Adequacy in Credit-Constrained-Economies” (ARA-CC)1.
The ARA-CC metric is based on an algorithm weighing the benefits of holding reserves against the opportunity cost
of holding reserves. The marginal benefit of holding reserves depends on country characteristics: a resource-rich
country and a fixed exchange rate regime, for instance, would require a higher level of reserves while a fragile state
with a flexible exchange rate arguably would call for lower reserves. The net cost of holding reserves can be
approximated either by the external funding cost (for countries with market access), the cost of sterilization, or the
marginal product of capital.
Guinea is a fragile resource-based economy with an intermediate exchange rate regime. On average, the results (Text
Table below) suggest that 3.3 months of imports could be considered an adequate level for Guinea. However, this
level can be considered a lower-bound estimate for at least two reasons: (i) the net cost of holding reserves may be
over-estimated given Guinea’s positive inflation differential against advanced economies, which implies the GNF may
continue to depreciate; thereby

Improvements in the quality of financial system supervision would allow a better
intermediation of local savings. Staff advised the authorities to accelerate the adoption of risk-based
supervision in line with the timeline agreed with AFRITAC West (AFW) and asked for strengthening the
directorate of banking supervision. The BCRG reiterated its commitment to AFW’s recommendations
and attributed the implementation delays to capacity constraints, including staffing shortages that are
being resolved. Staff welcomed the recent cap on risk concentration to 100 percent of regulatory capital
and the requirement to constitute exceptional provision of up to 15 percent of net banking income
imposed on banks that breach the prudential norm on the division of risks.26 Staff pointed that the
continued breaches of this norm by banks involved in food and fuel imports call for strengthening
banks’ capital beyond the GNF 100 billion target of June 2016.
29.
Improving competition in the banking sector and lifting structural impediments to
microfinance will promote financial inclusion and the sharing of growth dividends. Despite a
relatively large number of banks, Guinea’s financial system is one of the shallowest in the world. The
credit-to-GDP ratio and the proportion of individuals and companies using financial services stand well
below peers’.27 At the same time, Guinean banks rank amongst the most profitable in the world, given
negative real interest rates on deposits, and high interest rate spreads and banking fees.28 This reflects
low income levels, lack of competition,29 limited physical access to financial institutions, financial
illiteracy, and other barriers to credit such as weak property rights and bankruptcy procedures. The
reform by the authorities of the 2005 microfinance law and the National Strategy of Financial Inclusion
(Box 8) under preparation will unlock the potential of this sector. Staff welcomed the strategy and the
focus placed on enhancing the poor’s access to financial services rather than on keeping interest rates
low, and on the stricter enforcement of prudential regulations to lift governance standards. The
authorities concurred with the need to supplement the strategy with a comprehensive plan to reduce
the cost of bank intermediation, including through reforms of the judicial system to reduce the risks
faced by banks.

26

The number of waivers concerning the division of risks stabilized as the central bank decided to limit their granting to
the financing of oil imports and essential foodstuffs.
27

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper on Financial Inclusion.

28

Banks argue that about 40 percent of their labor force is unproductive, which could explain the large intermediation
costs but not necessarily the high profitability.
29

Three banks hold about 75 percent of total assets of the banking system.

Box 8. Guinea: Advances in Promoting Financial Inclusion
In 2014, Guinea adopted a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (Stratégie Nationale d’Inclusion Financière,
SNFI), built around four pillars: the policy and regulatory framework of mobile-based financial services, the
regulation frameworks, consumer literacy and protection, and data collection. The SNFI is being revised to
broaden its approach, include in the discussions non-bank providers of financial services (insurance and mobile
phone companies), and take into account lessons learned, like the Ebola epidemic.
Mobile banking and electronic money services penetration has been very rapid in Guinea thanks to the growth
of mobile phone services (21 percent on average since 2010). The number of subscribers soared from
4.2 million in 2010 to 10.7 million in 2015. The BCRG adopted in March 2015 wide-ranging regulation to
supervise the provision of e-money financial services. Accordingly, Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) must
now be registered at the central bank, are not allowed to remunerate deposits or supply credit, and must meet
minimum social capital standards. Areas also covered include customer protection rights, security and
traceability of operations, disclosure of tariff conditions, as well as quarterly reporting and external audit
requirements. Amendments will also include: (i) new financial products (like transfer services, domiciliation of
salaries, mobile banking, and distribution of insurance products); (ii) deposit protection; (iii) disclosures; and
(iv) competition and taxation. Analyses to elaborate national policies of financial literacy are also in progress.
Finally, the central bank intends to develop a framework for the compilation of Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) to improve data collection, within the context of a three-year TA project.

30.
Strengthening the operational independence of the Central bank will be critical for the
success of these reforms. Key measures called for in the updated Safeguards Assessment include
enforcing the legal limits to monetary financing of the budget, reforming the appointment rules of the
BCRG’s board members, and reducing the concentration of power of the Governor. After consulting
with staff, the BCRG submitted to Parliament amendments of its law to meet these goals. The central
bank is, however, reluctant to ban civil servants from seating at its board, as this would shrink the
already shallow pool of competencies. The BCRG consented that Board members holding positions in
the economic ministries (budget, finance, planning) will not have voting rights. These reforms will play
an important role in reducing fiscal dominance and facilitating the conduct of monetary policy.30

Structural Reforms
31.
Discussions on structural reform focused on raising Guinea’s low indicators of
governance, promoting economic diversification, and improving the delivery of public services.
The authorities agreed on the need to finalize the pending set of the ECF arrangement’s structural
reforms to improve the credibility of economic institutions by enforcing the public procurement code,
implementing the Government’s action plan to reform the legal system and the AML/CFT framework.
Staff encouraged them to fully enact the new mining code, considered by experts to be in line with
international standards, advising caution in the introduction of additional pieces of regulation that could
erode its comparative advantage. Reforms in the agriculture sector should be geared toward rolling out
support mechanisms aimed at enhancing productivity and poor farmers’ income while reducing the
need for government support over the medium term. Reforms of the support mechanisms for the
education should also be contemplated with a view to aligning them with social returns and boosting
human capital.
30

The BCRG sent a letter on November 2015 to the Ministry of Finance to initiate discussions on the reimbursement of
the 2014-15 central bank advances, and on the modalities of its recapitalization.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA

C. Other Issues
32.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings in
national accounts and fiscal statistics (see Informational Annex). Good progress was made with the
approval of the 2013 national accounts statistics. In light with the significant differences with GDP
estimates used for policy making, staff encouraged the authorities to swiftly reconcile the different
sources of data. The authorities pointed to the significant underestimation of GDP in the data used in
the context of the ECF arrangement and asked for AFW technical assistance to reconcile the databases.
Staff stressed that improving the coordination between government agencies will be important to
correct data discrepancies, and encouraged the authorities to develop indicators for intra-year updates
of GDP forecasts. Staff advised updating the base year (2002) of CPI data as soon as the household
survey is finalized and starting work to extend its coverage to outside Conakry. Finally, staff encouraged
the authorities to modernize the compilation methodology of government financial operations, and
ensure consistency with financing data available at the central bank.
33.
Capacity building. Staff discussed with authorities the capacity building strategy, including
commitments in the context of the Capacity Building Framework for fragile states, under which Guinea
is a pilot country. The level of TA is expected to increase significantly in the years ahead, with key areas
of assistance focusing on revenue mobilization, debt management, and expenditure rationalization,
strengthening public investment processes, monetary and exchange rate policies, and macroeconomic
statistics (including inflation, national accounts and balance of payments). The authorities welcomed the
expected gains from the CBF in terms of absorptive capacity and called for more long-term experts and
hands-on training on TA recommendations.
34.
Article VIII. Staff reviewed compliance with Article VIII under the Articles of Agreement and,
with respect to the multi-price auction, advised the central bank to avoid the occurrence of a multiple
currency practice (MCP) by continuing to ensure that the exchange rates of accepted bids at the auction
do not deviate by more than 2 percent. Staff also encouraged authorities to remove the MCP arising
from the value of the official rate lagging the weighted average commercial bank rate on which it is
based by one day. The central bank requested support from MCM to identify measures to remove the
MCP.
35.
Safeguards Assessment. An update of the 2012 assessment, completed in June 2016, noted
limited progress in some areas. In particular, the recent case of misreporting following the issuance of
large BCRG guarantees to commercial banks at the request of the government suggests fiscal
dominance in relations between the government and the central bank. Staff’s key recommendations
included that the BCRG Law be strengthened, oversight of internal controls and operations be enhanced
through closer follow up by the Audit Committee, and external auditors continue to verify program
monetary data at test dates. The central bank is in the process of finalizing a revised BCRG Law that
takes account of staff’s recommendations for submission to Parliament.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

GUINEA

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The authorities’ commitment to the ongoing fiscal adjustment is appropriate. Delivering
the planned fiscal adjustment, rebuilding reserves to three months of imports, and finalizing the reform
of the foreign exchange market will lay the basis for strong medium-term growth, improve Guinea’s
track record and credibility of economic policies and help unlock further donor support.
37.
Scaling-up of public investment should be carefully considered based on realistic
assessment. Scaling up investment in the energy and transport sectors will increase
Guinea’s long-term potential, only if they are effective and consistent with macroeconomic stability. The
authorities should develop a realistic economic scenario and formulate policies that reflect available
financing and capacity constraints. The authorities should implement these projects gradually, while
keeping the deficit in line with available financing. Tapping the tax potential, enhancing the quality and
value for money of public spending, and relying as much as possible on concessional borrowing will
provide additional fiscal space for these priority projects. PPPs carry potentially large fiscal risks and
should be used with caution.
38.
Addressing structural impediments to growth should be a top priority. Tackling these will
play a critical role in strengthening Guinea’s external competitiveness and its resilience to shocks.
Creating an enabling environment for private sector activity would help Guinea achieve its
macroeconomic objectives. In the short term, efforts should focus on finalizing the ECF arrangement
reform agenda. For the medium term, reforms should focus on strengthening the electricity and
agriculture sectors to boost growth, while safeguarding public resources.
39.
A more independent central bank will help reduce fiscal dominance and support external
stability. Monetary policy should focus on maintaining price stability and rebuilding external buffers to
at least 3 months of imports. Authorities should consider publicly announcing an inflation objective to
improve the conduct of monetary policy and accountability of the BCRG. The amendments of the
central bank law are an important step forward, but delivering the expected benefits requires strict
enforcement.
40.
Financial sector policies should aim at increasing domestic savings by improving financial
intermediation and inclusion. Strengthening financial supervision and introducing policies to lower
the costs of intermediation would also strengthen resilience to economic shocks.
41.
Staff’s analysis suggests that Guinea’s exchange rate remains somewhat overvalued. Staff
encourages the authorities to allow more flexibility of the exchange rate, swiftly implement the pending
reforms to the FX market, and consider launching a rules-based FX purchase program to rebuild
reserves.
42.
The authorities did not request and staff does not recommend approval of the multiple
currency practice maintained inconsistent with Article VIII obligations. This multiple currency
practice arises from the value of the official rate lagging by one day from the weighted average of
commercial bank rates. Currently, the authorities have no plans for its removal.
43.

26

The next Article IV consultation is expected to take place on a 24-month cycle.

Medium-Term
Macroeconomic
Framework

Prepare the economy to manage the
prospective large inflows of mining
resources and avoid Dutch diseasetype effects. Consolidate
macroeconomic stabilization, and lay
the basis for higher and diversified
growth.

Expected inflows did not materialize. Per capita GDP fell despite early advances in
structural reform, as political instability, terms of trade shocks and the Ebola epidemic
impaired GDP growth prospects.

Monetary and
Exchange Rate
Policy

Reduce inflation, and maintain a
market-determined exchange rate.

Inflation fell from 19 percent in end-2011 to 7.3 percent in end-2015. Reforms
introduced in 2015 improved the role of market forces in the FX market.

Fiscal Policy

Contain the budget deficit, and
improve PFM and the quality of
spending while increasing
allocations to priority sectors. Key
measures are: reform the tax
administration, control the wage bill,
limit subsidies by improving the
efficiency of public utilities and
reforming support to the agricultural
sector.

After significant progress during 2012–13, the Ebola epidemic and policy slippages
erased some of the gains. PFM, wage bill and subsidies reforms have been lagging
mainly due to lack of capacity implementation. Priority sector spending indicative
targets have been frequently missed.

Debt Restructuring
and Sustainability

Reach the completion point under
the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative (HIPC) as soon as
possible, and ensure post-HIPC debt
sustainability.

The HIPC completion point was reached in September 2012. The most recent DSA
concludes that Guinea continues to face a moderate risk of debt distress, but external
debt vulnerability to adverse shocks has increased. Other commitments under HIPC,
such as the audit of large public procurement contracts and the poverty database
remain to be finalized.

Structural Reforms

Improve the business climate and
remove deep-rooted bottlenecks to
investment and growth, including
poor governance, a weak judicial
system, severe power shortages, and
an inadequate road infrastructure.

The lack of competitiveness and enabling business environment continue to pose
significant challenges. However, some progress has been made in increasing the
electricity supply since 2015H2, thanks to the completion of the Kaleta Dam project.

Annex II. External Stability Assessment
Model-based assessments of the exchange rate using the IMF’s External Balance Assessment
(EBA-lite) methodology suggest a sizeable misalignment of the real effective exchange rate
between 16.2 and 32 percent. By end-2015, the overvaluation of the currency had led to a sharp
depletion of usable official reserves and of the banking sector’s net foreign asset position. The
January 2016 reform of the FX market has reduced the misalignment by about 15 percentage
points. Further FX market reforms, the reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2016, and structural
reforms will contribute to closing the residual gap.

A.

Balance of Payments and Exchange Rate Developments

1.

Guinea’s external current account deficit deteriorated slightly in 2015, standing at

18.7 percent of GDP. This has been driven by a small decrease in exports because of lower exports
of bauxite and artisanal gold. Imports slightly decreased too, due to the decline in imports of
services in part due to the impact of the Ebola epidemic and the related decline in economic activity.
2.

The external current account is expected to improve in 2016 due to the depreciation of

the exchange rate which will reduce imports before widening again over the medium term. By
2021, the current account deficit is expected to reach 20.1 percent of GDP, primarily due to an
increase in imports. Imports are expected to grow by 9.2 percent per year on average between 2017
and 2021, primarily to support the construction of infrastructure projects, while exports are
projected to grow by almost 8.6 percent per year on average over the same period, reflecting an
increase in bauxite extraction and agriculture production.
3.

Guinea’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated since the last Article IV

consultation in 2012. The appreciation of the REER was largely due to the inflation differential with
trading partners, while the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) was broadly stable until
mid-2014 when it began to appreciate because of the depreciation of the euro against Guinean
franc (GNF), after which depreciated as GNF weakened against the US dollar. In early 2016,
significant reforms to improve the role of market forces in, and the flexibility of, the foreign
exchange market resulted in a sharp depreciation of the GNF that has translated into a depreciation
of both effective exchange rates.

Model-Based Real Exchange Rate Assessments

4.

Model-based exchange rate assessments using the IMF’s External Balance Assessment

(EBA-lite) methodology suggest a sizeable misalignment of the real effective exchange rate.
The assessments use the current account and REER approaches:


The current account approach suggests

Table 1. Summary of EBA-lite Findings
Percent of GDP, unless otherwise stated

that the real exchange rate is
overvalued by 16.5 percent in 2015. A
model-based analysis indicates a norm
of -6.6 percent of GDP for the
cyclically-adjusted current account
deficit.1 Assuming an elasticity of the
current account balance with respect to
the real exchange rate of

rate adjustment necessary to eliminate the gap between the norm and the actual current
account is estimated at 16.5 percent (see Figure 2).


The REER approach indicates that the real exchange rate is overvalued by 32 percent in
2015. Similar to the current account approach, the REER model is based on a reduced form
equation of the REER.2 The ‘fitted’ real effective exchange rate is then computed as a
product of the level of economic fundamentals to the coefficients of a panel regression.
There is an exchange rate misalignment if the real effective exchange rate level cannot be
explained by the level of fundamentals using the coefficients of the regression detailed
above.

1

The current account approach estimates the exchange rate adjustment necessary to eliminate the gap between the
current account norm and the actual current account. The current account norm is made of the policy gap (the gap
between a country’s actual policies and its optimal policies) and the fitted current account (a product of the level of
economic fundamentals to the coefficients of a regression panel). The regression panel, estimated on a sample of
49 developed and emerging market economies over the period [1986–2010], includes a set of traditional
fundamentals, financial factors, cyclical/temporary factors and policy-related regressors, most of these variables
being computed as a country’s deviation from the ‘world’ counterpart (see IMF WP/13/272).
2

The explanatory variables of this model can be grouped into policy variables and non-policy fundamentals. The
policy variables include: FX intervention, interest rates, private credit, and capital controls. The non-policy
fundamentals are productivity, financial home bias, terms of trade, trade openness, NFA, output gap, aid and
remittances.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA

5.

While these estimates are subject to some error they lead to the conclusion that the

external position was substantially weaker than fundamentals in 2015. The models somewhat
overstate the magnitude of the overvaluation because of one-off effect of the Ebola outbreak that is
not captured.4 In the context of the fight against the Ebola outbreak, imports for medicines and
medical equipment increased significantly in 2015 and widened the current account deficit.
However, the counterpart donor financing of these operations, are underreported in the balance of
payments and the fiscal accounts. However, these one-off issues cannot offset the size of the
estimated misalignment, which reflect weaknesses stemming from two factors. First, the authorities’
intervention policies through the official foreign exchange auctions prevented the exchange rate
correction to its market value (Figure 1), and depleted reserves. Second, the expansionary stance of
fiscal policy with the overall fiscal deficit rising almost 5 percentage points in 2015. Non-price
factors, such as governance and infrastructure quality, also explain part of the misalignment.
6.

The authorities took the right steps to correct the misalignment, but further efforts

are required. The authorities reformed in January 2016 the operation of the foreign exchange
auction mechanism and allowed the exchange rate to fluctuate more freely. As a result, the premium
between the official exchange rate and the unconstrained bureau exchange rate has been reduced
to below 1 percent; and

exchange purchases through two-way (buy-sell) auctions. Central bank purchases of foreign
exchange, consistent with the international reserve target, leading to downward pressure on the
domestic currency would help reduce the exchange rate misalignment. A correction of the
misalignment will also be supported by the sizeable contraction in the fiscal deficit targeted in
2016—the overall deficit (after grants) is projected to be cut by 7½ percent of GDP.

A sustained improvement in competitiveness will also require an improvement in

non-price factors. Indicators of Guinea’s non price competitiveness are weak (see Section below)
and only a slight improvement has been achieved in recent years, stressing the need to accelerate
reforms to improve these indicators, including by boosting infrastructure.

Structural Competitiveness
8.

Guinea’s non-price indicators of competiveness have slightly improved since 2012 but

further progress is needed. According to the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI 2016), Guinea
ranked last out of 140 countries, from 141 out of 144 in 2012. In almost all the categories, Guinea
performs worse than the Sub Saharan Africa average and is often among the worst performers,
except in labor market efficiency. In addition, the performance of Guinea worsened in almost all
sectors (except macroeconomic environment) between 2012 and 2015. However, Guinea has slightly
improved its rankings in the World Bank’s survey-based “Doing Business Index” moving from the
171th position to the 165th position in 2016. In addition, the performance of Guinea improved in
almost all sectors between the 2012 and 2016 reports.
9.

Guinea ranks 135th out of 138th countries in the Enabling Trade index prepared by the

World Economic Forum. In terms of constraints to exporting and importing identified by firms,
access to trade finance is the most problematic factor for exporting whereas burdensome imports
procedures are the most problematic factors for importing.
10.

Various indicators continue to point to a weak governance situation in Guinea.

According to the 2015 Mo Ibrahim index of African Governance, Guinea ranks 40th over 54 in Africa.
The 2014 Transparency International report ranks Guinea 139th out of 174 in terms of Corruption
Perception Index (CPI). According to the 2016 Index of Economic Freedom, Guinea falls within the
category of mostly unfree economy, with a rank of 136th out of 165 countries overall.

____________________________

Decision point: Point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for
assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance: Amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and completion
points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at the decision point (or
25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point: Point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed at the
decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in footnote 2 above.
The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms
(i.e., floating completion point).

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guinea’s exchange rate arrangement is classified as a managed float system with no predetermined
path, after an interruption of the system during 2009–10; the de facto exchange rate arrangement
has been reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective February 5, 2015.
The system includes a multiple currency practice as the value of the official rate lags the weighted
average commercial bank rate on which it is based by one day. The Central Bank of the Republic of
Guinea (BCRG) intervenes twice a week through a multi-price foreign exchange auction market with
active commercial banks. The BCRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange
market interventions.
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 24, 2012.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK, 2011–16
(As of June 2016)

1.

The Bank’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2012–16, approved by the Board on
March 1, 2012, focuses on two pillars: (i) economic and financial governance; and (ii) infrastructure
for development. Under the first pillar, the Bank will assist in building public financial management
capacity, improving governance in the extractive sector and strengthening the central government’s
budget. Under the second pillar, the Bank will contribute to reducing the power generation gap and
further developing transport infrastructure. The mid-term review of the CSP, which was delayed due
to the Ebola crisis, was done in February 2016. This provided an opportunity for dialogue on the
Bank’s support to Guinea through the implementation of the PRSP, taking into account the fight
against Ebola, the socio-economic recovery process, and outcomes of the Abu Dhabi Conference for
the period 2015 to 2017. The Bank and Guinea’s authorities agreed to extend the end of the CSP
from 2016 to 2017 and to maintain the two pillars. The extension will: (i) allow the government and
the Bank to implement the reforms and the operations which were delayed due to the MVE; and,
(ii) allow the Bank to better prepare the next country strategy paper (2017–21) which will be aligned
on the new national development plan 2016–20 expected to be finalized in October 2016. They
agreed also that the Bank will support the development of the agricultural sector and the value
chain program Guinea intends to develop in the coming months, targeting sector reforms (including
land reform), entrepreneurship and business management (including youth), and financing (credit
and guarantees).

2.

Lending operations: During the donor and investment conference in Abu Dhabi, AfDB
announced UA 163 million ($250 million) additional resources in targeted support to the country’s
development program during the 2014–16 period through the mobilisation of all its financial and
technical assistance instruments/vehicles. In 2016 (last quarter), the Bank will conduct in close
coordination with the IMF a Debt Sustainability and Country Risk Analysis to assess whether Guinea
can be allowed more headroom for accessing the Bank’s ADB window to finance key infrastructure
projects in 2017. The 2017 Indicative Operational Program (IOP) will be fully financed in 2017 if the
analysis results in increased access to the ADB window.

3.

In the governance sector, the Bank has already approved a budget support allocation of
UA20 million in 2011 and support of UA 2.5 million through the Fragile State Facility (FSF). In
addition, the Bank restructured some non-performing projects and reallocated UA 7.5 million to an
economic governance project in 2011. This was to improve the country’s public finance
management while supporting the reforms aimed at enhancing governance, especially in the
extractive sector. The FSF support also covers public administration capacity building, particularly in
statistics and strategic planning. At the end of 2013 the Bank approved an institutional support
project of UA 11.4 million focused on improving governance in mining contract management and
on enhancing public investment and project management. A budget support operation
(UA 12 million) targeting the private sector environment and PPPs frameworks, governance (mining,
PFM, and public investment management) was approved by the board in end-June 2014 and UA
6.39 million was disbursed end-December 2014. The Bank intends to submit to board approval by
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA

end-July 2016 a programmatic budget support operation (UA 10.5 million in 2016 and indicative UA
10 million in 2017) targeting public financial management and the business climate. In addition, the
Bank intends to submit for Board approval by end-July 2016 a capacity building project aimed at
scaling-up and enhancing the government capacity to manage the Simandou Mining project
(mining one stop shop, local content policy, communities, etc.). By end 2016 the Bank will support a
small dedicated capacity building operations targeting Central Bank (BCRG) for UA 2 million. The
Agricultural project the Bank intends to support in 2017 for at least UA 10 million at the beginning
of the program will target the governance of the sector, entrepreneurship (including youth), and
financing issues (credit and guarantees).

4.

In the energy sub-sector, two projects were signed at the end of 2013 and began
implementation in 2014. The first project is the second Conakry Electrical Networks Rehabilitation
and Extension Project (PREREC.2) for UA 11 million. The second project is the
Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia- Sierra Leone-Guinea power regional interconnection project for UA
40.2 million that will see the construction of 1,360 km of 225 kV transmission lines and 12
sub-stations. In 2015, the Bank approved the financing the interconnection project of the Gambia
River Basin Development Organization (OMVG) involving the construction of a dam and a 240 MW
hydro-power plant at Kaleta already financed by the government with a loan from China.
Implementation of these three projects will result in: (i) an increase in the average electricity access
rate; (ii) a reduction in the kWh generating cost; (iii) a reduction in the number of power outages;
(iv) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs; and (v) a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Contingent on the resource mobilisation strategy related to the headroom related to debt and
country risk analysis to be discussed with the country and the IMF, the Bank is working on financing
for the Guinee-Mali interconnection project, which could be submitted to the Board approval in
2017.

5.

In the transport sub-sector, the Board approved in December 2014 the road
development and Transport Facilitation Programme within the MRU including the road Danané
(Côte d’Ivoire)-Frontier of Guinea and from the frontier to N’zoo-Lola (Guinea). This road is part of a
regional project including these key roads: Zantiébougou-Kolondiéba-Kadiana-Frontier of
Côte d’Ivoire (140 km) linking Bamako to Abidjan and San-Pédro through the axe
Tengréla-Boundiali-Séguéla-Daloa; and Duekoué-Guiglo-Bloléquin-Toulepleu-Frontier of Liberia.
These roads are part of the Transafrican Dakar-Abidjan-Lagos road. The Bank intends also to
co-finance in 2017 with the European Union a road program including the Coyah-FarmoriahPamelap road towards Sierra Leone, the Boké (Guinea)-Quebo (Guinea-Bissau) road, which is part of
the ECOWAS Regional Transport Programme, and the feasibility studies for the Kankan-MandianaOdiene road. Because of their integrative role, construction of these roads is in line with the New
Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Short-Term Action Plan, whose core objective is to
have interstate roads without any impediment to the free movement of goods and persons.
Contingent on the availability of a headroom related to Debt and Country risk analysis to be
discussed with the country and the IMF, the Bank will finance in 2017 the building of interchanges
on four key crossroads (Hamdalaye, Cosa, Bambeto, Encho5).

6.

Support to private sector operations. During the 2014–17 period, the Bank will support
specific private sector operations with high and transformative impact. At the request of the
government, AfDB envisages to contribute to efforts to mobilise resources for financing the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

GUINEA

infrastructure part of the Simandou mining project. In this regard, AfDB intends to provide an A loan
of about UA 200 million equivalent to about USD 300 million which will leverage at least a
USD 700 million billion loan. Africa50 will also contribute to the financing of this project at a later
stage. AfDB intends to provide an A loan of about USD 100 million for financing part of the Global
Alumina Bauxite project. AfDB will also support capacity building and provide technical assistance in
order to allow the government to fulfil its commitment pertaining to the implementation of the
Simandou project.

7.

Non-lending operations: To deepen the analysis and understanding of the country’s main
challenges and fuel strategic reflexion, the Bank will help the government finalize in 2015, and in
collaboration with UNDP, an economic and sector works (ESWs) on (i) private sector profile and
(ii) local taxation. The Bank will enhance its dialogue and provide specific technical assistance on PPP
(PPP law and PPP Unit) and on mining sector governance. The Bank will also continue to support
implementation of PRSP (direct support to CTSP and SP-SRP in charge of coordinating the
monitoring of the implementation of economic reforms programs and the PRSP), post-Abu Dhabi
commitments implementation, and the link between macroeconomic/budget framework sector
policies and the public investment plan. The Bank will continue its support through the FSF
programme to the National Statistics Development Strategy (NSDS) and the conduct of the Third
General Population and Housing Census (RGPH-III).

8.

Trust Funds: In addition to the ADF and FSF allocations, the Bank could mobilize
supplementary resources from the ADB private sector window (including enclave operations in the
mining sector infrastructure), and the Trust Fund resources to finance complementary operations in
the sectors covered in the 2012–16 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and that are important for the
country’s development. For example, through the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, a
strategy could be prepared in that area. Other instruments also available are the Partial Risk
Guarantee Instrument, the Global Environment Fund, and the Africa Carbon Facility and Green Fund.

9.

Response to the Ebola crisis. The AfDB has adopted a regional approach to address the
Ebola crisis. In April 2014, the Bank provided an emergency support of USD 2 million UA equivalent
to USD 3 million grant to support Mano River Union (MRU) countries affected namely Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone. In July 2014, the AfDB approved a UA 40 million equivalent to
USD 60 million grant for countries fighting against Ebola. In October 2014 the AfDB approved UA
100 million sector budget support in order to support the three most affected countries. AfDB
approved also in October 2014 a UA 7.7 million Technical Assistance Capacity Building Programme
to support the national and foreign health workers programs. The total Bank’s support for Guinea
amounts to UA 35 million (USD 52 million) and aims to help the government enhance the
immediate response but also structure a medium to long term plan. The AfDB will support the
government’s 2015-2017 post-Ebola recovery plan by accelerating the execution of planned projects
and mobilizing additional resources for new operations/projects.

10. African Development Bank and Fund staff collaboration: sharing of information on the
ECF-supported program, the macroeconomic situation, the budget, progress in structural reform,
planned missions, and mission reports.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 1, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings in national accounts and fiscal
statistics.
National Accounts: Real sector statistics are incomplete, and published with insufficient timeliness to support economic
policymaking. Statistics on economic activities are published less frequently and less regularly; the monthly bulletin of the
Guinean economy is trying to include the limited available macroeconomic variables. Monthly surveys of mining, industrial and
agricultural production are produced with delays. A series based on 1993 SNA was released in August 2014 along with brief
analyses on main aggregates and methodological notes. Following AFRITAC West’s recommendation, the National Institute of
Statistics plans to implement the 2008 SNA with 2015 as new benchmark year. Employment and population statistics are
published on an annual frequency.
Price Statistics: The monthly consumer price index (CPI), which only covers Conakry, is published in a timely manner with 2002
as base year.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Economy and Finance compiles comprehensive monthly budgetary central
government data on a cash basis for revenue, and on commitment and cash basis for expenditure based on a national
presentation not comparable to international standards. The last Government Finance Statistics (GFS) technical assistance (TA)
mission found that public finance reforms are progressing slowly in Guinea, with most progress in the adoption of the new
budget nomenclature and the new State’s chart of accounts. The current compilation methodology of the government
operations tables (TOFE) needs to be modernized, which is currently reconciled with budgetary execution and financing data.
The production of the TOFE based on GFSM 2001/2014 will require the use of the data outside the general accounting system,
as it lacks comprehensiveness and timeliness. Cash-based general accounts must also be improved along with the gradual
implementation of accrual accounting. Implementation of these reforms will require new IT systems, training and manuals. The
data produced by the debt office is of fair quality, although it does not yet include the financing of new infrastructural projects.
Data on extra-budgetary units, local government and central government investments in public and private corporations is
available, but will need to be assessed from a GFS perspective. Complete accounts for the social security funds sub-sector of
good quality are also available.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Central Bank and deposit money bank accounts as well as the monetary survey are
compiled and shared with the African Department on a monthly basis, for the purposes of program monitoring. Some delays
have been experienced with commercial banks data, which still needs to be improved. Coordination between the Central Bank
and the Ministry of Economy and Finance is improving, reducing discrepancies between monetary and fiscal data. However, the
ongoing migration to a new accounting system at the Central Bank has led to frequent data changes and to delays in the
provision of monetary statistics. Monetary data used to assess program performance are certified by an independent external
auditor on a regular basis. Monetary and financial sector data reports to the Statistics Department (STA) experience significant
delays, and the latest available data corresponds to June 2012. In January 2014, STA provided TA to the BCRG to start
reporting monetary data using the recommended standardized report forms (SRFs).

Financial Sector Surveillance: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) are consolidated on a quarterly basis by the Central Bank.
Guinea does not report FSIs to STA.
External Sector Statistics: The Central Bank compiles annual Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
statistics in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Although the quality of external sector
statistics (ESS) has improved since 2008, the central bank does not take advantage of all data sources within to compile the ESS.
A balance of payments survey has been implemented with a response rate of over 75 percent.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Guinea participates in the General Data Dissemination System, No data ROSC is available.
but the metadata have not been updated since 2003.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Guinea
July 22, 2016
Our Guinean authorities would like to thank staff for their candid reports which reflect the
constructive policy dialogue held under the 2016 Article IV consultation in Conakry. The
discussions covered the challenges facing the economy as well as the opportunities lying in
the country’s buoyant natural resource endowment and the authorities’ upcoming
development plan.
Guinea is implementing an ECF-supported program whose 6th and 7th reviews were
successfully completed in March 2016. Despite the country’s situation of fragility associated
with the shocks of the Ebola pandemic and the sharp decline in commodity prices, our
authorities have taken unpreceded measures to boost growth, improve public financial
management and create a conducive environment for private sector development.
Furthermore, for the period ahead, they are developing an ambitious five-year plan to unlock
the development potential and diversify the economy. Key pillars of their strategy include
making significant steps to close the energy and infrastructure gaps, boosting production in
the mining sector, revamping the agriculture sector and increasing human capital.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

The recent period is marked by a steady recovery from the Ebola outbreak, which took a
huge toll in human lives and socio-economic loss. After averaging 1.8 percent over the
2012–15 period, growth is projected to rebound to 3.7 percent in 2016. Activity will benefit
from higher energy provision from the newly built Kaleta hydroelectric dam. Inflation has
picked up to 7.9 percent but should decline gradually to 5 percent in 2019.
Our Guinean authorities have initiated a strong fiscal consolidation to reverse the
expansionary stance of the past years. As a result, the basic fiscal balance turned to a surplus
of 1.2 percent of GDP during the first quarter of 2016, that is 2.4 percent of GDP above the
program target. For the whole year, the fiscal deficit is projected to contract sharply to
0.4 percent of GDP from 7.1 percent in 2015. Such effort in an environment of high social
demand and required public investment is a clear sign of the authorities’ strong commitment
to rebuild buffers and enhance macroeconomic stability.
For the medium term, the authorities remain more optimistic while staying alert vis-à-vis
some of the risks pointed to by staff. Projections on both sides are consistent with respective
perceptions. The authorities’ baseline scenario backed by the Post-Ebola Recovery Plan
assumes growth to stand at 5.1 percent in the medium term against 4.5 percent under staff’s
conservative scenario. Moreover, the government’s five-year plan under discussion set more
ambitious goals. High public and private investments should further boost electricity supply
notably through the Souapiti dam, enhance road infrastructure, increase mining output and
boost agriculture production.

2
External stability is benefitting from the recent tightening of monetary policy. The latest
developments communicated by the authorities indicate that the level of international buffers
points to 3 months of imports.
Our authorities are cognizant that sound policymaking and decisive reforms will be critical
in the period ahead to sustain their efforts towards high and inclusive growth and spur
economic transformation. In this regard, they remain committed to pursue fiscal and
monetary policies conducive to macroeconomic stability while stepping up structural
reforms.
II. MACROECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL POLICIES GOING FORWARD

Fiscal policy
The authorities will continue their efforts to restore fiscal sustainability. In this regard, the
ongoing consolidation is viewed as an important step to break from the past and put public
finances on a sound footing. Government has adopted a freeze on spending while measures
are being taken to boost revenue. Subsidies in the electricity sector are maintained as
programed in the 2016 budget. On the revenue side, an array of measures is underway to
enhance tax collection, including; (i) eliminating tax exemptions; (ii) registering informal
commercial outlets; (iii) setting up mechanisms to cross-check and exploit the Customs and
Tax databases; (iv) creating a property taxation unit; and (v) improving the efficiency of the
Tax Department. Our authorities have also welcomed staff presentation of a blue print for tax
reform that would help tap the 3–5 percent of GDP tax potential. This analysis will feed into
the internal thinking on ways to broaden the tax base and enhance revenue collection.
Our authorities are also taking actions to improve public financial management. Guinea has
adopted far-reaching laws and procedures in PFM and the authorities are committed to
enhance enforcement of existing regulations from all public officials. In this regard,
emphasis will be put on public procurements and value for money of investment spending.
In the same vein, the authorities pay due regard to debt sustainability in their financing
strategy and intend to seek concessional resources to the most possible. This principle will
guide their efforts in closing the energy infrastructure gap, including on the Souapiti project,
which remains critical in the authorities’ plan to boost electricity supply as a key factor for
high and sustained growth. Financing scenarios are under discussion and assistance from
donors is being sought to minimize costs to public finances.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
The reform of the relationship between the fiscal and monetary authorities is key to our
authorities; with the goal of enhancing the framework for monetary and exchange rate
policies and avoiding the reoccurrence of issues of the like of the recent guaranteed loans. In

this regard, important recommendations from the Safeguards Assessment aimed at
strengthening the operational independence of the Central bank have been included in the
new BCRG law. The draft law has been discussed by Cabinet and is being further improved
before submission to Parliament. The changes include enforcing the legal limits to monetary
financing of the budget, reducing the concentration of power of the Governor and limiting
intervention from ministry officials seating at the Board to non-voting roles.
In terms of policies, the BCRG has made good progress on the exchange rate policy and
management, including the reform of the exchange rate determination mechanism aimed at
enhancing the role of market forces. As a result, the gap between the official and the parallel
exchange rates has been significantly narrowed in addition to enhancing the transmission
mechanisms. Going forward, efforts will continue to be made in strengthening international
reserves and in meeting the medium term inflation target.
Financial sector issues
Our authorities share staff assessment made in the Selected Issues paper on the shallowness
of the financial sector, the limited competition and access, as well as the many impediments
to the development of microfinance institutions. Many initiatives are underway to strengthen
banks, improve supervision and competition and promote financial inclusion. On
supervision, the BCRG is making steps to address capacity constraints and implement the
risk-based supervision as agreed with AFRITAC West. The authorities have adopted in
2014, a multi-pronged National Strategy for Financial Inclusion to address key bottlenecks
and promote financial inclusion. The implementation has been slowed by the Ebola outbreak,
but should gain traction following the ongoing revision of the strategy. It is built around four
pillars - the policy and regulatory framework of mobile-based financial services, the
regulation frameworks, consumer literacy and protection, and data collection – and
emphasizes actions to enhance access to financial services, especially for the poor. This will
be paired with initiatives to strengthen the banks, including lifting governance standards.
The authorities also take good note of staff additional recommendations to increase
competition and reduce intermediation costs, facilitate mobile financial services, improving
financial literacy, simplify regulations and improve the judicial system to reduce risks for
banks. Likewise, they will step up actions to revamp the microfinance sector which has
proved effective in increasing access for populations living in rural areas or involved in the
informal sector.
It is our authorities’ belief that the development of the financial sector and access will go
hand in hand with the overall effort to further modernize the economy and reduce
informality. As more activities are brought to the formal sector, thus enlarging the tax base,
those actors will seek financial services for their growing activities.

Structural reforms
Cognizant of the need to bolster structural reforms for entrenching growth and promoting
economic diversification, our authorities endeavor in many areas, including improving the
business environment especially enacting the new mining code, enforcing the public
procurement code and reforming the agriculture sector.
Agriculture remains with electricity a priority sector the government intends to overhaul
through important projects. Traditional and new cash crops such as cashew, palm trees,
coffee and cocoa are planned to be developed. A massive undertaking is also envisaged to
meet the demand in foodstuffs, rice in particular, which is mainly supplied through large
imports. To enhance domestic agricultural production, the government is expecting
investments in irrigation technologies, rural road infrastructure and storage facilities. Under
their development plan, processing agricultural products is also contemplated as a means to
diversify the economy and create jobs.
Improving the business environment with the view to attract more private investment is a
major endeavor for our authorities. To this end, a particular emphasis is put on improving the
judicial system, in addition to the efforts to upgrade the physical infrastructure notably roads
and electricity. The government is also planning campaigns to showcase Guinea as a top
destination for investment and business opportunities. In the same vein, our authorities are
committed to maintain efforts to enhance democracy and promote peaceful elections.
III. CONCLUSION
Guinea has come a long way. The country was reaping the democratic dividends following
the 2011 elections when it was hit hard by the Ebola outbreak. Compounded with the
commodity price fall, these shocks slowed the growth momentum. Thanks to the authorities’
strong resolve and response, paired with the assistance of the international community, the
country is now Ebola-free. The government has resumed its efforts towards economic
transformation and poverty reduction. The impressive fiscal adjustment initiated in 2016 is
meant to ensure macroeconomic stability, build buffers and create the space for the
investment envisaged under the authorities’ development plan. In the same vein, structural
reforms will be pursued with the view to diversify the economy and create jobs. The support
of the financial community, including the Fund, will continue to be instrumental in our
authorities’ strategy to create prosperity and reduce poverty.
