IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Italy
On July, 1, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Italy.
The economy is emerging gradually from a prolonged recession. Financial market sentiment and
confidence indicators have improved substantially since end-2014. Despite the recent bouts in
volatility, sovereign bond yields have fallen to pre-crisis levels buoyed by the European Central
Bank’s quantitative easing (QE). Bank and corporate funding costs have declined. Rising
business and consumer confidence has stemmed the decline in domestic demand. Against this
backdrop, the economy is expected to recover moderately, with real GDP projected to expand by
0.7 percent in 2015, supported by domestic demand and net exports. With the favorable tailwinds
from QE continuing and investment gaining further momentum, growth is projected to pick up to
1.2 percent in 2016.
Policies at the European level such as QE and more flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact
have been instrumental to support demand. At the national level, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s
government has set out an ambitious agenda to overhaul Italy’s political and economic system.
The Jobs Act, an overhaul of Italy’s labor market, was approved by Parliament in December and
has largely been implemented. A new law to convert Italy’s largest cooperative banks into joint
stock companies has spurred expectations of consolidation in the sector. Reforms of product and
services markets, public administration, education, judicial, and tax system are also progressing.
There is now a window of opportunity to push ahead with deeper reforms to re-ignite growth.
This requires continued actions and strong implementation efforts on multiple fronts, which are
mutually reinforcing. A wide-ranging reform to raise the efficiency of public services is
envisaged and would help tackle the long standing productivity problem. Product market reforms
in sectors that remain highly regulated such as transportation would also improve productivity. A

broad-based strategy to strengthen bank and corporate balance sheets, including an enhanced
insolvency regime and standard criteria for bank assessments of the viability of small and
medium enterprises, will support recovery. Fiscal rebalancing is needed to further reduce the
high taxes on labor and capital, through savings from past and ongoing spending reviews.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their bold policy actions, which, together
with actions at the European level, have contributed to the turnaround of Italy’s economy from a
prolonged recession and have improved confidence. Nevertheless, the recovery is still fragile,
and medium term prospects are held back by structural bottlenecks, high unemployment, weak
balance sheets, and elevated public debt. Directors emphasized that addressing these challenges
requires full implementation of policy efforts and broad-based structural reforms, building on the
many achievements over the past year. They agreed with the focus on raising productivity,
strengthening the financial health of banks and corporations; and pursuing growth-friendly fiscal
consolidation.
Directors welcomed progress on structural reforms to improve productivity and the business
climate, notably in the labor market, public administration, governance, and the judicial and tax
systems. They encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the various initiatives to improve
public sector efficiency, local public services, and competition in the product and service
markets. Directors looked forward to prompt adoption of key draft laws in these areas,
particularly those on public administration reform and annual competition.
Directors commended the authorities for the enactment of the Jobs Act, noting that its full
implementation will help reduce segmentation and duality, and facilitate the reallocation of
workers across jobs. They stressed the importance of completing the planned reforms of the
wage supplementation scheme and the educational system. Directors also saw scope for
decentralizing wage setting to make labor more responsive to economic conditions.
Directors supported the authorities’ comprehensive strategy to strengthen bank and corporate
balance sheets, thereby facilitating credit flows to the economy. They considered it a priority to
accelerate the reduction of nonperforming loans with decisive actions to improve provisioning,
speed up write-offs, revive the market for distressed debt, including through a carefully designed
state‐backed asset management company, and streamline insolvency procedures. Directors noted
the benefits of complementing these measures with targeted action to tackle small- and
medium-size enterprises in distress, by introducing standard criteria for bank assessments of their

viability and guidelines for creditor-led restructuring. Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to
improve access to finance and to strengthen governance in the banking and corporate sectors
more broadly.
Directors agreed that the current fiscal policy stance strikes the right balance between supporting
economic growth and reducing the public debt ratio. They supported measures to lower labor and
capital taxes, financed by cuts in spending and efficiency savings, informed by expenditure
reviews. Directors looked forward to strict implementation of the 2015 budget, and saw merit in
targeting a modest structural surplus over the medium term, complemented with ambitious
privatization efforts, with a view to advancing debt reduction, building buffers, and ensuring
compliance with EU fiscal rules.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Seizing the Window of Opportunity for Reform and Growth
Context: Euro area-wide policies and national efforts have supported a turnaround in
market sentiment and real activity. Italy’s performance since the crisis, however, has been
among the weakest in the euro area. Real activity and investment are still far from their
precrisis levels; unemployment is high; and public debt, at 130 percent of GDP, is a
source of risk. Low productivity and impaired balance sheets continue to weigh on the
recovery and cloud medium-term growth prospects.
Policies: There is now a window of opportunity to push ahead with deeper reforms to
re-ignite growth. This requires actions on multiple fronts, which are mutually reinforcing:


Tackling the long standing productivity problem. A wide‐ranging reform to raise
the efficiency of public services at all levels of government would not only provide
better quality and cheaper services but would also raise private sector productivity.
The implementation of the Annual Competition law would further liberalize product
and service markets, benefiting producers and consumers. Completing the Jobs Act
would create better incentives to hire and train workers, while greater firm-level
wage bargaining will make labor more responsive to economic conditions.



Supporting balance sheet repair. A broad-based strategy to strengthen bank and
corporate balance sheets will support recovery. More provisioning and write-offs, a
revived distressed debt market, and enhanced insolvency regime would accelerate
the reduction of NPLs. Establishing standard criteria for bank assessments of the
viability of SMEs and introducing guidelines for creditor-led restructuring would
accelerate the process of dealing with distressed SMEs.



Rebalancing fiscal adjustment and reducing public debt. Fiscal rebalancing is
needed to reduce the high taxes on labor and capital, through savings from past and
ongoing spending reviews. The planned small fiscal adjustment is appropriate in the
near term, given the still-weak growth and high debt. In the medium term, a modest
structural surplus would reduce debt faster, providing valuable insurance against
changes in market sentiment, and helping comply with EU fiscal rules. More
ambitious privatization targets would also help.

CONTEXT: A LAGGING RECOVERY
1.
The economy is emerging gradually from a prolonged recession. Financial market
sentiment and confidence indicators have improved substantially since end-2014. Despite the recent
bouts in volatility, sovereign bond yields have fallen below precrisis levels buoyed by the ECB’s
quantitative easing (QE). The stock market has rallied; bank and corporate funding costs have fallen;
and rising business and consumer confidence has stemmed the decline in domestic demand. In the
second half of 2014, private consumption continued to recover, supported by pent-up demand for
consumer durables and expectations of better employment prospects. Investment expanded slightly
in the last quarter of 2014. After 14 quarters of almost stagnant or contracting real activity, the
economy expanded by 0.3 percent q-o-q in 2015:Q1, on the back of rebounding investment
(Figure 1).
2.

The nascent recovery has been grounded in recent policy actions.



At the European level: Recent measures have provided much-needed demand support. QE has
had a powerful effect on asset prices, including bond yields and the euro (Figure 2); TLTROs
have improved funding conditions; the ECB’s Balance Sheet Assessment (BSA) has helped
resolve uncertainty about bank balance sheets; and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) flexibility
has allowed Italy’s fiscal stance to be fairly neutral in the near term.



At the national level: Prime Minister Renzi’s government has set out an ambitious agenda to
overhaul Italy’s political and economic system. While progress was initially slow and piecemeal—
reflecting the resistance of vested interests—reform momentum has picked up, contributing to
higher confidence. The Jobs Act, an overhaul of Italy’s labor market, was approved by Parliament
in December, and several of its elements have been implemented. A new law to convert Italy’s
10 largest cooperative banks, representing 15 percent of banking system total assets, into joint
stock companies has spurred expectations of consolidation in the sector and fuelled gains in
banks’ shares. Reforms of product and services

judicial and tax system are also progressing.

3.
Despite the positive uptick, the recovery
is lagging and fragile. Italy’s performance since
the crisis has been among the weakest in the euro
area.


Real activity is still far from precrisis levels and
private investment is 30 percent below its 2008
level. The output gap in 2014 exceeded
4½ percent, one of the largest in the euro area.



Headline inflation was positive in May 2015 after turning negative for some months in the
second half of 2014 and early 2015, but continues to hover around low levels. Part of the decline
in the price level is explained by the sharp drop in oil prices. Core inflation is below 1 percent,
suggesting that weak demand and the large output gap also play a role. Long-term inflation
expectations are still significantly below the ECB’s objective.



Real lending rates to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have come down but remain
relatively high. More importantly, credit to the corporate sector continues to contract.



Unemployment exceeds 12 percent and is even higher if workers in the wage supplementation
scheme are included, and among the

Diagnosis
4.
What is the root cause behind Italy’s persistent growth weakness? Structural
bottlenecks, depressed demand, impaired balance sheets, and subdued growth expectations have
all reinforced each other, pushing the economy into low-growth equilibrium.


Structural bottlenecks: Productivity has been stagnant since the early 2000s (Figure 3). There
are many possible explanations—including an inefficient public sector; high levels of taxation; a
lengthy judicial process; a fragmented labor market and inflexible workplace practices; and
underdeveloped corporate financing markets—which have perpetuated an unfavorable business
model. As a result of these structural rigidities and the loss of an important adjustment
mechanism with the adoption of the euro, Italy has struggled to respond to the rapid global
changes of the 2000s (IT revolution, the rise of China).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY



Depressed demand: With high public debt, there was little fiscal space to support the economy
after the global crisis. Also, financial fragmentation along national borders led to a pro-cyclical
tightening in monetary conditions. Given nominal wage and price rigidities and structural
impediments to the reallocation of resources across firms and sectors, the economy was unable
to adjust.



Impaired public and private balance sheets: The collapse in demand deteriorated the health
of firms and banks. In turn, balance sheet weaknesses exacerbated the decline in economic
activity—investment was held back by reduced credit supply (due to financial constraints) and
credit demand (due to muted confidence and debt overhang). The prolonged recession also
contributed to a steady rise in the public debt‐to‐GDP ratio.



Self-fulfilling expectations: Subdued growth expectations and policy uncertainty fed into
lower investment and weak activity.

Outlook and Risks
5.
Against this backdrop, the economy is expected to recover only moderately in 2015–
16. Following a contraction of 0.4 percent in 2014, real GDP is projected to expand by 0.7 percent in
2015, supported by domestic demand and net exports. The latter will benefit substantially from the
depreciation of the euro as a result of QE and the lower oil prices. With the favorable tailwinds from
QE continuing—and with investment gaining further momentum—growth is projected to pick up to
1.2 percent in 2016.
6.
The large output gap is projected to close only gradually given the deep output losses
and the moderate pace of recovery. In the short term, loose monetary conditions, low oil prices,
reduced policy uncertainty, greater confidence from the renewed reform momentum and policy
efforts to strengthen lending will support the rebound of private investment from its current
depressed levels, while the fiscal stance remains broadly neutral. Over the medium term, growth is
projected to hover around 1.1 percent, with the contribution from net exports likely subdued due to
a rise in imports as private demand strengthens. As a result, the output gap is projected to narrow
slowly from 4 percent in 2015 to 0.8 percent in 2020. With real activity still below potential even at
the end of the projection period, inflation is expected to stay below the 2 percent target and
unemployment to remain over 10 percent throughout the period.
7.
Without the full implementation of deep structural reforms, longer-term growth
prospects remain bleak. Potential growth estimates are low, at about ½ percent, reflecting crisis
legacies such as the collapse in investment, but also unfavorable demographics and the slowdown
in productivity that predates the crisis (Box 1). Progress on the ambitious reform agenda has been
important in lifting confidence and supporting the cyclical recovery. However, the weak
implementation record of past reforms calls for conservative estimates of the long run growth
dividend of ongoing and planned reforms. Similar to the approach taken by the authorities, the
potential growth projections do not incorporate the likely effect of announced structural reforms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

Box 1. Potential Output in Italy
Identifying potential output is important at the current
juncture. Estimates of potential output have been revised
dramatically over the past 8 years, suggesting the crisis has
had a lasting effect on labor, capital, and total factor
productivity (TFP). A multivariate filter approach was used to
re-estimate potential output for four EA countries (France,
Germany, Italy, and Spain). This method incorporates
empirical relationships between actual and potential GDP,
unemployment, and inflation. Judgment using additional
information on capacity utilization and the labor market
improves the plausibility of results.
Potential growth in Italy declined significantly already in
the precrisis period and then further during the crisis. A
drop in TFP growth accounts for most of the decline prior
to the crisis. During the crisis, around ½ of the drop in
potential growth comes from lower capital contribution
(due to the collapse in investment), with the remaining
shortfall evenly split between TFP and labor (due to the
increase in structural unemployment).
Compared to other large EA countries, Italy’s TFP
growth lags behind. Structural characteristics including
government inefficiency, the small size of firms, and labor
and product market rigidities may explain differences in
average TFP growth rates. The analysis suggests that the
slowdown in TFP growth in Italy may be related to the
lower ICT diffusion in the Italian services sector—a result
of rigid product market regulations. Previous studies have
also found that the inability of Italian SMEs to (i) respond
to the challenge of increased competition from China and
(ii) take advantage of the ICT revolution given the lack of
meritocracy in managerial selection and promotion, may
explain some of the TFP slowdown.

and a return to positive investment. However, as capital
and labor accumulation is likely to remain subdued in the near future, raising potential growth hinges on
Italy’s ability to lift productivity through structural reforms.

8.
Italy’s competitiveness has suffered from stagnant productivity and rising labor costs.
As detailed in the External Sector Report Assessment (Annex I), Italy’s external position as of 2014 is
broadly consistent but likely still weaker than suggested by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. Despite the improvement in the current account surplus in 2014, in
structural terms it is still 0–1.5 percent of GDP weaker than justified by fundamentals and

appropriate policies. And while Italy’s share of world exports has generally moved in parallel with its
European peers, price-based indicators of competitiveness—particularly those based on unit-labor
cost—have deteriorated since Italy joined the euro area both in absolute terms and relative to the
euro area average. Taking into account a broad range of indicators and model-based estimates of
the REER gap for 2014, staff considers that a real effective depreciation of 0–10 percent—supported
by structural reforms—would be appropriate to restore competitiveness. Given the 9 percent
depreciation of the euro since the end of 2014, Italy’s external position will likely strengthen in 2015.

9.
The risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. These risks are interconnected and if they
were to materialize, regional and global spillovers could be significant (see RAM):


Downside: Stagnation and low inflation that complicate efforts to reduce public debt remain an
important downside risk. Confidence may suffer if public support for the reform agenda wanes.
If unabated by a forceful area-wide policy response, adverse developments in Greece could have
a substantial impact on Italy via confidence effects, though direct exposures are limited.



Upside: QE, euro depreciation, and lower oil prices could have a larger positive impact than
currently expected. Rapid progress on the domestic reform agenda could boost confidence
further and spur a faster recovery. The authorities estimate that the structural reforms already
announced could raise trend growth by about 1/3 percentage point by 2020, if fully
implemented.2

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent,
and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non‐
mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Authorities’ Views on Economic Outlook and Risks
10.
The authorities expected a slightly stronger pickup in growth in 2016. QE was
anticipated to contribute significantly to the recovery through the exchange rate and interest rate
channels—with an estimated cumulative impact of 0.7 (MEF) and 1.4 (BOI) percent in 2015 and 2016.
The decline in oil prices could add another 0.3 percentage points cumulatively over 2015 and 2016.
However, erring on the side of caution, the

are improving, and lending rates have declined. Furthermore, the latest investment survey of Italian
firms suggests widespread and growing optimism both in the construction and services sectors.
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the overall assessment of the external sector. They
concurred that further improvement in competitiveness would be desirable to lift potential growth.
However, they cautioned against relying too much on labor-based indicators of competitiveness,
which show a much wider gap than other price-based measures.
12.
Domestic and external risks have receded owing to recent actions at the EU level,
domestic political stability, and the strong reform agenda. Important upside risks stem from
their conservative estimates of the impact of QE, euro depreciation, and oil price decline, as well as
the effect of recently implemented and planned structural reforms. The authorities considered that
risks from very low inflation had diminished somewhat, in light of the recent pickup in inflation
expectations. The BOI expected QE to push up inflation with an estimated impact of just over
0.5 percent both in 2015 and 2016. With confidence gathering momentum, contagion risks from
adverse developments in Greece were seen as limited in the near term. However, there was more
concern about longer-term implications, if perceptions about the irreversibility of the euro area were
to change permanently.

SEIZING THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
13.
There is now a window of opportunity to push ahead with deeper reforms to lift
growth and reduce unemployment. This will help move the economy out of its low-growth

14.
PM Renzi’s reform agenda includes ambitious initiatives in many areas. The National
Reform Program (NRP) aims to revive the Italian economy by (i) improving the business
environment through an overhaul of public administration, civil justice reform, and further
liberalization of product and services markets; (ii) raising labor productivity through wide-ranging
reforms of the labor market and education system; and (iii) supporting private investment through

better access to credit and other funding sources. According to the latest Economic and Financial
Document, during the first 13 months of the new government, almost 60 percent of the newly
announced reforms and 70 percent of the decrees inherited from previous governments were
implemented (see also Appendix I).
15.
The challenge now is to maintain the momentum and fully implement the reform
initiatives. Only the delivery of real change on the ground will strengthen confidence in a lasting
manner, secure a robust recovery, and lift potential growth in the long run. Simultaneous actions on
multiple fronts would also be mutually reinforcing.

A. Reviving Productivity: Public Sector Efficiency and Other Policies
Raising Public Sector Efficiency
Context

The Italian public sector is inefficient. According to the World Bank’s Doing

great significance. As the services provided
by the public sector are inputs into firms’
production processes, their inefficient provision may lower the marginal productivity
of the labor and capital employed by firms.
Raising government efficiency would not only provide better quality services at
a lower cost but would also raise private sector productivity. Exploiting the
variation across provinces in Italy, staff analysis establishes that public sector
inefficiency has a sizable effect on firm productivity. If public sector efficiency rose to
that of the best province in Italy, productivity of the average firm could increase by
5–10 percent, and overall GDP by 2 percent (Box 2 and Figure 4). Limited
geographical differentiation in public sector wages and downward rigidity in private
sector wages (due to competition with the public sector) also prevent firms from
adjusting wages in line with productivity.

Box 2. The Impact of Public Sector Inefficiency on Italian Firms
Do public sector inefficiencies hold back firm
productivity? Italy ranks poorly on measures of
public sector efficiency. It has also fallen behind
many advanced economies in terms of labor
productivity. Establishing a causal link between
these two stylized facts is not easy but is possible
given Italy’s large regional heterogeneity. Within
Europe, Italy has the largest variation in the quality
of the public sector. It takes more than twice the
number of days to get a construction permit in
Sicily than in Lombardy. Similarly, the median firm
in the North produces 9½ percent more per euro
spent on employees than the median firm in the
south.

To estimate the causal effect of public sector inefficiency, staff analysis uses a simple difference-indifference empirical strategy. The key identifying assumption is that productivity of firms in sectors that
are more reliant on the government would be more affected by government inefficiency. In other words, the
difference in productivity of firms in the construction industry—one of the most dependent on the
government—located in Lombardy vs. Sicily should be larger than the difference in productivity of firms in
the basic metals industries—one of the least dependent on the government—located in these two regions.
The analysis relies on a rich firm-level dataset and uses novel measures of government dependence.
The productivity of about 450,000 micro, small, medium, and large firms in the Orbis database is measured
as the ratio of operating revenue (or gross value-added) to costs of employees (or number of workers).
Government dependence is proxied by the frequency of news about a certain sector mentioning the
government (Pellegrino and Zingales, 2014). Giordano and Tommasino (2011) developed measures of
government efficiency for Italy’s roughly 100 provinces, which captures how efficiently government units
transform inputs into outputs relative to the most efficient province in the area of health care, education,
civil justice, child care, and waste collection. Data are from 2007.
There is strong evidence that the inefficiency
of the public sector holds back firm
productivity. For example, for a firm in a sector
above the median in terms of government
dependence, being in a province with above
median public sector efficiency increases output
per euro spent on salaries by 11 percent. These
estimates imply significant macroeconomic
benefits if public sector efficiency rose to the
frontier in all provinces. Productivity measured
as output per euro spent on salaries could
increase by up to 22 percent in the sectors that
depend the most on the public sector, while
gross value added per employee costs could
rise from 2 to 10 percent. For the average firm,
output would expand by 3 percent.

A comprehensive public administration reform is in the works. The draft
enabling law on public administration reform, approved by the Senate and under
discussion in the Lower House, outlines ideas to (i) reform the system of recruitment,
selection, and evaluation of public employees by introducing new performance
evaluation schemes for managers and maintaining pay to performance; (ii)
reorganize the public administration, including substantial rationalization of local
governments and enterprises, and deregulation of local public service; (iii) simplify
and digitize administrative procedure to make them faster, more efficient, and more
business friendly; and (iv) streamline legislation governing state-owned and local
public enterprises to minimize overlapping regulations from different levels of
government and peripheral government bodies, and promote competition.
Advice

The swift adoption and proper implementation of the public administration
reform will be crucial to unlock the private sector growth potential. As the draft
enabling law provides only the broad contours of the changes envisioned, the
reform should include:
i. Public administration reform. It should increase the autonomy and
accountability of public sector managers; strengthen benchmarking and
performance‐based budgeting; and improve mobility of workers and wage
differentiation across regions and in line with productivity.
ii. Local public services reform. In many areas, the provision of local services is
dominated by monopolies assigned to companies directly owned by (or related to)
local governments. The existence of more than 8,000 local public enterprises has
been highlighted as a source of inefficiency and a burden on public finances.
Hence, reforming local public services and rationalizing local public enterprises
would yield significant economic benefits.
iii. Public tenders. Public tenders for the provision of local public services are
required, and the Competition Authority has been given the power to question
actions by local authorities. However, data on contract award procedures suggest
that the majority of contracts are still done through “in-house” awards or similar
procedures. More transparency in tendering procedures and standardization of
contracts— particularly for the provision of local public services—can help improve
their quality and cost.
Improving the efficiency of the civil justice will have wide-ranging economic
benefits. Despite incremental reforms, the judicial system remains highly inefficient.
Building on the recently introduced measures, consideration could be given to
rationalizing the type of cases that reach the Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione);
allowing for further specialization of the courts—including in commercial and
insolvency matters; using ad hoc measures to reduce the backlog of pending cases;
and pushing ahead with the project to develop court performance indicators.

Reducing corruption will improve the business environment. Legislative
measures to enhance the anti-corruption framework should be adopted and
effectively implemented. This includes increasing the powers of the Anti-Corruption
Authority (ANAC), criminalizing the false accounting offense, and changing the
provisions on statute of limitations for corruption crimes to ensure that these crimes
can be prosecuted regardless of the delays caused by lengthy appeals.
Authorities’
Views

Overhauling the public administration is a key building block of the
government’s agenda. The authorities emphasized their commitment to complete
the legislative process of the draft enabling law on public administration reform by
end-2015. In the current system of fiscal decentralization, the full implementation
will take time, but process will be carefully monitored to ensure a leaner, faster, and
more business-friendly public sector.
The reform of local public services is already in train. Guided by previous
spending reviews, the 2015 Stability Law requires municipalities to submit concrete
rationalization plans, with implementation timeframes and cost savings estimates.
For economically important local public services (such as utilities), strong incentives
were put in place to promote consolidation and pave the way for market
deregulation.
The authorities also highlighted measures taken to improve procurement. A
technical working table composed of a restricted list of procurement aggregator
bodies is established, responsible for specifying the list of product categories and
the respective spending thresholds. The Anti-Corruption authority publishes
reference prices and is in the process of standardizing public contracts.
The authorities were optimistic that these reform efforts will increase
significantly the efficiency of public services. Several academics, however, noted
that the scope for rationalization and raising efficiency may be limited without
addressing public sector employment, and rethinking the role of the state in
providing services in a more radical manner.
Judicial reform remains a priority for the government. The measures undertaken
in the last few years have been bearing fruit, as evidenced by the 15 percent drop in
the number of pending civil cases since 2009. The authorities have also adopted
reforms to reduce the flow of cases by promoting alternative dispute resolution
techniques, such as arbitration, negotiation assisted by counsel, and mediation. Ongoing efforts aim to reduce appeals, improve the recently created “enterprise
courts,” and develop court performance indicators and best practices
(Strasbourg 2.0).
The authorities continue their fight against corruption. The anti-corruption
legislation, approved in late May 2015, includes enhanced powers for the Anti-

these services account for about 30 percent of total value added, and contribute
more than a third of inputs used by other sectors.

Advice

Consumer and producers would benefit from more competition in product and
service markets. While Italy has taken significant steps to liberalize product markets
since 2008, progress on legislating the needed reforms and implementing those
already legislated has been uneven. The swift approval and implementation of the
Annual Competition Law would be an important step to boost competition in a wide
range of sectors. Additional measures in sectors that remain highly regulated (such
as transport) would also help improve competition, lower markups, and increase the
purchasing power of households. Careful consideration should be given to the
regulation of services that have the potential to benefit from new technologies (e.g.,
the platform services in the new sharing economy), weighing the social cost that the
adoption of these technologies might entail against the widespread productivity
gains they would generate. Efforts to fully implement existing legislation should be
strengthened, which would narrow the gap between legislated regulations and
perceptions of product market efficiency.

Authorities’
Views

14

The authorities emphasized the significance of the adoption of the Annual
Competition Law. This is the first time an annual competition law was adopted,
following the 2009 legislation which introduced such a requirement, thus signaling
the new government’s commitment to open markets as a means to revitalize the
economy. They agreed that there is scope to enhance competition in sectors, such as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

roads, local transport, and ports. Some of these areas will be tackled in
complementary draft bills. The authorities concurred that implementation remains
the Achilles’ heel of product and service market reforms in Italy, since measures
legislated at the center are implemented by regional governments, often leading to
uneven outcomes. The planned Constitutional reform, which will give the state the
exclusive power over matters related to competition, should help with the consistent
implementation of legislated regulation and the tangible improvement in product
market efficiency.

Reducing Duality, Improving Labor Reallocation, and Raising Human Capital
Context

A pillar of the reform agenda, the Jobs Act is an overhaul of Italy’s rigid labor
market. The overarching goal of the reform is to improve reallocation of labor
across firms and sectors by reducing the uncertainty and expected cost of dismissal;
expand the social safety net to protect workers from the higher labor market
flexibility; and enhance the job matching process to ensure their swift return to
gainful employment. The reform also aims to tackle the pervasive duality in the labor
market, which is inequitable and limits labor productivity; and raise female labor
participation, which is very low and represents an underutilized source of growth.
Several elements of the reforms have already been fully implemented; the legislative
process for reforming the wage supplementation scheme and ALMP has also begun.
Specific plans for the potential introduction of a minimum wage are yet to be
presented.

Advice

If fully implemented, the Jobs Act would create better incentives to hire and
train workers. The introduction of a new open-ended labor contract with gradually
increasing protection and the extension of the coverage of unemployment benefits
are an important start. But other elements of the Jobs Act are equally important. The
planned reform of the current wage supplementation scheme will encourage the
transitions of workers from unprofitable to profitable firms and to jobs that better
match their skills. The plan for national coordination of ALMPs—to reduce regional
disparities and improve implementation, monitoring and evaluation—should speed
up the process of filling vacancies.
Further decentralizing wage setting could enhance job protection and creation.
Improving the ability of individual firms to adapt working conditions (such as
working hours, tasks, and wages) to their specific circumstances could prevent costly
labor shedding, better align wages with productivity, and alleviate regional
disparities. This could be achieved by allowing greater flexibility in national
contracts—by including top-up agreements for the most profitable businesses and
opt-outs for firms in temporary difficulties; and by tackling the existing constraints to
second-stage wage bargaining, which remains a rarely used option in Italy.

Improving the quality of human capital would play an important role in raising
labor productivity. Educational outcomes in Italy are poor relative to other
advanced economies: Italy has the fifth lowest share of population with upper
secondary education among OECD countries; its students score below the OECD
average in math, reading, and science; and its adult population has relatively low
literacy and numeracy skills. Thus, if properly designed and implemented,
government’s efforts to prioritize spending on education and improve school
outcomes could yield significant economic dividends.

The authorities are committed to fully implement the Jobs Act. Authorities
underscored that the Jobs Act is unlikely to create new jobs in the short run, but it
will increase productivity by changing the composition of the labor force. While still
early to judge, recent labor statistics showing an increase in the share of open-ended
contracts are encouraging. The ultimate effect on labor market duality will only be
discernible once the open-ended contract fiscal incentives expire. The authorities
noted that strengthening ALMP will be crucial to decrease unemployment duration,
but it is difficult given the decentralized provision of such services. The constitutional
reform, which will transfer the responsibility of ALMP back to the state, will help in
this regard. The successful implementation of the Youth Guarantee Scheme could
serve as a positive example.
Both the authorities and social partners agreed that more firm-level bargaining
is desirable. Several hypotheses were put forth about the reasons behind the low
take-up of second-stage bargaining, including the lack of a general agreement on
union representation, the high prevalence of small enterprises for which firm-level

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

bargaining is difficult and costly, the poor macroeconomic environment which has
limited the scope for productivity bonuses above national agreements, and the lack
of fiscal incentives.
The authorities emphasized that the planned school reform is complementary
to the overhaul of the labor market. The Good Schools plan aims to improve
educational outcomes and raise labor productivity by (i) providing better incentives
for teachers through open-ended employment, performance pay, and greater school
autonomy; and (ii) enhancing the curriculum to better link education and
employment. The planned reform, which was recently approved by the Senate, is
expected to complete the legislative process by the end of 2015.

Box 3. The Health of Italy’s Corporate Sector Through the Downturn
Italy’s nonfinancial corporate sector was hit
hard by the protracted economic downturn.
Analysis of roughly 200,000 surviving Italian
companies over 2006–13 reveals three key
stylized facts: (i) the profitability of Italian firms
has fallen dramatically; (ii) the process of
deleveraging has been quite slow; and (iii) debt
overhang has increased. As a result of the fall in
profits and slow reduction in debt, firms’ ability to
service their obligations has declined: the interest
coverage ratio (ICR) has fallen, and in 2013, about
1/5 of firms had insufficient income to cover their
interest payments and more than 30 percent had
an ICR<2.

The corporate sector remains vulnerable to
adverse shocks to profits and interest rates. A uniform decline in profits by 10 percent would increase the
share of companies with ICR<2 by 2 percentage points and the share of debt held by these firms by
3 percentage point.

Conversely, a positive shock to corporate
profits does little to improve the share of firms
potentially unable to service their debt. A
10 percent positive shock to profits would lower
the share of firms with ICR<2 by about
1 percentage points and debt of vulnerable
companies held by banks by 2 percentage points.
This finding suggests that a rebound in economic
activity may have limited impact on firms in poor
financial health, and a more active approach to
resolving corporate weakness may be needed.

highlights the important role played by firm
leverage, debt overhang, firm specific demand shocks, and access to liquid assets in determining investment
decisions in Italy. Moreover, their role has intensified in the post-crisis period, consistent with the idea that
financial constraints might become more binding during periods of heightened risk aversion.
The implications of the declining health of the corporate sector for aggregate business investment
are nontrivial. Using the estimated sensitivities of investment to net worth, debt overhang, sales and
profitability, and the change in these variables between 2006 and 2013, a simple back of the envelope
calculation suggests that 8–10 percent of the decline in aggregate corporate investment could be due to
firms’ deteriorating health.

process have been the main
obstacles to cleaning up balance sheets.

Repairing Balance Sheets
Advice

A broad-based strategy to simultaneously strengthen bank and corporate
balance sheets will support the nascent recovery. Repairing balance sheets will
free up resources for new lending to productive firms and sectors. It would also
unclog the transmission of monetary policy and allow firms and households to
benefit more fully from QE. The comprehensive strategy could involve a “stick-andcarrot” approach:
i.

Strengthen provisioning. Adequate provisioning would help narrow the sizable
gaps between the book and market value of NPLs. The ECB’s BSA revealed
sizeable provisioning gaps and capital shortfalls among the 15 participating
banks, which are expected to be filled by July 2015.3 Remaining uncertainty
about banks’ asset quality would need to be resolved by applying the new EUwide harmonized asset classification framework to all banks operating in Italy.4
Strict supervisory enforcement is essential for ensuring correct classification and
adequate provisioning.

3

Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) increased the volume of the planned rights issue from €2.5 to €3.0 billion.
MPS reclassified €5.7 bn of loans from performing to nonperforming, and increased NPL coverage to 49 percent.
Similarly, Banca Carige’s action plan comprises a rights issue up to €850 million (€200 million more than originally
planned), fully pre-underwritten by Mediobanca. Banca Popolare di Milano and Banca Popolare di Vicenza had
already closed their (arguably small) capital shortfalls at the time the ECB’s results were published.
4

A new asset classification framework, harmonized on the EU level and fully consistent with the past approach, has
been introduced in January 2015, and is applicable to all banks operating in Italy. See Circolare n. 272 del 30 luglio
2008 (Matrice dei conti), 7 Aggiornamento, 20 January 2015.

ii.

Accelerate write-offs. Supervisory actions that effectively introduce time limits
for write-off of vintage NPLs can play an important role in encouraging banks to
deal faster with the problem. One possibility is to raise considerably capital
charges for vintage NPLs after a certain period. Separately, imposing macroprudential limits on the (relative) size of the NPL (or bad debt portfolio) and
using measurable performance indicators of banks’ restructuring efforts can help
limit a further build-up of NPLs.

iii.

Improve further the insolvency regime. Additional reform efforts to rationalize
and streamline procedures will facilitate the swift exit of nonviable firms and
restructuring of viable firms. Remaining gaps in the pre-insolvency and
reorganization procedures should be addressed to allow a seamless transition
between different existing mechanisms and remove obstacles to advanced
restructuring procedures such as debt/equity swaps (Box 5). Reforms should aim
to accelerate the start and shorten the length of insolvency procedures, for
example by increasing the effectiveness of asset sales and reducing litigation
within the insolvency process. Establishing qualifications for insolvency
practitioners and allowing the specialization of courts in insolvency law would
help strengthen the institutional framework.

iv.

Restart the NPL market. As part of an overall strategy, an active distressed debt
market could play an important role in tackling the NPL problem. Private AMCs
should be encouraged including through regulatory measures and tax incentives
for NPL disposals. If properly designed, a centralized, system-wide, state-backed
AMC that is consistent with the EU state aid rules and within the limited available
fiscal space could help jumpstart the market for bad assets. Specifically, the
vehicle should (i) purchase assets at market prices; (ii) use transparent and
uniform valuation criteria; and (iii) have strong governance, including operational
independence and accountability.

v.

Provide tax incentives. To complement these efforts, tax incentives could
motivate provisioning and write-off. Consideration could be given to shortening
further the five-year period over which banks can deduct loan-loss provisions
from taxable revenues. This would also eliminate the build-up of deferred tax
assets.

vi.

Foster restructuring or resolution of distressed SMEs. Given the high number
of SME NPLs and the limited incentives for banks to tackle problem loans (in
light of their close relationship with firms), a triage approach could speed up the
process of dealing with distressed SMEs. Establishing standard criteria for bank
assessments of the viability of SMEs and introducing guidelines for creditor-led
restructuring would help with the separation of nonviable firms (for liquidation)
from viable firms (for rehabilitation) and allow banks to concentrate efforts on
those with better recovery prospects.

Box 5. The Insolvency System in Italy
The high levels of NPLs in the Italian financial system and the vulnerability of the corporate sector
highlight the importance of addressing the regulation of insolvency procedures in Italy. A number of
issues have been identified in the Italian insolvency practice that may prevent the speedy resolution of NPLs
and the restructuring and liquidation of firms.
The insolvency regime is complex, with tools that lack coordination. The bulk of distressed enterprises
in Italy can use debt restructuring procedures, formal reorganization or bankruptcy.1 However, there are
significant disincentives for the use of debt
restructuring options. The two procedures of
informal or hybrid debt restructuring (piani di
risanamento and accordi di ristrutturazione) do
not offer a flexible solution to distressed
companies as the goal is often to achieve full
payment to creditors. In contrast, formal
insolvency procedures (concordato preventivo
and fallimento) do not set limits to the
haircuts creditors can suffer. Informal debt
restructuring agreements cannot be easily
transformed into a formal reorganization plan
in the current system. In addition, there are obstacles to adopting advanced restructuring solutions, such as
debt/equity swaps, because of shareholders’ interference and the existence of preemption rights.
Insolvency procedures suffer long delays. Liquidation lasts more than 8 years on average, with
preferential and unsecured creditors recovering 29 and 6 percent of claims respectively. Apart from the
general inefficiency of civil courts, specific bottlenecks in insolvency procedures contribute to these delays:
(i) litigation within the insolvency process, that may involve several rounds of appeals all the way to the
Supreme Court; and (ii) difficulties in the collection and sale of assets, despite reforms that have introduced
flexibility in the procedure.
Insolvency cases tend to be initiated too late, limiting the scope for recovery. Various incentives have
been introduced for debtor companies, such as the possibility that management remains in control during
reorganization (concordato preventivo). However, there are no effective disincentives for directors to
continue trading even when insolvency is imminent (wrongful trading).
Courts and insolvency administrators are not specialized. While in smaller districts, the de facto
specialization of judges would not be possible, courts in larger towns would benefit from having civil judges
specialize in insolvency matters. The recently created enterprise courts do not have competences on
insolvency matters. In addition, there are no specific qualifications for insolvency administrators, and their
professionalization is limited.
1

Very large firms (with more than 200 employees) can use special procedures. Small enterprises are not subject to general
insolvency law.

Authorities’
Views

22

The authorities acknowledged that asset quality had deteriorated, and writeoffs had been limited. They noted that the adoption of the new asset classification
framework by all EU member states in January 2015 should help resolve
uncertainties about Italian banks’ asset quality through harmonizing asset
classification. However, this would not be enough to revive the market for NPLs—
given the still-sizable pricing gaps—and a more proactive approach is needed. The
advice on the potential use of supervisory actions to speed up the write-off process,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

such as introducing time limits on vintage NPLs, was received well and could be
implemented at the national level within the new SSM framework. The authorities
noted, however, that such actions would be more palatable if combined with other
elements in the strategy. This would also help alleviate concerns about pro-cyclical
tightening in regulatory requirements.
Work on the design of a state-backed AMC, consistent with EU state-aid rules,
was ongoing. But the authorities noted that it will focus on sofferenze loans
transferred at fair market value. The intention is for the state-backed AMC to help
jump-start the market, while enabling banks to continue supporting customers in
temporary difficulty. The authorities agreed that the reduction in the period of tax
deductibility would be useful, although the initial fiscal cost could be significant.
The authorities broadly agreed that a more efficient insolvency regime will be
important to reduce the stock of NPLs. However, views on how this would best be
achieved varied. Some considered targeted amendments to the existing regime to
be sufficient given recent reforms to the insolvency framework; others favored a
more systematic overhaul of the insolvency regime—as recommended by staff—
which would target the remaining gaps in pre-insolvency procedures. There was
wide agreement on the need to accelerate the start of the insolvency procedures,
reduce delays from litigation and increase the effectiveness of asset sales, and
introduce qualifications requirements for insolvency practitioners.
Views on the need to clean up corporate balance sheets were more varied.
Some questioned the premise that there was debt overhang in the corporate sector.
Others noted the increasing polarization within SMEs, with the “good” performers
poised to lead the recovery, and the “bad” performers burdened with debt and
holding up resources that might be better used elsewhere. While acknowledging the
issue with these “bad” performers, the authorities noted that (i) it is a difficult
problem to solve; and (ii) the case for policy intervention is less compelling than in
the financial sector. Nevertheless, the authorities were intrigued by a creditor-led
triage approach towards SME restructuring and the experience of other countries in
establishing standard criteria for SME viability assessments and restructuring
guidelines.

Strengthening Banks and Reviving Firms
Advice

Improving corporate governance would complement balance sheet repair. The
recent decree law on the largest banche popolari (BP), which requires them to
transform into joint stock companies—in line with past IMF advice—marks a
historical change in the governance structure of BPs. It will spur consolidation and
generate efficiency gains, improve risk and NPL management, and improve
governance. The recent measures to reduce foundations’ stakes in banks by
applying diversification thresholds is potentially helpful. Broadening these efforts

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

ITALY

would help tackle remaining issues in the governance of banking foundations and
smaller cooperative banks.
Diversifying SMEs’ funding will help ease credit constraints. Recent actions—
such as launching mini-bonds; introducing tax credits for investment in innovation
projects; allowing institutional investors to invest directly in SMEs; and creating
incentives for listing on stock exchange—are important steps. Further efforts could
include:

Authorities’
Views

i.

Enhance the use and enforcement of collateral. More efficient collateral
enforcement mechanisms could expand the availability and lower the cost of
credit. Introducing contracts based on fiduciary arrangements and expanding the
possibilities for out-of-court enforcement will allow a quicker recovery.
Reforming the secured transactions law and improving the registry for collateral
will expand access to finance.

ii.

Greater sharing of credit information. As emphasized in past consultations,
expanding access to the key registries by nonbanks and including other relevant
data (e.g., payments on taxes, retail credit, and utility bills) would improve credit
monitoring and support the shift from collateral-based to risk-based lending.

The authorities expressed their commitment to improve governance and
enhance competition in the banking sector. In addition to the recently
implemented reform of the BPs, steps were also being taken to strengthen the small
cooperative banks—the weakest link in the banking system—that face difficulties
managing risks and NPLs, and raising capital. These banks were given a year to selfreform, with the hope of establishing cooperative banking groups (in the spirit of
Crédit Agricole).
The authorities stressed that government support had cushioned the decline in
credit supply to SMEs. They were open to exploring options to improve
enforcement of collateral. Besides fiduciary contracts, the authorities expressed
interest in out-of-court enforcement and summary procedures for enforcement in
commercial credit relationships. Reforming security interests and registration of
movable collateral has been on the agenda since December 2013 but is yet to be
completed.

of vulnerabilities. Italy scores the worst among OECD countries in the World

authorities’ budgetary

Advice

Lower taxes and more efficient spending would support growth. The 2015
budget cut labor taxes by 0.7 percent of GDP, but the labor tax wedge remains well
above the OECD median. The ongoing spending reviews—aiming for savings of
€10 billion in 2016 and €17–18 billion by 2018—are crucial to raise the efficiency of
public spending and create room for further labor and capital tax cuts, and targeted
spending increases in areas such as infrastructure or R&D. These reviews should also
identify possible efficiency gains in areas such as procurement, transfers to public

enterprises, and health, among others. Completing the review of tax expenditures
envisaged in the delega fiscale would also contribute to fiscal rebalancing.
The planned modest consolidation of ¼ percent of GDP in 2015 strikes a
balance between supporting growth and reducing debt. In this context, the reindexation of pensions in accordance with the Constitutional Court ruling should not
modify the fiscal stance this year and going forward. Specifically, any permanent
impact on the budget should be compensated by reducing spending elsewhere. In
2016, the safeguard clause should be fully offset by spending cuts—to avoid
damaging tax hikes while building fiscal buffers. The flexibility under the SGP could
be used very modestly—to the tune of 0.2 percent of GDP—to cut taxes further and
support specific structural reforms with high growth payoff (for instance, the
rationalization of local public enterprises).
More ambitious medium-term targets would help reduce the substantial risks
to the debt path (Annex II). Beyond 2017, after the recovery is well entrenched, a
structural surplus of about ½ percent of GDP would provide valuable insurance

conditions.
Stronger budget institutions would improve the quality of spending. A
medium-term expenditure framework and the institutionalization of spending
reviews would enhance policy prioritization and help deliver on fiscal targets in a
growth-friendly way. Fully implementing the delega fiscale is essential to simplify the
tax system. Stronger efforts to curb tax evasion would generate savings and increase
fairness. These efforts should include greater use of the anti-money laundering

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

framework to pursue tax crimes. Greater information sharing would also help, e.g.,
between the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the “fiscal registry” (anagrafe
tributaria).
Authorities’
Views

The authorities agreed that fiscal policy should do more to support growth. The
ongoing spending reviews will improve efficiency and yield savings of at least
0.6 percent of GDP. The reviews will focus on purchases of goods and services,
reorganization of bodies at lower levels of government, health, and welfare
programs. Avoiding the legislated tax increase in 2016 (the safeguard clause) was
viewed as essential to keep the recovery on track. Offsetting the safeguard clause in
full by spending cuts could be detrimental to growth, hence the decision to use part
of the savings from lower interest rates to avoid the tax increase. In 2015, the
windfall from the lower interest bill would help absorb the unexpected (one-off) cost
associated with the Constitutional Court decision on pensions.5 At the same time, the
authorities were committed to offset any temporary or permanent impact on the
budget.
The flexibility under the SGP could reinforce the structural reform program. A
number of relevant reforms have been implemented recently or are being
implemented, with a positive medium-term impact on the budget position. These
include the reform of the public administration, the Jobs Act, and the Good Schools
plan among others. The use of the structural reforms clause under the SGP for 0.4
percent of GDP is warranted to support reform implementation, since it would allow
achieving the MTO of structural balance in 2017 more gradually.
A strategy to reduce public debt is in place. In their latest Economic and Financial
Document, the authorities target a structural surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in the
medium-term to reduce debt faster and build buffers. Any additional savings would
be used to boost growth by cutting taxes. Privatization will support the debtreduction efforts but even if targets were increased, the pool of available assets is
too small to have a significant impact on the debt path. The privatization target for
2015 is 0.4 percent of GDP, and includes the sale of participations in ENAV and Poste
Italiane.

STAFF APPRAISAL

Following the Constitutional Court ruling on pensions, the authorities adopted a decree, currently in Parliament,
reintroducing partial and progressive indexation and clearing arrears, while limiting the estimated net cost from
about €14 billion to €2.2 billion in 2015 (with a permanent component of €0.5 billion).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

ITALY

rebounded and real activity expanded in Q1 2015. Supported by stronger exports and higher private
spending, growth is projected at 0.7 percent in 2015, rising gradually to 1.2 percent in 2016, with
risks broadly balanced.
17.
Recent policy actions have been critical for this turnaround. At the European level, QE
has boosted asset prices, including bond yields and the euro; the ECB’s BSA has helped reduce
uncertainty about bank balance sheets; and more flexibility in the SGP has allowed the fiscal stance
to be fairly neutral. At the national level, the government has advanced important reforms of the
labor market, banking sector, civil justice, and the tax and electoral system that have also lifted
confidence.
18.
But much higher growth is needed to bring down unemployment and debt at a faster
pace. Persistent structural weaknesses, including due to incomplete implementation of previous
reforms—together with depressed demand, weakened balance sheets, and subdued growth
expectations—have been dragging down growth. Real activity and investment are still far from their
precrisis levels, and medium‐term growth prospects are lackluster. Unemployment remains high,
especially among the youth, and public debt exceeds 130 percent of GDP.
19.
Pressing ahead with deeper reforms is vital to revive growth. Policy efforts should focus
on three areas: (i) tackling the deep-rooted productivity problem; (ii) supporting bank and corporate
balance sheet repair; and (iii) rebalancing fiscal adjustment and reducing public debt. It is
encouraging that the government’s agenda includes ambitious initiatives in these areas. The
challenge now is to maintain the reform momentum and fully implement ongoing and planned
reforms, in order to bring about real change on the ground.
20.
The prompt adoption of the draft law on public administration reforms is necessary to
improve public sector efficiency and unlock the private sector growth potential. Reforms to
civil justice, the provision of local public services, tendering procedures, and human resource
management in the public administration would not only provide better quality and cheaper
services but would also raise private sector productivity. Legislative initiatives have been put forward
to address these areas; their full implmenetation will be crucial to overhaul the public sector.
21.
It is critical to increase competition in the product and service markets—to benefit
consumers and producers alike. The implementation of the Annual Competition Law will further
strengthen competition in a number of sectors. The challenge is to fully implement the existing and
new legislation, in order to raise the perception of product market efficiency, which remains very
low. Removing regulatory barriers in sectors that remain highly protected such as transport would
also help lower the cost of services.
22.
The Jobs Act should be fully implemented—to make the labor market more inclusive,
more responsive to economic conditions, and more productive. The new open-ended contract
with gradually increasing protection and the expansion of the unemployment benefit scheme would
help reduce duality, facilitate workers’ reallocation, and support their transition between jobs. But
implementing the remaining elements of the Jobs Act is equally important. Reforming the wage

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

supplementation scheme will free-up the labor currently tied in unprofitable firms. Strengthening
ALMPs should help these workers find new jobs faster. Outside the Jobs Act, promoting firm-level
bargaining through greater flexibility under national contracts would allow companies and workers
to better adapt to changing conditions and productivity.
23.
A broad-based strategy to strengthen bank and corporate balance sheets will support
the nascent recovery. It will free up resources for new lending to productive firms and sectors:


Banks. More provisioning and write-offs, incentivized by supervisory actions and fiscal
measures; a revived distressed debt market, including through a properly designed, centralized,
system‐wide, state‐backed AMC; and enhanced insolvency regime would accelerate the
reduction of the stock of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets. Further improvements in bank
corporate governance would strengthen capital raising and market discipline.



SMEs. A triage approach, which involves establishing standard criteria for bank assessments of
the viability of SMEs and introducing guidelines for creditor-led restructuring, would accelerate
the process of dealing with distressed SMEs. Improving access to finance, including through
enhancing collateral use and enforcement and greater credit information sharing, would support
investment.

24.
Fiscal policy should maintain an appropriate balance between supporting growth and
reducing debt. To support growth, fiscal rebalancing needs to continue by lowering still-high labor
and capital taxes financed by savings from past and ongoing spending reviews. In the near term, the
planned consolidation of ¼ percent of GDP in 2015 is appropriate—given still‐subdued growth and
high debt—and should be maintained. A very modest use of the flexibility under the SGP could
support the structural reform program and create room for further tax cuts. Over the medium-term,
a modest structural surplus of about ½ percent of GDP would reduce debt faster, providing valuable
insurance against changes in market sentiment, and helping comply with EU fiscal rules. More
ambitious privatization targets would also help.
25.
Comprehensive policy actions on multiple fronts would be mutually reinforcing.
Lowering the tax wedge and repairing bank and corporate balance sheets will boost jobs and
investment in productive sectors and firms. And the Jobs Act will help workers transition more easily
to these new job opportunities. The resulting productivity gains will be amplified by more efficient
public sector and more competitive market for products and services. Conversely, a piecemeal
approach could undermine the nascent recovery and leave the economy in its low-growth
equilibrium.
26.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held in the usual
12-month cycle.

Annex I. External Sector Report Assessment
Italy
Foreign asset and
liability position
and trajectory

Background. Italy’s net international investment position (NIIP) has deteriorated significantly since joining the Euro area,
with net liabilities of 28 percent of GDP as compared with 7 percent at end 2000, reflecting mainly current account
deficits and valuation adjustments. Gross assets and liabilities grew steadily during this period, reaching 136 and 164
percent of GDP respectively, 39 and 60 percent higher than in 2000. External debt represents about ¾ of gross external
liabilities. While the level of external debt is in line with the Euro area as a whole, its composition - half is owed by the
public sector - underscores the vulnerabilities related to the high level of public sector debt. Looking forward, modest
current account surpluses forecast over the medium-term will gradually shrink Italy’s net liability position as a share of
GDP.
Assessment. In light of the current account’s shift into a surplus, overall external sustainability is not a major concern.
Still, some further strengthening of balance sheets is desirable, as Italy is vulnerable to financial contagion given its large
stock of government debt and the sizable holdings of public and private debt by non-residents.

Current account

Background. Italy’s current account (CA) averaged a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP in the decade following the adoption
of the euro. Starting in 2012, it moved into balance and by 2014, it registered a surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP (up from 1
percent of GDP in 2013). The improvement in the current account is accounted for by the growing trade surplus, which
reached more than 3 percent of GDP in 2014, owing both to higher exports and subdued imports. In 2015, the current
account surplus is projected to rise further to 2.3 percent of GDP, reflecting the lower oil bill and euro depreciation. In
terms of saving and investment, declining investment accounted for about 60 percent of the improvement in the current
account since 2010, while higher public and private saving contributed the rest.
Assessment. Despite the recent improvement in the current account, the EBA model suggests that the cyclicallyadjusted level, which stood at 0.7 percent of GDP in 2014, was about 1.3 percent of GDP below the norm implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. 1/ Given these estimates and the need for stronger growth to
reduce public debt and unemployment over the medium term, while improving the external balance sheet, staff assesses
a gap of -1.5 to 0 percent of GDP for 2014.

Real exchange rate

Background. Portfolio and other-investment inflows typically have financed the current account deficit, and a modest
net FDI outflow, without much difficulty. This was also the case in 2014, which saw a strong return of foreign investment
in portfolio securities in the first half of the year, led by investment in government securities. TARGET2 liabilities,
accumulated by banks over 2011–12, have declined. 3/
Assessment. While supported by the QE, Italy remains vulnerable to a loss in market confidence, owing to the large
refinancing needs of the sovereign and banking sectors, and tight credit conditions from financial fragmentation.

FX intervention and Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.
reserves level
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free
floating.

The assessment of 2014 is supported
by Italy’s weak productivity and
competitiveness indicators. In
particular, stronger growth,
consistent with reducing high
unemployment and public debt,
while strengthening the external
balance sheet, would require a
modest weakening of the real
effective exchange rate from average
2014 levels.
Part of the needed adjustment may
reflect Italy’s weak competitive
position within the Euro area, where
the existence of a common currency
has removed an important
adjustment mechanism to
differences in relative prices changes.
Potential policy responses:
Implementation of structural reforms
will be critical to improving
competitiveness and boosting
potential growth. Continued
progress in medium-term fiscal
consolidation will also help close the
competitiveness gap and maintain
investor confidence. Combined,
these measures will support growth
and employment over the mediumterm.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Capital and
financial accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Stagnant productivity and rising labor costs have resulted in a gradual appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) since joining the Euro area, both in absolute terms and relative to the Euro area average. A
comparison of price-based indices suggests that the appreciation over the 2000-2014 period has exceeded the Euro
area average by about 0 to 10 percent, with indicators based on unit labor cost generally showing a wider gap than
other price-based measures. 2/ The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the euro contributed to a
depreciation of the REER relative to the 2014 average of about 5 percent as of May 2015.
Assessment. The EBA methodologies provide a relatively tight range of REER gap estimates in 2014. The REER
regression methods suggest an overvaluation of 3 percent (EBA Index REER model) and 6½ percent (EBA Level REER
model) in 2014. The CA regression method yields an overvaluation of about 5 percent. On balance, and consistent with
the staff assessment of the CA in 2014, staff assessed that a real effective depreciation of 0-10 percent would support
further adjustment and address economic imbalances over the medium-term.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2014 was
broadly consistent (but likely still
weaker) than suggested by mediumterm fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. Developments as of
May 2015 point toward some
strengthening of the external position
due to the depreciation of Italy’s REER.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

1/ The weakening of the CA balance relative to the norm in 2014 is largely the result of a revision in the EBA methodology, which
raised the CA norm for countries having both a relatively rapidly aging population and high dependency ratio, such as Italy.
2/ Depending on the measure used, Italy’s REER appreciated by -0.4 to 1 percent between 2013 and 2014 (year average on year
average).
3/ The sharp rise in Target 2 balances in the second half of 2014 reflected the policy adopted by Treasury to reduce issuance of
new debt securities, and a temporary spike due to interbank transactions. Target 2 balances have since declined.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Italy’s public debt is sustainable but subject to significant risks. While public debt is expected to decline
as growth resumes and interest rates stay low, it is very high and requires large gross and external
financing due to the rollover of existing debt. With most of the debt held domestically, the main risk
stems from a stagnation scenario, where growth and inflation remain very low for an extended period.
The ECB’s bond buying program partially mitigates market risks.
1.
Macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions. The assumptions underpinning the DSA are those
of the baseline scenario of the staff report. Real GDP growth is projected at 0.7 percent in 2015,
increasing to around 1 percent in the medium term. Inflation is projected at around 1.3 percent over
the medium term. The structural balance improves over the projection period due to the measures in
the budget and a falling interest bill. Spreads are assumed to remain at current levels. However,
yields are expected to rise moderately to about 2½ percent as monetary policy normalizes.
2.
The DSA tool that assesses the realism of the main assumptions on growth, primary
balance, and inflation does not indicate systematic forecast errors.


While growth outcomes in Italy were sometimes worse than projected, the current growth
projections are in line with consensus but below the authorities’ forecasts. Risks to the outlook
are broadly balanced. Stagnation and low inflation that complicate efforts to reduce public debt
remain an important downside risk. QE, euro depreciation, and lower oil prices could have a
larger positive impact than currently expected. Rapid progress on the domestic reform agenda
could boost confidence and spur a stronger recovery, lowering debt faster. Inflation projection
errors have been small historically but the risk of deflation is a particular concern given its
implications on debt dynamics.



The projected cyclically-adjusted primary balance is large, but Italy has a history of running large
primary surpluses for extended periods.

3.
The definition of public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt of the
General Government. The General Government includes the Central Government, Regional
Governments, Local Government, and Social Security Funds. EDP debt is a subset of General
Government consolidated debt, excluding items such as certain trade credits and other accounts
payable. Stocks are recorded at their face value and thus usually exclude unpaid accrued interest.

Baseline
4.
Staff projects the debt-to-GDP ratio to peak at 133 percent of GDP in 2015, before
declining to 123 percent in 2020. The debt profile is lower than a year ago on account of lower
interest rates. The revision of national accounts to adopt the ESA 2010 standard increased the level
of GDP in 2013, lowering the debt ratio by 4.8 percentage points. The baseline scenario does not
incorporate potential fiscal costs of a state-backed AMC and tax incentives to encourage loan-loss
provisions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

ITALY

5.
Gross financing needs have fallen but are expected to remain sizeable, with rollover
risks mitigated by the long–term debt structure and ECB bond buying. Italy remains vulnerable
to a loss in market confidence, owing to still large government refinancing needs (15–18 percent of
GDP). Refinancing risks are partially mitigated by the public debt structure. Average maturity is
around 6½ years and 70 percent of debt features fixed interest rates. The direct interest passthrough to the budget is moderate; a 100 basis points shock to the yield curve is estimated to raise
the interest bill by 0.3 percent of GDP in the first and second years. About two-thirds of debt is held
by domestic investors.
6.
The portfolio of Central Government derivatives accounts for 9 percent of total debt,
with a notional value of €160 billion. Most of the portfolio comprises interest rates swaps to
increase the duration of debt. The mark-to-market value of the Treasury’s portfolio was -2.6 percent
of GDP in 2014:Q3. A few contracts (for a notional of €16 billion) have early termination clauses. The
authorities will not enter new derivatives contracts going forward, except for cross-currency swaps
linked to foreign currency debt issuance.

Shocks and Stress Tests
7.
The heat map of the main risk shows susceptibility to a negative surprise to growth
and macro fiscal shocks.


Growth shock. Real output growth rates are assumed to be lower by one standard deviation for
two years starting in 2016, resulting in an average growth of -1.2 percent in 2016–17.
Furthermore, for every 1 percentage point decline in growth, inflation declines by 25bps. The
primary balance improves more slowly than the baseline, reaching only 0.7 percent of GDP by
2020. The debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly to about 145 percent during the growth shock and
then fails to come down over the projection period.



Interest rate shock. Market concerns about medium-term debt sustainability re-emerge,
increasing spreads by 200 bps. Higher borrowing costs are passed on to the real economy,
depressing growth by 0.4 percent. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an implicit
average interest rate of 3.3 percent by 2020. Debt still declines but very modestly, staying around
130 percent in 2020.



Contingent liability shock. Negative surprises, such as from the financial system, lead to a onetime increase in noninterest expenditure of about 10 percent of banking sector assets. This leads
to -1.3 percent growth for two consecutive years, depressing domestic demand and lowering
inflation by 0.3 percent. The primary balance worsens by 12 percent of GDP in 2016 and by
1.4 percent of GDP from 2017 onwards. Debt rises to 150 percent of GDP, after which it starts
declining very modestly. Gross financing needs would be significantly higher.



Primary balance shock. Reform fatigue weakens the implementation of fiscal adjustment
plans—which are delayed by one year relative to the baseline. The slippage leads to a very slight

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

increase in risk premia (20 bps increase for each 1 percent of GDP slippage). The debt-to-GDP
ratio is about 2 percentage points higher than the baseline by 2020.


Low inflation and prolonged stagnation. Inflation surprises on the downside given the large
negative output gap and is lower by 1 standard deviation (0.8 pp) from 2016 onwards, remaining
at 0.4 percent for three years and reaching 0.6 percent in 2020. Annual GDP growth is 0.6-0.9pp
lower than in the baseline and there is a 50bps increase in interest rates in 2016–20. This could
potentially arise due to slow progress in structural reforms, increase in contingent liabilities,
possibly from the banking sector, and loss of confidence as interest rates spike. The debt-ratio
increases to 145 percent of GDP in 2020 and fails to stabilize over the projection period.



Policy advice scenario. Under this scenario, structural reforms and fiscal rebalancing provide a
growth dividend of ¼ percent in 2017 that rises permanently to ½ percent of GDP by 2020. The
interest rate declines by around 10 bps. Annual privatization receipts of 1 percent of GDP
materialize. In line with staff’s advice, the structural surplus increases progressively to ½ percent
of GDP by 2020. These assumptions allow the debt-ratio to decline to about 112 percent of GDP
by 2020 and continue firmly on a declining path.

Structural Reforms to Improve the Business Environment
Labor market

Product markets

As part of the Jobs Act, a new open ended labor contract entered into
force in March 2015. The contract limits the scope for reinstatement,
introduces a fast track settlement of dismissal disputes, and provides
monetary compensation which rises with tenure in case of unfair dismissal.
A legislative decree, approved by the Government in June 2015, reviews
existing temporary contracts and allows for more flexible use of labor
within the firm, while promoting the use of the new open ended contract
as the main form of labour contract for employees.

Monitor take-up of new open-ended contract, recourse to legal action,
and judges' interpretation of new legislation.
Implement legislative decree on streamlining of contracts and monitor use

The introduction of NASPI (May 2015) broadens the coverage of
unemployment insurance and increases conditionality of receiving
unemployment benefits. Two additional schemes are introduced on an
experimental basis: Dis-Col for workers on collaboration contracts, and
ASDI for unemployed workers with children or close to retirement. A
legislative decree for reforming the wage supplementation scheme was
presented for preliminary examination in June 2015.

portfolio management and governance arrangements should
have binding, legally enforceable (instead of intentional)
character.

A recent reform of cooperative banks (banche popolari) forces
the largest to convert into joint stock companies and improves
the governance of the others (other mutual banks have been
asked to self-reform).
Furthermore, ACRI (the association of Italian Foundations) and
the Treasury signed a MoU regulating portfolio management
(diversification of investments, limits and conditions for debt,
derivatives and investments in instrumental entities) and
governance arrangements of Foundations. The memorandum
guarantees that foundations comply fully with the ban on
investee banks' control (also jointly or de facto).
Supporting
SMEs

Facilitate restructuring. Establish standard criteria for assessing
SME loans and guidelines for restructuring viable but distressed
firms.

The Commission set up to reform insolvency law has among its
goals to simplify insolvency procedures

Implement a “triage” approach for distressed SMEs, by
establishing standard criteria for assessing loans and
introducing guidelines for restructuring viable firms.
Improve further the insolvency regime by streamlining
procedures and accelerating the start of the insolvency process
to facilitate the swift exit of nonviable firms. Address remaining
gaps in pre-insolvency and reorganization procedures.

Encourage alternative market funding sources through, among
others, the introduction of a new fiduciary contract, and
enhancing sharing of credit information.

To increase supply of credit, insurance, securitization
companies and credit funds are now allowed to lend directly to
funds. There has also been liberalization of bonds issuance by
unlisted companies. To encourage stock market listing,
minimum capital requirements were reduced, tax credit for
large capital increases was introduced; and multiple voting
shares and loyalty shares can now be listed.

Monitor the effectiveness of the measures used and continue
encouraging alternative market funding sources, through,
among others, enhanced use and enforcement of collateral.
Enhance sharing of credit information to improve credit
monitoring and lending.

Remove obstacles to SME start-up and up-scaling.

The program for supporting innovative startups was expanded
to include non-startup SMEs of high technological value. The
Innovative Startup and SME scheme encompasses: flexible
corporate management tools; exemption from the regulations
on companies reporting systematic losses and on dummy
companies; flexible remuneration systems; tax incentives for
investments; equity crowdfunding; fast-track and free access to
public guarantees on bank loans.

Monitor the effectiveness of the measures adopted and keep
on encouraging the creation and growth of innovative SMEs.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ITALY—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of June 2, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic and financial statistics are
comprehensive and of generally high quality. Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner
(Table 1). The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a
calendar of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements of
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), including the timeliness and reporting standards, and it
has adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA2010).
National Accounts: Further improvements should be considered regarding changes in inventories in the
quarterly national accounts, which are currently derived as a residual and lumped together with the
statistical discrepancy.
Price Statistics:
Government Finance Statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics:
Financial Sector Surveillance: Participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS),
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and financial soundness indicators (FSIs) databases.
External Sector Statistics: The Bank of Italy adopted the standards for reporting Balance of Payments
(BOP) and International Investment Position (IIP) data on the basis of the Balance of Payments and
th

International Investment Position Manual, 6 edition (BPM6) in the second half of 2014.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
1996 and posts its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In 2015 Italy subscribed to SDDS Plus, together with the first group of
adherents.
Implementing G-20 DGI recommendations: The authorities have implemented
all of the recommendations. Further progress in the near future is likely to be
made on the reporting frequency of Financial Soundness Indicators.

Statement by Mr. Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for Italy
July 1, 2015

We thank staff for fruitful discussions during the 2015 Art. IV Consultations with Italy. The
Selected Issues Papers (SIPs) deal with critical issues and are of excellent quality,
particularly the analysis of the link between public sector efficiency and productivity. We
broadly concur with the thrust of the staff appraisal.
This said, the Staff Report sometimes gives the impression that the structural reforms Italy
needs in its labor and product markets, as well as in its public administration and finances,
are still in the planning stage including by frequent references to the “ambitious government
agenda” (ambitious, yes, but still an agenda).1 No, these are not just plans: during the last
year several key actions have been undertaken to implement these reforms.
Thus, this statement starts by clarifying what has been already fully legislated and
implemented, what is in the implementation phase, and what is in the planning stage. Of
course the lists of what is still in the implementation and planning stages are also long. But
what has already been achieved bodes well for the future.
One additional remark before proceeding: the Staff Report presents various indicators of the
efficiency of the Italian economy to illustrate the need for reform, including the World Bank
Doing Business Indicators and the World Economic Forum (WEF) perception-based indexes.
There is no doubt that there are bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the Italian economy but, for
the reasons that we explain below, the way these indicators are used in the Report conveys
only a partial representation of the country to the detriment of the effectiveness of the Report.
Where Italy stands in the implementation of the ambitious government reform agenda
Since the last Article IV Consultation the following structural reforms have been
implemented:

1

In terms of presentation, it is also unfortunate that some of the actions already adopted are often listed in the
sections on the “Authorities’ views” – rather than in the sections describing the current situation – leaving the
reader wondering whether staff shares the view that the actions were indeed implemented.

1. Probably the most important reform was the enactment of the Jobs Act, which deeply
changes the working of the labor market by introducing more flexibility in laying off
and hiring workers, reforming labor contracts and introducing a better protection for
the unemployed. This part of the labor market reform—its core component—is fully
legislated, including the necessary implementation decrees, and is thus fully
operational. Only two components of the reform—the reform of the wage
supplementation scheme and the reform of active labor market policies—still require
the implementation decrees, but they have already been sent to Parliament (for
comments, not for approval, which is not needed) in the first of these two areas.
2. Labor taxes have been cut and to an extent somewhat larger than suggested by staff
(close to one per cent of GDP, rather than 0.7), taking into account the 3-year
reduction of labor taxation for new permanent contracts. Based on our own estimates,
this cut has almost halved the gap between Italy’s tax wedge and that of the euro area.
The initial results are encouraging: permanent hirings increased sharply in the first
quarter of this year (+104,000); in April the unemployment rate decreased more than
expected, though remaining at high levels also on the back of increased labor supply.
3. Primary spending has been cut by about ½ percent of GDP (and more net of spending
increases that were necessary to implement some structural reforms such as the
strengthening of unemployment benefits).2 This decline in spending is not only the
effect of “austerity measures” but also of deep reforms, including the reform of
procurement, which does not require any further legislative action. It implies setting
up 35 procurement agencies that will replace the over 30,000 offices that currently
manage procurement activities in Italy. This is expected to be completed in July 2015.
4. New rules for the mobility of public sector employees have been legislated and are
now being used to reallocate personnel from the reformed Provinces to other parts of
the public administration. The 2014 law on the reform of the public administration
(not to be confused with the new law now in Parliament to complete the reform
process, which is the one mentioned in the Staff Report) introduced other
simplification and streamlining measures.
5. Thanks to the reform of the Treasury management system introduced during 2014, the
repayment of government arrears has been accelerated and payment delays have been
dramatically reduced with the introduction of the electronic invoice system. According
to the most recent data, €36.5 billion were paid to creditors, and the total
resources provided by central government to local governments – the firms’ debtors –
totaled €42.8 billion. This is assessed to broadly match overdue commercial debt.
6. New measures have been adopted to improve the functioning of the civil justice,
along the lines of the numerous provisions enacted since 2011. A paperless process
for civil court cases (processo telematico) was introduced. Two new modalities for
the extra-court resolution of disputes have been added. The possibility for judges to
2

The reduction in spending to GDP ratios is not evident in the headline statistics because the cut in labor
taxation of €80 per month for lower income dependent workers is not classified as a tax cut according to the
methodology followed by the Statistical Institute. However, from an economic perspective, it has all the
features of a tax cut, increasing the incentive to work.

resort to fast-track procedures has been widened. These and earlier reforms are already
having an impact: in June 2014 the backlog of pending cases was down by 18
percent from the peak of 2009.
7. A new anti-corruption law was approved in May 2015 which criminalized false
accounting, lengthened the punishment for corruption cases, changed the statute of
limitations and increased the powers of the Anti-Corruption Authority established in
2014. The crime of self-laundering has been introduced in January 2015.
8. The cooperative banking sector (banche popolari) has been profoundly reformed with
the aim of improving its corporate governance and its ability to access capital markets
and enhancing investors’ assessment. Measures on the portfolio management
(diversification of investments, limits and conditions for debt, derivatives and
investments in instrumental entities) and governance arrangements of banking
foundations have also been introduced; they guarantee that foundations fully comply
with the ban on investee banks’ control (also jointly or de facto).
9. On June 23 the government adopted a set of new measures to overhaul the insolvency
regime, reduce the length of recovery procedures and, consequently, speed-up the
write-off of non-performing loans (NPLs) from banks’ balance sheets. Moreover, loan
loss provisions will be immediately deductible for tax purposes. These newlyadopted measures, which are in line with staff recommendations, will facilitate the
development of a market for NPLs in Italy.
10. More generally, the issuance of implementation decrees to enact laws approved in the
past has been accelerated with the current government reducing by 70 percent the
backlog of implementation decrees arising from previous legislation.
Other elements of the government reform agenda are in progress but have not yet been
completed:
1. A key element is the enabling law on the reform of public administration. We will not
delve further into this as it is already discussed in the Staff Report. Its approval is
expected before the summer break. The implementation decrees are being drafted
already and are expected to be issued within a month after the approval of the law.
2. Early this year the Parliament approved the new electoral law, which has been
designed with the aim of enhancing the stability of the political system. It is part of a
broader strategy, including a constitutional reform whose discussion has further
advanced in Parliament and that will simplify the legislative process and rationalize
the attribution of competences between central and local governments.
3. In February 2015 the Government presented an Annual Competition Law aimed at
enhancing competitiveness in several sectors (professional services,
telecommunications, banking and insurance services, fuel distribution), meeting for
the first time the requirement introduced in 2009.
4. In March a draft enabling law to reform the civil procedure code was presented to the
Parliament with the aim of simplifying the procedures and widening the casemanagement powers of judges.

5. In May, the government draft bill to reform education was approved by the House and
is now under evaluation by the Senate. It aims at enhancing meritocracy of teachers,
fostering transparency in the management of schools, and strengthening training in
professional schools.
6. The government adopted a multi-year privatization program, which includes the listing
of major State controlled companies such as Poste, ENAV and Ferrovie. Revenues
from privatization are by law earmarked to the reduction of public debt. In
early 2015 the government sold on the market a 5 percent stake of ENEL, reducing its
stake to 25 percent. The IPO of Poste Italiane is scheduled for the fall. Incentives have
been provided to local authorities to privatize utilities under their control. In
parallel, the reorganization, restructuring and, when appropriate, sale of public real
estate continues, including by setting up several specific funds by Invimit, the
government real estate management company.
Finally, some steps are still in the planning stage, including, among others, proposals to:
reduce the appeal rate in civil justice and develop court performance indicators; improve the
provision of public services; strengthen the governance and resilience of the mutual bank
sector (banche di credito cooperativo); address the high stock of non-performing loans with
targeted actions (in addition to those introduced on June 23).
Doing Business and other indicators
These reforms are critical for addressing what is perhaps the most severe problem affecting
the Italian economy: its low productivity growth. The authorities’ tangible reform
achievements are a testament of how seriously this problem is acknowledged.
This said, we would caution against taking at face value some of the indicators presented in
the Staff Report which—like the Doing Business and WEF indicators—suggest that Italy is at
the bottom of OECD countries in virtually all respects. Indeed this is the impression that
one gets in reading the Staff Report, given the selection of the indicators presented. In this
regard, the list of the variables for the chart at page 10 excludes all the dimensions of the
World Bank indices along which Italy is performing relatively better, such as: “Starting a
business” (18th position among OECD countries); “Registering a property” (14th); “Protection
of minority shareholders” (10th).
Furthermore, some of the indicators the Staff Report put a lot of emphasis on are probably not
very revealing of actual conditions. Drawing from the Doing Business database, the Staff
Report notes that it takes 120 days (for a business) to get electricity connection in Italy. The
Staff Report does not say that, according to the same database, it would take 126 days to get a
connection in the UK, 132 days in Los Angeles and 142 days in Canada. Admittedly, the
Netherlands and Japan would be in a better position, but not by much (respectively 117 and
105 days). These data cast doubts on the quality of the reported indicator.
But the problems with these indicators are more general in the case of Italy for three reasons:

 The Doing Business indicators refer to central Italy, whose efficiency, for example in
terms of public services, is not representative of the national average weighted by
regional GDP (whose production is skewed toward the most efficient regions). It is
strange that staff does not acknowledge this problem, as the Staff Report does
underscore the major differences in the efficiency of public services across the
country.
 The WEF indexes are typically based on perceptions and, for Italy (to a much larger
extent than for other countries, based on econometric estimates) there is a wide gap
between perceptions and more objective information. For example, according to a
Eurobarometer survey, while a very large proportion of respondents (97 percent)
argue that corruption is widespread in Italy, the proportion of those who personally
know anyone who takes or has taken bribes in Italy is only 9 percent, at the lowest
among the EU countries. Econometric evidence shows that, while there is in general a
statistical relationship between perception of corruption and its direct evidence across
countries, in the case of Italy the fit is very poor and the relationship does not hold.
Therefore, while perception indicators are useful for many countries, for Italy they
may not be so useful, and hence should not be overemphasized.
 Third, the reported indicators typically give a snapshot of the current situation but do
not describe the trends. This may miss important developments. For example, OECD
PISA surveys do indeed show that Italian pupils’ competences are below the OECD
average, but Italy is one of the countries which over recent years recorded one of the
most marked improvements in competences in mathematics and science. Furthermore,
between 2003 and 2012, Italy reduced the share of “low performers” by 7
percentage points, and increased that of the “top performers” by 3 percentage points.
Finally, it is difficult to square the image of the country conveyed by the indicators included in
the Staff Report with some hard data. The Report appropriately underscores the
disappointing productivity and GDP performance of the Italian economy over the last
decade. It would have been more balanced to mention also some points of strength. Italy has
the second largest manufacturing industry in Europe and the seventh in the world. While it is
true that the productive system features a portion of small firms which are less innovative and
able to compete, it also includes a large share of highly productive and competitive
enterprises. According to WTO data, Italian firms are among the top-rank exporters in a wide
range of industries (textiles, basic manufactures, transport equipment, machinery, clothing,
electronic components). According to a 2013 SIP produced by staff, “In an era dominated by
the dramatic expansion of emerging-market exporters, Italy’s tradable sector continues to
rank among the world’s leaders – in contrast to many other European countries.” This is
confirmed also by the fact that, after the trade collapse in 2009, the volume of Italian goods
exports not only has kept up with, but has slightly outpaced potential demand (the weighted
average of trade partners’ imports). Against this background, competitiveness indicators
based on unit labor costs may underestimate Italian firms’ capacity to compete in

international markets. We reiterate our suggestion that the consideration of a broader set of
both price and non-price indicators would be more appropriate.
Outlook
We concur with staff that the improvement in growth prospects is the result not only of the
actions of the government but also of more favorable external conditions. The improved
macroeconomic outlook has been reflected in the upward revision of earlier staff projections:
GDP is now expected to grow by 0.7 percent in 2015 and 1.2 in 2016 (as against,
respectively, 0.4 and 0.8 in the January 2015 WEO Update). Over the medium term staff has
a somewhat less sanguine outlook than the authorities’, but not by much as the latter have
adopted a cautious approach, not including in the projections the likely effect of the structural
reforms that have already been and are being implemented.
The improved macroeconomic outlook and the reform already introduced over the last few
years have led to an improvement in companies’ financial structure and to a more diversified
access to financing for Italian business, particularly SMEs. The introduction in 2011 of the
Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) scheme, and its recent enhancements, virtually
cancelled out the tax advantage of debt finance. Positive results are emerging: in 2014 the
gradual strengthening of firms’ risk capital continued, also favored by increased foreign
capital inflows and by a wave of new stock-exchange listings. Tax incentives have been
introduced for venture capital and other measures have been taken to liberalize credit markets.
The re-composition of firms’ financial liabilities towards less reliance on bank funding
has proceeded on the back of a greater recourse to bond emissions, including by new
issuers and small unlisted firms benefitting from the provisions on the so-called mini-bonds
adopted in 2012. Overall, corporate financial debt and leverage have decreased; firms’
liquidity is high. This said, the authorities are well aware that more efforts are needed to
enhance capital markets, whose weaknesses reflect long-standing structural features of the
Italian productive system.
Financial sector
The banking system continues to be sound and resilient, as it has been throughout the crisis,
even without receiving any significant state support. The results for the Italian banks of the
Comprehensive Assessment conducted last year at the euro area level have been generally
positive. They confirmed the system’s overall resilience to extreme shocks. The two banks
showing capital shortfalls under the adverse stress test scenario have presented recapitalization
plans and already successfully completed substantial rights issues. At the end
of 2014 Italian banks’ common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1) was at 11.8 percent, with a sizeable
rise from 10.5 percent the year before; the coverage ratio of the NPLs increased to 44.4
percent. Markets’ assessment of the soundness of the Italian banks improved. Financial
supervision remains attuned to the highest standards, as acknowledged by the 2013 FSAP.
However, the effects of the prolonged recession continue to unfold. In 2014, banks’ overall
profitability remained weak, but improved with respect to 2013, thanks to continued efforts

to enhance efficiency and cut costs. Operating profits were almost completely absorbed by
loan loss provisioning as a consequence of the worsening in credit quality. The sharp rise of
NPLs mainly reflected the impact of the recession on firms’ capacity to generate income and
thus service their debt, despite the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio being one of the lowest
among the large euro area countries. The weaknesses of the insolvency regime and the
unfavorable tax treatment of loan-loss provisioning have been impediments to the reduction
of the stock of NPLs. In order to reduce it, targeted actions may be required, particularly by
helping to develop a secondary market for this kind of assets. As previously mentioned, the
authorities have recently adopted measures going in these directions.
Looking ahead, signs of improvement in the credit market are emerging, extending also to
the business sector. Credit conditions are reported as gradually easing. Exposure to interest
rate risk, even in the case of a prolonged period of low yields, is limited for both banks and
insurances. Italian insurers benefit from balanced cash flows, with good matching of yields
and duration between assets and liabilities.
Fiscal policy
As staff underscores, the fiscal stance, which continues to be guided by SGP rules, strikes the
right balance between the need to strengthen the fiscal accounts and the need to support
economic activity. The authorities remain well aware of the need to lower the public debt
ratio. However, we would complement the information included in this respect in the Staff
Report with two relevant points that are omitted:
 According to the Fund’s structural fiscal indicators (see Table A.23 of the Fiscal
Monitor most recent issue), Italy has one of the lowest pension and health care debt
among advanced countries (26 percent against an average of almost 134 percent for
advanced economic, measured by the NPV of projected increases in pension and
health care spending over the next 40 years).
 The dynamic of the debt ratio in the last few years has been negatively affected by the
above mentioned payment of arrears and, especially, by the support to the euro-area
financial assistance mechanisms (for a total of 6.2 percentage points of GDP).
Conclusions
Italy is undertaking simultaneous reforms in multiple critical areas, consistent with the IMF
policy advice. The implementation pace has significantly accelerated over the last year, and
efforts are paying off: together with improved external conditions, they have favored the
turning point of the business cycle.
It is now critical to consolidate the recovery. The stable return to a balanced and solid growth
is essential to support the efforts to deleverage public and private balance sheets, reduce the

benefits of structural reforms. As argued earlier, the policy agenda is clearly defined and
works are advanced on a number of fronts, in a context of continued prudence for fiscal

policy. The authorities are determined to keep momentum and to continue delivering. They look
forward to further constructive interactions with IMF staff.
