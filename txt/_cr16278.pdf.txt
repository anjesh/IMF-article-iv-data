IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Korea

On July 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Korea.
After decades of impressive economic progress, Korea’s growth has slowed, and the economy is
facing a number of structural headwinds, including: unfavorable demographics; heavy export
reliance; pockets of corporate vulnerabilities; labor-market distortions; lagging productivity; a
limited social safety net; and high household debt. Inequality and poverty are also of concern. On
the positive side, Korea has considerable fiscal space to manage these challenges.
Growth has been sluggish since 2012, reflecting not only a series of shocks but also a steady
decline in the economy’s growth potential. The authorities have responded proactively with
fiscal and monetary support, along with measures to contain the rapid increase in household debt.
Activity started to pick up in the second half of last year but slowed again in the first quarter,
reflecting the expiry of the consumption tax cut (which was later extended), weaker fixed
investment, and a payback in inventory accumulation.
Growth is projected to tick up to 2.7 percent this year and 3.0 percent in 2017, with inflation
remaining subdued. The anticipated pickup in activity is based on growing private consumption,
a stronger housing market, and the impact of fiscal and monetary easing. On the other hand,
export prospects will likely remain difficult, weighing on fixed investment. Credit is expected to
continue to grow, partly reflecting the impact of interest rate cuts, but at a slower pace consistent
with the tightening of prudential measures and the envisaged moderation in construction
investment after 2017.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Korea’s remarkable economic achievements over the past sixty
years. They noted, however, that the Korean economy now faces structural constraints to sustain
its strong growth, including rapid population aging, a heavy reliance on exports, rising corporate

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

vulnerabilities, labor market distortions, and lagging productivity. Directors supported the
authorities’ strong emphasis on structural reforms to overcome these constraints and raise growth
potential.
Directors broadly agreed that, given Korea’s low public debt, fiscal support can be used to
incentivize structural reforms, cushion any adverse effects, and support growth. They concurred
that a carefully targeted expansion of social expenditure over the medium term could help reduce
poverty and inequality and aid rebalancing by bolstering consumption and raising productivity.
In this context, they acknowledged the authorities’ aim to safeguard long run fiscal
sustainability, in view of future challenges arising from demographic change and possible
reunification. A few Directors noted that there is room to accommodate higher social spending in
the medium term without being offset by additional revenue or expenditure cut. A few other
Directors felt that any additional spending should be budget neutral or met by a revenue
enhancement. Directors welcomed the authorities’ consideration of a fiscal rule to anchor fiscal
sustainability over the medium term.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts on corporate restructuring, and urged timely
implementation of such efforts for distressed firms while ensuring an adequate social safety net
for affected workers. They welcomed the plan to recapitalize the policy banks, but stressed the
importance of sufficient budgetary resources and the need to unwind the bridge financing
provided by the Bank of Korea.
Directors concurred that labor market reforms are critical to address segmentation and boost
female labor force participation. They underscored the need to promote competition in the
service sector and among small and medium enterprises to raise productivity. They also
welcomed the authorities’ strategy to develop a “creative economy” by fostering innovation.
Directors broadly agreed that fiscal and monetary policies should remain supportive, in view of
the current weak conjuncture and downside risks, and welcomed the authorities’ announced
fiscal stimulus and recent policy rate cut. A few Directors, however, expressed caution regarding
the effectiveness and potential implications of further fiscal and monetary stimulus. Directors
recommended tightening and harmonizing macroprudential standards across banks and nonbanks
to contain risks from rising household debt.
Regarding the external sector, some Directors called for a more explicit focus on reduction of the
current account surplus. Directors stressed the need to continue to allow the exchange rate to
move flexibly to facilitate rebalancing and adjustment to shocks. They recommended limiting
intervention to addressing disorderly market conditions and encouraged disclosure of such
interventions. Directors supported the authorities’ plan to ease capital flow management
measures.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 14, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Background. After decades of impressive economic progress, Korea’s growth has
slowed, and the economy is facing a number of structural headwinds, including:
unfavorable demographics; heavy export reliance; pockets of corporate vulnerabilities;
labor-market distortions; lagging productivity; a limited social safety net; and high
household debt. Inequality and poverty are also of concern. On the positive side, Korea
has considerable fiscal space to manage these challenges.
Policies for long-term growth and inclusion. Structural reforms in the above areas
are critically important. Fiscal policy can be used in a complementary manner, both to
incentivize such reforms and to cushion any possible negative effects. In addition, a
carefully targeted expansion of social expenditure, sustained over the medium term,
could address inequality while bolstering consumption-led growth and even
contributing to financial stability. Fiscal rules could be introduced to ensure that
additional spending is financed by eventual revenue increases, to preserve
sustainability.
Near-term macroeconomic policies. The recently announced fiscal stimulus and
monetary easing were appropriate, and the fiscal package should be finalized and
implemented as soon as possible. Given the weak conjuncture and downside risks, the
macro policy stance should remain supportive. Prudential regulations should be
tightened, and better harmonized across financial institutions, to contain risks from
household debt. The exchange rate should remain flexible, and the authorities should
continue to avoid persistent, one-sided intervention.
Implications for rebalancing. Many of the above policies will not only boost growth
but also change its composition—corporate investment will rise, public and private
saving will decline, and the large current account surplus will moderate gradually. As
the economy rebalances, the economy will become less dependent on volatile external
demand, and households will share more in national growth outcomes. Moreover,
rebalancing will contribute to global economic resilience, and this too will benefit
Korea.

CONTEXT
1.
Korea has had a remarkable track record of economic performance. One of thirteen
success stories identified by the Commission on Growth and Development (2008)1, Korea embarked
on, and adhered to, a government-guided export-promotion strategy that delivered average growth
in excess of 7 percent for nearly fifty years. Per capita income surged from 5 percent of that of the
United States in 1960 to around 55 percent by the time of the global financial crisis. Within two
generations, Korea vaulted into the OECD, its goods and services became known around the globe,
and its national corporate champions entered the ranks of the world’s most recognized companies.
At the same time, the fruits of this success were widely shared. Land reform in the 1950s, low-cost
education opportunities, a dynamic business environment, and high social mobility helped facilitate
an egalitarian development path, and social indicators have long been impressive.

GDP Growth

Growth, however, has now declined, and income convergence may slow in the face of
structural headwinds. The economy has suffered OECD Countries - GDP Growth and PPP per capita income

include:


Demographics. With one of the lowest birth rates in the world, Korea is also one of the
world’s most rapidly aging societies, and fiscal outlays are expected to rise sharply.2 The
fraction of the population that is of working age is projected to peak in 2017 and decline
rapidly thereafter, depressing potential employment and growth. The overall population is
expected to start declining after 2025, with negative implications for domestic demand.



Export dependence. Korea’s economic success came on the back of exports, but that heavy
reliance may now be a liability in a world of slowing trade. With exports exceeding
50 percent of GDP—one of the highest shares among advanced economies—Korea is
heavily exposed to spillovers, particularly from China, its largest trading partner. China’s
slowing growth, rebalancing toward domestic demand, and moving up the value chain will
all affect Korea substantially.3



Sectoral weaknesses and corporate vulnerabilities. Some of the heavy industrial sectors
that underpinned Korea’s past growth—for instance, shipbuilding, shipping, steel, and
petrochemicals—are now facing bleak prospects globally given the trade slowdown and
competition from China. As in other countries, excess capacity in these sectors may need to
be shed. While Korean corporates overall appear relatively healthy, there are a number of
firms in these particular sectors that are struggling and will need to be restructured.4



Labor-market issues. Korea’s problem of a declining working-age population is
compounded by labor-force participation rates, particularly for females, that are below the
OECD average. In addition, the highly segmented labor market is distorted and inefficient—
employers’ easy access to “non-regular” labor not only promotes inequality among workers
but also leads to under-investment in firm-based training; separately, the heavily senioritybased compensation system leads firms to push older, more skilled workers into early
retirement, to the detriment of overall labor productivity.



Lagging productivity. Labor productivity is particularly low in the service sector—much
lower than in peer economies, and only half that of manufacturing—reflecting in part
regulatory barriers to competition. Productivity is also disappointing among SMEs—just
one-third of what it is among large enterprises (and down from one-half in the late 1980s).5



Insufficient social protection. Korea has rapidly traversed from emerging- to advancedeconomy status and has not yet built a comprehensive social safety net. The Basic Livelihood
Security Program (BLSP), introduced in 2000, provides cash and in-kind benefits to the most
vulnerable but is substantially less generous than the OECD average. The National Pension
System (NPS) currently covers about one-third of the elderly, and the OECD reports that
pension benefits were only around one-quarter of the average wage in 2015.6 These
inadequacies boost private-sector precautionary savings and depress consumption and
growth. They also may have contributed to increasing household debt: many retirees borrow
to open (risky) small businesses, in an attempt to supplement their incomes. Total social
spending amounts to just 10 percent of GDP, less than half the OECD average, and while
population aging will drive this up sharply over the long run, social spending will remain
relatively low for the next twenty years, with multiple adverse consequences.



Rising household debt. This represents both a short-term vulnerability, with possible risks
to financial stability, and a structural issue, insofar as high debt can depress households’
propensity to consume and dampen medium-term growth.7

3.
Income inequality and poverty are also issues of concern. Korea’s Gini coefficient had
fallen to among the lowest in the world in the mid-1990s and then rose somewhat in the wake of
the Asian crisis. While the Gini coefficient remains near the OECD average today, the gap between
the richest and poorest quintiles is now slightly higher than average. Moreover, social mobility,
traditionally achieved through education and entrepreneurship, is not as strong as in the past—only
20 percent of households were able to move to a higher income bracket between 2011 and 2014,
while a similarly sized share slid into a lower bracket. Finally, relative poverty rates, particularly
among the elderly, are among the highest in the OECD.8
4.
Low public debt affords policymakers room to respond to some of these challenges,
although Korea faces fiscal pressures in the long run. With debt just 38 percent of GDP now, and
on a downward trajectory over the next decade or two,9 Korea has substantially more fiscal space
than most OECD comparators. Over the longer term, however, fiscal pressures mount. The
authorities’ conservative baseline projections show debt reaching 60 percent of GDP by 2060 on
account of population aging, but slowing growth and the potential costs of possible future
reunification with North Korea could push debt far higher than this. The authorities place high
priority on fiscal consolidation, which could keep debt around 40 percent of GDP in the long run.10
5.
Against this background, the Article IV discussions focused on the structural and fiscal
reforms needed to boost growth and make it more inclusive. Korea may not reprise the
sustained, very rapid growth it achieved in decades past, but sensible, well-targeted reforms can
help the country to lean against the many headwinds that it faces, improve potential growth, and
spur job creation. As described below, a comprehensive package of structural reforms, backed by
the judicious use of Korea’s fiscal space, is needed to boost growth and improve welfare. Such
policies will also likely contribute to a gradual rebalancing of the economy, which will increase
Korea’s resilience and also make the global economy safer. It may be challenging to develop
consensus for these reforms, even with fiscal support, but they are needed for Korea to realize its full
potential. Status quo policies will not suffice.
6.
Policies also need to be calibrated carefully to provide short-term support to the
economy while addressing risks. Given the weak conjuncture and downside risks, recently
announced fiscal support and monetary easing were appropriate, and the fiscal package should be
finalized and implemented as soon as possible. In addition, going forward, the macro policy stance
should remain supportive. Prudential regulations should be tightened, and also harmonized across
banks and nonbanks, to contain risks from household debt. The exchange rate should continue to
be allowed to move flexibly, with intervention limited to addressing disorderly market conditions.
7.
Economic policymaking may be challenging given the current political environment. In
the April general election, the ruling Saenuri party lost its plurality in the National Assembly. Given
Korea’s presidential system, President Park will remain in power until her (single) term ends in

February 2018, but with the legislature now led by the opposition parties, the passage of economic
reforms may be complicated.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
A. Recent Developments
8.
Activity has been sluggish since 2012. The economy has been buffeted by shocks—the
Sewol ferry accident in 2014, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in mid2015, and the global trade slowdown more recently—in response to which the authorities
proactively provided monetary and fiscal support, including policy rate cuts, a supplementary
budget and tax cuts in 2015, and frontloading of expenditure plus a recently announced fiscal
package for 2016. Activity started to pick up in the second half of last year but slowed again in the
first quarter, reflecting the expiry of the consumption tax cut (which was later extended), weaker
fixed investment, and a payback in inventory accumulation, which had made strong contributions to
growth in 2015. The most recent high-frequency data have been mixed, while the output gap
remains negative (around 1½ percent of potential GDP).
9.
The weak external environment has weighed heavily on Korea. As in many other
regional economies, nominal exports fell sharply during 2015 and early 2016, with the largest
declines seen in exports to Asian partners and emerging markets in other regions. Export volumes
held up somewhat better but have declined this year. Reflecting Korea’s integration in global supply
chains, the decline in exports led to a decline in imported parts as well, and given soft domestic
demand and low commodity prices, overall imports
fell even more sharply than exports did, pushing
the current account surplus to a record-high
7¾ percent of GDP in 2015. 11 (See Box 1.) At the
same time, Korea experienced portfolio outflows in
the aftermath of the “RMB tantrum,” in anticipation
of Fed “lift-off,” and, to a lesser extent, following
Brexit. After two years of appreciation, the real
effective exchange rate began to weaken, and the
authorities appear to have sold foreign-exchange
reserves during several months over the past year.
Financial conditions generally remain stable, despite substantial volatility in capital flows at times.
Brexit led to initial sharp losses in Korean equities and the value of the won, but these were largely
reversed in the following week, amid continued uncertainty in global markets.

11
Low oil prices caused the current account surplus to swell by around 2 percent of GDP, with some of this expected
to reverse in the future, but there was little positive impact on growth, possibly because weak prices partly reflected
weak global demand, which was a negative for Korea.

Box 1. Korea’s External Position1
Korea has one of the world’s largest current account surpluses relative to GDP. Heavy investment kept
the current account in deficit during most of Korea’s rapid growth phase, and it was only after the Asian
crisis that the current account balance reliably turned to surplus. During 1999-2009, it averaged 1½ percent
of GDP, but since the global financial crisis, it has risen sharply, reaching 7¾ percent in 2015. A similar
outturn is expected this year. Korea’s net international investment position (NIIP) turned positive for the first
time in 2014 and reached 14½ percent of GDP in 2015.
There are explanations for part of the current account surplus. Given the weak conjuncture, it is natural
both that household saving would rise and that investment would decline. Large changes in terms of trade—
particularly related to the oil price—have also played a significant role in widening the surplus. Korea’s
demographics—its rapidly aging population, and the many citizens in prime saving years—are another
factor, as is the objective of saving for possible future reunification costs. Finally, it is important to correct for
certain balance-of-payments accounting practices in BPM6—in particular, retained earnings that accrue to
foreign owners of Korean capital will eventually have to be paid out, and this justifies part of the saving
implied by the current account surplus.
Nonetheless, a current account gap remains. After adjusting for all of the above factors, the current
account surplus appears to be on the order of 3 percent of GDP larger than justified by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
The current account gap is a symptom of underlying imbalances, which can be addressed through
policies. The gap implies that the economy is saving too much and investing too little, to the detriment of
Korea’s own welfare. Appropriate structural and fiscal policies can boost consumption and growth, improve
productivity, and stimulate corporate investment, all of which will lead to a stronger economy in which
households share more equitably in economic outcomes. At the same time, the economy will rebalance
somewhat away from volatile external demand (but not completely, as Korea is a small, open economy). The
current account surplus will decline, and Korea’s stock of net foreign assets will continue to grow, albeit
somewhat more slowly. All of this will also make the global economy more resilient, which again will be to
Korea’s benefit.

Reflecting economic slack and low oil prices, inflation has been subdued. Headline CPI
inflation dropped, by early 2015, to its lowest levels since mid-1999 and even now hovers around
1 percent, well below the Bank of Korea’s (BOK’s) target, which was recently reduced from a range of
2½–3½ percent to 2 percent. Core inflation has been more robust, with some moderation in early
2016, reflecting the dissipation of the impact of the 2015 cigarette-excise hike.

While the real economy has lagged, the

private credit is only slightly above trend, given sluggish
corporate borrowing. Credit growth to the household
sector, however, reached 11 percent y/y in 2015 on the
back of earlier rate cuts and a loosening of
macroprudential measures. About one-third of this
credit has come from non-bank financial institutions

(NBFIs), such as insurance companies,12 mutual credit cooperatives, savings banks, and securities
companies. The growth of nonbank household credit has accelerated and may continue doing so as
banks’ lending standards tighten.
12.
The financial system remains resilient. Financial soundness indicators—capital adequacy,
liquidity, and asset quality of both banks and NBFIs—are relatively strong on a point-in-time basis,
but they may weaken as banks realize losses on exposures to firms affected by the economic
slowdown; indeed, the banking sector’s NPL ratio ticked up to 1.9 percent in March 2016.13 Bank
credit growth has weakened recently and could slow further given elevated credit risk in the
corporate sector. In addition, bank profitability is very low by international standards, possibly on
account of banks’ policy responsibilities, as well as the low nominal interest rate environment. The
government recently implemented the Basel Committee’s recommendations on additional capital
requirements for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and countercyclical capital buffers
(which were set at zero initially).

Household debt surged last year. Debt reached 163 percent of net disposable income—
above the OECD average of 131 percent. Some key drivers have been: (i) population aging;14 (ii) a
sustained rise in chonsei prices;15 and (iii) the recovery in housing prices.16 Against this background,
the authorities announced more stringent bank screening of loan applications, a faster restructuring
of the mortgage market toward amortizing and fixed-rate loans, and tighter LTV limits on nonbanks’
nonresidential mortgages. The authorities are also considering asking banks to monitor a
comprehensive debt-service ratio (DSR) for borrowers. Following the announcement of these

12

Insurance companies in Korea can—unusually, in international comparison—make direct loans to households,
including both mortgages and loans collateralized by the value of insurance policies.

13

Corporate restructuring could also pose a risk, but commercial banks’ exposure to vulnerable sectors is relatively
limited, and loan loss reserves are adequate, with a coverage ratio of more than 145 percent, as of March 2016.

14

As discussed in Annex IX, many of the elderly borrow once retired so as to open small businesses with which to
supplement their old-age income.
15

Under the chonsei rental system, two years of rent are typically paid with an upfront deposit, which is often
borrowed from a bank. Landlords have steadily been demanding higher deposits in recent years on account of lower
interest rates.

16

House prices have been rising in the Seoul metropolitan area, while prices in other regions have weakened after
increasingly rapidly over the past few years. Overall, house prices do not seem overvalued according to the usual
affordability metrics, as discussed further in Annex IX.

Pockets of vulnerability persist in the corporate sector. Aggregate corporate leverage is
moderate, with nearly 90 percent of companies having a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 2. But the
financial soundness of firms in certain export-oriented industries, as well as construction, has
deteriorated as sales have slumped. The share of vulnerable firms—those with an interest-coverage
ratio below 1.5—has been high since the global financial crisis and rose beyond 35 percent last year.
Stress tests suggest that a 1 percent slowdown in external demand would reduce Korean corporates’
earnings growth by up to 1¼ percent, with serious implications for corporate investment and
economic growth.17

B. Outlook and Risks
15.
Staff continue to forecast a modest recovery. Broadly in line with Consensus, staff
forecast growth to tick up to 2.7 percent this year and 3.0 percent in 2017, with inflation remaining
subdued and the output gap closing only by 2021.
The anticipated pickup in activity is based on
growing private consumption, a stronger housing
market, and the impact of fiscal and monetary
easing. On the other hand, export prospects will
likely remain difficult. Sluggish exports and
heightened uncertainty will weigh on fixed
investment, and stockbuilding will continue to be a
drag. Credit is expected to continue to grow, partly
reflecting the impact of interest rate cuts, but at a
slower pace consistent with the tightening of

17

See Annex VII for detail of these stress tests, as well as the 2015 Article IV Consultation for Korea, which analyzed
the impact of weaker corporate balance sheets on investment. Annex IV describes how policy recommendations from
the last Article IV Consultation were taken up.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

macroprudential measures, the narrowing of the credit gap, and the envisaged moderation in
construction investment after 2017.
16.
Risks are to the downside. A number of factors could lead to weaker outcomes than
indicated in the baseline forecast:18


Domestic risks. Private consumption has been weak for several years, and the assumed
rebound may not materialize, particularly given the drag from household debt. Corporate
restructuring, while essential for the longer term, could lead to higher unemployment and
weaken consumption (although strong social safety nets would minimize this effect).
Corporate restructuring could also have an adverse short-term impact on banks’ balance
sheets, hampering their ability to extend credit and causing them to tighten lending
standards.



External risks. Korea is one of the countries most heavily exposed to China, and a hard
landing there, or a significant slowdown beyond WEO projections, would depress Korea’s
exports further. A faster-than-expected move by China up the value chain could also
generate more competition for Korea. On the other hand, rebalancing toward consumption
could raise Chinese demand for a wide array of Korean goods and services, including
cultural products. (See Annex VI.) Finally, tighter or more volatile global financial
conditions—particularly following Brexit—could lead to capital outflows, falling asset prices,
and rising funding costs, with adverse effects on activity.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities had a slightly more optimistic forecast than staff, while acknowledging
that growth momentum is weaker than desired. They agreed that household debt can be a drag
on consumption and growth but also suggested that the increase in household saving over the past
few years partly reflects rising life expectancy. They were less concerned about the unwinding of
expenditure frontloading since revenue overperformance would allow the budget to be executed
according to plan. They suggested that their efforts to increase budget execution rates, along with
the carryover from last year’s stimulus, as well as the planned new stimulus, would help to support
growth. They noted that risks from corporate restructuring could be contained, as budget provisions
for unemployment benefits would cover affected workers, while arrangements were being made to
ensure that creditor banks remain well capitalized (see below). While they were closely monitoring
possible spillovers from China, they felt that Korea’s position in global value chains and diversified
export base could help mitigate these risks. Instead, they saw the possibility of disruptive global
market conditions as the main risk to the forecast. Brexit was not seen as likely to have a substantial
impact on Korea, given that direct trade and financial linkages between Korea and the U.K. are
limited; the authorities, however, noted that medium- and long-term risks could exist during the
U.K.’s exit negotiation process. Finally, they suggested that higher oil prices could benefit Korean
exports by boosting demand in oil-exporting nations.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Boosting Potential Growth and Fostering Inclusion
18.
With the economy facing major structural headwinds, a comprehensive set of policies
is key to reinvigorating long-run growth and fostering inclusion. Structural measures are
needed in a number of areas, including corporate restructuring, labor market reform, and
productivity enhancement. Fiscal policy can play a complementary role, to incentivize these reforms
and to cushion their near-term impact. In addition, social safety nets should be strengthened, both
to address inequality and poverty, and also to boost consumption-led growth and contribute to
rebalancing. Given long-term fiscal pressures, enhanced social spending would eventually need to
be paid for with revenue increases (or cuts in other expenditure), and the authorities could commit
to this, and thus ensure debt sustainability, by introducing a set of formal fiscal rules.

Corporate restructuring
19.
The authorities have made substantial progress on corporate restructuring. A threetrack approach has been devised, covering: (1) shipbuilding and shipping; (2) more routine cases of
individual distressed firms across the economy; and (3) the overcapacity sectors of steel,
petrochemicals, and construction. In early June, the government announced broad plans for Track 1,
along with measures to recapitalize two policy banks that could face losses as firms are
restructured.19 (See Box 2.) The authorities also announced their intention to further improve policy
lending (including the banks’ capacity to handle corporate restructuring), which staff see as key to
helping avoid future problems. In addition, to minimize the impact of corporate restructuring on
employment and the regional economy, the government on June 30 designated the shipbuilding
industry as a sector that would require special support. Tracks 2 and 3 may proceed with minimal
government involvement, with the latter aided by the recently passed “one-shot” law, which
streamlines procedures and offers tax incentives for mergers and acquisitions.
20.
Staff commended the authorities for their focus on corporate restructuring and urged
that it proceed expeditiously. Speedy implementation of the strategy, including not only financial
but also operational restructuring of distressed firms, combined with social spending to help
affected workers is critical. Staff’s empirical analysis suggests that resolving the debt overhang could
meaningfully boost investment and stimulate hiring, and a review of the international evidence
suggests that corporate restructuring is associated with higher GDP growth afterward, and that
swift, decisive action is vital.
21.
The authorities’ preemptive action to safeguard the capital position of the policy
banks is also welcome and should be done with adequate fiscal support. Recapitalization of
policy banks is the responsibility of the fiscal authorities, although procedural constraints have also
implied a short-term role for the BOK in providing bridge financing. Staff see this involvement as
consistent with the BOK’s mandate for price and financial stability, but to ensure continued
monetary independence and fiscal accountability, the exposure should be unwound—i.e., either
19

As of June 2015, specialized banks, including Korea EXIM, KDB, and other public banks, accounted for almost half
of the credit supplied to large firms with an ICR below one for a prolonged period.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

repaid from fiscal resources or sold through markets—as soon as possible, and the government
should back up its intention to support an early exit of the BOK by providing sufficient resources for
recapitalization in the budget. At the same time, the financial supervisory authorities should
continue to monitor commercial banks’ exposure to vulnerable sectors, and continue to require
banks to maintain sufficient loan loss reserves.
Box 2. The Authorities’ Plan for Shoring up the Capital of Policy Banks
The state-owned policy banks Korea EXIM and KDB are the main creditor banks for many of the
firms in the five vulnerable sectors identified by government. Their lending to the shipbuilding and
shipping industries amounted to KRW 58 trillion (around 3½ percent of GDP) as of March 2016. The banks
are currently adequately capitalized, but the government estimates that KRW 5 to 8 trillion in additional
capital would be required for them to continue meeting Basel III requirements after some loans are written
down in the process of corporate restructuring. Recapitalization would safeguard financial system stability
and ensure that the banks remain able to fulfill their policy functions.
The government will provide KRW 1 trillion of in-kind, Tier 1 capital (shares in state-owned
enterprises) to Korea EXIM in 2016. It also plans to provide additional Tier 1 capital to Korea EXIM and
KDB through the 2017 budget. And in case of systemic financial risk, the government and the BOK, which
has a 12.4 percent ownership stake in Korea EXIM, may also consider additional direct capital injections into
that bank.
Separately, a Policy Bank Recapitalization Fund of up to KRW 11 trillion has been set up under the
management of the Korea Asset
Management Company (KAMCO). The
fund will be financed by KRW 1 trillion in
loans from the Industrial Bank of Korea
(IBK, another policy bank), on behalf of the
government, as well as up to KRW
10 trillion in loans from the BOK.1 The
BOK’s exposure will enjoy two levels of
credit protection, since it will be senior to
KAMCO’s junior tranche, and since it will
be insured by the Korea Credit Guarantee
Fund (KODIT), which is in turn fully backed
by the government. The BOK’s loans will
be of short tenor (one year or less, as per
the Bank of Korea Act), but the BOK can
lend again.
The fund, which was launched on July 1, will purchase policy banks’ Tier 1 or Tier 2 contingent
convertible (CoCo) bonds, on a capital-call basis. The pattern of use of the fund will depend on the
extent and speed of corporate restructuring, in addition to the credit condition of the vulnerable industries.
The fund will be in operation through end-2017. This date may be changed during the end-year review of
the fund, but in any case the government has expressed its support for early redemption of the BOK loans.

———

The BOK can lend only to banks, and its contribution to the fund will thus be channeled via the IBK. The IBK’s own contribution
will be channeled via KAMCO to benefit from favorable risk weighting.

Labor markets
22.
Labor market reforms are another key priority. The September 2015 Tripartite Agreement
between unions, employers and the government contained many important reforms but later lost
support from some key actors. A package of labor laws, based on the Tripartite Agreement, is now
stalled in the National Assembly. The government remains committed to labor-market reform and
has issued policy guidance to employers to promote the “wage-peak” system, emphasize
performance-based assessment, and clarify conditions for dismissal. Key priorities are as follows:


Addressing labor market duality. Market segmentation results in youth unemployment,
inequality, and insufficient investment in training. A priority is to dampen firms’ incentives to
hire non-regular workers by: (i) fostering cooperative labor relations; (ii) expanding benefits
for non-regular workers; and (iii) reducing labor-market rigidities by introducing
performance-based assessment and clear conditions for dismissal. In addition, broadening
access to training for non-regular workers will foster productivity.



Boosting labor force participation. Addressing labor market duality will help improve
female job participation and increase birth rates, but further measures are also needed—
these could include providing well-targeted support for childcare, facilitating flexible work
arrangements, improving work-life balance, enhancing job search and training support, and
addressing gender-based job inequalities.

Productivity
23.
Boosting productivity in the service sector and among SMEs is another area of focus.
Korea’s regulatory environment for upstream service sectors (e.g., electricity, gas, and rail) is very
stringent in international comparison. Staff estimates suggest that if this regulatory burden were to
diminish and reach the OECD frontier by 2025, it could boost TFP growth by about ¼ percentage
point each year. Significant productivity gains can also be achieved by promoting competition and
deregulation in healthcare, education, and professional services. As for the SMEs, government policy
should prioritize fostering growth and innovation, rather than shielding less competitive firms. Staff
analysis suggests that Korea is one of the countries most exposed to China's rebalancing. Korea may
need to move further up the value chain, develop sectors that benefit from increased consumption
in China, and enhance its traded services sectors, and as all that happens, the SME sector will also
need to respond dynamically.
24.
Against this backdrop, the government recently announced a three-pronged strategy
to strengthen the service sector. The plan includes: (i) promoting synergies between services and
manufacturing; (ii) revamping infrastructure oriented toward services; and (iii) nurturing new
businesses, notably in healthcare and tourism. To this end, the government will provide greater tax
benefits and other financial support and will also embark upon deregulation to promote
competition. The overall objective is to ensure that public policy supports both manufacturing and
services in an equitable fashion, and the authorities aim, in this way, to promote the creation of
250,000 new jobs in the service sector, and to increase the sector’s share of the economy from
60 percent currently to 65 percent by 2020.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

Complementary fiscal policy
25.
Fiscal support should be mobilized to incentivize and cushion any adverse impacts of
structural reforms. Additional, well-targeted subsidies for children and for childcare, for instance,
could stem declining fertility and improve labor force participation. Fiscal incentives could perhaps
be designed to make Korea’s substantial R&D activity more effective, complementing the
authorities’ efforts to promote a “creative economy.” (See Box 3.) And fiscal support, including
unemployment insurance benefits, retraining opportunities, and job-search facilities, could assist
workers affected by corporate restructuring or labor market reforms—this would allow more
equitable outcomes and increase the likelihood of developing consensus for structural reforms.
Box 3. Developing the “Creative Economy”
In the face of declining growth, the government is implementing a strategy to develop Korea’s
“creative economy.” The export-led growth model was a good match in a world of expanding trade, but
some rebalancing may now be needed. The Korean authorities are seeking to foster innovation and create
new firms and decent jobs. The intention is to transform the economy by creating a virtuous business ecosystem that facilitates the emergence of new industries and promotes higher-value added in existing
industries. The government hopes that these efforts will raise total factor productivity, reduce savings, and
boost private investment.
A wide range of measures have been introduced, including:


Centers for Creative Economy and Innovation. The government has set up 17 Centers for Creative
Economy and Innovation (CCEIs) nationwide, which provide close support to start-up entrepreneurs. The
centers serve as R&D clusters and provide customized support matching each venture’s growth stages,
all the way up to expansion into global markets. The government also aims to develop the Pangyo
Creative Economy Valley as a Korean version of the Silicon Valley.



Start-ups and venture capital. The government has facilitated firms’ access to venture capital and IPOs,
enhanced “cooperative competition” between large firms and SMEs, and strengthened the regulatory
environment for the protection of intellectual property (IP) rights by creating a market for trading IP (i.e.,
a stock exchange for small firms).



New markets and industries. The government has tried to create new markets and industries through
the fusion of science, technology and ICT, notably in biomedical sectors, nanomaterials, and renewable
energy. The government has also promoted M&A activity, including by revising laws on private equity.

Source: Government of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning.

The government sees these efforts as bearing fruit. The number of start-ups exceeded 30,000 for the first
time in 2015, and new start-up investment reached an unprecedented level. The innovation centers are
operating in full swing throughout the nation, and a total of KRW 176.6 billion of investment for 1,050
startups has been secured, with 7,044 cases of test product support carried out as of May 2016.

26.
In addition, a carefully targeted expansion of social expenditure, sustained over the
medium term, could yield multiple benefits. Increasing social spending would directly reduce
relative poverty among vulnerable groups such as the elderly, nearly half of whom are poor.20 It
could also—by increasing those groups’ disposable income and reducing households’ need for
precautionary savings—boost consumption-led growth and reduce the economy’s reliance on
volatile external demand. It could contribute to financial stability by reducing retirees’ borrowing to
open small businesses. And it would give the authorities more room to rationalize support to SMEs,
thus boosting labor productivity. Staff see scope for increases in the basic income as well as the
national pension, among other programs. Additional spending to strengthen the public education
system would also be desirable.21
27.
To preserve sustainability, revenue increases will be needed in the long term to pay for
expanded social spending, and fiscal rules could help ensure that these materialize. Increasing
revenues too early would, by reducing household disposable income, undercut the desired boost to
consumption and growth. But given the long-run fiscal challenges facing Korea, it is clear that
compensatory measures will be needed eventually. Increases in social contributions would be a
natural place to focus,22 and tax measures could also be considered—at just 21 percent of GDP,
Korea’s revenue burden is currently one of the lowest in the OECD.23 A set of fiscal rules could help
make the authorities’ commitment to future measures more credible. (See Box 4.)

Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities vigorously agreed on the importance of structural reforms to boost
growth, foster inclusion, and rebalance the economy. They noted that corporate restructuring
would move ahead quickly and that the unemployment fund would provide sufficient coverage
for affected workers. They agreed that fiscal policy would play the lead role in policy bank
recapitalization and viewed BOK involvement as fully consistent with its mandate, noting that
such involvement would be as part of a contingency plan. Going beyond corporate restructuring,
they emphasized that the government had laid out a broad reform agenda that includes: (i)
labor-market reform; (ii) reforms in state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (iii) measures to improve
Korea’s already impressive educational system; and (iv) financial sector reforms, focused on
deregulation and technological innovation. In aid of all of these, the government has emphasized
20

OECD Economic Surveys: Korea 2016.

21

Improving the quality of schools and access to public afterschool tutoring would reduce Korean households’
private spending on education, which, at 38 total spending, is nearly double the OECD average.

22

In this context, a faster pace of increases in the retirement age could also be considered. Automatic adjustment
mechanisms could also be envisaged, whereby the authorities would commit to introducing a particular revenue
measure if the debt, or the deficit, breached a certain threshold.

23

Box 6 in the 2015 Article IV Consultation staff report discusses Korea’s taxes in international comparison and
suggests some areas for reform—viz., streamlining tax expenditures, including deductions and exemptions under the
personal income tax and corporate income tax; reducing income shifting, and the resultant loss of tax revenue,
caused by differing personal, corporate, and capital gains tax rates; and moving property taxes away from
transaction-specific levies and more toward recurrent taxes on property owned. Increasing the VAT rate from the
current 10 percent—one of the lowest in the world—to the OECD average of 18 percent could, for instance, yield
3¾ percent of GDP in extra revenues. Similarly, reducing the unusually large standard deduction under the personal
income tax could generate 3¼ percent of GDP in revenues. There may also be room to raise the CIT rate.

the need to improve the services sector, and it has implemented a strategy to develop the “creative
economy.”
Box 4. Toward a Rule-Based Fiscal Framework
The Korean authorities are deeply committed to fiscal prudence, and their budget formulation and
execution are generally very sound. Against this background, it is no surprise that the general government
debt-GDP ratio is only about one-third of the OECD average.
Korea’s current fiscal framework, however, faces two main challenges:

 Countercylical policy. Supplementary budgets can be introduced only under very specific, and quite limited,
circumstances (e.g., war, natural disaster, or a recession). While this usefully guards against repeated revisions
to the original budget, it may also at times hamper policymakers’ ability to conduct countercyclical short-term
fiscal policy.1

 Long-term anchor. While the authorities’ commitment to long-term fiscal sustainability is well understood,
and they have laid out scenarios in which consolidation efforts keep debt around 40 percent of GDP in the
long run, there is no formal anchor in place.
A rule-based fiscal framework could address these challenges. Fiscal rules have been increasingly used
around the world—only 5 countries had one in 1990, but nearly 80 did by 2012 (Schaechter et al., 2012)2—and
Korea may benefit as well. This topic is currently under discussion in Korea, and a proposal may be submitted in
the near future. Staff intend to do further work in this area, drawing on recent Fund analysis3 and including
consideration of the appropriate design and escape clauses. One possibility would be to introduce a pair of rules:

 A structural budget balance rule would provide a framework for countercyclical fiscal policy, though it could
also introduce some communication difficulties, given the uncertainty in estimating the output gap.

 This could be combined with a debt ceiling—this would anchor public debt at a prudent level while allowing
policymakers the flexibility to choose the tax and spending mix. Some public discussion would be required to
pin down the appropriate debt level—it may be that 40 percent of GDP over the long run is too conservative,
especially considering the multiple benefits of additional social spending, as described above, including the
aim of rebalancing the economy.

Indeed, formal econometric analysis suggests that there is room to enhance the degree of countercyclicality of fiscal policy.

The authorities were open to staff’s fiscal policy recommendations but stressed the
importance of preserving long-run sustainability. They were in full agreement on the need for
fiscal policy to support structural reforms. They also agreed on the benefits of a stronger social
safety net, but they noted that social spending was already on a rising trajectory, and they were wary
of introducing new entitlements. Their strategy for dealing with rising social spending is first to look
for possible increases in pension and healthcare contributions from those who would be enjoying
larger benefits, next to seek savings through discretionary expenditure reform, and only then to
consider increased taxation, which they do not envisage for the time being. Fiscal rules have been
under discussion in Korea, and the authorities welcomed staff’s further analysis of the topic.

B. Providing Short-term Support and Addressing Vulnerabilities
Fiscal policy
30.
Given the weak conjuncture and downside risks, staff urged additional fiscal stimulus,
as the primary instrument to bolster aggregate demand. The authorities’ plans to ensure full
execution of the budget and to provide off-budget stimulus of KRW 6.5 trillion (close to ½ percent
of GDP) appeared helpful but not sufficient, especially since the frontloading of budget spending in
the first half of the year implied at least some fiscal tightening during the rest of 2016, which would
hinder the recovery. Staff suggested that Korea is one of the few Asian economies with both the
need and the space for fiscal stimulus. A package of about 1 percent of GDP—ideally implemented
as a supplementary budget—would be similar to the 2015 stimulus and likely sufficient to boost
growth toward the authorities’ target of 3 percent, without threatening debt sustainability. 24 As
Korea already has well developed infrastructure, stimulus spending could instead focus on targeted
transfers to the most vulnerable (and most likely to spend). Tax measures could also be considered.

On June 28, the authorities announced a fiscal package of more than KRW 20 trillion
(1¼ percent of GDP) to support the economy and employment. This will include a KRW 10
trillion supplementary budget, as well as spending through other channels, such as the SOEs.25 While
the supplementary budget is still being formulated, the overall package will feature a broad mix of
measures including: larger unemployment benefits; economic support, via public infrastructure
spending and other measures, of the regions most affected by corporate restructuring; an increased
tax deduction for housing rent; and tax incentives for the replacement of old diesel cars and for the
purchase of highly energy-efficient home appliances, to name just a few elements. These measures
are placed in the context of a broader government economic strategy, including an effort to develop
11 new growth engines for the economy. Staff estimate that the fiscal package will boost GDP by
around 0.3 percent, spread over 2016 and 2017.26 While the government expects that these

Multipliers are on the order of 0.3—low, given the economy’s extreme openness. (See Fiscal Expenditure and
Macroeconomic Policy, Korea Institute for Public Finance, March 2013.)

measures will largely be paid for by revenue overperformance (and thus will not require additional
borrowing), this nonetheless represents discretionary stimulus to the economy.

Monetary policy
32.
Staff also recommended monetary easing, and following the BOK’s recent rate cut, a
continued supportive stance appears to be appropriate. Monetary policy may not by itself
provide strong stimulus—it could create negative wealth effects for deposit holders, it could raise
chonsei prices27 and thus reduce renters’ disposable income, and it will not address structural factors
behind weak investment and exports. Nonetheless, staff saw a case for coordinated fiscal and
monetary easing, to send a strong signal and boost confidence. Risks to household debt could be
addressed via a tightening of macroprudential policy, and risks of capital outflows were seen as
manageable. After keeping the policy interest rate at 1.5 percent for almost a year, the BOK cut the
rate by 25 basis points on June 9, just after the Article IV mission. In light of the weak conjuncture
and downside risks, the BOK should maintain a supportive stance.

Macroprudential and external sector policies
33.

Further measures are needed to address macrofinancial risks:



Household debt. The authorities have responded to the rapid growth of household debt
with several measures, but the DTI cap of 60 percent remains high in international
comparison and should gradually be tightened toward 30 to 50 percent. The DTI cap should
also be extended to apply to other types of household debt (including so-called “group
loans”28); the planned monitoring of a debt-service ratio is a welcome step in this direction.
These measures should reduce financial risks and, by reducing household debt, also help
consumption and growth.



Nonbank credit. While nonbank lending to households is smaller than bank lending and
grew at a slower rate in 2015, it has accelerated this year. This deserves close monitoring,
not only because of the risks nonbank credit has posed in other countries (and indeed, in
Korea as well, during the past), but also because, in Korea’s highly tiered financial system,
nonbanks cater to less creditworthy customers and thus face elevated risks. Staff
recommended the continued harmonization of prudential regulations across banks and
nonbanks. This includes insurance companies, which engage in direct lending to
policyholders but may have limited expertise in assessing credit risk, as well as savings banks
and mutual credit cooperatives, which have looser capital requirements than commercial
banks, and whose lending is often used by households to finance risky small businesses.



Institutional framework. As recommended in the 2013 FSAP, separating macroprudential
policymaking from crisis management would increase transparency and accountability
among the relevant agencies and ensure greater independence.

27

Landlords tend to ask for increased chonsei deposits when rates fall in order to keep their interest income up.

34.
The planned easing of measures aimed at curbing capital inflows is appropriate. After
the global financial crisis, the authorities introduced macroprudential tools and capital flow
management measures to contain exposure to liquidity risk and foreign-exchange risk. These
included a ceiling on banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio, a leverage cap on banks’ foreign exchange
derivatives positions, and a levy on foreign exchange funding. The government expanded the
application of the macroprudential stability levy to NBFIs in 2015 while narrowing the application to
short-term FX borrowing. These measures were successful in increasing financial sector resilience by
limiting exposure to liquidity risk, reducing maturity mismatches caused by short-term FX
borrowing, and more generally lengthening the maturity of the financial sector’s FX borrowing.
Recently the authorities announced a relaxation of some of these measures, including raising the
leverage cap and allowing for a lower bank levy in case of sudden capital outflows. These are
appropriate given that the pressure of capital inflows has declined as the interest differential has
narrowed.
35.
The exchange rate should continue to be allowed to move flexibly, with intervention
remaining limited to addressing disorderly market conditions. A flexible exchange rate will help
the economy to weather external shocks, a role that can be supported with appropriate
macroprudential measures, such as the planned FX liquidity coverage ratio.29 Staff also suggested
that publishing data on intervention, with an appropriate lag, as in most advanced economies, could
be considered.

Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities agreed that macro policies should be supportive. While they believed
that earlier announced fiscal measures (such as expenditure frontloading and SOE spending) would
provide more support than staff acknowledged, they were nonetheless open to further stimulus and
later announced a package, to guard against the possible negative impacts of corporate
restructuring, difficult external conditions, and the end of the earlier consumption tax cut. As for
monetary policy, the authorities emphasized the importance of considering the timing of possible
Fed tightening, as well as the risks of capital outflows and of growing household debt. Nonetheless,
given the weak conjuncture, the BOK eased on June 9.
37.
There was also broad agreement on staff’s other short-term policy recommendations.
The authorities agreed on the need to monitor the growth of household debt closely and expected
it to moderate in the future as a result of recent measures. They also agreed on the need to
harmonize requirements across banks and nonbanks to contain nonbank credit growth. They did
not, however, see the need to change the current institutional framework for macroprudential policy
and crisis management. On external sector policy, the authorities noted that exchange rate flexibility
29

The authorities plan to introduce a foreign-currency liquidity coverage ratio (FX LCR) in 2017. While the regulation
has not been issued yet, the intention is to require commercial banks to hold at least 60 percent of their foreignexchange debt in high-quality liquid assets to withstand a 30-day net cash outflow in case of systemic risk. (The
required ratio increases gradually to 80 percent by 2019.) Foreign bank branches are exempted. Basel III suggests
that an FX LCR can be a useful monitoring tool. Basel III also requires implementation of a general LCR, which Korea
implemented in 2015.

would continue. While they continued to have concerns that publication of intervention data could
lead to speculative moves in the markets, this remains under consideration, in the context of
negotiating trade agreements.

C. Implications for Rebalancing
38.
Many of the policies described above will help to rebalance the economy. They will
tend to reduce savings, boost investment, and support growth. For example: strengthened safety
nets will reduce the need for private precautionary saving and boost consumption; corporate
restructuring will, over time, promote increased investment; and measures to boost the birthrate and
increase labor-force participation will raise growth, while labor-market reforms will boost
productivity. All of these steps will imply a reduction of Korea’s large current account surplus—but
not an elimination, or reversal, of that surplus, meaning that Korea’s stock of net foreign assets will
continue to grow, albeit more slowly. The exchange rate will need to stay flexible to accommodate
this transformation. Rebalancing will make the economy more resilient and help sustain Korea’s
growth in a world of slowing trade. It will also have the salutary effect of making the global
economy less vulnerable, which will be to the benefit of an open economy like Korea.

Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities saw the increase in the current account surplus as a temporary
phenomenon and agreed that rebalancing would be beneficial. The authorities agreed that
terms-of-trade gains and weak domestic demand contributed to the large current account surplus,
as did some Korea-specific factors, such as the country’s particular demographic profile and the
fiscal challenge of possible future reunification with North Korea. Nonetheless, they agreed that
narrowing of the surplus from its current level would be desirable. They also agreed on the
importance of exchange rate flexibility but emphasized that the current account surplus is unrelated
to a weak exchange rate.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Korea has made remarkable economic progress over the past sixty years, but potential
growth has slowed and inequality and poverty are areas of concern. The country is facing major
structural headwinds including: rapid population aging; a heavy reliance on exports; corporate
vulnerabilities; labor market distortions; and lagging productivity, particularly in the service sector
and among SMEs. Staff strongly support the priority that the Korean authorities have placed on
structural reforms to counter these headwinds.
41.
Corporate restructuring has been an area of particular emphasis for the authorities.
Staff commend the authorities for their focus on this key issue and urge that plans for financial and
operational restructuring of distressed firms be implemented swiftly, while ensuring an adequate
social safety net to assist affected workers is critical. The authorities also deserve praise for
proactively making arrangements to safeguard policy banks’ capital positions, and fiscal policy
should play the lead role in this process.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

42.
Given Korea’s low public debt, there is space to use fiscal policy in a complementary
fashion. Fiscal support can incentivize structural reforms and cushion any possible adverse effects.
In addition, a carefully targeted expansion of social expenditure, sustained over the medium term,
could reduce poverty and inequality, bolster consumption-led growth, and even contribute to
financial stability. Given the long-term fiscal pressures from population aging, increased spending
would need to be matched by eventual revenue increases, and the authorities could formalize their
commitment to such measures, and to fiscal sustainability overall, by introducing fiscal rules.
43.
Given the weak conjuncture and downside risks, macroeconomic policies should
remain supportive. The authorities have already been proactive in their short-term policy
responses, recently announcing a new fiscal stimulus and cutting the policy rate, both of which were
appropriate. The fiscal package should be finalized and implemented as soon as possible, and going
forward, the macro policy stance should remain supportive. Macroprudential standards should be
tightened, and also harmonized across banks and nonbanks, to contain risks. The exchange rate
should continue to be allowed to move flexibly, with intervention limited to addressing disorderly
market conditions. Most advanced economies also publish intervention data, with an appropriate
lag.
44.
Many of the policies described above will tend to reduce savings, boost investment,
and support growth. Korea’s large current account surplus will moderate slowly over time, and the
economy will be able to rebalance away from weak and volatile external demand. The exchange rate
will need to be flexible to accommodate this transformation, and to help the economy weather
external shocks.

Technical
Background
Notes

Background. The current account (CA) in 2015 was around 7¾ percent, 1½ p.p. higher than in 2014 and significantly above the average
over the last 5 years. This increase is fully explained by cyclical factors, such as more favorable terms-of-trade (in particular, lower oil
prices), and a larger negative output gap, which are expected to revert somewhat in 2016 leading to a slight decline in the CA. The CA is
expected to decline moderately over the medium term as the output gap narrows and, especially, as the projected rapid aging of the
population sets in.
Assessment. The EBA regression model puts the cyclically adjusted CA norm for 2015 at just above 1¼ percent, implying a CA gap of
about 6 percentage points of GDP. A small part of this estimated gap could be accounted for by relatively low public social spending in
Korea and the fiscal policy gaps of other countries, but there are also important Korea-specific factors not fully captured by the model’s
variables—these include prospective costs of reunification with North Korea, demographic factors, and certain BOP accounting
anomalies—all of which may result in higher-than-expected savings. Accounting for these considerations, staff assess the 2015 current
account gap at 1¾ to 4¼ percent of GDP. 1/
Background. The won has been on a gradual appreciating trend on a trade-weighted basis since 2012, having appreciated by
1½ percent in 2015 relative to its 2014 average. (This, however, masks important movements in cross rates—in particular, the won
depreciated against both the U.S. dollar and the yen, but strengthened vis-à-vis the euro and most emerging market currencies.) The
REER as of April 2016 has depreciated by 2 percent from its 2015 average.
Assessment. EBA’s REER regressions suggest a wide range of estimated gaps. According to the index model, the won is stronger than
fundamentals and desired policies, by 1½ percent, whereas the level model estimates the won to be substantially weaker, by
14¼ percent. The REER for 2015 is assessed to be 4 to 12 percent weaker than the level consistent with fundamentals and desired
policies. The assessed range uses as inputs EBA’s level model and estimated elasticities (top of the range), as well as staff’s estimated
elasticity (bottom of the range). 2/
Background. Net capital outflows increased to 8 percent of GDP in 2015, driven chiefly by a decrease of portfolio investments of nonresidents in Korea since 2014. The Korean government launched a plan to promote both residents’ overseas investment and to attract
inflows from nonresidents in mid-2015.
Assessment. Korea has experienced moderate bouts of capital-flow volatility in the past year, but net and gross flows appear
sustainable.
Background. Korea has a floating exchange rate. Reserves increased steadily from 2009 through mid-2014 but have since remained
stable at around 121 percent of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric. In dollar terms, reserves increased by $4 billion in 2015.
Assessment. Intervention should be limited to smoothing excessive volatility. The stock of reserves should be sufficient to buffer against
a range of possible external shocks.
1/ Current Account. EBA estimates that Korea’s cyclically adjusted CA remained roughly unchanged from 2014 at 7.1 percent, while the
EBA norm stood at 1¼ percent. The resulting EBA gap of 6 percent is, for the most part, unexplained by the EBA model (4½ percent), while
the remaining 1½ percent can be attributed to policy gaps. The assessed CA gap range of 1¾ to 4¼ percent of GDP takes into account
Korea-specific factors not in EBA, namely it accounts for precautionary savings tied to prospective reunification with North Korea,
demographic factors—Korea is undergoing rapid population aging while having a disproportionate share of its population in prime saving
ages (see Kwon, Kyooho (2015), “Impact of Demographic Changes on the Current Account,” KDI working paper)—and adjustments to the
treatment of foreigners’ share of retained earnings in BPM6.
2/ REER. Staff’s assessment of the REER gap is subject to a high degree of uncertainty related to both the difficulty in predicting when and
by how much Korea’s exports will respond to exchange rate movements, as well as the diversity of estimates produced by the EBA’s
exchange rate regression models. Staff analysis suggests that Korean export volumes have become highly inelastic to exchange rate
movements in the short run, and where the longer term implications of the won’s recent real appreciation are particularly difficult to
project.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015
was substantially stronger than
that implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policies.
Developments as of April 2016
point to a broadly similar
external position in 2016. This
assessment is subject to
uncertainty related to the
persistence of the large fall in
oil prices—Korea being one of
the largest oil importers in the
ESR—and the sharp movements
of relevant cross rates.
Potential policy responses:
Building domestic demand
growth momentum in the near
term could have some impact
on reducing imbalances, and
the recent monetary, fiscal, and
other policy steps to boost
domestic demand are steps in
the right direction. A more
durable reduction will require a
steady shift away from Korea’s
heavy reliance on
manufacturing exports for
growth—increasing productivity
in the non-traded sector, aided
by structural reforms
(particularly those focused on
the labor market), would help.
The authorities’ more
expansionary fiscal policy
stance, both this year and over
the medium term, could narrow
imbalances, all the more so if
coupled with an expanded
social safety net that reduces
the need for precautionary
savings. Real exchange rate
appreciation over time should
also play a role, and the rate
should remain market
determined with intervention
limited to smoothing excessive
volatility.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Current
account

Korea
Background. Korea’s net international investment position (NIIP) increased to 14½ percent of GDP in 2015, after turning positive for the
first time in 2014. This position is expected to strengthen further to 19½ percent of GDP in 2016 as the current account is in strong
surplus. The net external debt position was -23½ percent of GDP in 2015. Banks’ short-term external debt remains below pre-crisis
levels. The risk of currency mismatch in the non-financial sector is also limited, since the bulk of short-term external debt is in the hands
of exporters who hedge using forward contracts.
Assessment. The NIIP position and dynamics present little risk to external sustainability.

High
China is Korea’s main trading partner, accounting for
25 percent of its exports. While most of these are
intermediates intended for processing in, and reexport from, China, Korea also produces for Chinese
final demand and is thus vulnerable to a slowdown in
China. Second-round effects could come into play as
a China slowdown would affect the global economy.

A significant slowdown in large EMs or

A sharp deterioration in the housing market possibly
triggered by extreme shocks to the macroeconomy,
could also lead to an increase in household credit
risks. Corporate sector stress testing indicates that a

Annex IV. Main Recommendations from the 2015
Article IV Consultation and Follow Up
1.
The 2015 Article IV Consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 13, 2015.
Executive Directors saw merit in proactive policies to shore up near-term growth momentum, along
with structural reforms to sustain growth over the longer term.
2.
Directors welcomed the monetary, fiscal, and other policy changes that the authorities
implemented to reinvigorate domestic demand. They agreed that there remained room for further
monetary easing, if needed, and that Korea’s low public indebtedness provided ample room for
additional fiscal stimulus and a strengthening of social safety nets.
3.
Directors emphasized that Korea’s ability to continue growing through a heavy reliance on
gaining export market share is increasingly limited. They concurred that achieving a more balanced
growth path depends critically on addressing long-standing barriers to higher productivity in the
non-traded goods and services sectors.
4.
Directors noted that the structure of household debt could be strengthened through
additional steps to facilitate the transition of the mortgage market toward more stable, longer-term
lending. Directors stressed that maintaining a flexible exchange rate is essential to facilitate Korea’s
adjustment toward domestic sources of growth, and concurred that official foreign exchange
intervention should be limited to preventing disorderly market conditions and not prevent needed
exchange rate adjustment.
5.
Given the weak conjuncture and downside risks, the authorities have responded proactively
and put in place a number of measures to spur economic recovery:


In 2015, a supplementary budget introduced stimulus of about 1 percent of GDP, and in
2016, the authorities frontloaded spending within the year, extended tax cuts, and most
recently announced a 1¼ percent of GDP stimulus package.



The Bank of Korea cut its policy interest rate by 50 basis points over the past year.



The authorities implemented a set of household debt management measures including
more stringent bank loan application screening, accelerating the loan conversion program,
and tighter LTV limits on nonbanks’ nonresidential mortgages.



The authorities plan to unwind some of the earlier macroprudential measures aimed at
curbing capital inflows.



The authorities have made progress on corporate restructuring, especially in the
shipbuilding and shipping industries.



The government issued policy guidance aimed at reducing labor market rigidities.

Annex V. Korea’s Challenges—Parallels with Japan1
This annex draws out the parallels between Korea and Japan, particularly in terms of the aging
population but also notes that Korea has stronger corporate and public balance sheets than Japan did.
It conducts an econometric analysis that suggests that aging in Korea will exert a downward drag on
inflation going forward.
1.
Korea’s current environment of rapid aging, slowing growth, and low inflation has
sparked comparisons with the Japanese economy. Indeed, some of the structural issues facing
Korea currently and going forward are similar to those already confronted by Japan. It is also
important to note upfront, however, that Japan’s economic woes since the early 1990s were also the
consequence of a series of domestic and external shocks that made Japan’s economic developments
during those decades rather distinctive.2

A.

Structural issues and balance sheets

2.
Korea’s demographic trends seem to track Japan’s with a lag of about 20 years,
reflecting large gains in longevity, low fertility rates, and limited immigration. After peaking at
63 percent in 1995, Japan’s working-age population ratio declined to about 56 percent in 2015,
while Korea’s working-age population ratio is projected to peak at 66½ percent in 2017, and then
fall quickly to 56 percent in less than 20 years.3 Japan’s population started to contract in 2010, while
Korea’s is expected to begin its decline in 2025–35.
3.
In both countries potential growth has fallen sharply, reflecting similar factors. Japan’s
potential growth plunged from an average 4 percent in the late 1980s to less than 1 percent in the
2000s (text chart). In the early 1990s, the decline was primarily the result of deceleration in capital
formation and a reduction in total factor productivity growth. In the late 1990s, weak investment
growth and declining labor inputs due to aging were the main culprits. Both sluggish investment
and productivity growth were to a large extent the consequence of delayed restructuring and
balance sheet repair (Danninger and Steinberg, 2015). Indeed, after the collapse of asset prices in
the late 1980s, banks and firms were slow in addressing balance sheet problems, and nonviable
“zombie” firms with low productivity continued to operate. As banks needed to rebuild capital
buffers, lending was constrained, and private investment declined. Repeated fiscal stimulus was
needed to support the economy. In Korea potential growth dropped quite dramatically as well—
from the record high of 8 percent in 1991 to below 3 percent in 2015— reflecting a decline in the
contributions from labor, capital inputs, and productivity. Slow restructuring of nonviable firms may
1

Japan’s initial crisis was sparked by the collapse of bubbles in its stock and real estate markets in the early 1990s. As
the economy started to recover in the mid-1990s, the Asia crisis struck in 1997, pushing Japan close to a financial
meltdown. When the economy seemed to mend again in 1999–2000, renewed systemic stress was triggered by the
collapse of the global information technology bubble in March 2000. Once again a sustained recovery seemed to be
underway when the global financial crisis unfolded. And following a short rebound, the economy had to confront the
2011 earthquake (Syed, Kang, and Tokuoka, 2009; Berkmen and Lee, 2014).

have contributed to the productivity slowdown. Going forward, the contribution from labor inputs to
potential growth will continue to shrink, based on demographics projections, assuming only a mild

In both countries, productivity growth has been sluggish, especially in the nonmanufacturing sector. In Korea, labor productivity rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in 19952001, but remains only 40 percent of that of the three most productive OECD countries. In addition,
labor productivity in the service sector is only half what it is in manufacturing, and much lower than
in peer economies, perhaps partly reflecting regulatory barriers to competition. In Japan, labor
productivity is about half that of the frontier OECD economies. In the service sector, it only increased
by 25 percent since 1970, while it roughly tripled in the manufacturing sector.

In both economies, productivity has been adversely affected by labor market
segmentation. In Japan the share of non-regular workers grew from 20 percent in the early 1990s
to 35 percent (Aoyagi and Ganelli, 2013). In Korea the share of temporary workers—a proxy for nonregular employees—was nearly 22 percent in 2014, double the OECD average. This has taken a toll
on productivity, as temporary workers have fewer incentives to excel, and employers do not invest in

their development. At a broader societal level, this situation has created a two-tiered workforce and
contributed to inequality.
6.
Both Korea and Japan have to confront, or have confronted, balance sheet
weaknesses, but the scale of the problem seems quite different. In Japan, corporate debt was
very elevated in the 1990s, at over 140 percent of GDP. As noted above, delays in recognizing nonperforming loans, cleaning up balance sheets, and adequately recapitalizing banks led to continued
fragility in the banking system, which, in turn, limited its ability to extend new loans and support the
economic recovery. After a process of deleveraging and slow restructuring in the 2000s, corporate
debt reached just over 100 percent of GDP in 2015. Korea’s current corporate debt to GDP ratio is
just over 100 percent of GDP, but certain sectors—such as shipbuilding, shipping, and
petrochemicals—are in need of restructuring. Japan’s experience highlights the importance of
expeditiously recognizing NPLs, and strengthening balance sheets.

7.
Household debt is higher in Korea than it has ever been in Japan. In the latter, the
household debt to GDP ratio has been fairly steady at 65–70 percent, while in Korea it rose steadily
from 40 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to nearly 90 percent of GDP today.
8.
The position of public sector balance sheets is a key difference between the two
countries. Japan’s public debt to GDP ratio soared from 70 percent in 1990 to over 250 percent in
2015, driven by social security spending, and fiscal stimulus packages in response to the slowing
economy and to shocks— such as the 2011 earthquake. In contrast, Korea’s public debt remains
modest, less than 40 percent of GDP in 2015, although according to the authorities’ projections it
could reach 60 percent of GDP by 2060 on account of population aging, or even higher if growth
slows, or if fiscal outlays related to possible future reunification are considered. Given its strong
public-sector balance sheets, Korea has the space to use fiscal policy to incentivize essential
structural reforms and cushion any possible negative effects in the short run.

B.

Inflation

9.
The protracted period of low inflation in Korea has raised concerns that the country
may be heading toward an environment of excessively low inflation like Japan’s. Korea’s
average headline inflation rate plunged quickly from 4 in 2011 to 1.3 percent in 2013, remaining at

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

around 1–1.5 percent since then, and below the authorities’ target since late 2012. Movements in
Korea’s headline inflation since January 2011 appear similar to those in Japan in the early 1990s,
when inflation slid from nearly 4 percent in early 1991 to 1 percent in 1993, before dipping into
negative territory in 1995.

There are, however, some important differences between Korea’s inflation now and
Japan’s inflation in the early 1990s. Korea’s core inflation has remained more robust than
headline, at around 2 percent in 2014 and 2015, with some moderation in early 2016. Declining fuel
and energy prices explain the positive differential between core and headline inflation over this
period. In contrast, in Japan, core inflation was lower than headline inflation rate in the early 1990s,
and then followed the same downward trend as headline inflation. Besides, in Korea the downward
trend in headline inflation seems to have bottomed out in early 2015, when the economy was at its
weakest point. Conversely, Japan had a steady transition to deflation from early 1991 to early 1995.
Moreover, in Korea the share of consumption items with negative inflation—which rose from less
than 20 percent in 2012–13 to nearly 40 percent in mid-2015— includes almost exclusively fuelrelated items. Instead, in Japan the fraction of the consumption basket with negative inflation—
which increased steadily from less than 10 percent in 1990–91 to 50 percent at the end of 1995—
comprised items from several different product groups.

11.
Demographics are believed to have
affected inflation dynamics in Japan, and this
may be the case for Korea, too, especially going
forward. Aging could impact inflation by affecting
relative prices, including land—old people typically
prefer smaller houses. Aging could also have an
impact on inflation by discouraging demand for
investment, as lower labor supply and productivity
depress potential output and real rates of return
(Ding, 2014). In addition, inflation can be affected
by demographics if declines in population
compress aggregate demand (Yoon, Kim, and Lee,
2014). Several studies have empirically assessed the
effects of aging on Japan’s inflation (Katagiri, 2012;
Shirakawa, 2012; Anderson, Botman and Hunt, 2014).4
12.
To investigate the impact of
demographics on Korea’s inflation, we estimate
a modified Phillips-curve model that includes
aging among the explanatory variables.5 Based
on the model estimates, the cumulative change in
Korea’s inflation over 2012–15 (3.3 percentage
points) is almost fully explained by expected
inflation, the output gap, world oil price changes,
and the old-age dependency ratio (text chart). The
increase in the old-age dependency ratio is
estimated to have lowered inflation by nearly
0.2 percentage points.

13.
The estimated model also allows a comparison of the contribution of aging to low
inflation rates in Japan and Korea. Historically, changes in the old-age dependency ratio have
been more disinflationary in Japan than in Korea; however, going forward there will be more
disinflationary pressure in Korea, given that Japan has aged already, while Korea’s aging will
accelerate in the coming years. Based on these estimates, aging could contribute to a further decline
in the inflation rate by 0.3 percentage points over the next five years. This suggests that the inflation
could trend downward going forward. In this environment, it will be very important to ensure that

4

Katagiri (2012) found that unexpected shocks to demand structure due to aging produced about 0.3 percentage
point deflationary pressure in the Japanese economy.

5

The dependent variable is annual average inflation. The regressors include expected inflation, the domestic output
gap, world oil price changes, and the old-age dependency ratio as an indicator of aging. Population growth is
included in some model specifications. In addition, the explanatory variable set includes different indicators of
globalization, to assess whether increased integration has contributed to lower inflation across countries (IMF, 2006;
Borio and Filardo, 2007). Most parameters of the model are allowed to vary across countries, but the coefficients on
demographic and globalization indicators are assumed to be constant. The sample includes 12 large advanced
economies and China. The model is estimated over the period 1990–2015, using Seemingly Unrelated Regressions.

expectations remain well anchored. At the same time, structural reforms aimed at raising the fertility
rate could help reduce the deflationary pressure from aging.

C.

Conclusion

14.
The speed of population aging, the prospects of a declining population, and lagging
productivity due to structural problems are the ways in which Korea resembles Japan most.
Compared to Japan, Korea is entering the phase of accelerating aging with stronger corporate and
public sector balance sheets. Nevertheless, Korea needs to progress with the restructuring of
nonviable firms. Japan’s experience illustrates how delayed balance-sheet repair, compounded with
other structural problems, contributed to a protracted period of economic stagnation. Reforms to
reduce labor market duality and promote more competition and productivity gains in the service
sector are also crucial to support productivity, which—given the shrinking workforce—becomes
more crucial as catalyst for growth.
15.
Korea has low inflation but does not appear to be headed toward deflation. However,
given the possible downward pressure on inflation from aging going forward, the central bank will
have to closely monitor inflation expectations, and act decisively should they start to trend down
consistently. At the same time, structural reforms to prop up the fertility rate could help reduce the
deflationary pressure from the aging population.

Annex VI. Korea—Quantifying the Impact of
China’s Rebalancing on Korea’s Income and Trade1
This annex presents a multi-country, multi-sector Ricardian trade model that is used to simulate the
impact of China’s rebalancing on Korea. In the model, China’s move up the value chain has the
potential to have significant negative consequences for Korea. At the same time, there are effects not
captured in the model—for instance, Korean service exports could benefit from rising household
income in China.
1.
Developments in China are of key interest for Korea given the close economic ties
between the two countries. Korea’s trade exposure to China is of particular significance, with China
accounting for more than 25 and 20 percent, respectively, of Korea’s gross exports and imports.
Financial links have also strengthened between the two countries.
2.
The structural rebalancing of the Chinese economy consists of several distinct
transformations. These are captured in four separate scenarios, to permit an analysis of the
independent impact of each facet of rebalancing:


Scenario 1 (preference shock): China consumes more and moves away from investment;



Scenario 2 (move-up-the-value-chain shock): China moves up the production value-chain,
becoming more competitive in higher-tech manufacturing and in the process potentially
displacing imports of sophisticated parts from Korea and others; and



Scenario 3 (services-manufacturing rebalancing shock): China’s services sector
outperforms manufacturing.

3.
A Ricardian trade model is used to assess the impact on Korea from rebalancing in the
Chinese economy based on the three scenarios listed above.2 Quantifying some of these effects
requires having a rich model of linkages across both economies and sectors. The model is calibrated
to fit trade flows and the input-output structure of production in 2011 across 40 economies and the
rest of the world, with each consisting of 34 traded and nontraded sectors.3
4.
At the same time, like any model, it has limitations, including the fact that it excludes
trade in services, which could grow in importance for Korea as China’s households become richer
and consume more, and the fact that it is a one-period model (and thus does not factor in dynamic
losses, such as the frictions associated with shifting from one sector to another). Also, policy
responses to each scenario are not considered.
5.
This annex complements other work (at the Fund and elsewhere) evaluating the
impact of spillovers from China. This earlier work either empirically estimates spillovers from China

The model used here is a generalization of Caliendo and Parro (2015) to account for a wider set of counterfactual
experiments and follows the tradition of Eaton and Kortum (2002).

on aggregate variables of other countries, most often GDP, or studies impulse responses in dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium models.4 The Ricardian model used here has a rich set of predictions
of trade patterns because it focuses uniquely on that channel, unlike other approaches, and is
designed to capture changes in production value-chains.
6.
The model shows that Korea is particularly vulnerable to a move by China up the value

chain. While the last scenario generates muted spillovers in terms of income and real wages across
large countries, the “preference shock” (Scenario 1) and the “move–up-the-value-chain shock”
(Scenario 2) are associated with declines in Korea’s income and real wages. A direct comparison of
Scenarios 1 and 2 is not appropriate since the former assumes a full shift of China’s final demand to
match that of the U.S., something that will likely take years, while Scenario 2 uses an illustrative
productivity shock of 1 percent. Scenario 2 generates the most adverse spillovers to Korea as long as
the underlying productivity shock is more than 3 percent—a modest movement compared to that
assumed in Scenario 1 (see figure showing the sensitivity to the size of shock in Scenario 2).
Considering the three scenarios separately:6


A shift in Chinese preferences towards consumption away from investment (Scenario 1),
results in a contraction of 0.25 percent in Korea’s income. Real wages and imports from
China also contract, with exports to China remaining broadly unchanged. Under this
scenario, Taiwan Province of China, whose income falls by 0.47 percent, is more adversely
affected than Korea, while other large countries are relatively less affected. The adverse
effects can mostly be attributed to changes in terms of trade (ToT) and not volume of trade
(VoT).



Scenario 2, in which China moves up the value chain, carries the most adverse impact of all
scenarios considered. Korea and Taiwan Province of China appear to be the most affected,
with real incomes falling by 0.08, but income and real wages are lower across all large
countries, except Australia and the U.S. Most of the effects can again by attributed to terms
of trade. Comparing the absolute values of spillovers in this scenario relative to those in
Scenario 1 is not appropriate, as discussed previously, since the shock here is much smaller.
Relatively small changes in China’s position in the value chain have the potential to generate
much more adverse spillovers to Korea.



Scenario 3 affects China disproportionately, and spillovers to other large countries are
modest.

Annex VII. Corporate Debt: A Firm-Level Investigation1
This annex assesses corporate debt vulnerabilities in Korea. It stress-tests the Korean corporate sector’s
earnings with respect to macro shocks and estimates the benefits and costs of corporate debt
restructuring. Preliminary estimates suggest that resolving the corporate debt overhang may cost
around 6 percent of GDP (partly already provisioned for by the banks). At the same time, corporate
restructuring would “pay off” from society’s perspective in the medium term as it may increase
investment by ½ to ¾ percent of GDP and stimulate hiring of 45,000 people per year.

A.

Corporate debt vulnerability

1.
Corporate debt in Korea has been consistently high at about 100 percent of GDP over
the last decade. This is similar to Japan and less than in China, but more than in most comparable
economies. An offsetting factor to the risks of high corporate debt in Korea is that most of it is
denominated in domestic currency.

As a consequence of the global growth slowdown, earnings of Korean manufacturing
firms have been sluggish or declining since 2011. Korea is an export-oriented economy. The
share of export in GDP is about 50 percent, higher than in most comparable economies.
Accordingly, export revenue comprises a significant share of revenue in many industries: about
50 percent on average across manufacturing, but on average 65 percent in export-oriented
industries such as shipbuilding, petroleum, electronics, automobiles, and steel. Earnings in exportoriented manufacturing held up until 2013, but took a dive in 2014. We expect to see a further
deterioration in the earnings once 2015 data comes in.

The share of firms in vulnerable financial conditions—those with the interest coverage
ratio (ICR) of less than 1.5—has been relatively stable, if high, since the GFC. Export-oriented
manufacturers had historically been healthier than the rest of the industry, but their financial
conditions were severely affected by the earnings decline in 2014.
4.
The impact of declining earnings on firms’ debt service capacity was ameliorated by
accommodative monetary policy, which reduced debt service costs. Dashed lines in the chart
below show that the share of vulnerable firms would have been higher in recent years if the Bank of
Korea have not had loosened its monetary policy stance.2

Outside the manufacturing sector, construction, shipping, and services have also
suffered deteriorating profitability and high corporate debt vulnerabilities. This trend was
partly reversed for construction in 2014 on the back of more active housing market, and for
shipping as growth resumed from a low base. Note that since construction and shipping are debt-

The counterfactual assumes that the BOK did not cut the policy interest rate from 3¼ percent in 2012 to 2 percent
in 2014, corresponding to 60 percent higher interest costs, which would be fully passed on to the firms.

The total estimated debt-at-risk and employment-at-risk in the Korean economy are
shown in the figure below. Based on the aggregation of the Orbis data, as of end-2014, total debt
in vulnerable firms (with ICR<1.5, or ICR<1 in construction and shipping) was KRW 400 trillion, or 28
percent of GDP. Total employment in those firms was 1.8 million, or 6.5 percent of the labor force.

Stress-testing corporate debt

7.
Given anticipated slow medium-term global growth, corporate debt vulnerabilities are
subject to downside risks. To assess these risks, we consider the relationship between a set of
global economic conditions variables and the earnings of Korean manufacturing firms. The
specifications with the best explanatory power (as captured by R2) link EBIT growth in Korean
manufacturing with the change in the growth rate of global GDP, global trade, and China imports.
The interpretation of this specification is that, in recent years, the EBIT of Korean firms tended to
grow when global growth accelerated, and to decline when global growth decelerated. The
regressions are time-series OLS for 2006–14, include a dummy for the 2006-10 period of high EBIT
growth (not reported), and use yearly data on the aggregate EBIT of Korean firms.

8.
We find that since 2011, the EBIT of Korean manufacturing firms has on average
declined by about 3.5 – 4.5 percent annually. However, EBIT growth increased by 1.4 percent
when global GDP growth accelerated by 1 percentage point (column 1), by 0.37 percent when
global trade growth accelerated by 1 percentage point (column 2), and by 0.45 percent when China
imports growth accelerated by 1 percentage point (column 3).

We use these estimates to formulate medium-term stress-test scenarios for the
earnings of Korean firms. Note two caveats. First, the specification is not intended to capture
steady-state relationships (for example, it predicts a permanently declining EBIT). In the long-term,
the factors explaining the EBIT of Korean firms may change, for example, as the firms engage in
corporate restructuring to respond to the challenges posed by persistently low global growth.
Second, we focus on the central projections obtained in the regressions. Although statistical
significance is low given a small number of observations, we believe that this does not undermine
the usefulness of the results as a means to obtain first-order economic relationships and establish
meaningful stress-test scenarios.
10.

We can now formulate two stress-test scenarios:



A mild/baseline scenario is based on WEO projections of modestly accelerating global
growth. WEO (2016) projects that, between 2015 and 2018, global GDP growth will
accelerate by 0.2 percentage points annually (from 2.4 to 3.0 percent), global trade growth
will accelerate by 0.43 percentage points annually (from 2.0 to 4.1 percent), and China
imports growth will accelerate by 0.38 percentage points annually (from 2.0 to 3.15 percent).
If the past relationships established in the table above continue to hold, the WEO numbers
imply that over the next three years, the EBIT of Korean firms may decline by about 10–15
percent (depending on the global factor considered). Note that, while this scenario
corresponds to the central projections based on the regressions, actual EBIT realizations may
be better, for example, in case Korean firms engage in debt and wider corporate
restructuring.



A severe stress-test scenario is one where WEO projections of modestly accelerating global
growth are offset by a downturn in global conditions, similar to that which occurred in 2007–

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

2009. Back then, global GDP growth decelerated by 5.9 percentage points (from 3.9 to
negative 2.0 percent), global trade growth decelerated by 18.4 percentage points (from
8.0 to negative 10.4 percent), and China imports growth decelerated by 12.6 percentage
points (from 14.8 to 2.2 percent). These shocks would imply an additional contraction of EBIT
of 9.5 to 13.4 percent (depending on the global factor considered), and together with the
baseline contraction of 10–15 percent would imply a total contraction of EBIT by about 2025 percent.
11.
We find that, under a mild/baseline stress-test scenario, debt-at-risk can increase by
15 percent and employment-at-risk by 10 percent from 2014 levels. Under a severe stress-test
scenario, debt-at-risk would increase by 30 percent and employment-at-risk increase by 15 percent
from 2014 levels. While these are meaningful increases, they do not appear dramatic. A concern,
however, might be that the implications of corporate debt overhand for firm investment and
employment decisions might become more acute in crisis times, should credit conditions tighten
and the perceptions of the economic outlook become more pessimistic. The charts below illustrate
the consequences of a contraction in EBIT by 10 and 15 percent (corresponding to the mild/baseline
scenario range) and by 20 and 25 percent (corresponding to the severe stress-test scenario range)
for debt-at-risk and employment-at-risk.

Benefits and costs of corporate debt restructuring

12.
To assess the economic benefits of corporate debt restructuring, we study the impact
of corporate debt overhang on firms’ investment and employment decisions. The regressions
consider how a low interest coverage ratio (ICR<1.5) affects firms’ fixed assets and employment
growth rates. The firm-level panel regressions over 2006–2014 control for past revenue and EBIT
growth (one or two lags, to capture firm-level business opportunities, similar to Tobin’s Q), and year
and industry fixed effects. We have also examined regressions that use ICR level rather than the
ICR<1.5 dummy to assess corporate debt vulnerability (not reported), and found that ICR level is
economically insignificant in explaining investment and employment growth in all specification. This
confirms our focus on ICR<1.5 as a measure of corporate debt vulnerability. The results are shown
below. The results are highly consistent across specifications, and for the full sample versus
manufacturing firms only.

We find that firms with ICR<1.5 have lower growth rates for both fixed assets and
employment (by 2.5-3 and 4.5-5 percentage points, respectively). These elasticities enable us to
assess the positive impact of corporate debt restructuring:


At end-2014, fixed assets in at-risk firms were KRW 670 trillion, or 47.5 percent of GDP.
Assuming that half of the firms undergo debt restructuring that removes the debt overhang,
investment by those firms may increase by 0.6–0.7 percent of GDP.



Similarly, employment in at-risk firms was 1.8 million. Assuming that half of the firms
undergo debt restructuring that removes the debt overhang, hiring by those firms may
increase by 45,000 per year, effecting an annual reduction in the unemployment rate of
0.15-0.17 percentage points.

14.
To assess the costs of corporate debt restructuring, we calculate the costs of resolving
vulnerable firms. We assume that half of the vulnerable firms will need to be restructured,3 and
that a restructuring entails a 40 percent loss given default for the firm’s creditors (consistent with a
low end of the range for loss-given-default estimates for loan recoveries in the U.S.—see Shibut and
Singer, 2015). We find that the total cost of corporate debt restructuring may be about 6 percent
GDP in the baseline, and up to 8 percent GDP in the severe scenario. (Note that this does not imply
the fiscal cost, as part of the costs of restructuring can be absorbed in bank capital and provisions,
as well as by the existing bondholders.)

3

This assumption is consistent with our calculation (not reported) that about half of such firms had a low ICR for
three consecutive years—thus, their vulnerability is persistent, indicating a low likelihood that these firms will be able
to grow independently or restructure themselves out of a low ICR. A lower scale of corporate restructuring will
decrease the costs and the benefits of corporate debt restructuring in the same proportion.

The key qualitative result of the exercise is that corporate debt restructuring “pays
off” in the medium-term, from society’s perspective. The quantitative estimates hinge on a set
of assumptions that, although being reasonable first approximations, can be refined to better reflect
the specific circumstances and industry conditions. But the key qualitative result will remain—viz.,
when the social benefits and costs of debt restructuring are considered jointly, it becomes apparent
that the economic costs of debt restructuring are fully offset in the medium term by more rapid
output growth and higher hiring.4 In short, corporate restructurings pay off.

Annex VIII. Corporate Restructuring and its Macro Effects1
This annex highlights issues in Korea’s corporate sector, the need for restructuring, and the authorities’
initiatives and challenges. It then identifies lessons from other countries’ experience and conducts an
econometric analysis based on cross-country aggregate data that establishes that restructuring
episodes, while sometimes challenging in the short run, have typically been associated with more rapid
economic growth afterward.
1.
The corporate sector in aggregate appears to be healthy, but pockets of vulnerabilities
have arisen. Overall corporate leverage remains relatively low. Profitability, however, has fallen since
2010, in contrast with other advanced economies where profitability remains stable or has improved.
Rising vulnerability has been more pronounced in weaker segments of corporates. Weaker firms
have become more leveraged, while their profits have declined sharply. This is in contrast with
Japanese firms, which saw a recovery in profitability and a reduction in leverage since 2010.

While credit risks have risen, policy banks have large exposure to the vulnerable
sectors. Against the backdrop of weakening performance, most of the firms’ credit ratings have
been downgraded, suggesting a rising credit risk to the banking sector. Banks’ credit exposure to
shipbuilding and shipping firms is large. The policy banks Korea EXIM and KDB, in particular, have,
as of March 2016, lent KRW 38 trillion (2¼ percent of GDP) and KRW 20 trillion (1¼ percent of GDP),
respectively, to these sectors. They are now facing potential loan losses, which could affect their
capital position and policy lending capacity. As described in the main text, the authorities have made
arrangements for policy bank recapitalization.

At the same time, the government has formed a 3-track restructuring strategy, based
on urgency and risk, aiming to focus on key risks and facilitate industry-wide restructuring.


Track 1 is to deliver industry-wide restructuring in cyclically sensitive industries—the
shipbuilding and shipping industries. As the policy banks are the main creditors, the public
sector is naturally closely involved in Track 1 restructuring. The main creditor banks have
encouraged debt-distressed firms to come up with a comprehensive revitalization plan. The
three major shipbuilding firms, as a result, revealed revitalization plans, including the sale of
non-core assets, business reorganization, and downsizing, amounting to KRW 10.3 trillion
(0.7 percent of GDP). The major shipping firms have also reached a debt reduction
agreement with creditors or negotiated charter fees.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA





Track 2 is to restructure individual weak
firms, rather than an industry itself, through
banks’ regular credit assessment under
supervision of financial supervisors. Based on
the Corporate Restructuring Act, banks assess
credit risk and reach an agreement with
vunlerable debtors on financial restructuring,
possibly through workout or rehabilitiation
programs. Against this backdrop, the number
of corporates under debt restructuring rose
to 229 as of end-2015 (including 54 large
corporations), from 159 firms in 2014.

Track 3 is to pursue preemptive industry restructuring through mergers and acqusitions
(M&A), downsizing, or business line exchanges, to address overcapacity problems, such as in
the petrochemical or steel industries. This will be led by the industry itself, especially industry
associations. The Corporate Vitality Enhancement Act (also known as the “One-Shot Law”),
effective August 2016, should facilitate M&A and restructuring through streamlined legal
procedures for M&A, spinoffs, and equity transfers, as well as tax incentives (e.g., deferral of
capital gains tax from equity transfers, and installment payments of transfer gains tax).

5.
While Korea is well placed to address corporate vulnerabilities thanks to a strong
institutional environment, progress has been slower than desired. Korea has a good track
record of corporate restructuring in the past and has further improved its restructuring framework.
Despite worsening corporate conditions since 2011, however, restructuring efforts have started to
take place only rather recently. Changing global market conditions have raised questions about the
prospects for certain sectors and Korea’s appropriate positioning in them, and against that
background, corporate restructuring has been extremely difficult. Banks tended to delay loan
restructuring on account of the highly uncertain industry outlook and fear of substantial loss
realization. There has been a concern as to the negative effect on employment and regional
economies as well as potential difficulties for major firms. Notwithstanding the progress already
made in the corporate restructuring framework, some further areas for institutional improvements—
drawing on the international experience—include:


A larger role for capital markets in normal times. In many countries, restructuring tends
to be delayed in normal times until the realization of debt distress and heavily relies on legal,
institutional arrangements. This often requires large-scale government intervention and tax
payers’ money, resulting in larger costs. The role of private equity funds is limited, as their
small size is insufficient to take over large firms. M&A activity has been traditionally low,
despite a recent pickup, and the non-performing-loans market remains underdeveloped.



Strengthening the out-of-court restructuring framework. While firms have growingly
tapped into market funding such as bonds and commercial paper, the out-of-court
restructuring framework hinges on the role of the main creditor banks. Uncertainty arises,
therefore, regarding a loss sharing between bank creditors and non-bank creditors, as banks
have less incentive to initiate debt restructuring and bear the brunt of restructuring (Cho,
2013). In this sense, Korea’s revised Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act, which came into

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

effect in March 2016, will help address some of these problems, by extending the coverage
of creditors to all the creditors including bond creditors and offshore financial institutions,
and strengthening the role of the main creditor banks through a right to request other
creditors to freeze the exercise of creditor rights.

Building on the recent progress in the corporate restructuring framework, Korea could
also benefit from international experience with corporate restructuring, including:


Swift, timely restructuring is crucial to reduce uncertainty (Japan): The financial supervisory
authorities should play an important role to encourage banks to carry out loan restructuring,
including through debt-equity swaps (Inoue, 2008).



Clear guidelines (U.K.): Clear guidelines that facilitate a collective process for workouts (e.g.,
the so-called London Approach) could be extended to non-financial creditors.



Market infrastructure (U.S.): To facilitate corporate restructuring in normal times, the
important factors are the role of transparent, reliable disclosure of firms’ business and
financial conditions, and deepening of the financial markets (i.e., M&A, or buyout funds).

7.
Empirical analysis suggests some positive impacts of corporate restructuring on
growth:
Model specification: Panel fixed effects models for 33 advanced economies from 1992–
2012 were run. The model estimates effects of a reduction in debt-to-equity (D/E), and
corporate restructuring period (DUMCDR) on growth. The corporate restructuring dummy
(DUMCDR) is defined as a more than 12 percent decline (y/y) in D/E of 75th percentile firms in
a given year, which is in line with corporate restructuring episodes in the countries in the
panel. Financial channel effects are estimated via an interaction term (DUMCDR ×FID
(Financial Institution Depth)). The model also estimates effects of M&A on growth. The
model is as follows:



The main results suggest the following:


Corporate debt restructuring could have some positive effects on growth with a lag of
one year (Panel 1). The main channel is likely through a rise in investment and capital
productivity, given their positive correlation with the corporate debt restructuring
dummy.



However, negative spillovers via financial channels could partly offset the positive
impact of debt restructuring (the interaction term). This is possibly because tighter
lending conditions and a rise in NPLs could cause deleveraging of banks.



M&A could have a positive effect on growth with a lag of two years (Panel 2). The
lagged time effect is likely because the synergy of M&A takes time to be realized given
integration tasks of different organizations, people, and culture.

Annex IX. Household Debt1
This annex examines the rise of household debt in Korea and shows that the principal drivers have
been structural factors—e.g., demographics, the unique chonsei rental system, the structure of the
mortgage market, and the large nonbank financial sector—rather than increased borrowing for
consumption. The annex also presents an econometric analysis showing that a 1 percentage point
increase in household debt leads to lower consumption by 6 basis points (without any threshold
effects).

affordability measures, the risks of a sharp real
estate price correction (and a subsequent household balance sheet recession) should be small.
2.
Household survey data indicate that household leverage (measured as debt to net
worth ratio) in Korea is around 15 percent, comparable to other OECD countries (chart). The
distribution of household assets and liabilities by product in Korea is also comparable to those in
other advanced economies. On the asset side of the household balance sheet, nonfinancial assets
account for 74 percent of total household assets in Korea, compared to 68 percent of the average of
the countries included in chart 2. On liabilities, mortgage debt accounts for 41 percent of Korea’s
total household liabilities, slightly below the average of 45 percent of the comparator countries
(chart).

3.
Besides rising house prices, several structural factors unique to Korea also contribute
to the accumulation of household debt. Demographic changes are one driver—the large babyboom generation (born between 1955 and 1963) is retiring. Household survey data indicate that the
average Korean household starts to reduce debt after the age of 58 (BOK 2015), whereas in the
United States, average household debt peaks in the 31–40 age cohort (Garriga 2014). This is related
to the fact that retirees in Korea often take loans to purchase small businesses to compensate for
the relatively low pension income. To the extent that this borrowing is largely for income-generating
investments, this may be viewed as an increase in debt, but not an increase in leverage. However,
the elderly as a group have a high relative poverty rate of nearly 50 percent (versus 16 percent
nationwide), a high concentration of debt in bullet loans and nonbank loans, and a
disproportionately high share of assets in real estate, making them particularly vulnerable to shocks.
4.
A second driver of rising household debt is the fact that the prices of Korea’s chonsei
rentals has been increasing. (The chonsei rental allows the tenant to loan the deposit—a large
share of the property’s value, often borrowed from a bank—interest free to the landlord and lives
rent-free.) The ratio of the chonsei lease price to house sales price rose from 52 percent in 2009 to
74 percent in November 2015, the highest since these statistics was compiled (BOK 2015).2 It is
estimated that total rental deposits reached 530 trillion won as of June 2014, including 90 trillion
regular monthly rental deposits (53 percent of the tenants) and 440 trillion chonsei deposits
(47 percent of the tenants), with the latter as large as 40 percent of total household financial
liabilities. Although the chonsei deposits (liabilities incurred by landlords to tenants) are treated as
transactions among households and excluded from the official household financial liabilities data, it
is possible that the rising chonsei prices have contributed to higher borrowing by tenants to pay for
the deposits.
5.
A third driver is Korea’s unique mortgage market. Reflecting Korea’s relatively young
mortgage market, a large share of houses are financed by short-term interest-only loans, allowing
households to accumulate equity in other types of assets instead of paying down mortgage
principal. Cross-country experience suggests that an increasing share of interest-only loans in
mortgage markets may contribute to rising household debt and house prices; households tend to
accumulate equity more slowly with interest-only mortgages while present-biased mortgage
borrowers are more likely to extract home equity when they refinance mortgages (Campbell 2012
and Scanlon et al. 2010). The share of variable-rate loans in Korea’s mortgage market is also high in
international comparison (Lea 2010). Although variable rate loans have the advantage that lowering
interest rates can reduce defaults when house price declines prevent mortgage borrowers from
refinancing, they could also make households more susceptible to positive interest rate shocks.
6.
Recognizing the risks associated with the structure of the mortgage market, the
authorities recently implemented a loan conversion program, aiming to increase the share of
fixed-rate, amortizing loans from less than 25 percent in 2014 to 42.5-50 percent by 2017. The
average remaining maturity of bank home mortgage loans has lengthened rapidly, from 11.6 years
at the end of 2010 to 17.5 years as of September 2015. Although the program is a welcome step
toward a more stable, long term structure of the mortgage market, it has also encouraged the shift

Rising chonsei prices may be a result of landlords’ expectations of diminished capital gains on housing.

71

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

from chonsei rentals to outright housing
purchases and bolstered demand for mortgage
refinancing. On the other hand, an increase in the
share of amortizing loans from 35 percent in 2015
to 50 percent in 2017 should increase amortizing
mortgage by about 47 trillion won. Although the
initial impact on household debt is small, as
households build up equity through amortization,
their debt will decline more substantially over time
(chart).

7.
A fourth driver is the sharp increase in
the household borrowing via the non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs). Korea’s
macroprudential measures, adopted in the first half of the 2000s, have helped mitigate risks to the
banking sector; however, they have also contributed to an increase of lending via the non-banking
financial institutions. Growth in household loans via NBFIs has outstripped that of the banking sector
for much of the time since 2011. As of 2015, NBFIs accounted for about half of household lending.
The risks of non-bank lending are related to the less regulated nature of these institutions, and their
tendency to tap less creditworthy borrowers unable to access bank funding due to tighter regulatory
requirements. From a cross-country perspective, NBFIs lending is also high in Korea compared to
that in Japan, Euro area and the United Kingdom (IMF 2014a).
8.
Finally, macroprudential policies are relatively loose in Korea. Both the loan-to-value
ratio (LTV, currently at 70 percent) and the debt-to-income ratio (DTI, currently at 60 percent) are
relatively high by international standards (IMF 2014b). Moreover, the DTI ratio only applies to
mortgage debt, unlike in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Canada where caps on DSI
ratios were imposed on a borrower’s total outstanding household debt rather than on mortgage
loans only.
9.
In addition to these unique structural factors, the increase in household debt also
reflects household expectations of future income, asset prices, etc. Although it is not
straightforward to find the optimal nexus of consumption and household leverage, empirical studies
such as Cecchetti et al (2011) suggest that for the OECD countries, household debt can become a
drag on growth. A similar exercise by staff also found a negative correlation between household
debt and private consumption. The model is specified as follows:
∆C

β g

10.
The dependent variable
is the final consumption as a percent of GDP of country i at
time t. The debt variable
is proxied by household debt as a percent of GDP. The control
variables also include the lagged real GDP growth and the lagged long-term real interest rate to
capture the overall economic activities that could translate to the change in disposable income as
well as the terms of borrowing. The lagged indices for house price (hp ) and stock price (sp )
are included as additional control variables as proxies of household assets values, which will affect
household’s consumption via the wealth effect and the borrowing capacity. Finally, first differencing
consumption and household debt removes the trend.

72

11.
The GMM two-step system dynamic panel model is used for estimation. The empirical
results confirm the negative sensitivity of household consumption to household debt. The crosscountry regressions reveal that a 1 percentage point increase in household debt as a share of GDP in
the previous period would translate into a 6 basis points reduction in household consumption as a
share of GDP in the next period. This is comparable to other estimates in the literature—Calomiris et
al. (2012), for instance, find a housing wealth effect on consumption of between 5 and 8 cents on
the dollar. The regressions do not show significant threshold effects of household debt on private
consumption (as opposed to some BOK findings, using micro-level data, which suggested that debt
would dampen consumption only once it exceeded a certain level).3

Cecchetti et al (2011) also did not find precise threshold effects for household debt on growth, although such
thresholds were found for government debt (about 85 percent of GDP) and corporate debt (about 90 percent).

Korea’s exchange rate system has been classified as “floating” since 2009. Over 1997–2008, the
exchange rate was classified as “free floating” (“independently floating” under the older classification
system). Korea maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, in accordance with UN Security
Council Resolutions, which have been notified to the Fund under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision 144 (52/51).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 17, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The overall structure of the national accounts follows the recommendations of the
2008 System of National Accounts. Chain-linked (reference year 2010) and nominal GDP estimates are
compiled using the production and expenditure approaches; nominal GDP estimates are also compiled
using the income approach. The estimation method for expenditure components, which had used the
commodity flow method before the revision to reference year 2005, adopted the direct estimation
method, in which each expenditure component is measured directly. The size of the informal sector
has not been measured.
Consumer Price Index: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 92.9 percent of total households of
Korea; it excludes farming and fishing households. The geographical coverage, which includes 37
urban areas, should be extended to rural areas. The consumption basket is updated every five years
with a plan to move to a three-year update cycle; currently, expenditure weights are derived from
the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The new CPI index adopts both geometric means
and the ratio of arithmetic means. The geometrics means should be used for all unweighted
aggregation. The missing prices of products, except for the seasonal items, are imputed by the price
movements of similar products of the same item in the same geographic area. However, the CPI could
be improved further by imputing missing prices of the seasonal items rather than carrying forward the
last reported prices.
Producer Price Index: The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a
large segment of service activity. It excludes exported products, however, because the Export Price
Indexes are compiled separately in Korea. The rebased PPI (2010 = 100) employs 2008 SNA concepts
and definitions for the record and valuation of the prices and weights. The PPI could be improved by
making more use of imputing missing prices using the prices of similar commodities, rather than
carrying forward the last reported price. Mostly, the simple geometric average and the weighted
geometric average are employed in the elementary level index compilation. But in some, the indices
are computed by the weighted arithmetic average. Nevertheless, the headline PPI should be changed
to the one based on a geometric mean at the elementary level. The PPI classification by activity
conforms to the KSIC, which is itself based on the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)–
–with slight modifications only to reflect local considerations. The Korean commodity classification
used for the PPI does not conform to the Central Product Classification (CPC) and one based on the
CPC should be adopted as soon as possible.
Government Finance Statistics: Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the
central government, one using national definitions and the other using internationally recognized
standards based on GFSM 2001. The Korean authorities resumed reporting consolidated GFS data on
the general government for publication in the 2015 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY)
which include general government operations and a full balance sheet. The general government data

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

are compiled with significant lags (the latest available data are for 2014), mainly due to the lack in
timely source data for the local governments. While high frequency data for central government
operations are disseminated under the SDDS, these data are not yet reported for inclusion in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Financial Sector Data: Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) compiled by the Bank of Korea (BOK)
broadly follow the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual. Both liabilities and assets in foreign
currencies are converted into Korean Won at the previous business day's trading volume weighted
average rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. The data are revalued monthly with the exception of
monetary gold, which is revalued on a semi-annual basis. The BOK reports monetary data for the
central bank and other depository corporations using the standardized report forms (SRFs) The BOK
does not report data for other financial corporations.
Korea regularly reported Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for dissemination on its
website. Quarterly FSI data and metadata are available to the public through the IMF’s website at:
http://fsi/FSIHome.aspx#Country. Despite repeated requests to reestablish regular reporting, the latest
available data are for 2014Q2.
External Sector Statistics: The BOK currently compiles the BOP and IIP statistics consistent with the
Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual, sixth Edition (BPM6) analytical
framework (see http://ecos.bok.or.kr/). The BOK adopted the BPM6 in March 2014.
The quality of the quarterly external debt statistics, including periodicity and timeliness, have been
improving since 2006. In early 2007, the BOK switched from annual to quarterly reporting of the
International Investment Position. Data dissemination on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity meets the SDDS specifications. Since April 2006, the authorities have disseminated foreign
reserves data on a monthly basis rather than twice a month, as had been done since 1997. However,
some BOP and IIP data lack consistency.
Korea reports balance of payments and IIP data for the IFS (quarterly data) and the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook (annual data) publications.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Korea has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September
1996, and it uses SDDS flexibility options for the
timeliness of general government operations,
central government operations, and analytical
accounts of the banking sector data. Korea is also
availing itself of a relevant flexibility option for the
coverage of exchange rates.

Statement by KwangHae Choi, Alternate Executive Director for the Republic of Korea,
Il Young Park, Senior Advisor to Executive Director,
and Hyunjoon Lim, Advisor to Executive Director
July 29, 2016
Our Korean authorities thank staff for their well-documented report, which properly reflects the
candid and productive policy dialogue under the 2016 Article IV consultation. Staff rightly points out
the fundamental challenges facing Korea, and explores future policy directions to move ahead with
concrete actions. We welcome that the Article IV discussions focus on structural issues to boost
growth in the short- and medium-term. We particularly support staff’s attention on Korea’s efforts to
strengthen the service sector and to develop the “creative economy,” given that the Korean authorities
consider them as a key strategy to raise its potential growth. The IMF team and the authorities
broadly agree with overall economic development, outlook, and policy priorities. That said, we are of
the view that some important issues could be further discussed with more detailed information, and
we would like to make the following comments.
Recent Developments and Outlook
We acknowledge that as indicated in the staff report, the economic growth has been lackluster and a
bit disappointing compared to the rapid growth era. Nevertheless, given growing external and
domestic risks including from China’s rebalancing and planned corporate restructuring, we are
encouraged by the recent economic performance which is deemed satisfactory.
As already noted in the staff report, Korean authorities announced the fiscal package on June 28. Our
intention is that the National Assembly will pass the related supplementary budget, preferably in
August this year and be executed as quickly as possible to maximize the expected effects of
supporting recovery. In addition, we will make every effort to speed up the corporate restructuring to
minimize its possible adverse effect on growth and employment.
We expect that the pace of recovery will likely accelerate more sharply than staff projection as the
effects of the recently announced fiscal stimulus and cut on the policy rate in June will be at play.
More recent economic indicators show that domestic demands including consumption appear to be
improving, and the declining trend of exports is decelerating. On the employment front, as the
number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio (aged between 15
and 64) continued to rise to a record high of 66.5 percent over the past 37 months and the
unemployment rate remained flat at as low as 3.6 percent in June this year. Inflation rates appear to be
stabilizing. Although headline inflation remained at around 1 percent, mainly driven by low
commodity prices, declines in agricultural product prices and weak demands, low inflation will not
remain at a level which raises concern about deflationary pressure as core inflation has been close to 2
percent and expected Inflation hovers around 2.4 percent. In the financial market, the benchmark
Korea Composite Stock Price (KOSPI) index recovered some ground to 2,012.22 points as of July 21
after a sharp plunge to 1,925.24 points by 3.1 percent on 24 June in the wake of the UK referendum to
exit the EU. The Korean won also was also restored to pre-Brexit level, KW 1140.2 as of July 22
after plummeting 2.8 percent to KW 1183.3 vis-à-vis US dollars. As such, the impact of the Brexit on
the financial market appears to be less pronounced than initially anticipated.

2
While acknowledging staff’s view that growth potential has declined since the early 1990s (according
to recent analyses by the authorities), the potential growth rates in recent periods are estimated to
stand at 3 to 3.2 percent, which are higher than the staff estimate. We note that the negative output
gap is likely to close faster than envisaged by staff as the supportive policy stances take effects and
external headwinds dissipate. Furthermore, we also believe that potential output will be lifted as
ongoing corporate restructuring and labor reforms improve efficiency in resource allocation.
We again emphasize our firm commitment to maintaining supportive policy stance until the economy
is evaluated to be on a solid growth path.
Fiscal Policy in the Short- and Long-term
We share staff’s view that Korea’s fiscal position remains healthy relative to other advanced countries
with sufficient current account balance and strong buffers. We also recognize the need for continued
support to promote consumption and investment at the current juncture. A supplementary budget plan
would also intend to preemptively address increasing vulnerabilities from a weaker economic activity.
Nevertheless, we should be mindful that the fiscal policy could be more effective in a balanced
approach between economic circumstances and fiscal conditions amid maintaining fiscal
sustainability in the medium- and long-term.
In this regard, we take positive note of staff’s view that fiscal support should cushion the adverse
impact of structural reforms and to incentivize such reforms, including well-targeted subsidies for
vulnerable groups, promoting labor force participation, and promoting R&D activities. In a similar
vein, a supplementary budget would focus on creating jobs and supporting on-going restructuring.
We note the importance of establishing fiscal rule as a long-term anchor. A rule-based fiscal
framework could help preserve fiscal sustainability, while ensuring appropriate spending. We
emphasize that this rule needs careful consideration of possible future challenges, such as
demographic changes, reunification, and other internal and external volatility, and it is critical to
improve its credibility and stability. Discussion on this issue is currently underway, and a detailed
proposal will be announced in the near future. We welcome the Fund’s close engagement and
valuable contributions.
Social Expenditure and Revenue Mobilization
Further, we agree with staff’s recommendation that a carefully targeted expansion of social spending
over the medium-term could produce multiple benefits, including promoting a more inclusive growth,
boosting labor productivity, and rebalancing external sector. We also agree that more attention should
be paid to address relative poverty among vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly, given its higher
level of relative poverty rates compared to OECD countries.
However, we are of the view that a cautious stance should be maintained to implement social
spending expansion and accompanying tax increase.
A priority should be given to establishing a national consensus to advance this initiative. While
revenue mobilization should be eventually considered to response increasing social spending, recent
political debate and public opinion shows some reservation for expanding social expenditure by tax
increase. According to survey with regards to revenue mobilization for social spending, a majority
(80.6 percent) gave their preference for strengthening the efforts to improve the efficiency of

3
expenditure by changing its composition and rationalization to bonds issuance (9.9 percent) or
taxation (9.5 percent). Furthermore, nearly two-thirds of all respondents (69.3 percent) responded that
they were reluctant to expand social spending if they needed to pay more tax to finance it.
Accordingly, we need to take enough time to address this issue, also noting staff’s view that
increasing revenue is not necessary in the near future.
While the current level of social spending is relatively low, it is expected to rapidly increase even
under the existing system without introducing new measures. Korea has built a comprehensive social
safety net, including 4 major social insurances, public assistance, and social welfare services, but its
coverage and level is not sufficient mainly due to its immaturity from a short history. However,
estimates by the Korean authorities indicate that social spending in Korea is projected to catch up
with other advanced countries given the rapid population aging and developed welfare system.
A unique cultural characteristic of Korea should be also considered in assessing their social safety
net. Korea has a long tradition of a large family system. Based on strong ethical grounds, the young
and the elderly live together with mutual dependence; the young provide financial support, and the
elderly help with childcare and housework. This tradition has been maintained until now to some
extent, though, admittedly, it has adjusted overtime. We note that Korea’s elderly dependency ratio is
significantly higher than other countries, and thus, private transfer between individuals and family
plays a key role in supporting welfare for elderly. Recent study on the income sources of the elderly
also support this phenomenon, indicating that private income transfer is largely higher than social
welfare services, including pension and other public benefits. Against this backdrop, a careful
analysis on Korea’s social safety net is needed to ensure clearer policy implications.
Macroprudential Policy
The authorities have attempted to establish the macroprudential frameworks to better safeguard the
financial and macroeconomic stability since the global financial crisis in 2008. The LTV and DTI
regulations which were introduced in 2002 and 2005, respectively as efforts to stabilize housing
prices and thus mitigate the risks from the household debt, have been strengthened since the GFC.
Indeed, the details of the regulations such as ceilings, target group, loan type, and applied regions,
have been flexibly adjusted and well geared to the market development. In addition, these regulations
have also been implemented in combination with a variety of microprudential measures including the
tax rates for real estate ownership, the administrative procedures, and the taxation on real estate
development profits.
Staff recommended that the DTI cap needs to be tightened toward 30 to 50 percent and extended to
apply to other types of household debt. The DTI cap is currently set to 60 percent, and LTV cap is 70
percent across the financial sectors. Indeed, we acknowledge that management of the DTI ratio such
as confirmation of borrower’s declared income has been relatively loose since the regulation on the
housing market and household debt has centered on the LTV ratio thus far.
In this context, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) introduced “the Guidelines on banks’
mortgage loan screening” on February, according to which lenders should require new borrowers to
prove their income and repayment ability, moving away from the existing practice that puts more
weight on collateral. We expect that these new guidelines can normalize a function of the DTI
restriction and alter market expectations and speculative incentives, thus helping contain growing
potential systemic risk at current juncture.

4
Beyond that, we plan to implement the measures to call for lenders to strengthen monitoring of the
debt-service ratio to check a borrower’s credit risk, as noted by staff. We note that this indicator can
provide more comprehensive information for gauging a borrower’s cash available after servicing his
or her total debt obligations including banking, car financing, credit card, and other financial
institutions than the DTI ratio.
We continue to closely monitor the effects of the newly introduced measures at the current juncture,
and will undertake additional measures as recommended by staff where necessary, going forward.
