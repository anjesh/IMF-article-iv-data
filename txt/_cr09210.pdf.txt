Context of past surveillance. In recent consultations, the Fund and the authorities have
agreed on the broad policy priorities—pursuing medium-term fiscal consolidation, further
strengthening the financial and corporate sectors, and stepping up productivity-enhancing
reforms. Before the onset of the global crisis, the Fund advocated that fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms proceed at a somewhat faster pace to strengthen growth prospects in
the context of population aging and promote an orderly adjustment of global imbalances.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: The global recession has derailed Japan’s export-led boom. Despite recent
signs of stabilization at home and abroad, the outlook remains uncertain. Fiscal and
monetary stimulus will provide a timely boost to the economy but a sustained recovery
will ultimately depend on an upturn overseas. The economy is expected to contract by
6 percent in 2009 and grow modestly by 1¾ percent next year, while inflation is
projected to remain negative through 2011. Over the medium term, potential growth
could fall given the challenges with reorienting production away from exports and
lower investment due to tighter corporate financing, highlighting the need for reforms to
rebalance growth to domestic sources.
Policy messages:
•

Fiscal policy has provided timely and needed stimulus to the economy and should
remain flexible to address further downside risks. At the same time, given the
sharp increase in public debt and aging population, priority should be given to
clarifying a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy to be implemented once the
recovery takes hold.

•

The monetary policy response has been well-calibrated, but additional credit
easing measures may be needed should downside risks materialize.

•

Financial policies should continue to strengthen the resilience of the financial
system, while promoting corporate restructuring would help lay the foundation for
a sustained recovery.

•

Efforts to rebalance growth toward domestic demand will be critical to supporting
living standards and fiscal sustainability.
I. INTRODUCTION

1.
The global crisis has highlighted Japan’s close integration with the rest of the
world. Japan’s dependence on manufacturing exports helped lift the economy during the
2003–07 global boom, but also left it highly exposed to the collapse in external demand and
financial spillovers last year. At the same time, domestic demand, which had contributed
significantly to the expansion, faltered in the face of slowing exports and tight financial
conditions. The result has been the most severe recession in decades. The authorities have
responded with forceful measures to stabilize financial markets and support activity, but
given Japan’s close links with the rest of the world, a sustained recovery will hinge on the
timing and strength of the global upturn.
2.
Against this backdrop, this year’s Article IV consultation reviewed the mix of
policies employed by the authorities to support near-term growth and preserve
financial stability, while discussing reforms to help rebalance growth toward domestic

4
sources in the medium term. The sizeable fiscal stimulus is judged to be appropriate given
the depth of the slump, but the large buildup in public debt from an already high base
requires that attention be paid to the medium-term strategy to secure fiscal sustainability. The
Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) policy rate has effectively hit the zero bound, while macroeconomic
benefits from extraordinary monetary measures need to be weighed against risks to the BoJ’s
balance sheet and from market distortions. Financial policies should continue to strengthen
the system’s resilience and improve the efficiency of intermediation, while broad-based
reforms to create new investment and job opportunities are required to rebalance Japan’s
growth to domestic demand. The sharp downturn and political uncertainties surrounding the
Lower House elections this summer have added to the challenges in implementing fiscal and
structural reforms.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Inflation. With lower global commodity prices, CPI inflation eased from its high of
2.3 percent in July 2008 to –0.1 percent y-o-y in April 2009. Core inflation, which on
staff’s definition excludes both fuel and food prices, also turned negative as the
output gap widened to about –8 percent—about twice as large as after the 1997
banking crisis. While available measures are imprecise, short-term inflation
expectations appear to have declined considerably.

•

Exchange rate. Despite a worsening trade balance, the yen has appreciated by about
25 percent in real effective terms since August 2008, supported by unwinding carry
trades as well as narrowing interest rate differentials against key currencies. The
exchange rate has remained volatile reflecting shifts in global risk appetite, with
investors typically buying the yen during periods of market instability.

•

Current account balance. Falling exports, the strong yen, and lower returns from
overseas investments have narrowed the current account surplus from a record
4.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to an annualized 1.4 percent of GDP in Q1 2009.

4.
Japan’s financial markets have stabilized from the after-shocks of the Lehman
Brothers collapse, but some stresses persist (Figure 2).
•

Stock markets. In line with global trends, the Japanese stock market has rebounded
since March on signs that the worst of the downturn is behind, but remains about
40 percent below the end-2007 levels.

•

Money markets. The 3-month yen LIBOR-OIS spread, an indicator of counterparty
risk, has come down to near pre-Lehman levels and remains below the equivalent
U.S. dollar and euro spreads. Although the BoJ’s yen and dollar liquidity operations
(Appendix I) have helped to stabilize short-term money markets, 6-month TIBOR and
the negative 5-year basis FX swap spread point to continued tightness in longer-term
funding.

•

Credit markets. Bank lending rates have declined following BoJ’s policy rate cuts,
although falling inflation has pushed up real rates. Corporate bond spreads have come
down for AA-rated companies but remain sharply higher for lower-rated firms.
Meanwhile, activity in the securitization market remains dormant.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Staff’s Assessment
5.
Despite recent signs of stabilization at home and abroad, the outlook remains
uncertain. Policy stimulus will provide a much-needed boost to the economy but a
sustained recovery will ultimately depend on an upturn overseas.
•

Baseline. Staff projects GDP to fall by a record 6 percent in 2009, before expanding
by 1¾ percent in 2010. Progress with inventory adjustment and ample fiscal stimulus

financial conditions and trade.
Given significant economic slack,
inflation is projected to remain negative until 2011. In the short term, the current
account surplus is expected to remain around 1¾ percent of GDP.

•

Risks. The risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside and stem from the
deteriorating labor market, tight domestic financial conditions, and external
uncertainties. On the upside, faster-than-expected growth in China could bolster
Japan’s manufacturing exports, although the benefits would likely be limited given the
low import content of China’s fiscal stimulus. Inflation risks are also tilted to the
downside owing to the downside growth risks and uncertainties about how inflation
expectations will respond to a protracted slowdown.

6.
Staff projections are characterized by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. Tailrisk scenarios involving another severe credit event similar to the collapse of Lehman
Brothers or loss of market confidence in the sustainability of public finances around the
world would severely deepen the current recession, although the likelihood of such events
appears low (Box 1). In an optimistic scenario, strong policy responses could boost
confidence and jump start a robust recovery by initiating a virtuous cycle of stronger growth,
lower risk aversion, and higher spending.

9

Box 1. Analysis of Tail-Risk Scenarios
Two downside tail-risk scenarios are explored using the new IMF’s Global Projection
Model (GPM).
• Severe credit event. Should global financial strains intensify again, the Japanese economy
would face another sharp drop in its durable goods exports as foreign corporations—
already producing well below capacity—would scale back investment, while overseas
consumers would be forced to further reduce their debt. Even with carry trades largely
unwound, repatriation of profits and investment by cash-strapped Japanese entities could
push up the value of the yen, further deepening the recession. Bank lending attitudes
would tighten globally owing to

• Loss of market confidence. Should markets lose confidence in the sustainability of public
debt in several major economies, government bond yields would increase sharply

_________
1/ Bank lending attitudes are assumed to tighten globally from current levels by about ½ of the cumulative
tightening since summer 2007.
2/ The scenario assumes an increase in inflation expectations by 2 percentage points and up to a 1 percentage point
increase in term premia in the United States and Japan.

10

The Authorities’ Views
7.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks.

•

Near-term outlook for growth and inflation. In the April Outlook report, the BoJ
Policy Board projected GDP to contract by 3.1 percent in FY2009 and grow by
1.2 percent in FY2010, which is broadly consistent with staff’s projections on a fiscal
year basis.1 The Policy Board forecasted core inflation (excl. fresh food) to remain
negative in both years, with the FY2010 central projection at –1 percent.

•

Risks. The BoJ agreed that risks to growth were tilted to the downside, arising
primarily from a possible adverse feedback loop between financial and economic
activity globally as well as in Japan. A structural downgrade of medium-term growth
expectations by Japanese corporations could also undermine domestic investment and
employment. The BoJ considered the inflation outlook as highly uncertain reflecting
ambiguities about the growth outlook, the behavior of inflation expectations, and the
likely path for commodity prices.
IV. POLICIES TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND PRESERVE FINANCIAL STABILITY

The authorities have provided a significant boost to the economy and support to financial
markets through fiscal, monetary, and financial policies. Along with cutting the policy rate to
close to zero, the BoJ has taken a range of measures to stabilize financial markets and
facilitate corporate financing, including through asset purchases. Given the severity of the
recession and limits on monetary policy from the zero bound, fiscal policy has been required
to provide sizeable stimulus, although with the rapid increase in public debt, a plan to secure
medium-term debt sustainability is needed. Monetary and fiscal policy action has been
supplemented by financial measures to safeguard the banking system and maintain the flow
of credit, especially to distressed SMEs.
A. Fiscal Policy Priorities
Background
8.
After several years of improvement, the fiscal balance has sharply deteriorated,
reflecting the weak economy as well as discretionary measures (Figure 3).

Authorities’ medium-term consolidation plan. Given the surge in the deficit, the
government’s prior commitment of achieving primary balance (excluding the social
security fund) by FY2011 is now out of reach. In December 2008, the authorities
outlined a medium-term commitment for revenue and social security reform, which
calls—conditional on economic recovery—for new revenue legislation by FY2011,
including an increase in the consumption tax.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
9.
Fiscal policy has provided a timely and needed boost to the economy and should
remain flexible to address further downside risks.
•

Near-term fiscal stance. Current stimulus appears to provide adequate support to
growth under the baseline. If the recession persists longer than expected, additional
stimulus could be provided in FY2010, with a continued emphasis on measures that
are targeted and reversible, such as accelerated depreciation of capital expenditure in
sectors with high growth potential or tax changes that bring forward consumption.

•

Impact on public debt. On current trends, net public debt could rise to about
140 percent of GDP (240 percent in gross terms) by 2014. The government’s
contingent liabilities are also rising with the rapid expansion of SME lending
guarantees (budgeted at ¥30 trillion) and other financial support.

10.
At the same time, given the increase in public debt and fiscal pressures from an
aging society, priority should be given to clarifying the medium-term consolidation
strategy.
•

3

Design of medium-term strategy. In outlining such a strategy, a sensible option would
be to shift away from the current practice of targeting the primary balance to a cap on
the public debt ratio over the medium term in order to put the debt ratio firmly on a
downward path and strengthen public awareness of the need for fiscal consolidation.3
Whatever the target chosen to lower the debt ratio over time, the consolidation plan
will likely require expenditure measures (e.g., through further savings in public

For instance, staff analysis suggests that capping net debt at 130 percent of GDP (230 percent of GDP in gross
terms) would require an adjustment in the primary balance of around 1.5 percent of GDP annually during
2011–15. After 2015, further measures would be needed to place the debt ratio on a downward path. See
Appendix II for an analysis of the medium-term debt position.

14
administration, investment, and health care costs) and comprehensive tax reforms,
including a commitment to raise the consumption tax after the recovery takes hold.
•

Pension reforms. Priorities include addressing generational inequalities and securing
stable revenues for the central government’s increased contributions to the national
pension plan, particularly as uncertainties about the system’s benefits may be
weighing on consumption. This year’s actuarial update provides an opportunity to
reassess the system’s financial position in light of changes in the outlook, and
consider if any parametric changes (such as increasing the retirement age) are needed.

•

Public debt management. To help finance the stimulus measures, gross JGB issuances
are expected to rise to as high as 30 percent of GDP in FY2009. Short-term financing
risks appear contained given the limited foreign ownership of JGBs and large pool of
domestic savings. Nevertheless, the capacity of the market to absorb JGBs will likely
diminish over time as population aging reduces savings inflows and reforms improve
financial intermediation, underscoring the need for fiscal consolidation (Box 2).

The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
11.
The authorities expected a significant lift from the stimulus and reaffirmed their
commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation.
•

Fiscal stimulus. The authorities attached high importance to supporting employment4
and stressed that benefits from the stimulus measures should extend at least through
FY2010 given the schedule for implementation. The authorities shared the view that
the near-term fiscal stance should remain flexible in the face of downside risks.

•

Medium-term fiscal sustainability and public pensions. The authorities stressed that
their commitment to pursue medium-term fiscal consolidation was critical for
maintaining market confidence. They agreed that greater emphasis on the debt ratio
could help raise public support for fiscal consolidation and supplement a primary
balance target to guide annual budget planning, and despite the current political
climate, plan to unveil additional details of the new fiscal targets in the June Basic
Policies. As for the public pension system, the authorities did not see an immediate
need for parametric changes, although they acknowledged that the objective of raising
the compliance rate for contributions from about 60 to 80 percent in the medium term
may prove challenging.

•

Public debt management. The authorities considered their close communication with
the market to have helped facilitate larger issuances of JGBs and stabilize yields.

4

The authorities project that employment measures could help maintain about 1.3 million jobs a year, or about
2 percent of the labor force.

15

Box 2. Market Challenges to Financing Japan’s Fiscal Stimulus1/
Despite the significant widening of the deficit, the JGB market appears so far to have had little
difficulty in absorbing the new debt. JGB
yields have remained below 2 percent over the
10-year JGB Yield and Net Public Debt

past 10 years, during a period when net public
10-year JGB Yield/LS
debt increased by 40 percent of GDP,
suggesting that JGB yields thus far have not
been sensitive to changes in the fiscal position.
This may be due to some factors specific to
Japan, such as (until recently) high household
saving rates, stable institutional investors, and
strong home bias. In addition, the large
financial surpluses of the corporate sector
since the early 2000s may have played a role in

Going forward, these favorable market
conditions are likely to diminish. Japan is
undergoing rapid population aging, which has
lowered the household savings rate and may
over time limit the JGB market’s absorptive
capacity for new debt. Financial reforms that
have given institutional investors more
flexibility could also hinder the market
capacity. For example, the Japan Post Bank
(previously the postal savings) and the national
pension funds are now looking to expand their
investments in risky assets, and are no longer
required to accept JGBs from the Fiscal
Investment and Loan Program (FILP).

To maintain smooth financing of public
debt, fundamental fiscal reform at an early
stage is critical. Staff’s simulation suggests
that without policy adjustment, gross public
debt would rise sharply and exceed the level of
household financial assets within eleven years.
At this point or even before, other sources of
funding could become more important,
including from overseas.

While recognizing the decline in demand for JGBs with population aging, they saw
little short-term financing risk given the still large pool of domestic savings, and were
hopeful that the investor base could be diversified, including among foreign investors.
B. Supporting Growth with Monetary Policy
Background
12.
The BoJ has adopted a three-pronged strategy to support the economy involving
policy rate cuts, measures to ensure the stability of financial markets, and steps to
facilitate corporate financing (Figure 4).
•

Interest rate policy. In late 2008, the BoJ reduced its policy rate in two steps from
50 to 10 basis points—effectively hitting the zero bound—amid rapidly increasing
economic slack and emerging downward pressures on prices.

•

Additional easing measures. The BoJ has maintained stability in financial markets
and improved access to corporate financing through a number of measures, including
significant liquidity injections, considerable broadening of the range of eligible
collateral, special funds-supplying operations to facilitate corporate financing,
U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and higher volume of JGB purchases. In
addition, the BoJ has purchased outright high-rated commercial paper and corporate
bonds (see Appendix I for more details).

•

Buttressing the financial system. As a back-stop to the financial system, the BoJ has
resumed its purchases of banks’ stockholdings, although purchases thus far have been
limited. The BoJ has also offered to provide subordinated loans to banks to support
their capital base.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
14.
The BoJ’s policy response to the crisis has been well-calibrated. Should
downside risks materialize, further steps may be needed.
•

Near-term stance. In light of the significant widening of the output gap and
downward pressures on prices, monetary policy appropriately remains
accommodative.5 With the credit channel still functional and fiscal policy
expansionary, the current accommodative stance can be expected to provide
meaningful support to growth during the downturn.

•

Addressing financial strains. Should the outlook deteriorate and financial stresses reemerge, the BoJ could expand its easing operations. In such circumstances, the BoJ
could consider relaxing the eligibility criteria for commercial paper and corporate
bond purchases or extending the maturity of its operations for corporate financing and
its FX swap facility to help reduce the cost of longer-term funding. The BoJ could
also increase its JGB purchases to facilitate money market operations.

15.
Further enhancements to the BoJ’s communication strategy might be useful.
Adopting the three-pronged strategy has been helpful in explaining the BoJ's policy
intentions across a broad range of areas. Communication has also been enhanced by the
publication of two-year forecasts for growth and inflation and more comprehensive
discussion of risk factors. However, a gap has emerged between the BoJ Policy Board’s twoyear inflation forecast and its medium-term understanding of price stability.6 In the current
deflationary environment, clarifying the time horizon over which inflation is expected to
return to a range consistent with this understanding could help anchor medium-term inflation
expectations in positive territory. Although the case may be less compelling than during the
period of quantitative easing, a commitment to maintaining low interest rates until prices
recover might also help cap longer-term rates in the period ahead.
16.
The BoJ should continue to minimize risks to its balance sheet, while mapping
out an exit strategy for unwinding its policies. The balance sheet risks so far appear
manageable given the short duration and high quality of its asset purchases. However, should
downside risks materialize, the BoJ will need to weigh carefully the macroeconomic benefits
from additional easing measures against the risks of impairing the BoJ balance sheet and

5

A simple Taylor rule with a weight of 0.5 on the output gap and 1.5 on the deviation of projected inflation
from the median of BoJ Policy Board’s understanding of price stability (headline inflation of 0–2 percent)
implies an optimal policy rate of about –5 percent compared with the current rate of 0.1 percent.

6

In the BoJ’s April Outlook report, the FY2010 forecast of the majority of the BoJ Policy Board members for
core inflation (excl. fresh food) was between –0.8 and –1.1 percent, well below the Policy Board members’
understanding of price stability.

19
distorting market functions. In this case, as is well recognized by the BoJ, a clear delineation
of the role of fiscal and monetary policies would help protect against such risks.
The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
17.
BoJ officials stressed the importance of clearly identifying the goals of monetary
policy in the current environment.7
•

Monetary policy stance. The BoJ reiterated that it is paying attention to the downside
risks to activity and prices as it aims to return Japan’s economy to a sustainable
growth path with price stability. However, since Japan’s expansion earlier this decade
was partly based on an unsustainable build-up of various excesses overseas, a
protracted adjustment is inevitable. Rather than attempting to fully offset the
downturn, monetary policy should aim to smooth the adjustment and prevent a
freefall of the economy.

•

Risks and benefits of additional easing measures. Although financial conditions were
assessed by the BoJ as “severe” in its recent Outlook report, policy measures
including CP and corporate bond purchases have helped boost confidence by
providing a back-stop for banks to sell their holdings. If financial conditions
deteriorate again, the BoJ agreed that additional policy measures could be considered.
However, the authorities pointed out the risks of prolonged market interventions in
slowing down the pace of restructuring and hindering market activity. They also
made clear that increased purchases of JGBs were not intended to finance the deficit
or target long-term yields.

18.
Effective communication entails a careful explanation of the process through
which the economy can return to a sustainable growth path with price stability. The BoJ
noted that with considerable uncertainty about the outlook, longer-term definitive forecasts
that attempted to reconcile current projections of deflation with the 0–2 percent
understanding of price stability would not be reliable and could deviate significantly from
actual outcomes, reducing public confidence in the central bank’s assessment of economic
trends. Furthermore, committing to low interest rates by relying only on developments in
inflation (or inflation forecasts) may not be suitable given the need to monitor multiple
aspects of the economy, including asset prices and conditions in the financial system.
19.
The BoJ intends to exit from its easing policies in an orderly manner when
economic and financial conditions permit. The BoJ saw its credit easing as effective but

7

The BoJ’s Policy Board bases its monetary policy decisions on the short-term outlook for economic activity
and prices, as well as an assessment of longer-term risks from financial imbalances, including asset bubbles. In
this respect, the BoJ’s monetary policy framework already implements some of the recent proposals on how
central banks should respond to emerging imbalances.

20
was concerned about creating market distortions.8 The BoJ has sufficient instruments (such
as the ability to issue its own bills and pay interest on reserves) to facilitate an orderly exit.
Moreover, many of its existing operations will unwind automatically either due to a pre-set
expiration date or a built-in loss of attractiveness once market conditions normalize.
However, the decision on the timing of exit could be complicated by uncertainties about the
outlook.

For regional banks (which do not have much preferred equity), Tier 1 ratios have also
remained broadly steady at around 8 percent.
For example, the BoJ’s operations have helped push down a-1+ CP yields below the comparable T-bill rate.

In November 2008, the FSA revised the criteria for nonperforming loans to exclude certain restructured loans
to SMEs with a credible plan to rehabilitate their business within 10 years.

Policy support. The authorities have adopted measures to bolster capital and promote
lending, including setting aside ¥12 trillion for public capital injections and up to
¥21 trillion for purchases of bank stockholdings (including the BoJ scheme).
However, only a handful of regional banks have so far applied for public capital
despite the generous terms and limited conditionality.

As part of the stimulus plan, special credit guarantees of nearly ¥10 trillion have been extended to cover
around 490,000 SMEs since October 2008, in some cases replacing existing guarantees. These special
guarantees provide 100 percent coverage (up from 80 percent compared to standard guarantees) and for some
loans, extend for as long as 10 years.

23

Box 3. Challenges from the Current Crisis Facing SMEs
SMEs are an important part of the Japanese economy.1 SMEs account for over 50 percent
manufacturing shipment and 25 percent of exports and investment. They span many industries (e.g.,
90 percent are in services) and historically have served as key suppliers to large manufacturing firms.
SMEs account for nearly 70 percent of employment and in recent years have been a major source of
jobs for the economy.
SMEs were hit hard by the global slowdown
whose shock rippled down the entire supply
chain. Large manufacturers responded to the
shock by slashing production and cutting costs,
including from their SME suppliers. Shrinking
cashflow and tighter financial conditions have
put a strain on SMEs, forcing many to either
consolidate or exit. Bankruptcies have steadily
increased, particularly among small
manufacturing firms.
Structural weaknesses have also left SMEs
vulnerable to the crisis. Prior to the crisis,
SMEs suffered from significantly higher
leverage and lower profitability than larger firms
who benefited from the aggressive deleveraging
after the banking crisis. Debt-equity ratios for
SMEs remain nearly three times as high and
profitability, as measured by the interest
coverage ratios (ICR), four times lower
compared to large firms. Although SMEs appear
more liquid, this to some extent reflects their
limited access to market financing, leading them
to rely more on retained earnings for their
working capital.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
22.
In the current environment, financial policies should continue to strengthen the
resilience of the system. Government and BoJ measures have been effective in stabilizing
the financial system and facilitating corporate financing, but risks of a corrosive feedback
loop between financial strains and weakening activity remain. To address such risks, policies
should focus on:
•

Strengthening bank capital and profitability. To enhance the level and quality of
capital in the system, public funds could be targeted to help restructure and/or merge
weak banks and facilitate the raising of private capital.11 Such consolidation would
also help address the long-standing structural problem of low profitability and excess
capacity, particularly for some regional and smaller banks.

•

Reducing risks from bank equity holdings. Further reductions in stockholdings are
taking place gradually under the Basel-II approach of applying higher capital charges
on bank equity holdings from 2014. In the current environment, public purchases of
equities from banks have proved challenging given some banks’ unrealized losses. A
possible alternative would be to provide some ring-fencing or partial insurance to
protect bank balance sheets from declining equity prices in exchange for the banks
committing to reduce their holdings when prices recover.

•

Resolving systemically important nonbanks. The current global crisis has highlighted
the need in Japan, as elsewhere, for establishing resolution frameworks for addressing
liquidity and solvency problems of systemically important nonbanks such as life
insurance companies.

•

Restarting the market for securitization. Reflecting difficulties in the real estate and
consumer finance markets, issuances of securitized products fell by 45 percent in
FY2008. Steps to jumpstart securitization, such as by providing partial government
guarantees on asset-backed securities, could help SMEs, REITs, and nonbanks regain
access to this market.

23.
Measures to promote corporate restructuring could help the economy adjust to
the severe downturn. A public asset management company, similar to the Industrial
Revitalization Corporation of Japan (IRCJ), could be restarted to assist banks in working out
viable but distressed firms by providing new financing and helping resolve creditor disputes.
11

The BoJ conducts comprehensive and rigorous macro stress tests in its semi-annual Financial System Report.
The stress tests outlined in its March 2009 report suggest that some banks could face capital shortfalls if the
growth outlook deteriorates and the stock market declines again. Specifically, Tier 1 capital ratios in FY2009
for the bottom 10 percent of banks would fall below the level in the late 1990s and early 2000s under a scenario
with GDP growth of –4 percent in FY2009 and the TOPIX falling to the same level as its bottom after the
collapse of the bubble economy.

25
Guidelines for out-of-court workouts were introduced in 2001 to facilitate large-scale
restructuring and could be adapted to also assist small and medium-sized cases. For court-led
restructuring, streamlining procedures for smaller firms or expanding the availability of
financing could help encourage distressed firms make better use of the Civil Rehabilitation
Law.12
24.
As the crisis eases, exceptional interventions in the financial and corporate
sectors will need to be smoothly unwound. Public financial support to corporations and
regulatory forbearance, if sustained for too long, could hinder market discipline and needed
balance sheet adjustments. In addition, the sizeable increase in SME credit guarantees raises
the risk of large fiscal costs while slowing the pace of restructuring.13
25.
To address these risks, a transparent exit strategy is needed, to be implemented
as soon as conditions normalize, with the broad aim of protecting government solvency,
while preserving financial stability and promoting restructuring. For instance, reverting
to partial coverage or a more risk-based scheme on SME lending might encourage banks to
take actions against distressed borrowers, and could be a part of an exit strategy for allowing
markets to drive the restructuring process. Companies that default under the guarantee
scheme could be promptly sold to the Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC) or to the
private sector for restructuring. Corporations that receive public capital injections should
continue to operate on a commercial basis with clear criteria for exit to avoid propping up
nonviable firms.14
The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
26.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of policy priorities, but saw
less need for pre-emptive actions.
•

Strengthening bank capital and profitability. Based on their stress tests of the banking
system, the supervisors considered the overall level of bank capital to be sufficient.
Thus their broad policy intention was to ensure credit availability, rather than to
promote restructuring or consolidation, which should be guided by individual banks’

12

The law effective since 2000 allows existing management to operate the firm under a court-approved
rehabilitation plan.
13

Japan's experience with credit guarantees after its banking crisis highlights the risks associated with their
rapid expansion on generous terms. A similar program in 1998 extended nearly ¥29 trillion in credit guarantees
with 100 percent coverage, resulting in net losses to the government of around ¥2 trillion. The program expired
in 2001 and reverted back to a partial coverage scheme.
14

See Caballero, R., Hoshi, T., and Kashyap, A., 2008, “Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in
Japan”, American Economic Review, Vol. 98 (December) for an analysis of how the persistence of so-called
"zombie" firms in the late 1990s depressed job creation and investment for healthy firms.

26
commercial interests. They pointed out that their existing capital injection schemes
were working and expected additional smaller banks to apply. The authorities
believed that applying tangible common equity measures to Japan was not
appropriate at this moment given the banking system’s more stable sources of
funding, long investment horizon of preferred shareholders, and lower exposure to
“toxic assets”. Moreover, a shift away from Tier 1 to common equity measures could
lead to uncertainty over regulatory capital and contribute to pro-cyclical behavior by
banks.
•

Reducing risks from bank equity holdings. While the regulatory forbearance on
unrealized equity losses at regional banks could be considered as a form of ringfencing,15 the authorities were skeptical about applying such a strategy more
explicitly, citing concerns about potential moral hazard and risks to taxpayers.
Nevertheless, they continue to encourage banks to enhance their risk management
processes, while offering to purchase stocks from banks at market prices.

•

Resolving systemically important nonbanks. Given their generally sound financial
position, the authorities saw little urgent need at this stage to establish a special
framework for resolving large systemic nonbanking institutions but would continue
participating in global discussions on this issue.

•

Restarting securitization. The authorities recognized the importance of reviving
securitization and have taken steps to enhance the transparency and reliability of the
market, including by encouraging securities dealers to ensure traceability of
securitized products and by regulating credit rating agencies.

27.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the corporate
sector, but did not see substantial risks from the SME lending program. The authorities
viewed credit guarantees as crucial for supporting SME employment, which accounts for
almost 70 percent of the labor force. To promote restructuring, the authorities noted that a
new law is currently being discussed by the Diet to establish a public asset management
company, similar to the ICRJ, that would provide financial support for restructuring, with a
focus on medium-sized firms.

15

Following a temporary change in capital adequacy requirements in November 2008, regional banks subject to
domestic standards are no longer required to deduct unrealized losses on securities from Tier 1 capital.

27
V. EXCHANGE RATE AND EXTERNAL STABILITY
Policy Issues and Staff Views
28.
According to staff analysis, the current value of the yen is consistent with
medium-term fundamentals.
•

Exchange rate assessment. In terms of the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange
Rates (CGER)’s three analytical methods, the yen’s effective exchange rate was
estimated close to its medium-term equilibrium value as of March 2009. The real
effective exchange rate is also currently close to its long- term average since 1990.

•

Exchange rate framework. Despite rapid appreciation of the yen (Figure 6), the
authorities have not intervened in foreign exchange markets. The staff continues to
support the official policy that the exchange rate should be market determined, with
intervention only justified to counter disruptive exchange rate movements.

29.
With the significant unwinding of yen carry trade positions, risks to external
stability from financial spillovers have declined. Vulnerabilities from cross-border
exposures—both to and from Japan—do not appear significant and have fallen over time
(Box 4). Looking ahead, however, a rebound in global risks appetite could reignite carry
trades, including among retail investors, and bring these linkages back into play more
forcefully. With the stronger yen, FDI outflows from Japan have picked up, especially to the
United States and emerging Asia (notably India, Korea, and Vietnam). In the short term, the
tax exemption on dividends paid by overseas subsidiaries, which took effect in April, could
support financial inflows.
30.
Over the medium term, Japan’s current account surplus will likely remain close
to its equilibrium level. The medium-term current account balance is projected at around
1½ percent of GDP—close to the estimated equilibrium level (about 1¾ percent), but well
below the levels typical earlier this decade (3½ percent during 2002–07) owing to lower
export demand, reduced asset returns, and population aging. The narrowing current account
surplus will help facilitate global rebalancing, although the severe impact of the downturn on
Japan, together with the possibility of sustained lower external demand, point to the need for
accelerated reforms to rebalance growth toward domestic demand.

since 2003.
However, overseas exposures have fallen since the second half of 2008, reflecting factors such as
unwinding yen carry trades and a retrenchment of Japanese institutions’ external funding
commitments. Various proxies for overseas yen funding—including bank lending to foreign
institutions, foreign bank borrowing in Japanese money markets, foreign exchange margin trading
and short-yen positions of non-commercial traders—suggest that carry trade positions have been
unwinding in the face of the global crisis.
Network analysis suggests that risks to Japan’s external stability arising from cross-border
banking spillovers—both to and from Japan—appear low and have generally fallen over the
past year.1 Analysis considers an extreme scenario with a country defaulting on all its cross-border
liabilities, in turn triggering a global liquidity squeeze. Tracking the full range of domino effects
from one economy to another following this shock, Japan emerges as one of the most resilient
systems in the group of 16 BIS reporting economies:
• Spillovers to Japan. No country default would lead to a depletion of the Japanese banking
sector’s capital, although the U.K. and the U.S. defaults would inflict significant capital
impairment. Interestingly, the

The Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities noted the difficulties in identifying the factors behind the recent
movements in the exchange rate. They reaffirmed their commitment to a market
determined exchange rate and saw no case for intervention in the foreign exchange market as
long as conditions remained orderly, consistent with the G-7 policy stance. The authorities
again voiced skepticism about current account-based estimates of “equilibrium” exchange
rates which in their view do not adequately account for structural capital flows (such as
declining home bias), a serious omission in the case of Japan.
VI. POLICIES TO REBALANCE GROWTH IN THE MEDIUM TERM
Since overseas deleveraging is likely to constrain external demand for a prolonged period,
measures to rebalance growth toward domestic demand will be critical to supporting living
standards and securing fiscal sustainability.
Background
32.
The IMF’s Multilateral Consultation during 2006–07 identified reform priorities
for Japan in the areas of product and labor market liberalization, inward FDI, and
financial market development to help boost domestic demand. Reform progress has been
slow due to a lack of political consensus and the steep decline in economic activity.
•

Liberalizing product markets. The government signed economic partnership
agreements (EPAs) with Vietnam and Switzerland, and made some limited progress
in opening up protected markets such as nursing.

•

Labor reforms. Several steps were taken to protect vulnerable workers during the
recession, in particular, by relaxing the eligibility criteria for employment insurance.
Minimum overtime pay will also be raised from April 2010 and a compensatory leave
option in lieu of higher overtime payments will be introduced at firms upon
agreement with their employees.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
33.
The prospects of a protracted period of weaker external demand lend greater
immediacy to the long-standing need to rebalance growth. On current policies, potential
growth could fall from about 1¾ percent in 2007 to close to 1 percent over the medium term,
as investment rates decline with tighter corporate financing and structural rigidities slow the
necessary reallocation of labor and capital to more productive uses.
34.
Given the need to absorb excess labor and reallocate capital, the short-term
emphasis should be on reforms which create new investment and job opportunities.

31
Further deregulation of the agricultural and services sectors—including medical, child, and
elderly care—could create new drivers for growth and job creation.16 Further reforms in the
areas of inward FDI and financial market development, and steps to facilitate SME
restructuring could also support rebalancing. In light of the sharp increase in unemployment,
difficult labor market reforms could be put on hold for now, but pressures to reduce market
flexibility should be resisted.
The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
35.
Beyond the immediate challenge of filling in for falling external demand, the
authorities recognized the need for Japan to become less dependent on export-led
growth and to maintain competitiveness, including through reforms to secure fiscal
sustainability.
•

Social safety net. Recent measures have focused on improving social protection of
nonregular workers, providing partial coverage of corporate payroll expenses, and
expanding retraining programs. The government will announce in its June Basic
Policies further steps to provide better safety net and vocational programs without
reducing labor market flexibility.

•

Medium-term priorities. The authorities agreed that medium-term rebalancing would
require structural reforms to boost household incomes. In particular, wage growth had
been sluggish even before the onset of financial turmoil amid pressures from
globalization, technological changes, and labor market dualities.17 The authorities also
saw pent-up demand for social services such as child care or long-term elderly care,
such that removing supply side constraints could boost potential output. Promoting
green, low-carbon technology (including through the current stimulus package) would
also help increase domestic value added, while potentially creating new export
industries.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL

36.
Japan faces a difficult set of immediate and longer-term challenges. While Japan
was not at the center of the global financial crisis, the collapse in external demand and
financial spillovers have plunged the economy into a severe recession and exposed its
continued dependence on export-led growth. The authorities are taking appropriate steps to
support the economy, but despite such actions, the outlook remains uncertain and a sustained
recovery depends crucially on the strength of the global upturn.
16

The priorities for deregulation in services were discussed in detail in Chapter V of IMF Country Report
No. 07/281.
17

For a detailed analysis of factors underpinning weak wage growth in Japan, see Sommer, M.: “Why Are
Japanese Wages So Sluggish?” IMF Working Paper 09/97.

32
37.
In the near-term, policies should continue to support growth, while preserving
financial stability.
•

The BoJ’s policy response—including policy rate cuts, measures to ensure the
stability of financial markets, and steps to facilitate corporate financing—has been
timely and effective. In staff’s view, monetary policy needs to remain accommodative
in the period ahead, with the BoJ standing ready to provide further credit easing in the
event the outlook deteriorates or financial stresses reappear.

•

Fiscal policy should also remain flexible to address further downside risks. The
stimulus packages in 2008 and 2009 have provided valuable support to the economy.
Further measures may be necessary should the downturn prove more protracted, with
continued emphasis on measures that are targeted and temporary.

•

Financial policies should continue to focus on strengthening the resilience of the
system to a protracted slowdown. Priorities going forward should be to strengthen
bank profitability and capital, reduce risks from bank equity holdings, and promote
the restructuring of distressed but viable firms.

38.
The extraordinary nature of current policies calls for an orderly exit when the
economy recovers. In light of the rapid rise in public debt and fiscal pressures from the
aging society, it will be important to outline a clear fiscal consolidation strategy to take effect
once the crisis abates. In addition to new targets that aim to put the debt ratio firmly on a
downward path, securing medium-term fiscal sustainability will likely require expenditure
measures and comprehensive tax reforms, including a commitment to raise the consumption
tax after the recovery takes hold. The BoJ has sufficient instruments to facilitate an orderly
exit from its monetary and credit easing policies, with many of its market operations set to
unwind automatically when conditions normalize. The exit from financial sector
interventions should be guided by the need to preserve financial stability, protect government
solvency, and promote needed restructuring. Again, the challenge will be to determine the
proper timing and conditions for withdrawing such support.
39.
Structural reforms are needed to help rebalance growth over the medium term.
In this context, efforts to deregulate the agricultural and services sectors—including medical,
child, and elderly care—could create new drivers for growth and job creation. Further
reforms to encourage inward FDI, financial market development, and product market
flexibility could also support rebalancing and help Japan adjust to changes in the global
economy.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. JAPAN: RECENT FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE SECTOR SUPPORT MEASURES
As part of its three-pronged strategy to address financial strains,1 the BoJ reduced its
policy rate from 0.5 to 0.1 percent and took measures to:
•

Ensure the stability of financial markets. The BoJ broadened the range of eligible
collateral adding REIT-issued debt, loans on deeds to municipal governments and some
FX-denominated foreign government bonds. As for JGB repo operations, linkers,
floaters, and ultra-long JGBs were added as eligible collateral. The BoJ also introduced
unlimited U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations at a fixed rate via a swap line with the
Fed, increased purchases of the JGBs (from ¥14.4 trillion to ¥21.6 trillion per year),
started remunerating bank reserves, and made significant liquidity injections at the turn
of calendar and fiscal years.

•

Facilitate corporate financing. The BoJ introduced short-term unlimited fund supplying
operations against corporate debt collateral, while increasing the frequency, size and
range of eligible instruments for its CP repo and corporate debt operations (minimum
eligible collateral rating for corporate bonds and loans was broadened from A to BBB).
It has also adopted more direct “credit easing” measures by buying eligible commercial
paper (grade a-1 or better; up to ¥3 trillion) and corporate bonds (rated A or above, with
residual maturity of less than 1 year; up to ¥1 trillion) directly from banks.

To buttress financial system stability, the BoJ has separately offered to provide ¥1 trillion in
subordinated loans to banks and re-started purchases of bank-owned stocks of up to
¥1 trillion.
Other public institutions have also taken steps in these areas:
•

Financial stability. The government has set aside ¥12 trillion to recapitalize weak banks
and will offer to purchase banks’ stockholdings worth up to ¥20 trillion. Accounting
rules on unrealized losses on securities holdings have been relaxed for domestic banks to
help boost their reported capital ratios.

•

Facilitating corporate financing. The government has supported SME financing through
¥30 trillion in budgeted new guarantees and around ¥15 trillion in loan support. To
prevent large-scale layoffs and bankruptcies, additional funds have been made available
to the DBJ: ¥10 trillion for loans, ¥2 trillion in public capital for injection into
nonfinancial corporations, and ¥2 trillion for CP purchases. At the same time, moral
suasion is being applied by the FSA for banks not to cut back on lending to healthy
corporations. Separately, The MoF will lend ¥500 billion in foreign exchange reserves to
JBIC to help Japanese companies meet their overseas funding needs.

APPENDIX II. JAPAN: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Background
In 2002, Japan set a target of achieving primary balance of the general government
(excluding the social security fund) by the early 2010s. Subsequently, in Basic
Policies 2006, the authorities announced a FY2011 target for achieving primary balance, and
formulated a plan to cut expenditures by Y110

Debt Sustainability Analysis
Against this background, the staff has updated its assessment of Japan’s medium-term
public debt sustainability. The baseline scenario assumes the authorities’ current policies
with no increase in the consumption tax. Under the staff’s policy adjustment scenario, the
consumption tax would be increased by 5 percentage points starting in 2011 (3 percentage
2

Basic Policy 2006 also committed to reduce the debt/GDP ratio through the 2010s, but did not specify a target
level.
3

Specifically, the cabinet decision in December 2008 reads: “The government will take the necessary
legislative action by FY2011 in order to promptly implement the fundamental reform of the tax system
including that of the consumption tax on the condition that an upturn in the Japanese economy is achieved
through intensive efforts toward economic recovery within next three years starting from FY2008”.

points in 2011 and 2 percentage points in 2014), while the authorities would make additional
expenditure cuts of about 1.0 percent of GDP relative to the baseline between 2014–15.4
After 2015, a further adjustment
Medium-term Macroeconomic Assumptions
(1.5 percent of GDP) is assumed in this

2.9
scenario. Both scenarios are based on the
Real GDP growth
1.2
Inflation rate
1.0
staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, and
focus on net debt of the general
government including the social security fund.
The analysis suggests that without policy adjustment net public debt is likely to
continue rising over the medium-term. Under the baseline scenario, the debt/GDP ratio
exceeds 150 percent in 2018, while under the policy adjustment scenario, the debt/GDP ratio
would peak at around 130 percent in 2015 and then decline. The analysis also implies that
under a plausible assumption where interest rates exceed the growth rate, primary balance
would not be sufficient to stabilize the net debt/GDP ratio.5
The debt dynamics are sensitive to macroeconomic assumptions and underscore the
benefits of policy adjustment. For example, with a 1 percentage point decline in GDP
growth or a 100 basis point increase in interest rate from 2012 onwards, net debt is projected
to reach 200 percent of GDP by 2025 in the baseline scenario, while under the policy
adjustment scenario, net debt would stabilize.

These measures together with unwinding of the stimulus would lead to an adjustment in the primary balance
by 1.5 percent of GDP annually during 2011–15.

5

On the other hand, the adjustment scenario targets the debt/GDP ratio of 130 percent in 2015 and achieves
overall balance around 2020.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held during May 13–22, 2008; the
Executive Board discussed the Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 08/253) and concluded
the consultation on July 21, 2008. The concluding statement, staff report, staff supplement,
selected issues paper, and PIN were all published.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representatives on Japan
July 6, 2009
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on June 17, 2009. This information does not alter the
staff’s broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the staff report.
2.
Recent data suggest that economic activity rebounded in the second quarter. Exports
and industrial production grew strongly in May (by over 5 percent m-o-m) on the back of
progress with inventory adjustment in the IT and auto sectors. Meanwhile, benefits of fiscal
stimulus are beginning to be felt, with public works sharply higher and consumer spending
edging up. Sizeable fiscal and monetary stimulus should help the economy maintain positive
growth in the next few quarters. The June Tankan survey confirms some improvement in
business sentiment, but mostly among large manufacturers, while business conditions for
SMEs remain difficult. Looking ahead, Japanese corporates see downside risks from
overcapacity, tight corporate financing, and external uncertainties. The large economic slack
continues to exert downward pressures on prices—core inflation excluding food and energy
has fallen to –½ percent (y-o-y). On balance, the recent data are broadly consistent with
staff’s growth and inflation projections.
3.
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept its target rate unchanged at 0.1 percent during its
monetary policy meeting on June 15–16, citing downside risks to the outlook. Given the
stabilizing economy and some improvement in financial conditions, no new credit easing
measures were announced. The benchmark 10-year JGB yield has recently fallen in line with
global movements, by about 20 bps since mid-June.
4.
The government released its FY2009 Basic Policies on June 23. On the fiscal front,
the government committed to a new medium-term target of halving the primary deficit
(excluding the social security fund) within 5 years, and achieving primary balance within
10 years. The government also intends to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio by the mid-2010s
and to put it on a downward path during the early 2020s. However, no numerical targets for
the debt ratio were specified. According to fiscal projections by the Council on Economic
and Fiscal Policy, achieving these commitments would require raising the consumption tax
by 7 percentage points, implying an adjustment of 3½ percent of GDP in the primary
balance. While less ambitious than the 5 percent of GDP deficit adjustment under the staff’s
preferred scenario (primarily due to lower spending cuts), the thrust of these proposals is in
line with staff’s recommendations, and attention now needs to shift to articulating specific
measures for achieving the medium-term targets. Other reform agenda focuses on enhancing
the social safety net, including through broader eligibility for health care and unemployment
benefits. The government also intends to boost its support to green industries as a way of
raising potential growth.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 15, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Japan
On July 6, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
Although Japan was not at the center of the initial crisis, the collapse in external demand
and financial spillovers have plunged the economy into a severe recession. After
expanding robustly by 2.3 percent in 2007, GDP contracted by 0.7 percent last year.
GDP fell by about 14 percent SAAR in both Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, led by a sharp
decline in external demand for Japan’s manufacturing exports, although production data
have recently stabilized. Core inflation, which on staff’s definition excludes both fuel and
food prices, has turned negative. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has jumped to
5.2 percent in May 2009.
Japan’s financial markets have stabilized from the after-shocks of the Lehman Brothers
collapse last September, but some stresses persist. The Japanese stock market has
rebounded since March, but remains about 40 percent below end-2007 levels. The yen
has appreciated by about 20 percent in real effective terms since August 2008,
supported by unwinding carry trades and narrowing interest rate differentials against key
currencies. Bank lending rates have declined following Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) policy rate
cuts, although falling inflation has pushed up real rates. Corporate bond spreads remain
low for high-rated companies but have increased sharply for lower-rated firms.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The fiscal balance has sharply deteriorated after improving for several years. While
fiscal stimulus spending combined with automatic stabilizers will give a timely and
needed boost to growth, it carries a significant fiscal cost. With the overall fiscal deficit
projected to widen to about 11½ percent of GDP in FY2009, net debt is projected to
reach 100 percent of GDP this year (220 percent of GDP in gross terms). The
government has announced new medium-term targets in the FY2009 Basic Policies,
including halving the primary deficit (excluding the social security fund) within 5 years
and achieving primary balance within 10 years. The government has also committed to
stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio by the mid-2010s and placing it on a downward path
during the early 2020s.
Monetary policy has been accommodative. The BoJ reduced its policy rate from 50 to
10 basis points in late-2008. The BoJ also supported stability in financial markets
through significant liquidity injections, broadening the range of accepted collateral, larger
volume of JGB purchases, and U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations. In addition, the
BoJ took steps to improve the availability of corporate financing, in particular, through
unlimited funds-supplying operations against corporate debt collateral and outright
purchases of high-quality commercial paper and corporate bonds. As a back-stop to the
financial system, the BoJ has also resumed its purchases of banks’ stockholdings and
offered to provide subordinated loans to banks to support their capital base.
Financial policies are focusing on strengthening the resilience of the financial system.
The authorities have adopted further measures to bolster capital and promote lending,
while providing regulatory forbearance on unrealized equity losses at regional banks
subject to domestic standards. At the same time, they have expanded the government’s
lending guarantee program to stabilize SME lending.
Despite recent tentative signs of stabilization at home and abroad, the outlook remains
uncertain. Staff projects GDP to fall by 6 percent in 2009, before expanding by
1¾ percent in 2010. A sustained recovery will likely emerge during the course of 2010
but will hinge critically on improvement in overseas lending conditions and trade.
Inflation is projected to remain negative until 2011. The current account surplus is
expected to fall to 1½ percent of GDP in the short term, well below the levels typical
earlier this decade. The risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, stemming
from the rapidly deteriorating labor market, tight domestic financial conditions, and
external uncertainties. On current policies, potential growth could fall from about
1¾ percent in 2007 to close to 1 percent over the medium term as investment rates
decline due to tighter corporate financing and structural rigidities slow rebalancing of
growth toward domestic sources.
Executive Board Assessment
While Japan was not at the initial epicenter of the global crisis, the ensuing collapse in
external demand and financial spillovers have plunged the economy into a severe
recession. Directors commended the authorities for their well-calibrated response, which

3
is providing a much-needed boost to the economy. They expected a sustained recovery
to take hold next year, in line with a pick up in global growth, with inflation in mildly
negative territory during the slowdown. However, Directors emphasized that the outlook
is exceptionally uncertain. Notwithstanding recent signs of stabilization, risks are tilted to
the downside due to a deteriorating labor market, still-tight financial conditions, and
lingering uncertainties about global growth.
In these circumstances, Directors recognized that Japan faces a distinct set of
immediate and longer-term challenges. They agreed with the authorities that the focus
of near-term policies should be to support growth and preserve financial stability. Once
the economy recovers, attention will need to turn to implementing an exit strategy from
the exceptional policy interventions necessitated by the crisis and to stepping up
reforms for rebalancing growth. Determining the appropriate timing, speed, and
conditions for unwinding support will be key.
Directors welcomed the support being provided by the fiscal stimulus packages, and
emphasized the need for continued flexibility to address further downside risks. A longer
or more severe recession could call for additional targeted and reversible measures next
year. Noting the rapid rise in public debt and the aging population, Directors welcomed
the authorities’ medium-term consolidation strategy to be implemented once the
recovery takes hold. In addition to new targets aimed at placing the debt ratio firmly on a
downward path and careful debt management, such a strategy will likely require
expenditure cuts as well as comprehensive tax reform, including an increase in the
consumption tax after the recovery takes hold.
On the monetary front, Directors commended the authorities for their wide-ranging
actions, which have helped to stabilize financial markets and facilitate corporate
financing. The accommodative stance was seen as appropriate given the significant
output gap and deflationary pressures. Going forward, most Directors supported
additional credit easing measures should downside risks materialize or financial
stresses resurface, while minimizing risks to the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet. A few
Directors suggested that clarifying the horizon over which inflation is expected to return
toward the Bank of Japan’s understanding of price stability could anchor expectations.
With regard to the medium-term, Directors noted that the Bank of Japan has sufficient
instruments to facilitate an orderly exit, and that many of its credit easing measures are
set to expire automatically. The challenge will be to assess the appropriate timing and to
clearly communicate the exit strategy to guide expectations.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to a market-determined exchange rate.
Following a sharp appreciation during the crisis, the yen appears in line with its longerterm equilibrium value according to IMF staff estimates.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to stabilize the financial system. The authorities
should continue to strengthen the resilience of the system, notably by bolstering bank
profitability and capital and reducing risks from their equity holdings. At the same time,
promoting restructuring of viable but distressed firms could help the economy adjust to
the downturn. Exit from financial and corporate sector interventions should be guided by
the need to preserve financial stability, protect government solvency, and facilitate
needed restructuring.

4

Over the medium-term, Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with
structural reforms, including deregulating the agricultural and service sectors, enhancing
product market flexibility, further developing financial markets, and encouraging inward
foreign direct investment. While reform priorities are clear, their urgency has increased
in the wake of the crisis. By rebalancing growth toward domestic demand, such reforms
will help Japan adjust to structural shifts in the global economy. Directors also welcomed
the recent steps to strengthen the social safety net.
