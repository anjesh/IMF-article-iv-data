The 2004 Article IV Consultation discussions were held in Phnom Penh during April 28May 11 and July 13-15. The team consisted of Messrs. Lee (Head, APD) and Nakamura
(PDR), and Mmes. Abdelati, Muñoz (both APD), Kojo (FAD), and Rendak (LEG).
The mission was assisted by Mr. Hagemann (resident representative). Mr. Alowi (OED)
attended the policy meetings. Mr. Valdivieso (APD), who led the work on the Ex-Post
Assessment (EPA), discussed the EPA report with the authorities during the July 13-15
visit.

•

The 2002 Article IV Consultation was completed on February 20, 2003, along with the sixth
and final review of a three-year PRGF arrangement.

•

Discussions on a new PRGF arrangement have been delayed by the political stalemate in the
wake of the July 2003 national elections. Staff visited Phnom Penh in May and
September 2003, and March 2004 to maintain the policy dialogue. Formal discussions on an
arrangement could take place later this year.

•

A power-sharing agreement, which was reached after eleven months of deadlock between
the main political parties, paved the way to formation of a new government in mid-July.
There were no changes to the economic team, nor are changes expected in economic policy.
However, the number of political appointees in the government has doubled, which could
compromise the functioning of the government.

•

Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in January 2002, and
has maintained an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, core data are generally adequate for
surveillance purposes and are provided on a timely basis.

•

The authorities intend to publish the staff report, the selected issues paper, and the Ex-Post
Assessment report.

•

This report was prepared by a team led by Mr. I. Lee.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Macroeconomic performance in the past few years was generally good, reflecting
both favorable external developments and prudent fiscal policy. Exports soared
following a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S., and large aid inflows helped finance
domestic investment and spurred construction activities. Prudent fiscal policy has been
key to ensuring price stability.

•

These favorable developments, however, have masked underlying structural
weaknesses. Competitiveness has deteriorated on account of poor governance—in part
due to lack of progress in legal and judicial reform—which exacerbated uncertainty in
the business environment, while rudimentary infrastructure and high wages have kept
operating costs high. Slow growth in agriculture, where most of the poor make their
living, has pushed Cambodia further from meeting the MDGs.

•

Non-agricultural growth slowed to 3.2 percent in 2003 due to the SARS-related
drop in tourism and election-related uncertainties. Overall GDP growth, however,
was robust mainly because of a strong rebound in agricultural production. Prices
remained stable reflecting low trading partner inflation and prudent fiscal policy,
although some of the earlier gains in fiscal revenue collection were lost in the election
year. The pace of reforms stalled in the run-up and aftermath of the July 2003 elections.
The 2004 budget law, along with a range of legislation needed to complete WTO
accession, still awaits parliament approval.

•

Growth is expected to slow in 2004-05. While tourism is rebounding, agricultural
growth is expected to be lower than the exceptionally high growth of the previous year.
A further slowdown, possibly to below 2 percent GDP growth, is expected as
Cambodia’s garment industry will be exposed to direct competition from China
following the elimination of the quota system in January 2005.

•

A refocus of economic policies is needed to achieve the NPRS targets. In the medium
term, improving competitiveness will require a more forceful approach to addressing the
impediments to private sector activities, particularly the regulatory environment and
governance problems. In the long run, agricultural reforms through improved use of land
and a redirection of foreign aid toward promoting agricultural growth will be essential to
reduce poverty and generate employment to absorb the growing labor force.

•

Without stronger political resolve, medium-term economic growth is unlikely to be
sufficiently strong to reduce poverty. Additional revenue mobilization is necessary to
meet social spending needs and maintain fiscal sustainability. Effective use of revenue
and aid resources and improved service delivery hinge on hitherto resisted
comprehensive civil service reforms. Legal and judicial reform, which has been on the
government’s reform agenda for years, are critical to institute a transparent and
accountable economic system.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Economic growth in the 1990s was robust, albeit from an exceptionally low base
given the damage from the 20-year civil war. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 yielded a
coalition government but internal tensions persisted, undermining the rebuilding process.
Elections in 1998 produced a more durable coalition government that oversaw a period of
generally positive economic performance. More recently, tensions between the former
coalition partners in the wake of the July 2003 elections delayed the formation of a new
government with sufficient parliamentary support until mid-July 2004.1 Economic reforms
largely came to a halt during the eleven-month stalemate.
2.
Large aid inflows and the boom in the garment and tourism sectors have helped
Cambodia develop a formal sector around the main urban areas. The rural areas,
however, where most of the poor live as

3.
Accordingly, only limited progress has been made in alleviating poverty since the
beginning of reconstruction efforts. Cambodia remains one of the poorest countries in the
region with 36 percent of the population in poverty as of 1999. Moreover, Cambodia is
seriously off-track from the MDGs in several aspects (Box 1).
4.
Cambodia’s development program was supported by a three-year PRGF
arrangement for SDR 58.5 million (67 percent of quota), approved on October 22, 1999.
The sixth and final review was completed in February 2003, after which a disbursement of
SDR 8.4 million raised total Fund credit and loans outstanding to Cambodia to
SDR 70 million (80 percent of quota). The National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(NPRS), together with a Fund-Bank joint staff assessment, was also endorsed by the Fund

Hun Sen’s party solidified its seats in the July 2003 national elections but not by enough to
rule. A power-sharing agreement with one of the main opposition parties in June 2004 paved
the way to the formation of a new coalition government in mid-July 2004.

Box 1. Poverty in Cambodia
Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per
capita gross national income less than half of the East Asia and Pacific
average. Based on the World Bank Atlas Method, Cambodia’s per capita
gross national income is US$300, the lowest in the East Asia region with the
exception of Myanmar. It has some of the worst human development
indicators in the world, ranking 130th out of 173 countries, with a national
poverty level of 36 percent. The population is deprived of basic physical
and institutional infrastructure as a result of decades of political and social
instability until the early 1990s.
Despite steady growth during the last decade, poverty and inequality
have remained stubbornly high. Thirty-six percent of the population had
incomes below the poverty line of $0.40-0.63 per day in 1999, only
marginally below the 39 percent in 1994.1 In addition, the GINI index of
40 percent implies a high level of inequality. The 20 percent of households
with the lowest (per capita) income only receive 7.5 percent of the total
income, while the highest quintile receives 46 percent of total income.

Cambodia is off-track in pursuing the Millennium Development Goals:
•

•

Food security is lagging. At 36 percent, the proportion of
people suffering from hunger is far from the 2015
target of 19.5 percent. Poverty is worse in rural areas.
The high proportion of under-weight children under age
5 persists owing to inadequate food intake, lack of
health care, and poor sanitation.
Child mortality has increased over the past ten years,
particularly post-neonatal mortality. The main causes
have been diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory
infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases,
particularly measles where the coverage rate of
immunization is only 59 percent, well-below the 2015
target of 90 percent. Despite progress, the maternal
mortality rate remains extremely high at around 437
per 100,000 live births.

Cambodia could achieve primary education for all by 2015, but is unlikely to reach its secondary education
and gender equality targets. At 20.3 percent in 2001, the youth illiteracy rate was much higher than the
3 percent average in East Asia and the Pacific.

Health and sanitary conditions are very poor: only 30 percent of the population has access to safe drinking water
and only 17 percent has access to sanitation facilities. The conditions are especially poor in rural areas where only
10 percent has access to sanitation. More resources are needed to improve basic household amenities, especially in
remote areas. Given the rural concentration of the poor, meaningful poverty reduction will require more broadbased growth based on agriculture diversification and higher agricultural productivity.

and Bank Boards in February 2003. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) prepares its audited
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as required
under the Fund’s safeguards policy. An IMF safeguards assessment mission in January 2004
found that progress has been made and proposed measures to strengthen the remaining
weaknesses of NBC’s control framework.

During the 2002 Article IV Consultation, Directors welcomed progress under the
PRGF. However, they noted the widespread poverty, narrow production base, low revenue to
GDP, and pervasive governance concerns. They underscored the need to strengthen government
capacity and promote broad-based economic growth through investment and a vibrant private
sector. The accompanying Ex-post Assessment report provides a detailed account of the Fund’s
contribution to Cambodia’s recent economic growth.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS FOR 2004
6.
Macroeconomic performance in the past few years was generally good. With the
advent of political stability in 1999, private sector activities, reportedly also in the informal
sector, flourished in urban areas. Annual real GDP growth averaged 6-7 percent, reflecting both
favorable external developments and prudent macroeconomic policies (Table 1). In particular:
•

Exports soared following a bilateral trade agreement with the United States that
effectively reduced the average U.S. tariff rate for garments produced in Cambodia from
50-70 percent to 10-20 percent. The

•

Large aid inflows, which averaged
12 percent of GDP, helped finance
domestic investment and fueled
construction activities. About half
of the inflows were grants in the
form of donor-financed projects and
technical assistance, all of which
were outside the budget. Aid inflows
were used to improve health and
education, rebuild physical
infrastructure, and strengthen
economic and social institutions.

Prudent fiscal policy has been key to ensuring price stability in Cambodia’s highly
dollarized economy. As much as 95 percent of total liquidity, including estimated U.S.
dollars in circulation, is in dollars. With few monetary policy instruments, the task of
ensuring that aggregate demand does not become a source of inflation necessarily falls to
fiscal policy. This task has been made easier in recent years because of low inflation in
U.S. dollar terms in trading partners.

7.
Fiscal revenue improved from 8.1 percent of GDP in 1998 to 11.2 percent in 2002
owing in part to strengthened tax and customs administration. The latter was supported by
an extensive technical assistance program under the Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP).
Nevertheless, total revenue remains low—

More recently, nonagricultural growth slowed to 3.2 percent in 2003 due to the
SARS-related drop in tourism and election-related uncertainties. However, overall GDP still
grew by 5.2 percent, mainly because a lower Mekong river level—due to lower rain fall—
exposed a larger area of arable land that allowed a strong rebound in agricultural production.
Revenue collection was disappointing, partly reflecting low nonagricultural growth, but more

- 10 -

importantly due to greater tax evasion and smuggling by importers.2 Election-related spending
during the year helped to boost consumption, which, however, required a sharp curtailment of
non-priority expenditure toward the end of the year, especially given the poor revenue collection.
The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) widened by 1¼ percent to
10¼ percent of GDP due to buoyant merchandise imports, lower tourism receipts, and higher
petroleum prices. The vulnerability of the deposit base of the banking system was apparent
during the July elections when foreign currency deposits declined by 20 percent in a matter
of 1-2 weeks. They recovered, however, later in the year (Table 3).
9.
Only modest progress on structural reforms has been made since 1999. Basic
institutions were set up and various laws ranging from commercial contracts to accounting were
adopted. A Financial Institutions Law was passed that provided the legal basis for successful
bank re-licensing. However, progress has been particularly slow in civil service and judicial
reform due to political resistance. The pace of structural reforms slowed across all sectors in the
run-up to, and aftermath of, the July 2003 election. The 2004 budget and a range of legislation
needed to complete WTO accession still await approval by the National Assembly.
10.
More importantly, the reconstruction efforts have not yet been able to establish a
strong foundation for sustainable growth, even in urban areas. In particular, structural
weaknesses, complicated by deeply rooted governance problems, remain in the following three
inter-related areas:
•

An underlying deterioration of competitiveness has been masked by favorable
external developments. Poor public administration and weak governance—partly due to
slow progress in legal and judicial reform—have exacerbated uncertainty in the business
environment and allowed the rich to set their own rules. In addition, embryonic and
poorly maintained infrastructure and high wages have kept operating costs high (Box 2).3

•

Agricultural development has stagnated due to limited access to arable land and
markets (Box 3). Slow growth in agriculture has pushed Cambodia further away from
meeting the MDGs and reduced its capacity to absorb the growing number of entrants to
the labor market over the medium term.

2

Tax collection by the customs department declined from an average 15 percent of retained nongarment imports in 2001-02 to below 13 percent in 2003 (notwithstanding the modest decline in
the unweighted average tariff, which is estimated to have negligible revenue implications).

3

See Chapter 2, “Implications of Removal of Quotas in 2005,” in the accompanying Selected
Issues paper, which shows Cambodia to be one of the most vulnerable countries among Asian
low-income countries to the garment quota elimination.

- 11 -

Box 2. Competitiveness
Cambodia’s garment exports have risen rapidly since the late 1990s, mainly reflecting two factors. The first
is the 1996 bilateral trade agreement with the United States that substantially reduced the effective tariff rate
on garments produced in Cambodia. The second factor is the large economic rent for Cambodian exporters
to the U.S. market reflecting the U.S. quotas imposed on Chinese garment exporters. The underlying
weaknesses of Cambodia’s competitiveness can be gleaned from two key observations.

Cambodia is unable to fully utilize its allocated quota. Most of Cambodia’s garment exports are
in categories that are subject to U.S. quotas on imports from China. However, Cambodia’s garment
exports are below their quota in the U.S. market, and almost negligible in non-U.S. markets such as
in Japan, while Chinese products dominate the market in the same categories.

•

Non-garment exports have remained flat in U.S. dollar terms. The business community
estimates that a 15–30 percent cost reduction is required for Cambodia to remain competitive
relative to China. Recent proposals to move garment manufacturers to export processing zones will
have limited impact since Cambodia already provides extensive tax incentives.

There are many reasons for Cambodia’s weak competitiveness.
Competitiveness is impeded by poor infrastructure,
corruption, and red tape. According to the World
Bank’s recent Investment Climate Survey and Value
Chain Analysis, the average cost of starting a business
is estimated to be as high as 553 percent of per capita
income, compared with 30 percent in Vietnam and
7 percent in Thailand. The “bribe tax” is estimated at
5¼ percent of sales in manufacturing, more than double
the rate in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and China. Moreover,
it takes an average of 18 days to obtain export customs
clearance in Cambodia, compared with 11 days in India
and 7 in China.

High labor cost has been another factor. At a minimum wage of $45 a month and an average of $61 a
month in the garment sector, Cambodia’s wages are higher than in several neighboring countries, including
Vietnam, India, and Sri Lanka. Moreover, foreign investors are subject to a 100 percent wage premium for
night shifts, are restricted from operating on weekends or any of the 22 national holidays to meet temporary
demand surges, and face frequent labor strikes.

Box 3. Impediments to Agricultural Growth
About 80 percent of the poor depend on agriculture for their
livelihood. Agriculture contributes 40 percent to GDP and
accounts for 70 percent of employment. During 1994-2003, the
sector grew at an annual average of less than 4 percent,
contributing very little to employment growth. The average rice
yield, estimated at 2.1 tons per hectare in 2001, is the lowest in
Southeast Asia, reflecting in part low labor productivity. For
example, a worker in Cambodia produces 44 kg of rice compared
with 62 kg in Thailand.
Pro-poor growth will depend on addressing key constraints
faced by the rural economy in agriculture:

Average annual growth rates.

•

Lack of land availability. Only 1 percent of land area is used for permanent cropland and only 7 percent of this is
irrigated. Cultivated land rose gradually from 1.4 million hectares in the mid-1980s to about 2.4 million hectares in the
late 1990s, and has not increased since. Furthermore, most of the new land from de-mining (0.1 million hectares) and
forest clearance (2.5 million hectares) has reportedly been allocated to the rich, who do not use the land for cultivation.
This is partly corroborated by NGO reports that claim the government has approved 0.8 million hectares as land
concessions in the past few years. However, official data show no expansion in cultivated land.

•

Lack of property rights. Only 10 percent of farmers have formal title to their farming land. With no property rights,
most farmers are hesitant to engage in long-term investment and have no access to collateralized lending.

Limited access to economic opportunities
•

Inadequate rural roads and poor road maintenance impede commercialization. Of the 12,323 km of the existing road
network, only 16.20 percent is paved. In comparison, Thailand has 98 percent of its road network paved, Malaysia
76 percent, and Vietnam 25 percent. There are no secondary roads and tertiary roads often feed directly into the
primary network. Moreover, the rail system is in need of major rehabilitation.

•

Weak marketing systems. Only small scale informal trading of surplus rice occurs with Vietnam and Thailand.
Cambodian farmers have weak bargaining power due to limited information on market prices. In addition, lack of
warehouses contributes to huge price swings between post- and pre-harvest seasons (close to 100 percent sometimes),
damaging poor farmers. The absence of agricultural associations and cooperatives also slows agricultural development.

•

Lack of modern farming techniques and advanced technology. Farmers use traditional seeds that produce low crop
yields. Moreover, even though good quality fertilizers are imported from Thailand, these are diluted by middleman
before reaching the farmers.

•

Limited access to formal financial services. The state-owned Rural Development Bank acts as a wholesale bank,
mainly in lending to NGO microfinance institutions. So far six micro-finance institutions have been licensed and the
largest (Acleda) has recently obtained a commercial bank license. None of the other commercial banks lend to farm
households. It is estimated that only 15 percent of the rural population has access to financial institutions. As a result,
farmers are under-capitalized and have no means of adopting new technology, improving seeds, or using fertilizers.

•

Barriers to public health. Due in large part to the low pay of public sector health workers, the public must pay fees to
obtain free public health services. This limits farmers access to health care and their ability to earn income.

Limited access to forestry and fisheries
Forest and fisheries resources, which were previously a source of supplementary food and income to farmers, have become
increasingly difficult to access. Recent changes in natural resource management policies have left vast areas of the country
(30 to 40 percent of total area) with unclear management arrangements.

Government capacity remains
severely constrained by lack of
human capital and entrenched
governance problems. The quality
of the civil service remains poor, and
fiscal revenue, currently at
10.4 percent of GDP, is hardly
enough to meet basic priority
spending needs (Table 4).

The outlook for economic growth
Health
Education
Agriculture
Rural Development
in 2004 is tinted by weaker prospects for
agricultural production. The Avian flu earlier in the year, the smaller fish catch due to the
lower Mekong river level, and agricultural production that is unlikely to be much higher than
last year’s bumper crop indicate weaker output growth. While non-agricultural growth is
expected to rebound strongly due to a recovery in tourism, overall GDP would most likely
increase by 4-4½ percent. The impact of still-high petroleum product prices is expected to
widen the external current account deficit by another ½ percent of GDP. Inflation is also
likely to inch up reflecting price developments in trading partner countries.
III. MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES
12.
Urgent reform in the agricultural sector is essential to achieve the NPRS
objective of reducing poverty. As a small open economy with ample unused arable land and
a large unskilled labor force, agriculture is widely recognized to be Cambodia’s comparative
advantage. Promoting agriculture is the best strategy to secure a key source of growth that
could help absorb a part of the expected increase in the labor force, address poverty more
directly, and provide a more rapid expansion of domestic market for manufactured products.
A more dynamic agricultural sector may also encourage foreign investment, which has been
weak, partly because the population of 13 million does not provide a sufficiently large
domestic market.
13.
Cambodia can no longer rely on the garment sector as the engine of growth.
Efforts should focus on improving competitiveness to dampen the impact from the expected
decline in garment exports and encourage diversification of its export base. This is
particularly urgent because the elimination of the quota system in January 2005 will expose
Cambodian exporters to direct competition from China, where production costs are estimated
to be 15 to 30 percent lower than in Cambodia. It will take some time before Cambodia’s
exports could recover, even if all identified reforms are undertaken. The value of garment
exports could decline by 12 percent in 2005, which might reduce GDP growth to below
2 percent. A depreciation of the exchange rate is likely to have only a limited impact on

- 14 competitiveness because most costs, including wages, are denominated in U.S. dollars.4 The
overall impact of the quota removal on the balance of payments, however, would be modest
as garment-related inputs, almost all of which are imported, and profit remittances would also
drop. Cambodia could earn some time if the U.S. takes recourse in either the so called
“product specific” safeguard against Chinese imports, available until 2013, or the special
textiles safeguard, which expires in 2008. However, it would be highly risky for the
government to formulate its economic strategy on the uncertain assumption that the U.S. will
adopt either of these two options. Furthermore, additional tariff reduction by the U.S. or
relaxation of rule of origin requirements by the EU and Canada would have only a marginally
favorable impact.
14.
Even under the best case scenario, which assumes improved governance and
reduced costs, growth would only reach the annual NPRS target of 6-6½ percent
by 2009 (Table 5). Under this scenario, public debt, which was 75 percent of GDP at the end
of 2003, is expected to be sustainable. Assuming that Cambodia reaches a debt rescheduling

Chapter 4, “Pro-Poor Exchange Rate Policy: a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis,” in the
Selected Issues paper discusses the potential impact on the poor from different policy
responses to the quota elimination.

- 15 agreement with the Russian Federation and the United States on comparable terms to the
1995 Paris Club agreement, Cambodia’s net present value (NPV) of public debt at the end
of 2004 would be reduced to 33 percent of GDP.5 However, the NPV of public debt would
still represent around 235 percent of total revenue (280 percent excluding grants); a
significant strengthening of the revenue effort would be needed to reduce this
below 200 percent after 2013 (Annex II).
15.
Failure to press ahead more resolutely with reform will limit growth to
2-4 percent annually in the medium term. A new government that lacks a strong
commitment to improve governance is likely to fail to improve the business environment,
which will make a recovery from the negative shock of the quota elimination highly unlikely;
and with lower revenue collection, the government will be unable to meet even priority
spending needs. Moreover, long-run growth will be jeopardized if agricultural sector reforms
are not implemented. In this non-adjustment scenario, the NPV of public debt will reach
about 230 to 250 percent of fiscal revenue, threatening fiscal sustainability. While the
economy is not likely to experience a financial or balance of payment crisis, the lack of
reform will slow progress toward poverty alleviation, which in turn could lead to social
unrest.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The authorities were more sanguine than the mission about short- and mediumterm economic prospects. They considered that their current efforts to reduce red tape,
together with close adherence to core labor standards—which they believe will support
demand for made-in-Cambodia garments—would be adequate to ensure only a modest slow
down in growth after the quota phase out. Moreover, they have recently received new
investment proposals in the garment sector from Vietnam, where the U.S. quota will remain
beyond early 2005 until Vietnam accedes to the WTO. They agreed that agricultural
development was important to reduce poverty and raise long-term growth, and to consider, in
consultation with donors, the possibility of reorienting aid flows.
A. Fiscal Issues
17.
Supported by robust first quarter results, the government was cautiously
optimistic that fiscal revenue collection, which declined in 2003, would recover in 2004.
They indicated that the low collection by the customs department partly reflected delayed
payments of taxes. Moreover, the government has also started implementing some of the

If reaching an agreement is further delayed, Cambodia’s external cash flow position will
improve in the near term to the extent that the current interest charges on the stock of debt
(which are largely in arrears) are negligible.

- 16 fiscal measures announced late last year.6 The mission, however, argued that additional tax
policy measures equivalent to 0.8 percent of

would be needed to meet their revenue

target (inclusive of measures announced last

doubts about their ability to do this during
the remainder of the year, but agreed that

revenue from strengthened anti-smuggling

efforts. Even if the revenue target is met and
recurrent spending contained, domestic-0.5

financed capital spending will be
substantially compressed because of
compensation payments to Thailand, higher interest payments following possible closure of
their debt rescheduling negotiations, and settlement of a portion of the stock of arrears to
domestic suppliers.7
18.
To meet the NPRS targets, total cumulative revenue measures equivalent to
about 2½ percent of GDP will be needed over 2004–09. This requirement would rise
further if foreign financing were to decline from current levels. The authorities agreed with
the need to introduce additional revenue measures, but indicated that they would not want to
pre-commit to any specific measure at this stage. They assured the mission, however, that
they would continue to avoid recourse to domestic bank financing, which has helped contain
riel inflation. On the spending side, a continued tight lid on non-wage and non-social
spending will allow a modest increase in the wage bill, from an average salary of $34 a
month in 2003 (compared with an average garment worker’s wage of $60 a month) to
$80 a month by 2008, while improving the primary balance to a level that is consistent with a
sustainable fiscal path by 2007.
19.
The authorities agreed that computerization of the revenue departments will
help better capitalize on the technical assistance provided so far by reducing paperwork
and keeping track of collections, a key to reducing corruption. The authorities are currently
6

The measures include subjecting all telecom charges and airline tickets to a 10 percent
excise, and introducing a specific tax on kerosene, bicycles, and air-conditioners at
10 percent. The full-year revenue impact of these measures could be as high as 0.35 percent
of GDP. However, faced with strong resistance, the authorities are not yet fully enforcing
these measures. Moreover, the announced increase in the ad-valorem tax on beer from
20 percent to 30 percent has been put on hold.
7

While comprehensive data are not available, the mission estimated total domestic arrears at
end-2003 to be around 3 percent of GDP, including unsettled outstanding operations from
previous years and payment orders during 2003 in excess of cash released.

- 17 reviewing least cost options, but one that could be easily expanded to other departments in
future. In addition, they will continue to collect arrears (receivables) to institute a tax-paying
culture. They were also receptive to the mission’s recommendation to restructure the
organizational structure of the Tax Department to one based on taxpayer services, education,
and self-assessment. With regard to customs reforms, they agreed that passage of the Law on
Customs, which the new government should re-submit to parliament without further delays,
is crucial to strengthen enforcement and reduce smuggling. The authorities indicated that they
would, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, also monitor closely large
urban distribution centers where smuggled products are alleged to be sold.
20.
The authorities are now more cautious in awarding government contracts. Most
of the Build-Operate-Transfer contracts in recent years were awarded through direct
negotiations that resulted in actual payments to the Treasury, through either profit sharing or
taxes, that were well below expectations.8 While noncommittal, the authorities agreed about
the need for the National Audit Authority to audit the operations of existing contract holders
with significant fiscal implications to verify compliance with the terms of the contracts. For
new contracts, the World Bank’s proposed overhaul of the procurement and concession
legislation, which stresses competitive bidding, is expected to help address part of the
problem in the medium term. Recently, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) stopped
awarding a power project to a private company and asked the IFIs to provide an assessment
of the proposal. In response, the World Bank and the AsDB will identify the least cost
national power development plan, against which the current and any future projects can be
compared.
21.
The public expenditure management reform agenda remains large (Table 6).
Reform of the Treasury slowed in 2003: about two thirds of line ministries still do not
provide timely reports of their transactions to the Treasury, and foreign currency units within
the MEF manage their accounts separately. Partly reflecting a revenue shortfall, the Cash
Management Committee was unable to smooth out the government’s spending commitments
during 2003, resulting in yet another late-year bunching of spending and earmarking of next
year’s tax receipts. The authorities noted, however, that disbursements under the Priority
Action Plan for social spending had accelerated, and the backlog was expected to be fully
cleared by early 2005. To better coordinate and monitor public expenditure management
(PEM) reform, the MEF has established a reform committee, which will also serve as the
counterpart to a donor technical working group under a Sector-Wide-Approach to PEM
reform. The authorities were also committed to improving the effectiveness of public
spending once lessons are learned from the World Bank’s ongoing expenditure tracking
study.
22.
The government will complete the ongoing studies before making a decision
about overhauling the structure of the civil service and wages. Public employment, at
8

The mission estimated that foregone revenue from three key contracts signed in recent years
could be as much as $15 million a year.

- 18 some 2½ percent of the total population, and an associated wage bill of less than 4 percent of
GDP are within international norms. However, civil service wages are well below that of the
formal private sector, and the wage structure is highly compressed. The authorities indicated
that they are reluctant to downsize the civil service because of social concerns, especially
when unemployment was rising. However, they now expect to complete key studies, which
have been substantially delayed, within the next few months, which are critical inputs to
formulating a comprehensive civil service reform strategy in consultation with the World
Bank. The studies include functional reviews to determine appropriate institutional
arrangements, organization, processes, and staffing of government functions; and labor
market analyses to identify adequate remuneration. The government was, however, less
committal on demobilization, which had stalled since the first phase was completed in
late 2002.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
23.
The central bank will continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market to
stabilize excessive fluctuation of the exchange rate. Domestic currency cash injected by
government spending is normally retained in circulation as the transaction demand for riel
continues to rise with economic growth. Exchange rate instability typically arises when
government spending accelerates and the central bank is slow to absorb the excess supply in
riel. Mindful of the shallowness of the market and that exchange rate policy has only limited
effects on competitiveness, the mission supported the NBC’s policy to stabilize “riel”
inflation at a low level by maintaining a broadly stable exchange rate. At the same time, the
authorities should not preclude an exchange rate adjustment if there are fundamental changes
in underlying market conditions exerting pressure in the foreign exchange market.
24.
The mission agreed with the NBC that Cambodia would benefit from dedollarizing the economy in the long run. In addition to the loss of seigniorage, the lack of
monetary policy independence and the central bank’s inability to act as a lender of last resort
could eventually threaten financial stability. Moreover, although the United States now
accounts for 25 percent of Cambodia’s gross external trade, this is expected to decline after
the elimination of the quota system. Hence, the potential benefits of lower transactions cost
from certainty about the value of the riel vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar will be more limited. Dedollarization initiatives, such as requiring that all government transactions be conducted in
domestic currency, could also be considered. But forceful administrative measures or
political uncertainty could immediately translate into capital flight, as there is still lack of
confidence in riel.
25.
The authorities acknowledged that commercial banks have played only a limited
role in facilitating investment finance. While successful bank restructuring during 2000-02
contributed to financial deepening, bank loans in percent of GDP remain well below those in
other countries in the region. Even then, the NBC agreed to closely monitor credit expansion,
especially since banks’ credit risk assessment capacity is weak, legal infrastructure including
the enforceability of financial contracts is not in place, and reliable borrower information is
not available. In this regard, passage of the Negotiable Instruments and Payment Transactions
Law, the Secured Transaction Law, the Insolvency Law, and the Securities and Exchange

- 19 Law, is expected to reduce payment system risks and provide a legal basis for collateralbased lending. Early completion of the implementation of the new chart of accounts and the
accounting law will provide banks better information on potential borrowers.
C. Private Sector Regulatory Environment and Governance
26.
Private sector activities are deterred by the high costs of inputs and governance
problems, as confirmed in a recent World Bank analysis.9 The high input cost associated
with poor infrastructure and human capital
Comparison of Customs Clearance Costs
needs to be addressed. In the short run, the
($ per 40 foot container)
authorities will consider revisiting the
provisions for overtime, nightshift, and holiday
pay—while upholding core labor standards—to
reduce labor costs. The mission emphasized
that greater wage flexibility is also needed.
Moreover, the minimum wage was segmenting
the labor market, hindering growth in
employment. On governance, the authorities
agreed that establishing an independent and
well functioning judiciary within a transparent
legal framework is a basic prerequisite to
creating a conducive business environment. The mission noted that, additionally, a strong
political commitment is required to urgently address administrative impediments to
investment and the high informal fees, not only to help the garment sector recover quickly,
but also to promote export diversification.

Only in recent years has work begun to strengthen the legal and judicial system
in conjunction with WTO accession. Most of the laws, however, are still in draft form.
Once the accession package is adopted by the National Assembly, Cambodia will become,
along with Nepal, one of the first low-income countries to join the WTO.10 Benefits are
expected to be wide-ranging as accession requires adoption of 46 pieces of legislation over
the next several years, ranging from judicial reform to trade related property rights. But equal
effort needs to be placed on proper implementation of the legislation. In response to criticism
from some NGOs that Cambodia’s WTO accession would expose the country to open
competition for which it is not ready, government officials indicated that Cambodia was
already fully open, and that WTO accession would provide an opportunity to put in place an
orderly environment in which Cambodia will be able to better compete.

In view of the political impasse, the WTO has granted an extension to September 2004, by
which time the accession package needs to be adopted by parliament (Table 7).

28.
The government has recently increased salaries of judges and established the
Royal School of Judges and Prosecutors. Some progress has also been made by the
working groups tasked with producing an action plan to implement the Strategy for Legal and
Judicial Reform. Donors were resistant, however, to providing more assistance noting that
not much had been done even though the legal and juridical reform has been on the
government’s agenda for the past 10 years. While donor assistance would undoubtedly help,
there are measures that could be implemented in the short term for which, above all, political
will is required. These include adopting the law on the status of judges and prosecutors,
embarking on the implementation of a long pending reform of the Supreme Council of
Magistracy, and establishing a commercial court (Box 4). The authorities cautioned,
however, that judiciary reform, especially reform of the Supreme Council of Magistracy,
would likely be delayed as it was a sensitive issue and needed to honor an understanding that
was reached between the political parties as part of their power-sharing agreement.
D. Rural Development and Aid Allocation
29.
The authorities acknowledged that progress in agricultural development has
been slow. The mission questioned why cultivated land area had not increased since the late
1990s even though there is ample unused land. In this regard, the mission recommended
auditing the already awarded land

30.
Lack of roads and information on prices limits the ability of, or incentive for,
small scale farmers to sell their produce in competitive markets. Moreover, the absence
of a clear land registration system has weakened incentives to improve land
productivity by building irrigation systems. The authorities indicated that they would
consider helping farmers set up agricultural associations and cooperatives that would, as a
group, have better access to market information and a stronger bargaining position. Such
associations could also improve farmers’ access to financial resources. On the latter, the

Lack of enforcement of property rights is reported to have favored those with power, rather
than small farmers, in land disputes.

Box 4. Legal and Judicial Reform
The existing legal framework and judicial institutions are weak, and their reform is substantially behind
schedule, constituting a major impediment to private sector growth and foreign investment.
Legal and judicial system
Cambodia’s legal system is based on civil law. The Constitution adopted in 1993 provides for the
separation of powers, and establishes the judiciary as an independent institution. The Supreme Council of
Magistracy is charged with helping the King to ensure judicial independence and to discipline judges and
prosecutors.
Cambodia’s judicial institutions comprise provincial and municipal courts, which adjudicate the majority
of civil and commercial disputes, Appeals Court, Supreme Court, and military courts. At present, there are
no specialized commercial courts or independent arbitration with the exception of the recently established
labor arbitration council, whose decisions are neither mandatory nor subject to enforcement.
There are currently 195 judges and prosecutors (also referred to as “magistrates”). Judges have little
expertise or experience to handle commercial disputes, and are widely perceived to lack independence
from political influence and vested interests. Enforcement of court decisions is unpredictable and costly.
Recent developments in legal and judicial reform
While the legal and judicial reform has been on the government’s agenda for the past 10 years, work has
only recently begun on drafting new legislation in conjunction with preparation for the WTO accession.
Most of the laws are still in draft form.
On the positive side, salaries of judges were raised in 2003 from $25-30 a month to $200-400 a month, and
the Royal School of Judges and Prosecutors was established. The School enrolled the first 55 students in
November 2003, for graduation in 24 months. In June 2003, the government adopted the Strategy for
Legal and Judicial Reform. Working groups have been tasked to produce an action plan that will prioritize
reform measures by mid-2004 and be used to solicit assistance from the international community.
Where do we go from here?
In the medium term Cambodia’s accession to the WTO is expected to strengthen the legal system.
Commitment of the authorities will be required to embark on reforming the judiciary. While Cambodia
will require significant donor assistance, some measures that require little or no such assistance can and
should be implemented in the short term. These include:
•

Adopting the law on the status of judges and prosecutors that would establish an appointment
process and the terms and conditions of service, including a code of conduct.

•

Taking concrete steps to ensure the independence and the transparency of the operation of the
Supreme Council of the Magistracy, to enable it to fulfill its functions set forth in the Constitution.

•

Establishing a commercial court that will specialize in commercial dispute resolution. A law on the
commercial court is currently being prepared and is expected to be passed in 2005.

•

Passing an anti-corruption law that establishes an effective framework for investigation and
prosecution of corruption offences and provides for declaration of income and assets by
government officials; and preparing the implementing regulations.

•

Publishing all court decisions and creating a repository of all laws in Khmer and in English.

mission endorsed the NBC’s strategy to reduce lending rates in rural areas through increased
competition among lending institutions. Donors and the IFIs are providing support in a few
areas: the AsDB is providing assistance in commercialization of agriculture, diversification
of crops, and land management, while the World Bank is focusing on land concessions and
titling.
31.
The authorities saw a need to
review, together with donors, the current
allocation of foreign aid flows. Although
weak administrative capacity may have
required that about 50 percent of all aid
flows be used for technical cooperation, a reallocation may be needed to more directly
address poverty and boost long-term growth.
The enormous investment needs of the
agricultural sector argue for greater
allocation of resources for building
infrastructure that could support irrigation
systems and roads to markets.

32.
Unsustainable logging has destroyed a valuable source of income and
contributed to soil erosion. Although the ban on logging remains in place, monitoring of log
transportation and other forest crime prevention schemes remains weak. The authorities
reiterated their commitment to retain the ban on logging until sustainable forest management
plans are put in place. A plan for community based forestry to safeguard the livelihood of
local communities is also being considered. In particular, more forceful action is required by
the government to incidents reported by the Société Générale de Surveillance, the new
independent forestry monitoring firm.
E. Other Issues
33.
The authorities are continuing their dialogue with the Russian Federation and
the United States to reach agreement on debt rescheduling. The latest proposal from the
Russian Federation involves an upfront cash payment and substantial debt cancellation. The
Cambodian authorities have indicated that they are seeking further clarification on the
Russian proposal, and intend to intensify negotiation with the United States.
34.
In accordance with Cambodia’s commitment under ASEAN, its tariff lines were
recently reclassified to the ASEAN Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN). The
authorities confirmed that even after the conversion to AHTN, their unweighted average tariff
remained unchanged at 15 percent—Cambodia’s average tariff was reduced from
16.5 percent in 2003 to 15 percent under the old tariff nomenclature.

- 23 -

35.
Cambodia’s statistical framework is being upgraded but substantial weaknesses
remain. The authorities agreed on the need to start relying more on their own resources and
training to strengthen technical capacities. However, the revenue situation makes it unlikely
that any meaningful amount of resources would be allocated to statistics from the budget.
36.
A draft comprehensive anti-money laundering law is being prepared with the
assistance of LEG and MFD. An interministerial working group was charged with this task,
headed by the NBC. The Prime Minister has also instructed that a Financial Investigation
Unit be set up at the NBC, indicating his commitment to anti-money laundering.
F. Ex-Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement
37.
Cambodia’s longer term program engagement was reviewed in the context of the
Ex-Post Assessment report discussions.12 The authorities welcomed the draft EPA report as
a useful review and foundation for future reform plans. They noted that the EPA gave
appropriate consideration to the adverse initial conditions, provided a good description of
developments under Fund-supported programs, and presented a balanced assessment of the
strengths and weaknesses of the policies pursued during the period under review. They
agreed with the main finding of the report that, despite important progress achieved in many
areas, poverty remained pervasive and governance problems widespread. They also agreed
with the key elements of the strategy proposed in the EPA for future engagement with the
Fund, and reiterated their desire to start discussions on a new PRGF soon. However, the
authorities had a number of observations.
•

The report could have emphasized more the challenges faced in the transition to a
market economy. In particular, the challenges posed by people’s attitude toward the
role of the government—they had grown to depend too much on government actions
during the central planning period—and the problems faced in rebuilding and
reestablishing trust in, and credibility of, key institutions. Deepening confidence is
key for future development.

•

As regards the thrust of macroeconomic policies, the authorities agreed that it will
be critical to maintain stability to achieve high growth and reduce poverty. In line
with the EPA recommendations, they believe fiscal policy will continue to play a
central role. They will continue in their efforts to enhance revenue and strengthen
expenditure control. The authorities also agreed not to resist fundamental pressures on
the exchange rate, but noted that the impact of a flexible exchange rate may be very
limited as long as the market remains shallow and dollarization continues to be

12

The accompanying EPA report was prepared by a separate team led by Mr. Valdivieso
(APD).

- 24 -

widespread. That said, they agreed with the steps outlined in the report to achieve dedollarization.
•

The authorities agreed that pervasiveness of poverty was a serious problem but
warned against an unqualified comparison of indicators across countries, particularly
given the differences in data quality and methodologies used in calculation. They
reiterated their intention to gear their policy efforts toward meeting the NPRS goals,
especially by expediting structural reforms that would enhance the impact of growth
on poverty reduction.

•

The authorities agreed that much remains to be done in the governance area and
reiterated their determination to address it forcefully. They noted, however, that
governance problems were not exclusive to the public sector. In this regard, they
thought the report could have also discussed the extent of transparency and
accountability problems outside the government sector, including in the corporate
sector and the NGOs.

•

The authorities thought the report covered well long-term issues and policy
requirements relating to agricultural development; their focus has been on measures
with a short-term impact, such as, for example, enhancing marketing channels and
institutionalizing micro-finance activities in rural areas.

•

On external financial assistance, the authorities agreed that there was a need to
enhance the informational database to analyze aid effectiveness, and noted that actual
aid inflows may be less than recorded because they include donors’ overhead costs in
their respective countries. They considered that aid in the form of technical
cooperation was adequate given their depleted human capital, but noted that donors
would have helped promote greater ownership by using more local staff, which would
have saved scarce financial resources. Finally, they pointed to several ongoing efforts
at enhancing donor coordination, for example, the progress achieved so far in
developing a framework to enhance the public sector’s financial management in
consultation with the Bank, Fund, and other donors.

38.
The authorities requested that the Fund continue to provide policy advice, more
focused technical assistance, and financial support. They reiterated their desire to start
discussions on an economic program to be supported by a PRGF arrangement. In addition to
helping to strengthen Cambodia’s official international reserve position and contain possible
adverse effects from the forthcoming elimination of the garment quota, an arrangement with
the Fund would help underpin a framework for donor coordination and encourage domestic
reform efforts within the government. While underscoring their responsibility for ensuring
that technical assistance is used effectively by choosing the right counterparts, they
emphasized the importance of training local trainers to ensure that the transmission of skills
proceeds more smoothly.

- 25 -

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Cambodia has come a long way in rebuilding its economy from the ruins of
decades-long civil strife. However, poverty alleviation remains a challenge that the recent,
narrow based growth has not been able to address. Nurturing the agricultural sector, where
Cambodia has a natural comparative advantage, becomes all the more urgent as Cambodia
will no longer be able to rely on the garment sector after the elimination of the quota system
in early 2005. With most of the poor living in rural areas, agricultural development is the only
way to address poverty directly.
40.
Limited access to arable land is a key impediment to agricultural growth. The
staff urges the government to focus more on land issues, including auditing the already
awarded economic concessions, reviewing the transfers of ownership of de-mined and deforested land, and speeding up land registration. It is also important that the government
review, together with donors, the current allocation of foreign aid flows with a view to
refocusing it on agricultural development.
41.
Cambodia also needs to intensify its efforts to promote growth in other sectors,
for which it will need to attract foreign investment. It is recognized, however, that
reducing the high input costs associated with poor infrastructure and human capital, and
establishing a sound regulatory environment, can only be achieved in the long run. There is
considerable scope for improvements in the short run, however, by cutting cumbersome red
tape and the high informal fees, and by allowing greater wage flexibility. These are especially
important in a dollarized environment where the exchange rate can not be used to improve
competitiveness.
42.
The staff urges that judicial reform be accelerated to address governance
problems that are deeply rooted in all aspect of economic activities. The weakness of the
judiciary is evident: there have been no reported cases of prosecution for any business-related
activities or corruption since reconstruction efforts began in the early 1990s. The staff looks
forward to the adoption of the anti-corruption law and the law on the status of judges and
prosecutors, which would establish an appointment process and the terms and conditions of
service, and to the establishment of a commercial court that will specialize in commercial
dispute resolution. WTO accession will be helpful in putting in place a legal framework
given the many laws required for membership. The staff notes, however, that the benefits of
adopting the WTO accession package will only be realized if the laws are properly and
forcefully enforced.
43.
The staff commends the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability
that has helped Cambodia to achieve robust growth in the recent past. Fiscal policy will
need to continue to play a central role, and for this, it will be important to enhance revenue
and strengthen expenditure control in the period ahead.

- 26 -

44.
Attaining the government’s medium-term fiscal objectives hinges critically on
the success of additional revenue mobilization. To meet the 2004 revenue target, additional
tax policy measures equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP (inclusive of measures announced last
December) will be needed in the second half of this year. Over the medium term, attaining
the NPRS targets of higher social spending and rural infrastructure development will require
a serious commitment by the government to improve revenue collection, through both
additional tax policy measures and strengthening tax and customs administration. In this
respect, computerization in the revenue departments and the passage of the Law on Customs
will be crucial to strengthen enforcement capabilities.
45.
The agenda for fiscal management reform is large. The establishment of the MEF
reform committee promises a new opportunity to promote ownership and internalization of
technical assistance. On awarding contracts, the staff recommends that the National Audit
Authority audit the operations of existing contract holders with significant fiscal implications
to verify compliance with the terms of the contracts. The audit reports should be made
available to the public.
46.
To improve the effectiveness of the government, overhauling the civil service and
its wage structure is essential. Early completion of the ongoing studies, which have been
substantially delayed, will be critical to prepare a comprehensive civil service reform strategy
in consultation with the World Bank.
47.
The staff supports the central bank’s policy of intervening in the foreign
exchange market to stabilize excessive fluctuations of the exchange rate. Mindful that the
exchange rate policy does not have much impact on improving competitiveness, the staff
suggests maintaining a broadly stable exchange rate, barring fundamental changes in market
conditions.
48.
The staff agrees with the NBC that Cambodia would benefit from de-dollarizing
the economy in the long run. De-dollarization initiatives, such as requiring that all
government transactions be conducted in domestic currency and issuing a larger
denomination note, could be considered. But forceful and abrupt administrative measures or
political uncertainty could immediately translate into capital flight.
49.
Strengthening the legal infrastructure is key to promoting sound financial
intermediation of banks. The staff looks forward to an early passage of the Negotiable
Instruments and Payment Transactions Law, the Secured Transaction Law, the Insolvency
Law, and the Securities and Exchange Law, all of which are needed to reduce payment
system risks and to ensure a legal basis for collateral-based lending. Early completion of the
implementation of the new chart of accounts and the accounting law will provide banks better
information on potential borrowers.
50.
Failure to push the reform agenda forward, especially measures to improve the
business environment and accelerate agricultural reforms, will jeopardize attaining the

- 27 -

NPRS targets. In particular, governance related reforms, especially that of the judiciary, will
require a strong political commitment. Further delays could lead to reduced donor financing
and threaten fiscal sustainability.
51.
The staff welcomes continued dialogue with the United States and the Russian
Federation to seek ways to complete the debt rescheduling negotiation, and looks
forward to an early completion.
52.
Cambodia’s statistical framework is being upgraded but substantial weaknesses
remain. In the coming years, there is a need to rely more on domestic resources and training
to strengthen technical capacities. If donor financing is lacking, this may require a shift of
resources within the current budget.
53.
The mission welcomes progress made in the preparation of a new comprehensive
anti-money laundering law and looks forward to its adoption.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguard assessment policy, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is subject
to a full safeguard assessment with respect to a possible successor PRGF Arrangement. The
assessment was completed on March 24, 2004 and specific measures were proposed to address a
few weaknesses.

- 39 -

VIII.

ANNEX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since November 8, 1992 the exchange rate arrangement for the riel has consisted of the following
two rates. First, the official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all
official external transactions conducted by the government and state enterprises. Second, the
market rate, which is determined by the foreign exchange market, applies to all other transactions.
The official exchange rate is adjusted so as to limit the spread between the official rate and the
market rate to no more than 1 percent on a daily basis. On July 25, 2004, the official exchange
rate was CR 4,024 per U.S. dollar and the market rate CR 4,038 per U.S. dollar. Cambodia
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002. Cambodia
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Cambodia is subject to the provisions on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The
Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on February 20, 2003.
X.

Technical Assistance:

Following discussions between the Government, the IMF, UNDP, and other interested multilateral
and bilateral donors, a comprehensive Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP) was adopted in
May 2001. The TCAP arrangement ended in mid-2004, following a six-month extension. Fund’s
technical assistance to Cambodia remains intensive, but will be gradually phased out (Annex VI).
A resident Treasury Advisor was assigned in June 2004 for a period of 6 months. An FAD review
mission will take place in October 2004 to review overall progress with revenue administration
reforms and assist the authorities in defining the overall framework for future reforms in this area.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office was closed in October 1997, but it was re-opened at endOctober 1999. Mr. Hagemann is currently the Resident Representative.

ANNEX II

Cambodia: Debt Sustainability
1.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, Cambodia’s debt is expected to be
sustainable.1 The baseline scenario assumes sustained real GDP growth of 6 percent, export
growth of 9 percent, and broadly stable foreign aid in nominal U.S. dollars. On the fiscal
front, budgetary consolidation is expected to begin with the 2004 budget, which would
require discretionary tax revenue measures and improvements in tax and customs
administration.
A. The Current Situation
2.
Cambodia’s total external public debt was $3.0 billion (71 percent of GDP) at
end-2003, of which $1.9 billion was owed to the United States and the Russian
Federation. Other external debts were owed largely to multilateral creditors on highly
concessional terms. Domestic public debt, all denominated in local currency, accounted for
about 5 percent of GDP.
3.
Restructuring Cambodia’s debts to the United States and the Russian
Federation in highly concessional terms, which together account for 64 percent of total
external debt, is critical for securing debt sustainability. The baseline scenario assumes
that agreement is reached with the U.S. by mid-2004 on comparable terms to the 1995 Paris
Club agreement (i.e., flow rescheduling on Naples terms). It assumes a 40-year maturity, a
16-year grace period, and an interest rate of 3 percent. Similar terms are assumed on the debt
owed to the Russian Federation, after an initial upfront discount of 70 percent. The
restructured debt would amount to $1.7 billion at the end of 2004. The total stock of
outstanding debt at the end of 2004 would amount to $2.1 billion (46 percent of GDP), or
29 percent of GDP in net present value (NPV) terms.
B. Public Debt Sustainability
4.
Cambodia’s stock of public debt is projected to decline after an initial increase
from 34 percent of GDP in 2004 to 35 percent of GDP in 2006 in NPV terms. In the
baseline scenario, total public sector debt in NPV terms is expected to fall to 16 percent by
2023 if the primary deficit is kept to about 2½ percent of GDP over the medium term and to
about 3 percent of GDP in the longer run. The NPV of the debt-to-revenue ratio at
237 percent in 2004 is high, reflecting the weak revenue base. Hence, failure to improve
revenue collection steadily over time would undermine public debt sustainability.

1

Standard Fund templates for low income countries and sensitivity tests are used to assess
Cambodia’s debt dynamics. Tests involve applying temporary deviations of key variables
from the baseline with magnitudes based largely on historical deviations.

- 41 -

ANNEX II

5.
Sensitivity tests suggest that the debt dynamics are vulnerable to a real
depreciation, to debt-creating flows in the medium term, and to lower GDP growth in
the long term. A one-time 30 percent real depreciation in 2004 (test B5) would increase the
NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratio from 34 percent of GDP in the baseline to over 50 percent of
GDP, and the NPV of the debt-to-revenue ratio to more than 300 percent in the medium term.
A 10 percent of GDP increase in debt-creating flows in the first projected year (test B6), such
as might arise from an unexpected realization of contingent liabilities, would increase the
NPV of the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios to 40 percent and 270 percent,
respectively. If the real GDP growth rate were to fall by two standard deviations from its
recent average (test B4), which corresponds broadly to the difference between the GDP
growth shown in the non-adjustment scenario and the baseline presented in the main text (see
paragraph 14), the NPV of the debt-to-revenue ratio would reach about 240 percent in the
medium term.
C. External Debt Sustainability
6.
In the baseline scenario, all debt indicators are projected to improve over time.
The NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to fall below 20 percent, the NPV of the
debt-to-exports ratios to fall below 30 percent and the debt service-to-exports ratio would
decline to below 2 percent in the long run.
7.
The debt dynamics are most vulnerable to a real depreciation and export
decline. A one-time 30 percent real depreciation would push up the NPV of the debt-to-GDP
ratio to about 45 percent in the near term. A one-time two standard deviation shock in
exports, which is about twice as large as the shock assumed in the non-adjustment scenario in
the main text, would raise the debt service-to-exports ratio to 4.8 percent compared with
3.4 percent in the baseline scenario, and the NPV of the debt-to-exports ratio would rise to
91 percent compared with 58 percent in the baseline scenario in 2013. Even then, these ratios
are not high enough to threaten external viability.
D. Conclusion
8.
The key vulnerability in Cambodia’s debt dynamics is its weak fiscal revenue
base. While the nominal stock of debt and service payments are modest relative to GDP, the
revenue base, currently at 11 percent of GDP, may pose difficulties in servicing debt. A
one-time real depreciation is also a source of risk as it increases the size of the stock of debt
relative to GDP and fiscal revenue.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value. The restructured debts are excluded in 2002 and 2003.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 5 years.
7/ Debt-services before 2003 are cash basis.
8/ Debt forgiveness in 2004 is excluded.
9/ Excluding garment-related imports and re-exportable imports

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ANNEX III

Cambodia: World Bank Policy Dialogue and Its Relation with the IMF1
The World Bank’s policy dialogue in Cambodia covers public financial management, private
sector development, legal and judicial reform, military demobilization, the national poverty
reduction strategy, rural development, decentralization, the national transportation strategy,
governance and anti-corruption, and forestry management. The pace of the Bank’s dialogue
has been affected by delays in forming a government since the July 2003 elections.
National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS)
Following completion of the NPRS in December 2002, the JSA was presented to the Board in
February 2003, and highlights a number of strengths and challenges/weaknesses, some of
which the government, with the Bank support, has worked to address. The Bank provided
technical assistance (TA) and financial support to the General Secretariat of the Council for
Social Development (GSCSD) in the Ministry of Planning (MoP) under an IDF grant, and has
also mobilized a multi-donor trust fund to continue this support and supported the wide
dissemination of the NPRS at local levels. The TA has focused on coordinating inputs from
donors and government on the annual progress report (APR) for the NPRS, and specifically
on updating the policy action matrix and integrating the NPRS and the Cambodian Millenium
Development Goals (CMDG) indicators into one monitoring framework. The WB/IMF have
consolidated comments on two drafts of the APR to the government and prepared a joint JSA.
The Bank is assisting in the design of the NPRS architecture, a roadmap for implementing the
NPRS and developing the government’s next five year strategy (2006-2010). As part of this
process, the Bank has been convening informal donor meetings to discuss the restructuring of
the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) and planning an inclusive participatory process for
producing the National Poverty Assessment (NPA) 2005, which will combine the results
(Poverty Profile) of the current Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) (which the Bank
is supporting along with UNDP and SIDA), as well as participatory, qualitative poverty
assessments currently being undertaken by ADB and WB. The NPA will aim to ensure broadbased buy-in from all stakeholders and form the analytical basis for the next five year plan.
The NPRS process has been challenging from the start, and most recently due to delayed
formation of the government. In addition, there has been confusion as to the respective roles
of MOP and MEF in the NPRS process. As a result the Bank has not been able to proceed
with a formal dialogue regarding the NPRS architecture and the National Poverty Assessment,
but these will be taken up with the new government.
Other Poverty and Gender Initiatives. The Bank is coordinating a multi-stakeholder PSIA
on Social Land Concessions as key policy reform issue, and is preparing a Land Allocation for
Social and Economic Development project. The Bank has recently completed a Country
Gender Assessment (in collaboration with ADB/UNDP/UNIFEM). The Bank has provided an

ANNEX III

IDF grant to the Ministry of Women’s and Veterans’ Affairs (MoWVA) for building capacity
for gender policy analysis and gender budgeting.
Public Financial Management. The Government and some partners have worked to
prioritize reforms to the public expenditure and financial management system following
Technical Cooperation Assistance Program (TCAP) and the joint WB-ADB Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review, 2003 (IFAPER). A joint effort of ten
of Cambodia’s development partners committed in January 2004 to assist in strengthening the
Government’s ability to lead and implement this agenda and to provide fully coordinated
support via a sector wide approach (SWAp). The collaborative approach is supported by the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) secretariat, as envisioned in the
recent Bank-Fund board paper.2 It is expected that the Government will develop a prioritized,
sequenced, and costed annual PFM work program (on a rolling basis) over the new few
months with implementation starting in August 2004 or so.
The IFAPER, which is the basis for the Bank’s engagement in this sector, found that though
Cambodia has made significant headway in reforming public expenditure policy and
management, it will have to make much more progress on three principal fiscal, fiduciary, and
institutional challenges in order to implement its development agenda. Indeed, in comparative
perspective, Cambodia’s PFM system ranks below average (as compared to the low income
countries assessed by a joint World Bank-IMF diagnostic tool), indicating the need for
substantial upgrading. (move this paragraph first).
Civil Service Reform. The IFAPER found serious problems afflicting the civil service—low
pay, pay compression, low skills, and thus low capacity. Low public sector wages provide a
breeding ground for corrupt practices and low pay is a leading cause of Cambodia’s relatively
poor standing on public sector performance. The World Bank’s CPIA ranks Cambodia in the
fourth lowest quintile among fellow low income countries on issues pertaining to public
sector management and institutions. Though the Government has recently made some
progress, including an increase in average remuneration in 2002, carrying out of a civil service
census, and the development of an automated payroll system, much more is required. In some
of these areas, such as workforce control, key measures such as the introduction of an
establishment register will allow the Government to build productively on its previous
successes, while in other areas, notably pay and employment policy, the Government will be
challenged to push itself farther and faster than currently envisioned. Decompression of
salaries coupled with average salary increases is a key element of the Government’s reform
program.
The Bank has provided the Government with a significant amount of grant funding to carry
out an agreed set of studies that would provide the analytical groundwork for reform. These
studies cover: (i) labor market pay comparator analysis, (ii) pay and employment sustainability
2

ANNEX III

analysis, (iii) reallocation and retrenchment analysis, (iv) development of a functional analysis
methodology and its application to select ministries, and (v) preparation of an establishment
register. Work on the studies has only recently commenced and is thus far behind schedule.
Private Sector Development. While there is broad appreciation for efforts to improve the
foreign investment regime, develop a pro-poor trade strategy, and create a Private Sector
Forum to facilitate a reform dialogue with the private sector, the Government needs to place a
higher priority on structural reforms to support sustainable, private-led growth. The Bank,
working with the MPDF, IFC and PPIAF, has provided an input to the Government's Private
Sector Development Strategy through an Investment Climate Assessment and Value Chain
Analysis. The objective of this effort is three-fold: to remove impediments to productivity
growth, to help diversify the economy, and to increase the role of the private sector in service
delivery. The findings of the work to date have identified overlapping trade facilitation,
inspection, and licensing processes of various agencies as contributing to an excessive
regulatory burden and a high incidence of corruption associated with the Cambodian
investment climate. In light of these findings, the Bank is focusing its efforts on
operationalizing the reform recommendations through a potential SWAp on private sector
development. Initial focus areas for the SWAp are trade facilitation, inspection mandates,
reform of PPI governance arrangements, and value chain development.
Legal and Judicial Reform, Governance, and Anti-Corruption. With support from the
Bank, the Government devised a Legal and Judicial Reform (LJR) Strategy in 2002 that was
formally adopted in June 2003 and published an ambitious draft Plan of Action. This plan was
then the subject of a Government-sponsored National LJR Workshop in December 2003.
Various follow-up working groups have proposed action plan interventions that are now being
prioritized with a view to fixing a sequenced work program for the remainder of 2004 and
beyond with emphasis on: (a) access to legal and judicial services and the collection and
dissemination of relevant legal and judicial information; (b) empowering the market economy
and legal and judicial reforms in support of private sector development; and (c) the creation
and support of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
Both external and internal perception-based surveys indicate high levels of corruption in
Cambodia. The 2001 Governance Action Plan (GAP) was seen as a road map to guide a
comprehensive reform of governance in Cambodia. The GAP covered five cross-cutting
issues: legal and judiciary system, public administration, decentralization and deconcentration,
public finance, anti-corruption and gender issues, and two sectoral areas of special focus,
armed services reform and natural resource management (land, forestry and fisheries). The
NPRS notes that the GAP was a comprehensive and ambitious program and that “controlling
and eliminating corrupt practices is a long term and difficult process.” While some ground
work has been done in many areas, it has not as yet amounted to significant action that shifts
the incentives in a way that discourages corrupt behavior.
The Bank’s new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) will focus on four key cross-cutting areas
that have strong linkages to a governance agenda: (i) improved public financial management
and public administration reform, (ii) private sector development, (iii) improved local

-51 -

ANNEX III

governance and accountability, and (iv) improved access of the poor to productive assets. To
be included in the Bank’s assistance program, interventions will need to support reforms and
results in at least one of these four areas.
Military Demobilization. The first phase of the full-scale demobilization program was
completed early 2003 with the distribution of the reintegration packages to 15,000
demobilized soldiers. At the same time, the second phase was postponed for various reasons
including the proximity of elections, and an investigation by Bank's Institutional Integrity
Unit. In June 2003, the Bank declared misprocurement on a contract for $6.9 million resulting
in the cancellation of $6.3 million from the IDA credit, and a further $0.6 million from a
Dutch Grant. A total of almost $2.8 million dollars is required to be repaid by the government
to the Special Account. The Government has postponed the next phase of the Demobilization
program since early 2003. Discussions on the future of the program will take place once the
new government has been formed. If a decision is made to continue with the program, and
with the IDA funding, several outstanding areas of concern including the inflated payroll lists,
and the project design, will need to be addressed.
Transportation Sector Strategy. Despite significant diagnostic work and investment in
reconstruction and development of infrastructure, transport remains a constraint to overall as
well as equitable growth. There is no agreed transport sector strategy and Cambodia's
management of its considerable transport assets remains poor. The transport sector strategy
note, originally developed with the ADB’s support, is currently being updated with Bank
support and will take stock of the current state of the sector, including the Government's views
and priorities, the areas of engagement of other donors, the views of transport users,
consultant assessments and the like. The resulting note will serve as input to the joint CAS
process, suggest possible avenues for Bank and other donor engagement in the sector over the
next 3 to 5 years. This informal note will be completed before the end of the current FY.
World Bank-IMF Collaboration
Bank-Fund collaboration in Cambodia takes place at two levels: (i) through the policy-based
lending program; and (ii) through analytical and advisory services. It is expected that there
will be close coordination between the Fund’s upcoming PRGF program and the Bank’s
proposed PRSC. The first PRSC is likely to focus on public financial management and private
sector development (and subsequent PRSCs would broaden the coverage to priority sectors). It
is expected that the Bank and Fund will work under streamlined conditionality arrangements.
Lending operations and non-lending instruments are described in the following tables. The
Bank’s current portfolio grew from 10 to 18 credits over the previous CAS period, rising from
US$245 million to $364 million, supporting a sectorally and geographically diverse set of
projects. Disbursement levels have been above the average for the region. The new CAS is
expected to go to the Board in January 2005.

ANNEX IV

Cambodia: Relations with the Asian Development Bank
From 1992 through June 2004, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved $773.6 million in low-interest
loans to Cambodia to finance 26 projects and 5 structural reform programs. To date 10 projects, for a total of
$256.0 million, have been completed: (i) the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project [approved in 1992];
(ii) Power Rehabilitation Project [approved in 1994]; (iii) Agriculture Sector Program [approved in 1996];
(iv) Basic Skills Project [approved in 1995]; (v) Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project [approved in 1995];
(vi) Basic Education Text Book Project (approved in 1996); (vii) Basic Health Services Project [approved in
1996]; (viii) Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage Project [approved in 1996]; (ix) Siem Reap Airport
Project (approved in 1996); and (x) Financial Sector Program, Subprogram I [approved in 2001]. Of the
remaining loan projects, $251.8 million were for economic infrastructure, $107.0 million for social infrastructure,
and $118.81 million for agriculture and rural infrastructure, and $40 million for finance and governance.
During the same period, the AsDB also designed and administered 113 technical assistance projects amounting to
$73.5 million. They were financed through grants from the AsDB ($27.4 million), the Japanese Special Fund
($32.8 million), and other sources ($13.3 million). In 2003, the AsDB approved five national loans: Agriculture
Sector Development Program; Agriculture Sector Development Project; Northwest Irrigation Project; GMS
Power Transmission; and Provincial Towns Improvement (Supplement).
The AsDB's draft Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2005-2009 has been developed in close collaboration
with the World Bank and DFID and senior government officials at technical level. The draft CSP will focus on
pro-poor sustainable growth, social development, and good governance. The AsDB will foster broad-based
economic growth through investments in physical infrastructure, support for greater regional integration,
sustainable development of small and medium-scale enterprises and investments in agriculture. It aims to
improve the welfare and reduce vulnerability of the poor through increasing their access to physical assets, land,
human capital and services. It's work on governance will concentrate on directly supporting improvements in
public financial management, decentralization and deconcentration initiatives, and improving public service
delivery. These will be accomplished through AsDB’s program of assistance in the following four priority
sectors: (i) agriculture and water resources; (ii) education; (iii) finance; and (iv) transport. The draft CSP has its
geographical focus in the Tonle Sap Basin.

ANNEX V

Cambodia—Statistical Issues
Extensive technical assistance from the Fund, the UNDP, the AsDB, and the World Bank has
contributed to substantial improvements in macroeconomic statistics. Since October 2001, a
long-term IMF advisor was placed in the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) to assist the
authorities in upgrading economic and financial statistics. An expanded edition of the
statistical yearbook was published in September 2003. An IFS page for Cambodia has been
published since April 1996. In March 2002 Cambodia began participation in the Fund’s
General Data Dissemination System, and Cambodia’s metadata were posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, core
data are generally adequate for program design and monitoring and are provided on a timely
basis.
National accounts. Official GDP estimates are provided annually under peripatetic expert
support from the AsDB. Revised national accounts series for 1993–2002 were officially
released in July 2003. The quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of
comprehensive and reliable sectoral information. A National Accounts Concepts, Sources and
Methods Manual was finalized and submitted for publication.
Prices. The NIS provides a monthly CPI with a five-week lag. NIS has recently updated the
CPI for Phnom Penh with new expenditure weights (July–December, 2000 = 100). In
addition, the NIS has compiled a quarterly urban CPI for five major provincial cities and
Phnom Penh since July 2000. An ongoing project, financed by the AsDB and supported by
STA, is developing a quarterly producer price index commencing in December 2003.
Government finance statistics. The Ministry of Economy and Finance provides monthly
fiscal data broadly based on GFS standards on a timely basis with a four-week lag. There are
still weaknesses regarding the reliability of data sources, the coverage and the economic and
functional classifications of expenditure. Donor-specific data on investments financed by
project are available only with considerable lags. Further improvements will require an
increase in human resources devoted to government finance statistics compilation and will
depend heavily on the ongoing measures to improve expenditure management, including a
revision of public accounting.
The authorities have provided monthly fiscal data for publication in IFS since 2001. The last
reported data are for December 2002.
Monetary statistics. The NBC provides data on the monetary authorities and deposit money
banks on a monthly basis with a four-week lag. An IMF mission in April 2002 assisted the
authorities in strengthening the framework for compiling monetary statistics. In addition to the
accounts of the monetary authorities and deposit money banks, the NBC also compiles the
sectoral balance sheet for central bank and a central bank survey. It plans to compile a
depository corporations survey in accordance with the methodology recommended in the
IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual after all banks have fully implemented the
uniform chart of accounts.

- 56 -

ANNEX V

External sector statistics. The NBC is responsible for compiling balance of payments
statistics. Customs data have substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the
nonrecording of nondutiable imports, under reporting of re-exports, and the weakness of
customs controls. While there have been improvements in the quality of foreign direct
investment data, private capital flows are believed to be large and not fully captured by
official data. A range of international transactions by enterprises, such as payments for
imported services, income payments, and portfolio investment abroad are not included in the
data. Data on external debt are provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but timely
information on disbursements by bilateral donors is weak. In January 2003, the authorities
implemented an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) to collect data on
international transactions via the banking system to improve balance of payments estimates. A
balance of payments mission in March–May 2004 reviewed source data used for compiling
the balance of payments and recommended improvements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Cambodia
On September, 13, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cambodia.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance in the past few years was generally good, reflecting both
favorable external developments and prudent fiscal policy. Annual real GDP growth averaged
6-7 percent. With the advent of political stability in 1999, private sector activities flourished in
urban areas. Exports soared following a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S., and large aid
inflows helped finance domestic investment and spurred construction activities. Prudent fiscal
policy, including strengthened tax and customs administration, has also been key to ensuring
price stability.
These favorable developments, however, have masked underlying structural weaknesses.
Competitiveness has deteriorated on account of poor governance—in part due to lack of
progress in legal and judicial reform—which exacerbated uncertainty in the business
environment, while rudimentary infrastructure and high wages have kept operating costs high.
Government capacity remains severely constrained by lack of human capital and entrenched
governance problems. At the same time agricultural development has stagnated due to limited
access to arable land and markets. Slow growth in agriculture, a sector where most of the poor
make their living, has pushed Cambodia further away from meeting the Millenium
Development Goals (MDGs).
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities and this PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board.

-2-

In 2003, non-agricultural growth slowed due to the SARS-related drop in tourism and electionrelated uncertainties. Overall GDP growth, however, was robust mainly because of a strong
rebound in agricultural production following a reduced harvest the previous year. Prices
remained stable reflecting low trading partner inflation and prudent fiscal policy, although some
of the earlier gains in fiscal revenue collection were lost in the election year, severely
constraining priority spending.
The pace of reforms stalled in the run-up and aftermath of the July 2003 elections.
The government has recently produced an action plan to implement its strategy for legal and
judicial reform, but not much has been done from this reform agenda in the last 10 years.
Reform of the Treasury slowed in 2003: about two thirds of line ministries still do not provide
timely reports of their transactions to the Treasury, and there was yet another late-year
bunching of spending commitments. The 2004 budget law, along with a range of legislation
needed to complete WTO accession still await parliament approval.
Growth is expected to slow in 2004-2005. While tourism is rebounding, agricultural growth is
expected to be lower than the exceptionally high growth rate of the previous year. A further
slowdown, possibly to below 2 percent GDP growth, is expected as Cambodia will be exposed
to direct competition from China following the elimination of the garment quota system in
January 2005. It will take some time before Cambodia’s exports could recover, even with
accelerated reform implementation given the higher input costs and governance problems.
The Ex-Post Assessment of performance under previous Fund-supported programs noted that
macroeconomic developments were generally good, but growth remained volatile and narrowly
based. There was little progress in alleviating poverty and progress in improving governance,
civil service reform, and demobilization was slow. As such, while quantitative targets presented
no problems, compliance of structural conditionality under the Fund programs was mixed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Cambodia has made progress in rebuilding its economy from
the ruins of the decades-long civil strife. They commended the authorities for the generally
good macroeconomic performance of the past few years, which reflects prudent fiscal policy
as well as favorable external developments. However, they expressed concern that growth has
been narrowly based and poverty has not fallen. Accordingly, Directors emphasized the
importance of increasing the pace of reforms, and in particular, addressing governance issues,
strengthening the legal and judicial system, and nurturing the agricultural sector. They saw
these reforms as essential to encouraging investment, growth, and product diversification.
They noted that these measures are all the more important in view of the difficulties Cambodia
will face in competing in the garment sector after the elimination of the quota system in
early 2005.
Directors welcomed the government’s continued commitment to poverty reduction as
discussed in the first annual progress report of Cambodia’s National Poverty Reduction
Strategy (NPRS) Paper. They noted with concern that the reform process has been largely put

-3on hold during the post-election political impasse and looked forward to rapid progress to
achieve the poverty reduction targets established in the NPRS. They cautioned that further
delays could reduce donor assistance and threaten fiscal sustainability. They acknowledged
that these reforms will require strong political commitments, and in this regard, welcomed the
new government’s emphasis on these priorities.
Directors urged the government to attach high priority to agricultural and land reform, which
they saw as an effective and direct way to address poverty since most of the poor live in rural
areas. To improve land use, they advised auditing already-awarded economic concessions,
reviewing the transfers of ownership of de-mined and de-forested land, and speeding up land
registration for rural farmers. Policies should be implemented to enhance land tenure security
and eradicate illegal settlement and grubbing. They encouraged the government to review,
together with donors, the current allocation of foreign aid flows, with a view to refocusing it on
agricultural development.
Directors observed that Cambodia needs to intensify efforts to attract foreign investment in
order to promote diversified growth. While recognizing that significantly improving
infrastructure and human capital and establishing a sound regulatory environment can only be
achieved in the long run, they suggested that there is considerable scope for improving the
business climate in the short run by cutting cumbersome red tape and high informal fees, and
by allowing greater wage flexibility.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate judicial reform to address governance problems
that are deeply rooted in all aspects of economic activities. They looked forward to the
adoption of the Anti-Corruption Law and the Law on the Status of Judges and Prosecutors,
which will strengthen the independence of the judiciary, and to the establishment of a
commercial court. Directors welcomed ratification by the National Assembly of Cambodia’s
entry to the WTO, and the impetus it will give to putting in place a legal framework for a market
economy.
Directors emphasized the critical importance of strengthening revenue mobilization in order to
attain the government’s medium-term fiscal objectives. They urged the government to take
additional tax policy measures and further strengthen tax and customs administration to meet
the 2004 revenue and medium-term NPRS targets. In this respect, they noted the crucial
importance of broadening the tax base by reducing exemptions, and to strengthening
enforcement by computerizing the revenue departments and passing the Law on Customs.
They noted the potential contribution of good management of natural resources to the revenue
base.
Directors agreed that another key component of fiscal reform is improving public expenditure
management. They pointed to the establishment of the Ministry of Economy and Finance
reform committee as promoting ownership and internalization of technical assistance.
They recommended that the National Audit Authority audit the operations of existing
fiscally-important contract holders to verify compliance with the terms of the contracts, and
making the audit reports public.

-4Directors recommended overhauling the civil service and its wage structure to improve
government effectiveness. They called for an early completion of the ongoing but substantially
delayed studies on civil service reform as a critical step in preparing a comprehensive reform
strategy, in consultation with the World Bank.
Most Directors supported the National Bank of Cambodia’s policy of intervening in the foreign
exchange market to stabilize excessive fluctuations of the exchange rate. In view of the highly
dollarized economy, they noted the limitation of exchange rate policy in affecting
competitiveness. They therefore suggested maintaining a broadly stable exchange rate
relative to the U.S. dollar, barring fundamental changes in market conditions.
Directors agreed that Cambodia would benefit from de-dollarizing the economy over time, and
saw greater use of the national currency as facilitating the reorientation of monetary policy to
controlling inflation and the use of indirect monetary control instruments. They suggested that
de-dollarization initiatives, such as requiring that all government transactions be conducted in
domestic currency and issuing a larger denomination note, should be considered, but
cautioned that forceful and abrupt administrative de-dollarization measures or political
uncertainty could immediately translate into capital flight.
Directors highlighted the key importance of further strengthening financial supervision.
They welcomed the progress made in this area and looked forward to early passage of laws to
facilitate sound intermediation of banks, reduce payment system risks, and ensure a legal
basis for collateral-based lending, among other initiatives. Directors welcomed progress made
in the preparation of a new comprehensive anti-money laundering law and looked forward to
its adoption.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to pursue prudent debt management policies
in order to ensure fiscal sustainability. They welcomed continued dialogue with the United
States and the Russian Federation to seek ways to complete debt rescheduling negotiations,
and looked forward to their early completion. The importance of resolving these negotiations
satisfactorily to ensuring continued access to Fund financing was noted.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Cambodia’s performance under Fund
arrangements since the early 1990s, and agreed that Fund involvement has been effective in
maintaining macroeconomic stability. They noted, however, that despite important progress
achieved in many areas, poverty remains pervasive and governance problems widespread.
Looking ahead, Directors considered that a new arrangement with the Fund would help
strengthen Cambodia’s official international reserve position, contain possible adverse effects
from the forthcoming elimination of the garment quota, underpin a framework for donor
coordination, and encourage domestic reform efforts. Directors stressed that sound policies by
the authorities would also be needed to catalyze international support for Cambodia’s poverty
reduction strategy.
In view of substantial weaknesses in Cambodia’s statistical framework, Directors welcomed
the work to upgrade it, and saw, in the coming years, a need to rely more on domestic

-5resources and training to strengthen technical capacities. They observed that if donor
financing is lacking, this may require a shift of resources within the current budget.

IMF Executive Board Reviews Progress Report on Cambodia's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on September 13, 2004 reviewed
the Annual Progress Report on Cambodia’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) and
welcomed Cambodia’s NPRS.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion based on the Joint Staff Assessment of
Cambodia's Annual Progress Report, which was prepared jointly by the staffs of the IMF and the
World Bank, Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Cambodia has come a long way in rebuilding its economy from the ruins of the decades-long
civil strife. Macroeconomic performance of the past few years reflects prudent fiscal policy as
well as favorable external developments. However, growth has been narrowly based and poverty
has not fallen. It is therefore important to press ahead with efforts to broaden the base of
economic activity and reduce poverty by increasing the pace of reforms, and in particular,
nurturing the agricultural sector, and strengthening the legal and judicial system. These measures
are all the more important in view of the difficulties Cambodia will face in competing in the
garment sector after the elimination of the quota system in early 2005.
“The government is committed to poverty reduction as discussed in the first annual progress
report of Cambodia’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) Paper, which provides a
sound basis for continued access to Fund concessional financial assistance. To achieve this goal,
Cambodia needs to intensify efforts to attract foreign investment in order to promote diversified
growth. There is considerable scope for improving the business climate in the short run by
cutting cumbersome red tape and high informal fees, and by allowing greater wage flexibility.
“The authorities also need to accelerate judicial reform to address governance problems that are

“Strengthening revenue mobilization is critical in order to attain the government’s medium-term
fiscal objectives. The government will need to take additional tax policy measures and strengthen
tax and customs administration to meet the 2004 revenue and medium-term NPRS targets.

Another key component of fiscal reform is improving public expenditure management and
reforming the civil service.
“The opportunity to review Cambodia’s performance under Fund arrangements since the early

maintain macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, poverty remains pervasive and governance
problems widespread. A new arrangement with the Fund could help strengthen Cambodia’s

efforts,” Mr. Carstens said.

Statement by Ismail Bin Alowi, Alternate Executive Director for Cambodia
and Tirta Segara, Advisor to Executive Director
September 13, 2004
Introduction
On behalf of our Cambodian authorities, we would like to express their appreciation
to the staff, management and the Executive Board as well as other development partners and
the donor community for their advice and continued support. The authorities would also like
to express their appreciation for a balanced Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV, and
constructive advice. On the Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement
paper, the authorities find the paper useful and provides a balanced and comprehensive
review of the Cambodia’s achievement during the Fund supported programs.
Continued sound macroeconomic policies, supported by financial and technical
assistance from the international community have contributed to macroeconomic stability
and important progress in building central institutions of macroeconomic management,
restructuring the financial sector and integrating Cambodia into the world economy. Despite
these improvements, Cambodia’s economy still faces several challenges. Poverty remains
pervasive as the economic growth remains narrowly based and volatile. Growth in the
agricultural sector has been slow. While some progress has been made in structural reforms,
structural weaknesses remain. In view of these challenges, the Cambodian authorities would
like to reiterate their continued commitment to sound macroeconomic management and
reform agenda, consistent with the objective of NPRS and SEDP.
The authorities strongly believe that Cambodia has no other better choice than
strongly implementing comprehensive reform. The formation of new administration in July
2004 within a peaceful and stable environment has provided the authorities with a renewed
opportunity to push forward their reform agenda in order to achieve the National Poverty
Reduction Strategy (NPRS) targets, aiming at promoting strong growth and reducing
poverty. In this regard, the new administration has announced and outlined its “Rectangular
Strategy” as an effective policy tool for the Royal Government to implement the NPRS. The
Rectangular Strategy focuses on (i) the promotion of economic growth (ii) the generation of
employment (iii) the implementation of the Governance Action Plan and thereby ensuring
equity and social justice and (iv) enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the Royal
Government in implementing the reform programs.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects for 2004
A combination of prudent macroeconomic policies and favorable external
developments contributed to Cambodia’s favorable macroeconomic performance in the past
few years. During 1999 - 2002 real GDP grew by 6.7 percent per annum. The Cambodian
authorities are aware that such a robust growth was narrowly based, driven mainly by the
garments, tourism, and construction sectors. In 2003, growth remained strong at 5.2%,

-2-

reflecting a strong rebound in agricultural production, thanks to favorable weather condition.
The impacts of SARS on tourism was less severe than expected, with a sharp rebound in
tourist arrivals toward the end of 2003. For 2004, the authorities are more sanguine than staff
on economic prospects in view of strong recovery in tourism and strong performance in the
garment industry. The agricultural sector is also expected to record a strong growth as the
authorities believe that the Avian flu has smaller impact than projected by staff.
The inflation rates during the past few years remained low, reflecting continued
prudent monetary and fiscal policy. In 2003, based on 12-month average, the inflation rate
was only 1.2 percent. Meanwhile, the year-on-year inflation rate in December 2003 was only
0.5 percent. The absence of supply shock combined with cheaper imports from neighboring
countries have also contributed to the subdued inflation. For 2004, inflation is expected to
rise slightly in line with price developments in trading partners countries. External position
has improved with gross official reserves increasing steadily to US$ 737 million at the end of
2003, sufficient to cover 3 months of imports of goods and services.
Fiscal Policy
Recognizing the importance of and the key role played by fiscal policy in achieving
macroeconomic stability in a highly dollarized economy, the Cambodian authorities have
continued to pursue a prudent fiscal policy and to implement the necessary fiscal reforms to
ensure a favorable macroeconomic and financial environment as a foundation for sustainable
growth, including the adequacy of the budget to meet the NPRS targets. During the past few
years, several structural measures have been implemented to strengthen tax and customs
administration, including broadening the tax base and preventing leakages. As a result, the
overall fiscal performance was significantly improved as government revenue increased
steadily to 11.2 percent of GDP in 2002. While the revenue collection in 2003 declined,
partly reflecting delayed payment of taxes, the revenue target for fiscal year 2004 has been
set at 11.9 percent of GDP. In this respect, the current budget surplus is expected to increase
to 1.2 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2003. To meet the
revenue target for 2004, the government will continue to implement vigorously fiscal
measures, focusing in particular on the collection of tax arrears, further the improvement of
tax and customs administration. In addition, the authorities will be more cautious in awarding
government contracts to private sector.
On the expenditure side, the government has exercised prudence, putting in place
significant expenditure restraints in order to provide scope for priority spending and budget
reallocation. Budget management had been streamlined through reallocation of spending to
the social and economic sector. In line with its commitment to a pro-poor fiscal policy, the
Cambodian government carried out military demobilization to divert more resources from
defense and security to the social sector. In this connection, defense and security spending is
expected to decline from 3.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2004, while
social sector spending is budgeted to increase from 1.8 percent to 3.8 percent of GDP over
the same period. Administrative procedures and public sector governance would also be
enhanced to ensure that social sector spending targets are achieved. Moreover, to further

-3-

strengthen budget management, the government accounts have been centralized at the
National Treasury.
With regard to the external debt, the Cambodian authorities have continued their
efforts in seeking resolution to its outstanding debts with bilateral creditors, in particular,
with the United States and the Russian Federation
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Financial Sector Reform
Monetary restraint and the NBC’s foreign exchange intervention policy, supported by
prudent fiscal policy and lower imported inflation has contributed to lower inflation in 2003.
The CPI inflation declined from 3.7% at end – 2002 to 0.5% at end – 2003. As a matter of
policy, the NBC will intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize excessive
fluctuations of the exchange rate. The objective of the policy is to stabilize riel inflation at a
low level by maintaining a broadly stable exchange rate. In a highly dollarized economy,
exchange rate policy has limited effects on competitiveness and limited role as a shock
absorber in the short-term. Nevertheless, an exchange rate adjustment will be considered, if
there are significant fundamental changes in underlying market conditions. Going forward,
the NBC is committed to further improve its monetary policy instruments. Therefore, the
cooperation and assistance from the Fund is warranted.
The authorities acknowledge that de-dollarization would benefit the Cambodia
economy in the long run. Full de-dollarization would allow monetary policy to be conducted
effectively and independently and to be used as counter cyclical tool. In this regard, the
authorities are taking steps to promote de-dollarization. In particular, the authorities will
consider to require all government domestic transactions be paid in the local currency.
Demand for local currency, riel, is growing steadily mainly in the rural area and for
government transaction purposes. Riel in circulation rose from almost 2.5 percent of GDP in
1994 to over 5 percent in 2003.
On the financial sector reform, the reform has been progressing well. The successful
bank restructuring during 2000 – 02 has strengthened the soundness of the banking system.
The banking system is now well capitalized with capital adequacy ratios reaching 36% as at
end-July 2004 and banks are subject to a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory regime.
Reform were successfully in enhancing public confidence which were reflected in the
upward trend in deposits and credits. Nevertheless, the NBC is well aware that financial
intermediation remained limited, especially in the rural area and NBC supervisory capacity
needs to be strengthened. In this regard, several prakas have been issued recently on Prepaid
Payments on Rentals and Leases, Requirement in compliance with Fact and Substance, and
Payments of Dividends in advance to contain any potential access to banks’ assets. The
authorities are taking steps to ensure early passage of the Negotiable Instruments and
Payment Transactions Law, the Secured Transaction Law, the Insolvency Law and the
Securities and Exchange Law. A new chart of accounts has been introduced and a full
compliance by banks is expected by end of 2004. The NCB is also working towards reducing

-4-

lending rates in rural areas through increased competition among lending institutions and
promoting microfinance in the rural area.
Governance and Other Structural Reforms
The authorities recognize that strengthening structural reform efforts in all sectors
particularly in the areas of governance, civil service, agricultural sector will be key to
sustaining growth and competitiveness as well as reducing poverty. For Cambodia, good
governance is a backbone and prerequisite for sustainable socio-economic development and
ensuring social justice. Therefore, the authorities remain determine in promoting good
governance through effective implementation of the Governance Action Plan (GAP) as a
roadmap to guide a comprehensive reform of governance in Cambodia. The GAP covers four
crosscutting areas of reforms: (i) combating corruption, (ii) judicial and legal reforms, (iii)
public administration reform, and (iv) demobilization of armed forces and natural resources
management.
In fighting corruption, the Royal Government of Cambodia remains committed to the
adoption of Anti-corruption Law which has been submitted to the Parliament. This will be
accompanied by the establishment of an independent body to fight corruption— the Supreme
Council Against Corruption—and mechanism to strengthen the effectiveness of law
enforcement. In addition, the government is also committed to continue promoting the
effectiveness, transparency and accountability in the management of public finances,
especially through the strengthening of audit process and public procurement. In this context,
the authorities introduced the Law on Audit and established the National Audit Authority
(NAA) in 2000, and expressed their intention to ratify the new United Nations anticorruption convention.
The Cambodian authorities share the staff’s concern on the urgency of the judicial
reform to address governance problems. As has also been identified by the Investment
Climate Survey, judicial reform is a critical factor to the establishment of favorable
investment climate, based on the rule of law. Over the past few years, various laws, from the
laws related to human rights, laws on investment, trade and commerce, to laws to support
natural resources management, have been enacted. To improve the quality of judges and
prosecutors, the government established the Royal School of Judges and Prosecutors in 2002.
In addition, beginning in 2003, remuneration for judges and prosecutors was increased.
The authorities agree with staff that the limited human and financial resources are
among major challenges faced by Cambodia in this area, and hence, external assistance will
remain be warranted. Nonetheless, the Royal Government of Cambodia remain strongly
committed to continue the legal and judicial reforms to ensure the independence of the court
system through the implementation of key policies and strategies developed by the Council
of Legal and Judicial Reform. In this respect, the government will prepare an action plan
focusing on the finalization and submission of draft basic laws to the National Assembly. In
addition, to realize Cambodia’s commitment under the WTO, various laws related to
commercial transactions will go through the legislative process.

With regard to the administrative reforms, the government has adopted the National
Program for Administrative Reform to transform the administration and civil service into an
effective organization. The provision of public services will be facilitated and simplified
through the elimination of overlapping work, streamlining bureaucracy, and by implementing
decentralization. These procedures will be gradually computerized to improve transparency
and reduce corruption. Special attention will be given to the management of civil servants to
move the public administration closer to the people. The Cambodian authorities also share
the staff’s view that the low quality of public services is largely attributed to the low wages
in the civil service, which is approximately only one-third of the average wage of private
sector employees in the formal sector. In light of this, in the recent years the authorities
increased salaries for civil servants commensurably with their skills, experience and
responsibility, especially for teachers and health workers.
Given the significant dependency of the poor to the agricultural sector, the authorities
fully agree that urgent reform in this sector is essential to achieve the NPRS objective of
reducing poverty. Therefore, addressing key impediments to agricultural growth is one of
the government’s reform agenda. Recognizing that the improvement of access to arable land
may take longer time, in the short-term, the authorities will shift its direction from
“expansionary” or “extensive” agriculture to “deepening” or “intensive” agriculture, by
increasing the yields of the existing land. This strategy will be supported by more extensive
agricultural research, market developments, distributions of seeds and fertilizer, as well as
supply of rural credit. The authorities will continue to enhance marketing channels and
institutionalize micro-finance activities in rural areas. On the land reform, the government
will continue to implement the Law on Land Management and land policy to strengthen an
equitable and efficient system of land management, distribution and utilization. This will
include land restoration and distribution, land tenure security, eradication of illegal
settlements and land grabbing, and control of land ownership concentration for speculative
purposes.
Measures to Improve Business Climate
As an engine of growth for Cambodia, a healthy private sector is key to promoting
economic development. Therefore, the government will continue to promote good
governance, strengthen the legal frameworks, regulations and institutional capacity to
facilitate business and private investment activities. For this purpose, the government
recently established the Steering Committee for Private Sector Development, supported by
three sub committees which are already operational. Specific measures to facilitate business
have been set out, aiming at reducing cost and time imposed on companies on their
registration and export-import operation. Beginning in September this year, the cost of
registration will be reduced from USD615 to USD177, while the time spent on paperwork
will also be reduced from 30 to 10.5 days. In addition, the government also intend to improve
the effectiveness of government-private sector forum.

Removal of Quotas on Textiles and Clothing Exports
The authorities are aware that despite the continued robust production and investment
in the garment industry in Cambodia, the phasing out of Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) will
affect the Cambodia’s garment industry. While it is not easy to predict the size of potential
impact on Cambodia’s market share, the authorities are more sanguine than staff in
estimating the decline in the value of garment exports and its impact on the GDP growth.
Over the last 19 months, 22 companies have expanded their production capacities, reflecting
their optimistic expectations on their operations in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the authorities
agree with staff that to dampen the impact from the expected decline in garment exports, the
government need to redouble its effort in improving competitiveness. In this respect, the
authorities already took several measures to improve competitiveness, by reducing operating
costs, particularly labor and administrative costs. In addition, the authorities are in the
process of seeking the preferential duty treatment from the US government in the same terms
as applied to the African poorest countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act
adopted by the US Congress. Cambodia’s good record of adherence to core labor standards
should be a good incentive.
Ex Post Assessment of Longer –Term Program Engagement
The authorities appreciate the Ex Post Assessment (EPA), which provide a useful
review and foundation for future reform plans. The authorities agree with the main finding of
the report that, despite favorable macroeconomics developments and important progress
achieved in many areas under previous Fund – supported program, poverty remains
pervasive and strengthening of governance is crucial. With respect to poverty, while the
authorities agree that widespread poverty is a serious problem, they caution against
unqualified comparison of indicators across countries, given the significant differences in
data quality and methodologies used in calculation. Regarding the governance, the authorities
are fully aware that much remain need to be done, and they have reaffirmed their strong
commitment to address it vigorously. On the external financial assistance, the authorities note
that aid in the form of technical cooperation is adequate and donors would have helped
promote greater ownership by using more local staff. In this respect, the authorities would
like to underscore the importance of training local trainers. The Cambodian authorities also
agree with the key elements of the strategy proposed in the EPA for future engagement with
the Fund.
Conclusion
In conclusion, with continuous support from the international community and the
authorities’ strong efforts to implement structural reforms and pursue a sound
macroeconomic policies, Cambodia has made considerable progress under the Fundsupported program despite its prevailing capacity constraints and unfavorable external
factors. The authorities have renewed their commitment to move forward to strengthen
governance and improve institutional capacity. They are fully aware that the absence of these
measures could undermine the investment and business climate in Cambodia. Given the

limited resources, the success of this economic reform will depend on continued support
from the international community. In this regard, the authorities continue to count on the
strong support from the international community, including the Fund. In particular, they
request the Fund to continue to provide policy advice, more focused technical assistance, and
financial support. Therefore, they would like to start discussion on an economic program to
be supported by a PRGF program. In addition to help strengthen Cambodia’s official reserves
position and contain possible adverse impact from the phasing out of the garment quota, this
arrangement would help underpin a framework for donor coordination and encourage
domestic reform efforts within the government.
