Executive Summary
Economic Developments


Bangladesh’s economy has held up remarkably well, despite the global recession. Growth
decelerated only modestly from the pace recorded in recent years and remained broadbased. Strong remittances, resilient exports and weak imports caused the current account
of the balance of payments to record a surplus of almost 3 percent of GDP in FY09 (July
2008-June 2009). Gross reserves doubled to over US$10 billion in the year to November
2009, raising reserve coverage to 4.8 months of prospective imports, a 15-year high.



A decline in international food and commodity prices contributed to easing inflation.



The FY09 budget deficit remained below the budget target, despite revenue shortfalls,
owing to continued problems in implementing the Annual Development Program.



Monetary policy was accommodative through the summer. The injection of liquidity from
unsterilized interventions to maintain the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar pushed interest
rates down and inflated banks’ excess reserves. Faced with a possible pickup in inflation,
and a rapid rise in share prices, monetary conditions were subsequently tightened, but
insufficiently, and through large high-cost government borrowing—with excess funds
deposited in Bangladesh Bank (BB)—rather than sustained monetary policy operations.



Progress on structural reforms was mixed.



Growth momentum was subdued during the first months of FY2010. However, as growth
and imports recover, the need for official foreign exchange purchases will be reduced.
This should allow monetary policy to focus on addressing the injection of liquidity that
will occur when the government starts to draw on its accumulated deposits with BB.

Policy Issues


Bangladesh seems stuck in a low revenue-low capital spending equilibrium and
infrastructure bottlenecks are holding back growth. Staff and the authorities agreed on the
need to raise government capital spending, financed from higher tax revenues, in order to
boost medium-term growth and raise living standards.



Rather than contemplating greater exchange rate flexibility, as recommended by staff, the
authorities indicated that their priority was to make the existing framework for monetary
and exchange rate policy work, including by gradually reducing banks’ excess liquidity.



Financial soundness indicators are generally favorable although the weak state of the
state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) remains a concern. The authorities were receptive
to the recommendations of the July 2009 FSAP Update mission and indicated that they
had already started to make improvements based on the advice.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The political environment has settled down following successful elections. A
military-backed caretaker government, which had been in control for 2 years, left office in
favor of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League (AL)-led government in January 2009. Amid high
voter turnout, the AL won more than the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to pass
constitutional amendments unchallenged.
2.
However, despite a large popular mandate for reform, progress has been
limited. The government declared alleviating poverty and reducing consumer prices to be its
top priorities. Accordingly, administered prices of fertilizer and diesel were reduced. But
implementation of the ambitious election manifesto for economic reforms—needed to unlock
Bangladesh’s potential through private sector-led growth—is progressing slowly.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Bangladesh’s economy has held up remarkably well despite the global recession.
Financial contagion was contained by low levels of financial integration. Growth, estimated
at 5.9 percent for FY09, decelerated only modestly from the pace recorded in recent years
and remained broad-based. Monetary conditions were increasingly loosened through the
summer. However, unlike in some neighboring countries (e.g. India), no fiscal stimulus
measures were put in place, apart from a modest budget reallocation aimed at supporting
sectors affected by the global downturn. The

4.
The external position strengthened considerably in FY2009 and the first four
months of FY2010. Strong remittances, resilient exports and weak imports caused the
current account of the balance of payments to record a surplus of almost 3 percent of GDP in
FY09, up from less than 1 percent of GDP in FY08. Gross international reserves exceeded
US$10 billion in November, almost double the level in November 2008. This is equivalent to
4.8 months of prospective imports, a 15-year high.
5.
This put pressure on Bangladesh Bank (BB)’s monetary policy framework. The
improvement in the current account put upward pressure on the taka which BB countered

Box 1. How did Bangladesh double central bank reserves amid the global crisis?
The capital account remains effectively closed. Therefore, Bangladesh was not affected by
the global “flight to safety” towards the end of 2008 and in the first half of 2009.
FDI inflows have stayed at only about 1
percent of GDP per annum, owing to a
relatively unfavorable business climate. This level
was maintained in FY09 thanks to a large sale of
telecom shares.

and a wait-and-see attitude in the private sector, which depressed the import of capital
machinery.

through unsterilized foreign exchange purchases. This caused banks’ excess reserves to rise
sharply, sending short-term interest rates below 1 percent (Figure 3). In the absence of
reverse repo transactions, the monetary policy framework was rendered virtually inoperative.

6
6.
The accommodative monetary policy pushed up asset price inflation. A decline in
international food and commodity prices contributed to a fall in inflation to 2.2 percent in
June. But with the accommodative monetary policy, upward pressure on real estate prices has
become visible and the stock market has risen by 40 percent since March. As international
food and commodity prices began to rise again, inflation rose to 6.7 percent in October.
7.
The FY09 budget deficit remained below the budget target, despite revenue
shortfalls, owing to continued problems in implementing the Annual Development
Program (ADP). Held back by lower imports, customs revenue fell short of the target. As a
result, the ratio of NBR revenue to GDP declined by 0.2 percent of GDP to 8.2 percent of
GDP, falling short of the original budget target by 0.7 percent of GDP. ADP spending fell
short of the original budget by 1 percent of GDP reflecting implementation bottlenecks. The
overall fiscal deficit (including grants) amounted to 3 percent of GDP, almost 1 percentage
point of GDP smaller than envisaged in the original budget.
8.
In the area of structural reforms progress was mixed. Comprehensive plans to
address infrastructure bottlenecks, such as the power and gas shortages which are holding
back growth, remain under discussion. Progress in Public Private Partnerships (PPP) has
been very slow. The reintroduction of interest rate ceilings on important categories of bank
lending was a setback to financial market development. The recent appointments made at the
Boards of Directors of three state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) were not fully in line
with established regulations. The FY2010 budget’s extension of para-tariffs and the
introduction of a regulatory duty to a large number of consumer goods raised nominal
protection and is second-best to comprehensive tax policy reform.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
9.
Bangladesh’s growth momentum is likely to remain somewhat subdued in the
near term but inflation seems set to increase. Staff projects growth to decelerate to
5 percent in FY2010 as economic activity is likely to be held back by weak imports,
particularly of capital machinery, sluggish exports and private sector credit, and subdued
hiring of Bangladeshi workers by employers abroad. The ample availability of liquidity
along with adverse base effects related to last year’s unprecedented decline in international
food and commodity prices is likely to drive up inflation throughout FY2010, possibly to
double digits by the summer. As imports recover, the need for official foreign exchange
purchases will be reduced in the second half of FY2010, reducing external pressure on
monetary policy.
10.
Over the medium term, as global growth and trade recover, Bangladesh’s
growth should edge up as well, to around 6 percent per annum (Text Table 1), building
on increasing trade integration with countries in the region and the rest of the world, and
growth momentum in the agriculture, services, and construction sectors. The current account
can be expected to remain in surplus with the import coverage of reserves remaining robust.

11.
There are both downside and upside risks to the baseline projections. A
prolonged global slump could hold back exports and remittances. As the U.A.E. accounts for
almost one-fifth of remittances, a slowdown in Dubai, following the recent financial
problems, would also have adverse effects. Continued shortages of energy may further
discourage private-sector investment and FDI. On the other hand, private sector investment
may jump, if the global recovery is deemed more robust than expected. An acceleration of
structural reforms could also boost growth substantially.
12.
The staff’s updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests that Bangladesh
has a low risk of debt distress. Continued prudent foreign borrowing amid robust economic
growth and recent real appreciation of the taka has put the external debt to GDP ratio on a
declining path both in face value and in net present value terms. However, taking into
account domestic public debt, which amounted to 21 percent of GDP at the end of FY09, the
risk of debt distress is somewhat more elevated. In the staff’s baseline scenario, the ratio of
total public debt to GDP remains at around 44 percent of GDP over the medium term.
13.
Other macroeconomic vulnerabilities are also low. Stress tests conducted during
the recent FSAP update suggest that the banking system is mainly vulnerable to a
deterioration in domestic credit quality, whereas vulnerability to exchange or interest rate
movements is low. The stock market continues to play a limited role in the overall economy.
However, with the increasing engagement of banks in the market, risks to capital from a fall
in the market could be large for some banks.

8
IV. MACROECONOMIC POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on policies required to maintain near-term macroeconomic stability,
including by reducing excess liquidity in the financial system, and longer-term policies to
boost growth through tax policy reform and higher public investment.
A. Containing Excess Liquidity
14.
Through the summer, monetary policy was accommodative. The injection of
liquidity from unsterilized interventions, conducted to maintain the stability of the exchange
rate, pushed short-term interest rates substantially below the notional corridor of policy
interest rates from April onwards and inflated banks’ excess reserves to unprecedented levels
(Figure 3). In order to boost lending and activity, BB also capped banks’ interest rates on
lending to priority sectors. These actions were taken against the backdrop of a declining
inflation rate and a deceleration of private sector credit.
15.
The subsequent tightening of monetary policy was inadequate. Faced with large
excess liquidity in the banking system and a rapid rise in share prices, BB started to mop up
liquidity through the issuance of BB bills (from August) and reverse repo operations (from
mid-October, after having reduced the reverse repo rate by 200 basis points to 2.5 percent).
However, the total amount of liquidity taken out of the market by BB remained limited.
16.
The reduction in excess liquidity and reserve money was mostly achieved
through high-cost government borrowing beyond what was needed to finance the fiscal
deficit. Strong net sales of National Savings Certificates (NSCs) and Treasury Bills and
Bonds caused an accumulation of government deposits with BB (Box 2). For instance, during
October alone, BB’s net claims on government declined by Tk 40 billion. Staff noted that BB
would need to start issuing a sufficiently large amount of BB bills—the authorities’ main
instrument to mop up liquidity—to bring down excess liquidity further if the government
began to draw on its deposits with BB. The resulting higher market interest rates would be a
small price to pay to prevent a harmful acceleration of inflation. BB emphasized that it would
take strong actions to bring excess liquidity down further if inflation and credit demand were
to pick up. The government made clear that it stood ready to bear the (quasi-)fiscal costs of
the needed mopping up operations.
17.
There is scope to strengthen the monetary policy framework and stabilize
systemic liquidity. To enhance the credibility and predictability of monetary policy, staff
proposed to move, in due course, to a standing facility for repo and reverse repo operations
and adoption of an interest rate corridor. The authorities concurred but noted that this would
have to wait until fully functional open market operations are in place. Staff also noted that
averaging reserve requirements on a two-week maintenance period would help control shortterm volatility.

9

Box 2: Challenges in Cash Management
Bangladesh faces challenges in cash management on both the expenditure and funding sides
of the budget. This raises the government’s interest bill and could undermine fiscal control
owing to the resulting build up of deposits at BB and commercial banks over which the
Ministry of Finance has limited control.


Alongside the funds flowing through the treasury single account (TSA), Ministries
and Departments retain substantial amounts of cash in commercial bank accounts
(1.1 percent of GDP at the end of FY2009). There is no law or rule in place that
requires unspent funds held in commercial banks to be swept back into the TSA at the
end of the fiscal year. Commercial bank deposits of autonomous and semiautonomous government bodies are also rising steadily and amounted to 1.8 percent
of GDP at the end of FY2009. This suggests that budget allocations to these bodies
have systematically exceeded their spending needs.



Unlike in most countries, retail government savings instruments (NSCs) form a large
proportion of outstanding government debt in Bangladesh and now amount to
8 percent of GDP. There are no effective controls on NSC sales as they are entirely
demand driven. Interest rates on NSCs are administered and have been changed only
four times in the past ten years. At present, NSC interest rates vary from 8½ to
12 percent. In the current environment of low inflation and excess liquidity, rates on
bank deposits and on treasury bills of similar maturity are 400–500 basis points
lower. As a result, there has recently been a large shift toward NSCs: with net sales in
Q1 FY2010 of Tk 28 billion, the annual net sales target of Tk 33 billion is likely to be
exceeded. Moreover, despite these large NSC sales the government has mostly
adhered to its treasury bill and bond auction calendar, causing a major increase in
unremunerated government cash balances with BB.

B. Improving Exchange Rate Management
18.
Greater exchange rate flexibility could help reduce the costs of managing
liquidity for BB, while dampening inflationary pressures. Staff believes that the taka is
somewhat undervalued, though not far out of line with fundamentals (Box 3). Staff expressed
the view that allowing a modest nominal appreciation of the taka could help reduce excess
liquidity in the financial system, thereby reducing the pressure on monetary policy. A modest
appreciation would help dampen inflation and would be unlikely to affect the
competitiveness of Bangladesh’s exports, especially because of the recent sharp nominal

10
depreciation vis-à-vis the euro and the yen. Staff underscored that greater exchange rate
flexibility would also be in the longer-term interest of the economy, especially if the balance
of payments would remain stronger than currently envisaged. In addition to helping financial
sector development (e.g. through encouraging the development of a foreign exchange
derivatives market for hedging purposes), it would reduce the need for costly sterilization
operations which risk exacerbating vulnerabilities related to the rising domestic debt.
19.
The authorities indicated that they would not contemplate greater exchange rate
flexibility. While they also felt that the taka was somewhat undervalued, they were
concerned that a nominal appreciation would add to the problems of exporters.
C. Boosting Growth Through Higher Capital Spending
20.
Bangladesh seems stuck in a low revenue-low capital spending equilibrium but
would break into a higher growth trajectory with decisive tax reforms. Bangladesh has a
track record of overall fiscal prudence. However, two key issues are preventing a sustainable
rise in growth-enhancing government spending:


Bangladesh’s tax-to-GDP ratio (stable at around 8.5 percent for the past several
years) is 4 percentage points lower than the average of countries in the region at a
similar development stage, constraining the scope for higher spending in key fields.



Capacity constraints and governance issues are causing chronic underimplementation of the ADP. The 56 percent increase in ADP spending envisaged in
the FY2010 budget over the FY09 outturn looks unrealistic given also that the
implementation rate has averaged 73 percent over the past 5 years.

21.
Staff outlined a reform scenario which illustrates how a higher growth
trajectory can be achieved with higher capital spending (Text Table 2). However, it
would require a break from the past, when recurring plans for tax policy and tax
administration reforms were invariably watered down and capacity constraints and
governance issues prevented increased ADP implementation. Raising tax revenue to the level
envisaged in the scenario, i.e. 11.6 percent—still one percentage point of GDP below the
regional average—would require fundamental changes in income tax and VAT policy.

11
Box 3: Is the level of the REER appropriate?
While the taka appears to be somewhat undervalued, staff believes that the assessment made
during last year’s Article IV consultation, that the real effective exchange rate is close to its
estimated equilibrium level, remains valid.

Over the medium term, Bangladesh’s
current account balance is projected to
narrow to less than 1 percent of GDP.
Import growth is projected to recover and
the growth of remittances is projected to
slow as the effect of a slowdown in the
hiring of Bangladeshi workers will begin to
be felt.

Between 2000 and 2008, Bangladesh
broadly maintained its share of global
exports, owing to the strong performance
of the textile and garments sector (see also
Box 1). Of Bangladesh’s regional
competitors, India and Vietnam managed
to increase their share of global exports
thanks to their more diversified production
base, more business-friendly
macroeconomic and structural policies, and
better-quality governance (See also

Staff emphasized that tax reforms are vital to unleash Bangladesh’s potential,
while maintaining fiscal prudence and sustainability. While Bangladesh’s external debt
position does not pose immediate risk, escalating foreign borrowing, especially nonconcessional loans, could weaken its external debt position. Besides, foreign donors may not
be able to meet increasing borrowing demand from Bangladesh. In fact, despite the large
budget support from the ADB, there may be a shortfall in net external financing in FY2010.
Financing higher capital spending domestically from high-cost NSCs could quickly
undermine fiscal sustainability by raising the interest bill and the overall fiscal deficit.
23.
The government is committed to boosting growth through tax policy reform and
higher public investment. The authorities reaffirmed their intention to submit new VAT
legislation to Parliament in the context of the FY2011 budget. Raising the ADP
implementation ratio has become a political priority. And the FY2010 budget included an
allocation to commence Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

D. Reforms of Energy Prices and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
24.
Energy and fertilizer subsidies look set to rise again. Losses of SOEs, which for
the most part have been brought on the budget, arise mainly from administered prices that do
not cover input costs. As a result of the rapid decline in international oil prices during FY09,
losses at the state-owned oil company were contained. However, international oil prices have
been rising in recent months and domestic prices for petroleum products and electricity are
again below the levels needed to cover the costs of the relevant SOEs. Staff recommends that
the authorities opt for early and more frequent adjustment of retail energy prices, combined
with targeted compensation for the poor. This would prevent the accumulation of large losses

13
and an eventual large price adjustment, as was experienced in FY08. Also, by reducing
infrastructure bottlenecks, including oil-import facilities, the transportation and distribution
costs can be substantially reduced, which would lessen the need to raise retail prices.
E. Financial Sector Reforms
25.
Successful financial sector reforms are key to securing Bangladesh’s growth
potential. The July 2009 FSAP Update mission found that considerable progress has been
made in strengthening the soundness and resilience of the financial sector since the 2003
FSAP. Financial soundness indicators are generally favorable although the asset quality of
the commercial loan portfolio remains weak, with a large share of loans classified in the
substandard, doubtful, and loss categories. The recommendations of the FSAP Update
mission provide a roadmap to a more efficient and resilient financial sector.
26.
The weak state of the state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) remains a concern.
The banking sector remains structurally weak, reflecting low capitalization and distortions
due to the presence of weak and systemically important SCBs. Three large SCBs were
corporatized in 2007 and brought under BB’s regulatory authority. Their Boards and
management were strengthened, and their operations were upgraded through a monitorable
program. The SCBs’ finances have improved but remain much worse than those of the
private banks.
27.
Staff underscored that strategic guidance and robust decisions—based on
business principles at the Board and management level—remain critical to further
promote SCBs’ soundness, especially in view of the recent relaxation of the cap on the loan
portfolio growth from 5 to 10 percent. In this context, it urged BB to closely monitor the
performance of the three corporatized SCBs using agreed verifiable indicators. In order to
prevent an increase in non-performing loans in the medium term, BB should use its
supervisory powers to take corrective measures, as necessary, if there is evidence that these
banks are not being run appropriately. In particular, it would be important to monitor whether
all of the recently appointed directors and chairmen live up to the expectations that they will
be able to help further strengthen the SCBs. And Rupali Bank, the weakest of the four major
SCBs, should be brought under the same restructuring and monitoring program as the other
three SCBs as quickly as possible.
28.
The authorities noted the progress they had already made in implementing
many of the recommendations put forward by the FSAP update mission. Recent
improvements included (i) preparing for the introduction of Basel II regulations effective
January 1, 2010; (ii) raising the quality of banks’ capital; (iii) creating risk management units
at all banks; (iv) strengthening BB’s in-house capacity for stress testing; and (v) requesting
commercial banks to run their merchant banking business through separately formed
subsidiary companies. The authorities had also requested a resident advisor to assist with
strengthening BB’s banking supervision capacity.

14
29.
Staff noted the FSAP Update mission’s recommendations to strengthen
accounting practices, and to unify and broaden regulations. Weaknesses in the
implementation of accounting standards by banks appear to cause an overestimation of the
decline in the NPL ratio and allowed “paper” recapitalizations of some of the SCBs.
Prudential and regulatory enforcement would need to be improved in order to ensure that all
microcredit and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) are eventually brought fully within
the regulatory perimeter. The authorities argued that banks are using appropriate accounting
standards and NBFIs and microfinance institutions are properly regulated but acknowledged
that there was scope to strengthen accounting practices and the enforcement of regulations.
30.
Measures should also be taken to increase efficiency in the financial markets.
Non-prudential interventions, such as ceilings on lending rates for priority sectors, moral
suasion, directed lending, and easing debt service for some sectors, are counterproductive in
the long run. In light of this, staff welcomes BB’s pronouncement that the ceilings on lending
rates are temporary. In the staff’s view, they and other intervention instruments should be
removed as soon as possible and in any case before market interest rates rise with higher
inflation. The high fixed interest rates on NSCs are a burden on the budget and distort the
monetary policy transmission mechanism. Increased flexibility of interest rates would make
the auction process for government securities more efficient and eliminate the devolvement
of securities onto the primary dealers at rates that frustrate trading. It would also facilitate the
development of a more active secondary market in government paper which would help
financial sector deepening and monetary policy implementation, and reduce borrowing costs.
V. OTHER ISSUES
31.
Improving the quality and timeliness of economic statistics would strengthen
policy making. Staff noted the efforts underway to improve trade statistics. Adoption of a
Statistics Act would clarify responsibilities in the compilation of statistics and provide
needed autonomy to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Other key priorities include
improving and updating the source data for national account statistics, moving towards
Government Financial Statistics Manual 2001 standards for fiscal statistics, and ensuring that
the BBS has sufficient staff and other resources to compile statistics.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Bangladesh’s economy has held up remarkably well, despite the global recession.
Growth has been supported by buoyant domestic activity, including in agriculture and
services. Resilience in exports as well as continued strong inflows of remittances also played
an important role. In addition, fiscal conservatism of the government has paid large
dividends. Going forward, these trends are expected to continue and the staff’s baseline
scenario projects medium-term growth at a respectable 6 percent. However, staff identified
two policy issues.

15
33.
First, preventing an increase in inflation is the immediate policy concern. By
stabilizing the exchange rate of the taka in the face of strong remittance inflows, monetary
policy has been too accommodative for the domestic conditions. Staff welcomes the
commitment made by BB to employ all available instruments to contain inflation if and when
there are clear signs of a pickup in prices. However, staff sees a need for preemptive and bold
action by BB. The resulting higher market interest rates would be a small price to pay to
prevent a harmful acceleration of inflation, which hurts the poor most severely.
34.
Greater flexibility in the exchange rate would support monetary policy
objectives. Staff is of the view that the authorities should move towards greater flexibility in
the exchange rate to lessen the constraints on macroeconomic policies. The export sector
should be able to sustain such a move, since staff believes that the taka is somewhat
undervalued, though not far out of line with fundamentals. Increased day-to-day movements
in the exchange rate would also help deepen the foreign exchange market.
35.
Second, for the medium term, measures should be taken to unleash
Bangladesh’s potential, while maintaining fiscal prudence and sustainability.
Bangladesh seems stuck in a low revenue-low capital spending equilibrium and
infrastructure bottlenecks are holding back growth. Higher growth could be achieved through
higher revenue and higher capital spending. Therefore, pushing through the plans for VAT
reforms is crucial.
36.
Further financial deepening is needed to allow Bangladesh to achieve its growth
potential. Ceilings on lending rates and other non-prudential interventions should be
removed as soon as possible. Increased flexibility of interest rates, including for NSCs,
would make the auction process for government paper more efficient and give impetus to an
active secondary market. It would also help offset the government’s higher interest costs
related to the needed monetary tightening. Restructuring of SCBs must be accelerated.
37.
Continued improvement in the quality and timeliness of statistics would improve
policy making. Improvements in national account statistics are particularly urgent.
38.
As there is no timetable for the removal of the one remaining exchange
restriction on the transferability of funds in nonresident taka accounts, staff does not
recommend its approval by the Board.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bangladesh take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
BANGLADESH
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20091
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Tom Dorsey (IMF)
and Ernesto May and Carlos Braga (IDA)
December 23, 2009
Bangladesh’s risk of debt distress is low based on external debt indicators. Bangladesh’s
external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant policy-dependent indicative
thresholds under the baseline scenario and also do not breach the thresholds under the stress
tests2. Debt burden indicators are significantly worse when domestic debt is included.
Accordingly, this analysis reveals a more elevated risk of debt distress on public debt
compared to results based solely on external debt. Staffs will continue to monitor closely the
evolution of domestic debt and the government’s ability to mobilize domestic resources,
especially tax revenues.
1.
The results of this DSA are similar to those of the previous DSA.3 The primary
difference between the two is that, whereas in the previous DSA one of the thresholds was

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by World Bank and IMF staffs and in consultation with the Asian
Development Bank using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of
both institutions. The DSA is based on macroeconomic data gathered in the context of IMF missions to Dhaka
in 2009. Estimated debt outstanding and disbursed as of end–FY2009 provides the basis for the debt figures.
The starting point for the previous DSA was estimated debt outstanding and disbursed as of end–FY2007.

2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent.
Bangladesh’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are:
40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for
the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt
service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

marginally breached in the most extreme stress test, this is not the case in the current DSA.4
The projections of the external debt to GDP ratio in the previous DSA were, by and large,
accurate as the outturns for FY2008 and FY2009 deviated only marginally from the
projections. Compared to the previous DSA, the baseline assumptions for economic growth
are more conservative, the projected rate of external debt accumulation is somewhat lower
and, reflecting lower global interest rates, the discount rate is reduced from 5 percent to
4 percent.5 Longer-term debt dynamics are adversely affected by the lower growth
assumptions but positively affected by the lower projected rate of debt accumulation. The
lower discount rate raises the net present value of external debt across the board.
2.
Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the
DSA. Most notably, it is based on projections for growth that are in line with the average
growth rate over the past ten years and somewhat lower than those in Bangladesh’s own
medium-term framework.
I. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
3.
All external debt indicators remain well below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, and no thresholds are breached under
standardized stress test.6 Bangladesh’s external debt was equivalent to 24 percent of GDP
at the end of FY2009, down from 27 percent of GDP at the end of FY2007. The declining
trend in the external debt to GDP ratio reflects prudent borrowing and strong economic
growth. The main results of the external DSA are as follows:

4

The relative magnitude of the most extreme shock in last year’s DSA (the combination of one-half standard
deviation shock to net transfers, export growth, GDP growth, and the GDP deflator) is now smaller than in last
year’s DSA because the historical averages of the macroeconomic variables are somewhat higher and the
standard deviations are somewhat lower for the period 2000-2009 used in this DSA than for the period 19982007 used in the previous DSA. For instance, the 10-year average of the growth of exports of goods and
services is now 11.5 percent, up from 11.0 in the previous DSA, and the standard deviation is now 7.2 percent,
down from 7.7 percent in the previous DSA. Since the values of the key variables under the shock are simulated
to be the historical average subtracted of half a standard deviation, exports of goods and services are now
somewhat higher vis-à-vis the baseline compared to the analysis done in the previous DSA.

5

The discount rate was reduced by a full percentage point after the six-month average U.S. dollar commercial
interest reference rate fell below the earlier 5 percent discount rate by more than a full percentage point for a
period of six months (see staff guidance note http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2008/070308.pdf).

6

Private sector external debt remains very small. Capital controls generally impede borrowing from abroad.
And while industrial projects in Bangladesh can access medium and long-term external borrowing with prior
BOI approval, the absence of a sovereign credit rating raises the country risk premium, making external
borrowing relatively expensive.

3
Box 1. Bangladesh: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Real GDP growth in the medium term is projected at 6 percent, slightly above the 10-year average of
5.8 percent. It is assumed to average 6¼ percent in the long run. This is lower than in Bangladesh’s
own medium-term framework, reflecting the fact that the government which came to power in January
2009 is still in the process of articulating an agenda of growth-enhancing structural reforms.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator in domestic currency, decelerates from 6.4 percent in
FY09 to 4.5 percent in FY14, reflecting declining import prices and moderating demand pressures.
The growth of exports and imports of goods and services is strong in the medium term (12½ percent
and 12 percent, respectively). As the economy continues to become more open, exports and imports
both will increase in terms of GDP. Remittances are projected to increase by 9 percent per annum.
The current account (including grants) continues to show a surplus as remittances continue to offset
the merchandise trade deficit. Deeper macroeconomic and structural reforms, which are not envisaged
in this baseline, would boost imports further and push the current account to a deficit. Such reforms
would trigger larger FDI inflows and donor support which would finance part of the higher imports.
Net aid inflows (disbursements of grants and loans net of amortization payments) amount to about 1.3
percent of GDP in the medium and long term. The strong balance of payments, limited momentum for
structural reforms, and slow implementation of existing donor-supported projects are holding back the
disbursement of project and program loans. And amortization payments are edging up over time (they
will amount to about US$720 million in FY2010 and rise to US$850 million in FY14, up from
US$580 million in FY08). The larger net aid inflows in FY08 (1.9 percent of GDP) was in response to
the two cyclones that hit Bangladesh that year. The net aid inflow in FY2010 (1.5 percent of GDP) is
also expected to exceed the longer-term average because of the large budget support from the ADB
(¾ percent of GDP) in response to the global recession.
The grant element of new external borrowing is assumed to remain at about 30 percent.
The primary fiscal deficit (including grants) is assumed to average 1 percent of GDP over the
medium term, about 0.4 percent of GDP smaller than the average of the past 10 years. Domestic
revenue is projected to remain below 11 percent of GDP over the medium-term.
Real interest rates on domestic currency government debt are assumed to average about 6 percent in
the medium term, and decline gradually as financial markets develop.



All debt indicators in the baseline scenario are expected to decline over the 20-year
projection period (Table 1 and Figure 1). The NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio
decreases from about 20 percent in 2009 to less than 10 percent (compared to an
indicative threshold of 40 percent) during the projection period, while the NPV of
external debt-to-exports ratio decreases from 99 percent in 2009 to 25 percent (compared
to an indicative threshold of 150 percent), and the debt service ratio decreases from 6
percent in 2010 to 2½ percent (compared to an indicative threshold of 20 percent).

4
The standard stress tests do not reveal serious vulnerabilities7 although the NPV of
debt to revenues threshold is almost breached in the most extreme test, in which net nondebt creating flows (e.g. official transfers, remittances, and FDI) are at their historical
average minus one standard deviation in 2011-12 (Table 2, Figure 1). The strong increase



II. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS 9
4.
Domestic debt has been rising modestly in recent years, from 20 percent of GDP
in FY06 and FY07 to 21.2 percent of GDP n FY09. Close to 40 percent of the domestic
debt is in the form of treasury bills and treasury bonds, held mostly by domestic commercial
banks. National savings certificates, mostly held by the nonbank private sector, constitute
another large share of the domestic debt (38 percent). Bangladesh Bank holds more than 20
percent of the government’s domestic debt, in the form of nontradable overdrafts and a small
amount of devolved treasury bills and bonds (0.6 percent of GDP at end-FY09).10
7

Debt and debt burden indicators in the “historical scenario” in Figure 1 and Figure 2 are less favorable than in
the baseline. The historical scenario puts key variables such as real GDP growth and the non-interest current
account in percent of GDP during 2010-2030 at their historical averages recorded during 2000-2009. The
baseline scenario builds on the recent favorable developments in remittances and exports of textiles and
garments. If these assumptions are replaced, in the historical scenario, by the somewhat less favorable numbers
realized during 2000-09, then the debt and debt burden indicators develop less favorably.

8

A recent review of some aspects of the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework recommended
greater recognition of remittances in DSAs for countries where they are large, including in the determination of
risk ratings (see http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4358).

9

Public debt includes domestic central government debt and external public and publicly guaranteed debt.

10

It should be noted that the government of Bangladesh maintains large and growing deposit balances with
commercial banks. According to the monetary survey, these balances amounted to Tk 183 billion or 3 percent of
GDP at the end of FY2009, up from Tk 122 billion or 2.6 percent of GDP at the end of FY2007. Therefore, net
domestic government debt was about 18.2 percent of GDP at the end of FY2009. The substantial government
deposits reflect inefficiencies in budget and cash management. They are mostly held by autonomous and semiautonomous government bodies. Because the deposits are largely outside the control of the central government,
the public debt sustainability analysis does not take them into account and focuses on the gross public debt.

5
5.
In the baseline scenario, the NPV of public debt-to-GDP ratio remains steady at
about 40 percent of GDP. The decline in the NPV of external public debt to GDP ratio is
offset by a rising domestic debt-to-GDP ratio. The NPV of total public debt remains at 40
percent of GDP through FY2015 and declines to 37 percent of GDP in FY2030. The NPV of
public debt-to-domestic revenue ratio follows a similar trend, remaining broadly steady
between FY2010 and FY2015 and gradually declining in the long run.
6.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected paths of
debt indicators are sensitive to alternative assumptions and point to sizeable risks
(Table 4). Subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises have for the most part been
brought onto the budget. This has reduced fiscal risks. However, energy (e.g. electricity and
diesel) and imported fertilizer remain underpriced and a further rise in world market prices
could create contingent liabilities of the government to state-owned enterprises as no
mechanisms exist to automatically adjust domestic retail prices to reflect higher import costs.
Under the assumption of a one-off debt creating flow of 10 percent of GDP—to securitize the
contingent liabilities, as was done in FY08 at a smaller scale to regularize BPC’s debts to
state-owned commercial banks—the debt service to revenue ratio reaches 36 percent in
FY2015, compared with the baseline ratio of 28 percent.
7.
It should be noted that the baseline assumes continued under-implementation of
the government’s Annual Development Program (ADP).11 Full implementation of the
ADP in FY2010, while desirable to boost long-term growth, could raise the overall fiscal
deficit by more than one percent of GDP. The bulk of the ADP is typically financed by
concessional external financing. Therefore, full implementation of the ADP would likely
entail additional concessional external financing—over and above what is assumed in the
baseline scenario. To the extent that the higher ADP spending would be financed through the
issuance of additional domestic debt, some of which carries interest rates of 12 percent, this
would put key public debt and public debt service ratios on higher and possibly rising paths
over the medium term.
III. DEBT MANAGEMENT
8.
In response to a request from the authorities, a joint Bank/Fund mission visited
Bangladesh in November 2009 to provide technical assistance in developing a reform
plan for improving debt management functions and operations. The mission built on the
findings of previous work done by the Bank and the Fund in Bangladesh, which included
assessing strengths and weaknesses in debt management performance and capacity and
designing a medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS).12
11

During the past five fiscal years, successive governments on average managed to implement 73 percent of the
amount included in the original budget for ADP spending. In FY09, ADP spending fell short of the original
budget by 1 percentage point of GDP.

12

There was a joint Bank-Fund mission to develop a MTDS (January 2008), followed by a Bank mission to
apply the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) tool (February 2008).

6
9.
The November 2009 mission focused recommendations on several key areas
where procedural and capacity issues have been identified, including (i) improving
institutional arrangements for managing total public sector debt, with a view also to better
integrate domestic debt in the debt recording system; (ii) developing capacity and procedures
for improved cash balance management and cash-flow forecasting; and (iii) reducing
operational risks, given deficiencies with regard to the recording and reconciliation of data.
IV. CONCLUSION
10.
In the staffs’ view, Bangladesh should be considered at low risk of debt distress
based on external indicators, but the analysis reveals a more elevated risk of debt
distress on public debt. The baseline projections and the associated standard stress tests
show little risk related to external debt given that none of the indicators breaches the
indicative debt burden thresholds. However, in view of Bangladesh’s continued low
domestic revenue base, risks to domestic debt accumulation raise concerns.
11.
The substantial increase in debt ratios when domestic debt is included calls for
careful management of the public debt. While the NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio
would decline over the 20-year horizon under the baseline assumptions, the ratio would
remain high over the medium term and rises in some of the alternative scenarios and bound
tests.
12.
Efforts to mobilize domestic revenues, as well as the appropriate management of
contingent liabilities, and continued prudent management of expenditures while
protecting priority spending are the keys to ensure improvement in the debt indicators.
This exercise also underscores the importance of effective management of the existing debt
and new debt accumulation.
13.
The staff encourages the authorities to build on recent steps and move forward
as quickly as possible to strengthen debt management capacity. In this regard, it will be
important to continue the work underway to develop a comprehensive public debt data base
which covers both domestic and external debt and to integrate it with centralized reporting of
all external aid flows.

2/ The large rate of debt accumulation in FY2010 compared to later years reflects large program loans from the AsDB (almost 0.8
percent of GDP) to help bangladesh weather the global crisis. The bulk of these loans were disbursed in November 2009.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

VIII.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Bangladesh Bank (BB) is subject to an
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on June 20, 2003.
A safeguards assessment of the BB was completed on January 24, 2005. The assessment
concluded that substantial risks exist in the legal structure, financial reporting, internal audit,
and internal control systems. Implementation of the measures by BB is monitored by staff.
IX.

Exchange Arrangement

Exchange regime. The de jure exchange rate regime is a managed float. The de facto regime
is stabilized.
Exchange restriction. At the last Article IV consultation, the Executive Board urged the
authorities to adopt a timetable to remove the remaining exchange restriction on the
convertibility and transferability of proceeds of current international transactions in
nonresident taka accounts.
X.

Resident Representative

The resident representative office was established in 1972. Ms. Eteri Kvintradze will take
over as Resident Representative in February from Mr. Jonathan Dunn, who represented the
Fund in Dhaka between August 2004 and December 2009.
XI.

Technical Assistance

Since the last Article IV consultation, departments have continued to provide technical
assistance (TA). Recent and prospective TA includes the following:
Department

ANNEX II. BANGLADESH: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
1.
The World Bank Group Program in Bangladesh consists of an integrated package of
financial assistance including concessional IDA credits and IFC investments, along with
complementary analytical and advisory services. Collaboration and coordination between the
IMF and the World Bank on Bangladesh was described in last year’s Article IV staff report.
2.
Bangladesh is among the largest recipients of financial assistance from IDA. IDA’s
engagement in Bangladesh is guided by its Country Assistance Strategy which was discussed
and endorsed the Bank’s Board of Executive Director’s in April 2006. The CAS supports a
program of technical and financial assistance aimed at: (i) improving the investment climate
and (ii) empowering the poor. Cutting across both these goals, was a focus on improving
governance. During the CAS period, in line with its objectives, IDA committed US$2.69
billion, of which around 40 percent went for improving the investment climate by
strengthening infrastructure (energy, roads, transportation, water and sanitation), 17 percent
for empowering the poor by improving the delivery of education and health services, and 25
percent for strengthening governance.
3.
As part of this strategy, IFC provides direct support to the private sector in
Bangladesh, with an emphasis on: (i) private infrastructure; (ii) energy, including
investments in gas production and related infrastructure; (iii) manufacturing and service
sector companies; and (iv) innovative private sector sponsored projects in health and
education. IFC is also supporting the development of local capital markets and a competitive
banking sector through direct investments and institution building. Furthermore, to promote
SME development, IFC’s regional SME Facility, the South Asia Enterprise Development
Facility (SEDF), will continue to provide technical assistance to financial intermediaries,
SMEs and the professional service firms that support these SMEs. A separate facility, the
Bangladesh Investment Climate Facility (BICF), launched in 2007, will assist the
Government of Bangladesh to reforms its Investment Climate.
4.
Looking ahead, a new CAS is being prepared for Bangladesh covering (FY10-14). It
will be aligned with the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) II that is currently being finalized
by the government. This new CAS will build on the World Bank Group’s work in
Bangladesh so far and also help the government deal with some emerging challenges.
Specifically, the CAS is expected to focus on:




Increased resilience to climate change impact.
Improved Human Development and Social Protection
Improved Environment for Private Sector Investment and Growth:

The CAS will also continue to focus on improving governance as a cross cutting issue given
the important role it plays in strengthening service delivery.

ANNEX III. BANGLADESH: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
Lending and technical assistance operations
Bangladesh joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and, as of 31 December
2008, cumulative public sector lending amounted to almost US$10 billion for 192 loans, with
$183 million for technical assistance (TA) grants for 331 projects. The country is one of the
largest borrowers of concessional Asian Development Fund resources. The loans and TAs
have supported all key sectors including energy, transport, social infrastructure, agriculture,
and natural resources. AsDB has also supported eight private sector projects worth
$242 million, including the Meghnaghat Power Project—the first build-own-operate power
project in the country—and GrameenPhone, which substantially expanded rural access to
mobile phone services.
In 2008, the AsDB approved a total amount of US$592 million in loans. This included loans
to (i) enhance the capacity of the technical and vocational education and training system
(US$50 million); (ii) fill infrastructure financing gaps, encourage private sector investment,
and promote public–private partnership in infrastructure (US$165 million); (iii) support the
improvement of urban governance, infrastructure and service delivery (US$87 million);
(iv) contribute to sustainable economic growth by minimizing the devastating impact of
severe floods and a cyclone, and reducing future risk from similar disasters (US$120
million); and (iv) help expand targeted safety net programs (emergency assistance of US
$170 million).
Financial support from the AsDB is set to more than double in FY2010 from the level
recorded in FY2009 (US$599 million, see table). In October 2009, the AsDB approved a
loan of US$500 million under the countercyclical support facility (CSF, established in June
2009 to support AsDB's developing

Country Partnership Strategy
The current results-based country partnership strategy (CPS), covering the period 2006–10, is
part of a joint strategy prepared with the UK’s Department for International Development,
Government of Japan, and World Bank. Under this CPS, the AsDB is playing a major role in
the energy, transport, education, urban health, and urban water supply and sanitation sectors.
In other areas, such as agriculture (i.e., agribusiness), water resources management, the
financial sector and small- and medium-sized enterprise development, AsDB is supporting
initiatives led by other development partners. Disaster mitigation, regional cooperation,
gender, and environment continue to be addressed as key crosscutting issues. The CPS
emphasizes designing projects that are better prepared for implementation. This means
projects that are simpler; take into consideration capacity constraints; and include covenants
that are realistic, focused, and properly sequenced.
The Bangladesh country operations business plan for 2010-2012, approved in August 2009,
comprises 25 projects totaling about US$2.4 billion, including assistance for construction of
the Padma Multipurpose Bridge and promoting regional cooperation in South Asia. The TA
program for 2010-2012 consists of 29 projects, with an annual allocation of about of $6.2
million.
Cofinancing operations enable AsDB’s financing partners—governments or their agencies,
multilateral financing institutions, and commercial organizations—to participate in financing
AsDB projects. The additional funds are provided in the form of grants, official loans, or
credit enhancement products. In 2008, the Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation
(Sector) Project was provided with US$80 million loan cofinancing, of which US$60 million
was from Japan and US$20 million was from the OPEC Fund for International Development.
This project was also provided US$10 million in grant cofinancing from Canada. Switzerland
provided US$6 million and US$2.5 million in grant cofinancing for the Skills Development
Project and Post-Literacy and Continuing Education (Supplementary) Projects, respectively.
As of year-end 2008, cumulative direct value-added cofinancing for Bangladesh amounted to
US$1.2 billion for 26 investment projects, and US$58.4 million for 68 TA projects.
Economic and sector work program
Each year, the AsDB publishes its Asian Development Outlook, in which it assesses
macroeconomic performance. AsDB’s Bangladesh Resident Mission also publishes the
Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update. A bimonthly Economic Indicators Update has also
been launched. In support of AsDB’s Country Partnership Strategy (2006-2010) exercise,
several thematic assessments and sector studies were completed. These include: thematic
assessments for poverty, growth, and poverty reduction, private sector development,
governance, environment, and gender, and various sector studies.

ANNEX IV. BANGLADESH—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 9, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
most affected areas are national accounts, fiscal and trade statistics.
Real Sector Statistics: The paucity of source data remains the principal impediment to
improving national accounts statistics and adversely affects the ability of the Bangladesh Bureau
of Statistics (BBS) to absorb technical assistance aimed at improving compilation techniques.
The BBS does not conduct an annual national accounts survey of business enterprises, and
source data are primarily from benchmark surveys, a census of manufacturing establishments
conducted every two years, and biannual household expenditure surveys. Many of the benchmark
surveys were conducted over five years ago and are based on outdated sample frames.
The shortcomings in the data also affect compilation practices. And a system of price indices for
estimating national accounts at constant prices needs to be developed. A September 2009 TA
mission developed and agreed a detailed work program with the BBS for undertaking the
exercise of updating the base year from 1995/96 to 2005/06 and creating a comprehensive
benchmark estimate and new series with the new base year.
Price statistics: The CPI and PPI weights are outdated, which introduces uncertainty.
Government finance statistics: A 2008 STA multi-sector mission recommended additional
actions to strengthen the analytical usefulness of fiscal data, including to: improve the integration
of debt stocks and related financial flows; sensitize donors to the need to promptly provide
complete data on Direct Project Assistance; and establish an inter-agency committee to prepare a
migration plan to the GFSM2001.
Monetary statistics: Bangladesh Bank compiles monetary data using the standardized report
forms (SRFs) framework. The SRFs are reported electronically to the IMF on a regular basis. As
a result a consistent time series based on SRF data is available from December 2001.
Balance of Payments: In the area of goods transactions, the data are collected from different
data sources—exports are based on information from customs declarations and imports are based
on foreign exchange settlements. But efforts are underway to unify the source data based on
customs declarations only, in line with STA’s recommendations. This should help resolve
inconsistencies with the national accounts, where customs trade data are used in compiling net
exports of goods and services.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 23, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Bangladesh
On January 5, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2009 Article IV consultation with Bangladesh.1
Background
Bangladesh’s economy has held up remarkably well despite the global recession. Financial
contagion was contained by low levels of financial integration. Growth, estimated at 5.9 percent
for FY2009 (July 2008-June 2009), decelerated only modestly from the pace recorded in recent
years and remained broad-based. The limited impact of the global downturn on Bangladesh’s
growth partly reflects the relatively low overall trade openness, and the large share of basic
textiles and garments in total exports, which fared relatively well. The resilience of Bangladesh’s
exports contrasts with the experience in other countries in Asia where exports are still
substantially below the pre-crisis peak.
The external position strengthened considerably in FY2009 and the first four months of FY2010.
Strong remittances, resilient exports and weak imports caused the current account of the
balance of payments to record a surplus of almost 3 percent of GDP in FY2009, up from less
than 1 percent of GDP in FY2008. With the capital and financial account of the balance of
payments broadly in balance, the improvement in the current account caused a major rise in
gross international reserves during FY09. Reflecting also an SDR allocation from the IMF
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

2
(US$0.7 billion) and Asian Development Bank disbursements (US$0.6 billion), gross
international reserves exceeded US$10 billion in November, almost double the level in
November 2008. This is equivalent to 4.8 months of prospective imports, a 15-year high.
The strength of the external position put pressure on Bangladesh Bank (BB)’s monetary policy
framework. The improvement in the current account put upward pressure on the taka which BB
countered through unsterilized foreign exchange purchases. This caused banks’ excess
reserves to rise sharply, sending short-term interest rates below 1 percent. Over the summer,
with no measures taken to absorb liquidity, the monetary policy framework was rendered
virtually inoperative.
The accommodative monetary policy pushed up asset price inflation. A decline in international
food and commodity prices contributed to a fall in inflation to 2.2 percent in June 2009. But with
the accommodative monetary policy, upward pressures on real estate prices have became
visible and stock market prices have risen by 40 percent since end-March. As international food
and commodity prices began to rise again, inflation rose to 6.7 percent in October.
The FY2009 budget deficit remained below the budget target, despite revenue shortfalls, owing
to continued problems in implementing the Annual Development Program (ADP). Held back by
lower imports, customs revenue fell short of the target. As a result, the ratio of tax revenue to
GDP declined by 0.2 percent of GDP to 8.6 percent of GDP, falling short of the original budget
target by 0.6 percent of GDP. ADP spending fell short of the original budget by 1 percent of
GDP reflecting implementation bottlenecks. The overall fiscal deficit (including grants)
amounted to 3 percent of GDP, almost 1 percentage point of GDP smaller than envisaged in the
original budget. The counterpart to the lower deficit was mostly in lower than budgeted
disbursements of foreign loans.
In the area of structural reforms progress was mixed. Comprehensive plans to address
infrastructure bottlenecks, such as the power and gas shortages which are holding back growth,
remain under discussion. Progress in Public Private Partnerships (PPP) has been slow. The
reintroduction of interest rate ceilings on important categories of bank lending was a setback to
financial market development. The recent appointments made at the Boards of Directors of
three state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) were not fully in line with established regulations.
The FY2010 budget’s extension of para-tariffs and the introduction of a regulatory duty to a
large number of consumer goods raised nominal protection and is second-best to
comprehensive tax policy reform.
Amid continued uncertainty about the strength of the global recovery, Bangladesh’s growth
momentum is likely to remain somewhat subdued in the near term yet inflation seems set to
increase. Accordingly, growth could decelerate in FY2010 as economic activity is likely to be
held back by weak imports, particularly of capital machinery, sluggish exports and private sector
credit, and subdued hiring of Bangladeshi workers by employers abroad. The strong
performance of the agricultural sector in FY2009 will also be hard to exceed substantially. The
ample availability of liquidity along with adverse base effects related to last year’s
unprecedented decline in international food and commodity prices is likely to drive up inflation

3
throughout FY2010, possibly to double digits by the summer. As strong inflows of remittances
are expected to continue, the external position should remain strong and gross international
reserves should remain above a relatively comfortable 4 months of prospective imports.
Over the medium term, as global growth and trade recover, Bangladesh’s growth should edge
up as well, to around 6 percent per annum, building on increasing trade integration with
countries in the region and the rest of the world, and growth momentum in the agriculture,
services, and construction sectors. The current account can be expected to remain in surplus
with the import coverage of reserves remaining robust.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the strong performance of Bangladesh’s
economy, despite the global recession. They noted that growth has been supported by buoyant
domestic activity, including in agriculture and services. Directors considered that resilience in
exports as well as continued strong inflows of remittances also played an important role. They
noted that fiscal conservatism of the government has paid large dividends. Going forward,
Directors expected these trends to continue with medium-term growth in the baseline scenario
projected at a respectable 6 percent. However, they identified two policy issues.
First, Directors considered preventing an increase in inflation to be the immediate policy
concern. They observed that by stabilizing the exchange rate of the taka in the face of strong
remittance inflows, monetary policy has been too accommodative for the domestic conditions.
Directors welcomed the commitment made by BB to employ all available instruments to contain
inflation if and when there are clear signs of a pickup in prices. However, they saw a need for
preemptive and bold action by BB. Directors considered that the resulting higher market interest
rates would be a small price to pay to prevent a harmful acceleration of inflation, which hurts the
poor most severely.
Directors noted that greater flexibility in the exchange rate would support monetary policy
objectives. They were of the view that the authorities should move towards greater flexibility in
the exchange rate to lessen the constraints on macroeconomic policies. Directors observed that
the export sector should be able to sustain such a move, since they believed that the taka is
somewhat undervalued, though not far out of line with fundamentals. In Directors’ view,
increased day-to-day movements in the exchange rate would also help deepen the foreign
exchange market.
Second, for the medium term, Directors noted that measures should be taken to unleash
Bangladesh’s potential, while maintaining fiscal prudence and sustainability. Directors observed
that Bangladesh seems stuck in a low revenue-low capital spending equilibrium and
infrastructure bottlenecks are holding back growth. They agreed that higher growth could be
achieved through higher revenue and higher capital spending. Therefore, Directors strongly
encouraged the authorities to push through the plans for Value-Added Tax (VAT) reforms.

4
Directors noted that further financial deepening is needed to allow Bangladesh to achieve its
growth potential. In light of this, they observed that ceilings on lending rates and other nonprudential interventions should be removed as soon as possible. They considered that
increased flexibility of interest rates, including for National Savings Certificates (NSCs), would
make the auction process for government paper more efficient and give impetus to an active
secondary market. Directors noted this would also help offset the government’s higher interest
costs related to the needed monetary tightening. Directors encouraged the authorities to
accelerate the restructuring of SCBs.
Directors noted that continued improvement in the quality and timeliness of statistics would
improve policy making. They considered improvements in national account statistics to be
particularly urgent.
Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt a timetable for the removal of the remaining
exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, on the transferability of funds in
nonresident taka accounts.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
