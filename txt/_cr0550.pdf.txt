Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Algeria
Approved by Amor Tahari and Matthew Fisher
December 20, 2004

•

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Algiers during October 7–24, 2004. The
mission comprised J.E. De Vrijer (head), G. Sensenbrenner, T. Koranchelian, J. Wieczorek, and
N. Mwase (all MCD). F. Fischer (MFD) joined the mission to follow up on the 2003 FSAP.
S. Maherzi, Advisor to the Executive Director for Algeria, participated in the discussions.

•

The mission met with the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Algeria, the Delegate
Ministers for Financial Reform and for Participation and Investment Promotion, the Economic
Advisor to the President, other senior officials, and members of parliament. The staff team also met
with representatives from the business and diplomatic communities. A press conference was held at
the end of the mission.

•

At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation on January 14, 2004, Executive Directors
welcomed the strengthening of Algeria’s economic performance over 2002–03, but underscored the
need to reinvigorate structural and institutional reforms in order to achieve a lasting improvement in
private sector-led growth and employment. While they acknowledged that Algeria’s pressing social
and infrastructure needs will continue to call for high levels of public investment in the coming
years, Directors cautioned that the high level of public spending entails risks and urged the
authorities to tighten the fiscal stance. They also encouraged the authorities to implement the
Financial System Stability Assessment recommendations.

•

President Bouteflika won a second five-year term in April 2004 in a poll that international observers
found fairly contested.

•

Algeria accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, in September 1997.

•

Relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II.

•

Despite a number of weaknesses, Algeria’s statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance, with
the exception of prudential data on the banking sector. The authorities aim to subscribe to the SDDS.
Statistical issues are addressed in Appendix III.

•

The authorities have published the 2003 Article IV consultation report and the Financial System
Stability Assessment. They intend to publish the 2004 Article IV consultation report and Selected
Issues papers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments
•

Algeria’s real GDP growth increased from 3 percent per year in 2000–02 to 6 percent in
2003–04, largely reflecting the expansionary fiscal stance and rising hydrocarbon
production. The increase in oil prices has allowed Algeria to strengthen further its
external position.

•

The fiscal expansion in recent years has contributed to job creation, but unemployment
remains high. In addition, the vulnerability of public finances to oil price fluctuations
increased. Monetary policy has helped to keep inflation under control. Structural reforms
have stalled.

•

Following presidential elections, the government decided to push ahead with external
trade liberalization and other structural reforms, including in the banking sector. The
authorities have prepaid some external debt.

Policy discussions
Discussions focused on how to manage hydrocarbon resources, improve growth performance and
reduce unemployment.
•

The 2005 budget marks a turning point. While allowing for significant public investment
over the next five years, it delinks spending from volatile hydrocarbon revenue and
envisages a gradual fiscal consolidation over the medium term.

•

Sound management of high external inflows from hydrocarbon exports is key to improve
the outlook for private sector-driven economic growth and employment. The fiscal
adjustment planned by the government will gradually bring the nonhydrocarbon primary
deficit to a sustainable level. Staff urged the authorities to substantially reduce tax
exemptions, improve control over the wage bill, and strengthen the social safety net to
mitigate the social costs resulting from structural reforms.

•

Staff recommended setting the management of hydrocarbon revenue in a long-term
framework and transforming the oil stabilization fund into a savings/financing account
fully integrated into the budget.

•

The new fiscal stance should facilitate the Bank of Algeria’s task of managing the impact
of hydrocarbon revenue on monetary conditions and on the development of the financial
sector. Staff recommended handling the hydrocarbon company’s liquidity outside the
money market and absorbing any remaining excess liquidity. Given that currently there
are no signs of exchange rate misalignment, staff encouraged the authorities to continue
with their present exchange rate policy.

•

The authorities agreed with staff that Algeria’s favorable financial position and the new
electoral mandate present an excellent opportunity to accelerate structural and
institutional reforms. Key reforms include: modernizing the banking sector and
continuing external trade liberalization.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Algeria, an important hydrocarbon exporter, has made some progress in the
transition to a market economy.1 While restoring macroeconomic stability in the context
of Fund-supported programs during 1994–98, it undertook a number of important reforms,
including liberalizing prices and current international transactions, reforming tariffs, and
opening the hydrocarbon sector to foreign participation. The authorities closed or privatized
400 public entities, but some 1,200 public enterprises remain. An association agreement with
the European Union (EU) has been signed in 2002 and negotiations towards accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) are ongoing.
2.
However, Algeria lags behind most other Middle East and North African
(MENA) countries in economic reform. Economic management relies heavily on the state
and the institutional environment is weak (Figure 1). The financial sector largely consists of
public banks, which continue to be burdened by nonperforming loans to public enterprises.2
Furthermore, cumbersome regulations and high nonwage labor costs have led to the
emergence of a large informal sector. The public sector owns most agricultural land and a
large part of industrial real estate, while investment is largely driven by the state and
concentrated in the hydrocarbon sector.

The hydrocarbon sector represented 36 percent of GDP, 98 percent of exports, and almost 70 percent of
budgetary revenues in 2003.
2

The Treasury has repurchased some of these loans in three off-budget rounds in 1991-94, 1995-98, and 2001,
amounting to DA 1,130 billion or 27 percent of 2001 GDP.

(ERP).3 The resulting expansionary fiscal stance has contributed to an increase in real GDP
and job creation, but unemployment of about 24 percent at end-2003 is still very high
(Figure 2).4 The expansionary fiscal policy has increased the vulnerability of government
finances to oil price fluctuations (Box 1).

Box 1. Government Expenditure and GDP1
Government spending has moved strongly with hydrocarbon production. The correlation coefficient
between the annual change in government expenditure and the one-year lagged change in hydrocarbon GDP
is about 0.75.

Capital spending has a positive impact on growth. Empirical evidence suggests that government capital
expenditure induces an increase in real nonhydrocarbon GDP while government current expenditure does not.

See the selected issues paper on “Relationship between Government Expenditure and GDP,” (forthcoming).

The ERP was a capital expenditure program supplementing the budget. It amounted to about $7 billion
(8½ percent of 2004 GDP) and covered the period 2001–04.
4

The fiscal stance is measured by the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit in relation to nonhydrocarbon GDP.

President Bouteflika was reelected on April 8, 2004 with 85 percent of the votes.
Now that the security situation is better under control, the President has highlighted the need
to rationalize public finances and debt management, modernize the financial sector, and
develop the private sector, including through opening up public enterprises to partnerships
and privatization.

sectors, which largely
depends on government spending, increased sharply. The unemployment rate is expected to
decline somewhat further in 2004 (Box 2).
Box 2. Labor Market Developments
Low economic growth together with a fast growing population resulted in sharply rising unemployment,
which soared from 19.8 percent in 1990 to 29.5 percent in 2000.
The government pursued a wide range of employment programs, which include wage subsidies, labor
intensive public works, micro-finance programs, job replacement services and vocational training. It also
increased financial support to agriculture and small- and medium-sized enterprises through the ERP.
Furthermore, since 2001, in the context of a growing informal sector, it has reduced wage-based contributions
to foster employment opportunities in the formal sector. Employment in the private sector was 61 percent of
total employment.
Although on a declining path, registered unemployment remained high at 23.7 percent in 2003. The youth
unemployment rate was even higher at 45 percent. Unemployment was also unevenly distributed across the
country with almost 60 percent of the unemployed residing in urban areas.

increase from 13⅓ percent of
GDP in 2003 to 15½ percent in 2004. Despite early debt repayment, the overall balance of
payments surplus is expected to increase further in 2004. Gross external reserves reached
US$37.3 billion (almost 2 years of import cover) at end-September. The external debt-toGDP ratio is expected to decline from 35 percent in 2003 to 25 percent in 2004.

the exchange rate. In the
second semester of 2003, the Bank of Algeria (BA) intervened to offset the depreciation of
the dinar that had resulted from the appreciation of the euro against the dollar (Figure 6). In
2004, BA aimed to minimize the deviation of the REER from its end-2003 level, which it
considered as an equilibrium level. The REER appreciated by 1½ percent during the first
eight months of 2004. The spread between the illegal parallel market and the official
exchange rates remained large at about 25 percent.

5

Since 2001, Algeria has implemented a comprehensive tariff reform: the number of tariff categories was
reduced to four, and duty rates were lowered in two steps: the maximum rate was reduced, and the minimum
duty values were replaced with a temporary additional duty (droit additionnel provisoire-DAP) to be gradually
phased out by January 1, 2006. In 2004, the four tariff rates were 0, 5, 15, and 30 percent (average rate:
19.2 percent), and the DAP was 24 percent of customs duties, down from 60 percent in 2001. In 2004, other
import taxes (redevances douanières) have been replaced by a small fee.

The fiscal stimulus to overall
demand persisted in 2004 (Table 3).
The fiscal policy pursued since 2001
resulted in a sharp increase in public
spending from 47 percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP (NHGDP) in
2001 to 52 percent in 2004, a high
level compared to other countries
(Figures 7 and 8). The reduction of
import taxes and the decline in nontax
revenue are expected to result in a fall
in nonhydrocarbon revenue by
1½ percent of NHGDP in 2004. As a
result, the nonhydrocarbon primary
budget deficit is expected to increase
from 29½ percent of NHGDP in 2003
to almost 32 percent in 2004
(Figure 9). Nevertheless, higher
hydrocarbon revenue is expected to
strengthen the overall fiscal position.

Progress in the implementation of structural reforms has been slow in 2003–04.
The authorities have strengthened the performance contracts for public banks and progress is
being made in modernizing the payments system. Other reforms consisted of: (a) granting a
third cellular telephone license and liberalizing international telephone services;
(b) privatizing a few small enterprises; and (c) modernizing part of the legislative framework
in line with WTO rules, while pursuing negotiations towards Algeria’s WTO accession.6
11.
The authorities have actively managed public debt. They repaid US$0.9 billion
ahead of schedule to the African Development Bank and Saudi Arabia, and continued their
discussions on early repayment of Paris Club debt. In addition, the government swapped
DA 624 billion (10½ percent of GDP) non-tradable debt to public banks issued in the context
of past bank restructuring for tradable Treasury securities covering benchmark maturities of
up to 10 years.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Algeria maintains a long-standing close cooperation with the Fund. Fund
surveillance in recent years has focused on:
•

Maintaining macroeconomic stability. While staff has highlighted the risks
associated with the fiscal stance, the authorities were of the view that an expansionary
fiscal policy had a role to play in reducing unemployment. At the same time, they
have adopted a prudent monetary policy that helped maintain macroeconomic
stability.

•

Accelerating structural reforms. Staff has stressed the need to liberalize external
trade, reform the banking system, and accelerate other structural reforms to achieve
sustainable high growth and create productive jobs. The authorities have implemented
a comprehensive tariff reform with Fund technical assistance, signed an association
agreement with the European Union, and modernized their trade regime in line with
WTO rules. Progress in other structural reforms, including privatization, has been
slow.

•

Engaging in a more active debt management. Following a Fund technical
assistance mission, which designed a strategy for Algeria’s return to international
capital markets, the authorities repaid ahead of schedule 4 percent of the external
debt.7

13.
Recently, the authorities decided to move towards a sustainable fiscal policy, in
line with staff advice, and resume Algeria’s transition to a market economy. The 2005
6

New ordinances issued in 2003 cover (i) international trade; (ii) the organization of free trade zones;
(iii) various aspects of the protection of intellectual property in trade transactions; and (iv) competition.
A revision of the Code of Commerce is also under way.

budget envisages a gradual fiscal consolidation, while allowing for significant capital
spending. It also includes a direct subsidy to loss-making public enterprises to replace part of
public banks’ credit. In June 2004, parliament passed the government’s program for the next
five years, which aims at liberalizing the economy and envisages structural reforms,
including in the financial and public enterprise sectors, and the civil service.
A. Key Challenges and Outlook for 2005 and the Medium Term
14.
The main challenges facing the Algerian economy are how best to manage
hydrocarbon resources, improve growth performance and reduce unemployment. The
authorities agreed with staff that increased political stability and Algeria’s strong financial
position have created excellent conditions for implementing the government’s economic
reform program. Staff underscored that sound management of the large hydrocarbon
resources, prudent macroeconomic policies, together with interrelated structural and
institutional reforms would enable Algeria to complete its transition to a market economy
and stimulate private investment in order to diversify the economy and create jobs.
15.
Algeria’s economic outlook for 2005 is favorable.8 With high projected
hydrocarbon prices, the external position is expected to strengthen further. Real GDP growth
is projected to decline to 4–4½ percent, largely reflecting short-term capacity constraints on
hydrocarbon output. The planned fiscal consolidation and continuation of a prudent monetary
policy are expected to keep inflation subdued.
16.
The medium-term outlook is also encouraging. Real GDP growth is projected to
average 4½ percent during 2006–09, which would further reduce the unemployment rate to
about 17 percent by 2009.9 Despite the projected gradual decline in hydrocarbon prices,
hydrocarbon exports are expected to remain high through 2009.10 Given steady growth and
further reductions in customs tariffs, imports are expected to continue to rise. Nevertheless,
the external current account surplus would remain large over the period, and the external debt
is expected to decline further. International reserves, excluding the counterpart of the oil
stabilization fund, would remain at about 16 months of import cover by 2009. With the
envisaged fiscal consolidation, the vulnerability of government finances to oil price
fluctuations would be significantly reduced, and inflation is expected to remain low.
17.
The debt sustainability analysis shows that external and public debt would
remain sustainable over the medium term (Tables 7 and 8). The standardized stress tests
for external debt sustainability show that the external debt ratio could increase above
60 percent under extreme circumstances to finance the high pace of reserve accumulation
8

The baseline scenario is based on WEO oil price projections and on the fiscal consolidation envisaged in the
2005 government budget, but does not assume accelerated structural reforms.
9

Based on a labor force growth and labor productivity growth of 1½ percent per annum as in previous years.

10

According to the WEO projections, oil prices would decline from US$42.7 per barrel in 2005 to US$34 per
barrel by 2009.

- 13 -

assumed under the baseline scenario. The public debt sustainability analysis indicates that the
public debt-to-GDP ratio would decline in most circumstances.11 Even with large shocks, the
public debt ratio would decline after an initial increase. In view of the high oil dependency,
staff has analyzed the impact of a drop in oil prices to US$19 per barrel starting in 2005
together with stalled structural reforms, resulting in low growth. Under this scenario,
international reserves will decline to about 10 months of imports by 2009, and the
government would run fiscal deficits starting in 2005. Nevertheless, external and public debt
would remain sustainable.
18.
Accelerated structural reforms would improve further the medium-term
outlook. The projected economic growth rate under the baseline scenario would lead to a
sustained but gradual reduction in unemployment. To achieve higher growth and create more
productive jobs, the authorities need to accelerate the pace of structural and institutional
reforms, notably in the banking and public enterprise sectors. While undertaking these
reforms, additional spending will be required, including to mitigate their social costs (Box 3).

Box 3. Alternative Medium-Term Scenario
Staff has prepared an alternative scenario under which the authorities would decisively accelerate
structural reforms to help diversify the Algerian economy. Under this scenario, real nonhydrocarbon
GDP growth would increase to 5½ percent from 2008 and the unemployment rate would drop to about
15 percent by 2009.
To support these reforms, the authorities would need to resort to some additional judicious spending.
Thus, the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit would decline to 24 percent in 2009, compared to a level of
21 percent foreseen in the 2005 government budget under the baseline scenario, and inflation would be
slightly higher.

B. Management of Hydrocarbon Revenue
19.
Hydrocarbon wealth provides the means to support economic and social
development, but its management poses important challenges for macroeconomic
policies. While sizable government spending in the social sectors and on infrastructure would
be needed in the coming years to improve the conditions for private sector development and
reduce unemployment, the management of hydrocarbon revenue should take into account the
need to:
•

diminish the procyclicality of fiscal policy in light of hydrocarbon price volatility;

•

avoid Dutch disease, to sustain the competitiveness of the nonhydrocarbon tradables
sector;

•

ensure that hydrocarbon revenue is used in a transparent manner to minimize
governance problems and waste; and

•

save part of hydrocarbon wealth for future generations.

20.
Hydrocarbon revenue management, therefore, ought to be set in a long-term
framework (Box 4). Staff has presented to the authorities a long-term fiscal framework in
which the government saves each year a sufficient portion of hydrocarbon revenue so that the
return on these savings can finance the budget deficit once hydrocarbon resources are
depleted. Such an approach implies sustainable paths for the primary nonhydrocarbon deficit
and for public expenditure.
Box 4. Management of Hydrocarbon Wealth1
Staff’s long-term fiscal framework aims at preserving the permanent per capita income from
hydrocarbon wealth, in line with work done for other oil-exporting countries (e.g., Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan). The baseline scenario is based on the U.S. Geological Survey estimates of probable reserves
and assumes that these are exhausted by 2050. It also assumes that oil prices gradually decline to a long-term
level of US$25 per barrel after 2009, real NHGDP growth of 4 percent per annum, and an interest rate of
5 percent.
Under this scenario, cautious management of hydrocarbon wealth requires limiting the hydrocarbon
primary deficit to 22 percent of NHGDP on average during 2005–09. The deficit progressively declines
further in the outer years of the simulation (largely because of NHGDP growth); this deficit can then be
financed by income from net financial wealth.

21.
A savings/financing account would complete this framework. The regulations of
the current off-budget oil stabilization fund—Fonds de Regulation des Recettes (FRR)—do
not limit public expenditure, as the deficit levels included in recent budget laws have
shown.12 Staff suggested that the authorities initiate a review of the role and procedures of
the FRR. In this regard, it recommended that all hydrocarbon revenue be accumulated in the
FRR, which should only be used to finance the sustainable nonhydrocarbon primary deficit
and to repay public debt. To ensure full accountability and transparency, the FRR should be
integrated in the budget. BA should continue to manage the counterpart of the FRR, and the
FRR should receive the financial returns on this investment net of interest paid on public
debt.13
22.
The authorities were very interested in the long-term framework for managing
hydrocarbon revenue presented by staff. They also indicated that they would reconsider
the role of the oil stabilization fund, including transforming it into a savings/financing
account.
Fiscal Policy
23.
The 2005 budget marks a turning point in the fiscal stance and aims to reduce
the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit to 30.4 percent of NHGDP in 2005 from
31.8 percent in 2004.14 The authorities indicated that after providing fiscal stimulus in recent
years, they now intend to limit the vulnerability of government finances to oil price
fluctuations, in particular in light of the high wage bill and the loss of customs revenues
related to the ongoing external trade liberalization. Moreover, while hydrocarbon revenue is
projected to remain sizable over the medium term, in terms of NHGDP it would decline from
a peak of 47 percent in 2005 to 35 percent by 2009. The budget aims at delinking
government spending from volatile hydrocarbon revenue. While capital spending is expected
to remain at about 19 percent of NHGDP, containing the wage bill and active debt
management would reduce current spending from 32½ percent of NHGDP in 2004 to
30 percent in 2005 (Box 5).

12

In 2000, Algeria established the FRR, as part of the Treasury account at the central bank, in order to
(i) reconstitute the cushion of external reserves that had been used in 1998–99 during a period of low
hydrocarbon revenue; (ii) service public debt; and (iii) smooth expenditure.
13

Currently, the counterpart of the FRR is part of BA’s international reserves. To take into account the longterm investment needs of the FRR, BA has divided its investment portfolio into two benchmarks.
14

The 2005 budget is based on an oil price assumption of US$19 per barrel. The fiscal projections presented in
this report are based on the WEO oil price projections but otherwise are consistent with the government budget.

- 16 -

Box 5. 2005 Budget and Growth Consolidation Plan
The 2005-09 fiscal policy of the government rests on two pillars:
•

Launching the Growth Consolidation Plan, a capital expenditure program amounting to DA 3,800
billions (US$50 billion or 61 percent of 2004 GDP) over 2005-09. The plan aims at improving public
services (mainly justice), developing human capital, building a public infrastructure, supporting economic
activity (mainly agriculture), and expanding housing.

Reining in current spending, through (i) reducing the wage bill, which is currently at 50 percent of
current spending; (ii) pursuing active public debt management (early repayment and debt conversion);
and (iii) reducing subsidies by gradually revising administered prices on water, electricity, and
hydrocarbon products.

24.
Staff commended the authorities for their prudent budget, which, if
implemented, would put public finances on a sustainable path. The medium-term fiscal
projections included in the 2005 government budget imply that the transition from the 2004
nonhydrocarbon primary deficit to a sustainable level, as defined in the long-term fiscal
framework prepared by staff, would take place over five years. Pursuing this policy would
also ensure public debt sustainability over the medium term even under adverse shocks.

25.
The authorities broadly agreed on the need to reduce tax exemptions and
improve tax equity, in light of the significant reduction in customs tariffs underway.
They indicated the difficulty of this task, given that the bulk of these exemptions benefits
sensitive sectors, such as agriculture. Staff underscored that the resulting increase in tax
revenue could be used to reduce the tax wedge, which deters job creation in the formal
sector.
Controlling public expenditure over the medium term rests on containing the
26.
wage bill and careful selection of investment projects. Limiting the wage bill requires
aligning real wage growth to productivity growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector and
downsizing the civil service. The selection of investment projects should be based on costbenefit analyses and take account of the limited absorption capacity and resulting current
spending. To this end, staff urged the authorities to conduct a public expenditure review in
cooperation with the World Bank. Staff also stressed the need for adequate social safety net
measures aimed at mitigating the inevitable social costs of structural reforms.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

27.
Staff discussed with the authorities a monetary program that would keep
inflation low while allowing for an adequate expansion of credit to the economy. The
planned fiscal adjustment should facilitate BA’s task of managing the impact of
hydrocarbon-related inflows on monetary conditions and on the development of the financial
sector. The monetary authorities target broad money growth to achieve their inflation
objective, in the context of a managed float regime and extensive capital controls. BA’s
monetary program aims to limit broad money growth to less than 16 percent in 2004 and
14½ percent in 2005 by controlling base money growth.
However, as long as oil prices remain high, the state-owned hydrocarbon
28.
company’s (Sonatrach) deposits will fuel excess liquidity in the banking system, thus
constituting a potential threat to macroeconomic stability. The authorities were not very
worried by the increase in the liquidity resulting from Sonatrach’s large deposits in a public
bank. They indicated that these deposits carried conservative placement requirements that
effectively prevented the bank from extending credit.15 Nevertheless, they are considering
how to deal with Sonatrach’s deposits outside the money market. In order to increase BA’s
control over banking system liquidity and restore the signaling role of BA interest rates, staff
recommended that Sonatrach deposit the part of its resources not needed for operations in an
interest-bearing account at BA. It also urged BA to fully mop up any residual excess liquidity
in the banking system. In this regard, the securitization of BA claims on the Treasury would
provide an additional instrument to the deposit auctions.

15

Sonatrach has the bulk of its deposits in one public bank. It surrenders 100 percent of its exports proceeds to
BA, which credits Sonatrach’s account with the public bank in dinars.

- 18 -

29.
The authorities agreed that the flexibility that has characterized BA’s exchange
rate policy should be maintained. While continuing to be a managed float, Algeria’s
exchange rate policy should be directed to align the real exchange rate with its fundamental
determinants, namely relative productivity and real oil prices (Box 6). Staff recognized that
BA’s exchange rate policy had served the economy well and that the REER depreciation in
2002-03 had helped external competitiveness, and found no signs of a current
misalignment.16 Over the medium term, the authorities indicated that high import growth was
a new factor that they would consider when assessing the appropriate level of the exchange
rate. Staff pointed out that the foreign trade liberalization would be associated with a
tendency for real depreciation of the dinar. It stressed, however, that lasting gains in
competitiveness could only be secured through institutional and structural reforms. Staff also
encouraged the authorities to monitor closely the macroeconomic impact of the fiscal
consolidation, given that the latter is a key channel in the transmission of oil price
fluctuations to the economy.
Box 6. Equilibrium Exchange Rate1
The REER of the Algerian dinar varied significantly during the last decade. The Balassa-Samuelson
effect together with real oil prices explain the long-run evolution of the equilibrium REER and the
convergence speed towards equilibrium is 9 months, similar to the findings in other commodityexporting countries.
There are no signs of misalignment in the current exchange rate. The continuous departure of the
Algerian dinar rate from the stated objective was broadly consistent with the path of the estimated
equilibrium exchange rate. Furthermore, the appreciation of REER since the second half of 2003 was in
line with the long-run equilibrium exchange rate.

Country: Algeria’s Experience,” (forthcoming).

C. Structural Reforms

30.
Staff discussed with the authorities the experience in other transition economies
that shows that achieving high sustainable growth and creating productive jobs go hand
in hand with structural and institutional reforms (Figure 12). The authorities indicated
that they intend to step up structural reforms and gradually disengage from the productive
sectors in order to attract private investment, enable the transfer of know-how, and improve
growth prospects. Staff encouraged them to move ahead on two priority areas: reforming the
financial sector and further liberalizing external trade.

16

Competitiveness remains an issue, however, in light of the dominant position of the public enterprise sector
and the lack of export diversification.

Reform of the Financial Sector

31.
Staff has endeavored to follow up on the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (Box 7). It has not, however, obtained recent prudential data needed to assess the
soundness of the banking system. The authorities have started implementing some of the
Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) recommendations, including: (i) granting
subsidies to loss-making public enterprises in the 2005 budget to replace new bank credit;
(ii) strengthening the performance contracts for public banks; and (iii) making progress in
modernizing the payment system. The authorities are also considering privatizing a number
of public banks. However, banking supervision remains weak. Furthermore, the government
has recently sent a confusing signal about its intentions by prohibiting public entities from
dealing with private banks.
The authorities were receptive to staff recommendations for strengthening
32.
financial intermediation. Key actions would include:
•

Release public banks from financing loss-making public enterprises. Staff
welcomed the replacement of part of public banks’ credit to loss-making public
enterprises by government subsidies. These, however, should be framed in a
comprehensive enterprise restructuring plan, with clear guidelines on the relation
between public banks and these enterprises.

•

Enhance transparency, governance, and competition in the sector by:
(i) requiring public banks to only lend to creditworthy clients; (ii) rescinding the
recent prohibition for public entities to deal with private banks; and (iii) publishing
public banks’ performance contracts and ex-post evaluations.

- 20 -

Box 7. FSAP Follow-Up
A BA audit for the 2003 FSAP of large exposures of the five largest public banks (based on end-2002 data)
found a provisioning shortfall, which, if recognized, would have brought the solvency ratio of public banks to
minus 6 percent from the official number of 14.8 percent. BA has indicated that such an audit had not been
repeated. No comprehensive update of prudential data was available.
The following can be reported with respect to some FSSA recommendations (Country Report 04/138):
Recommendations

Actions

Follow-Up

Privatize public
banks over the
medium term

• Quickly sell the two healthiest
public banks. Give remaining
banks five years to prepare
for privatization; curtail
operations if no bidders.
• Make shareholder control of
managers much tougher.
• Fully finance unviable public
enterprises and programs
through budget
appropriations; pursue public
enterprise reform.

• The authorities are considering privatizing a number
of public banks but no details are available.
• The Ministry of Finance more systematically
controls public bank managers, who report quarterly
on performance contracts with quantitative and
qualitative objectives on profitability, productivity,
quality of the loan portfolio, loan recovery,
management and control, etc. No sanctions have
been imposed so far, but some public banks report
tighter lending and provisioning practices.
• The 2005 budget includes DA 35 billion for
operating subsidies to loss-making public
enterprises. Work is ongoing to determine residual
stock losses and prospective flow losses. No
information is available on budget allocations
beyond 2005 and enterprise restructuring plans.

Improve the bank
operating
environment to
cut intermediation
costs

• Improve accounting and
audit.
• Make supervision proactive.
• Strictly enforce provisioning
rules.
• Modernize payment system.

• The accounting reform project, launched in 2002, is
now in its final stage. Implementation is planned for
end-2007.
• Banking supervision is recruiting and training
additional inspectors. On-site inspections have
focused on domestic private banks that represent
2 percent of system assets.
• No information on required and actual provisioning
is available.
• Payment system reforms are proceeding with World
Bank assistance for completion by end-2005. A
contractor for the real-time gross settlement system
has been selected. Bids for retail payment reform
were opened recently.

Modulate
hydrocarboninduced liquidity
and credit cycles
that curtail banks’
risk-taking

• Increase domestic debt
issuance to manage liquidity.
• Prepay some foreign debt.
• Create legal infrastructure for
repo market.

• Net domestic debt has increased marginally.
• Foreign debt is being repaid out of the FRR.
• The conversion of restructuring bonds into tradable
instruments will foster repo transactions.

- 21 -

•

Significantly intensify efforts to strengthen banking supervision, in particular by
improving on-site and off-site supervision of the large public banks, and strictly
enforcing prudential rules. Staff also encouraged the authorities to enhance BA’s
supervisory capacities, speed-up the implementation of the new information system
for reporting bank data, and undertake risk-based surveillance that ensures effective
early warning.

•

Formulate an action plan for privatizing several public banks. Staff stressed that
selling one public bank quickly to a reputable foreign bank would be important for its
demonstration effect and would help contain the cost of restructuring other public
banks.

External Trade Liberalization

33.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to trade liberalization. It noted their
intention to ratify the EU Association Agreement soon, and the multilateral trade
liberalization efforts since 2001, such as the tariff reform, the gradual phasing out of the
temporary additional duty (droit additionnel provisoire) and the elimination of the customs
tax (redevances douanières) in 2004. The mission encouraged the authorities to speed-up the
negotiations to join the WTO, and urged them to abolish all regulations in breach of WTO
rules.
There is a need to further improve customs administration. While welcoming
34.
improvements in the inspection targeting system, staff urged the authorities to strengthen
customs administration and simplify procedures to speed up clearance and more effectively
combat corruption and smuggling.
Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen regional cooperation. It
35.
emphasized that regional integration can buttress the multilateral liberalization policy and
expressed its readiness to provide technical assistance. The authorities welcomed staff’s
proposal to organize a regional seminar in the spring of 2005 on trade facilitation in the
Maghreb countries.
Other Structural Reforms

36.
Alongside strengthening financial discipline of public enterprises, staff
encouraged the government to continue its efforts to reduce its involvement in the
productive sector. It considered that subjecting privatization to the maintenance of
employment and activity hinders a successful privatization program. The mission proposed
replacing these constraints with social safety net measures to accompany the privatization
program. To increase job creation in the formal sector, staff recommended reducing nonwage
labor costs.
Concerning the exchange system, staff raised the issue whether the large spread
37.
between the official and the illegal parallel market exchange rates is related to problems with
current account convertibility, in particular regarding conversion for travel and making other

- 22 -

payments for invisible transactions. The authorities replied that the spread mainly reflects
large informal imports and tax evasion, and that the ceilings on travel allowances are
indicative only. Staff welcomed the authorities’ interest in Fund technical assistance to
ensure free convertibility for international current transactions and to develop the foreign
exchange market.
Strengthening governance is key to improving the business climate. Algeria made
38.
some progress in this respect: BA publishes its comprehensive annual report as well as all
banking laws and regulations, and the Ministry of Finance publishes budget and draft budget
laws, as well as reports on economic developments. Looking forward, staff recommended
(i) ensuring disclosure of government documents and adopting a law to this effect;
(ii) undertaking audits of public enterprises based on international standards and publishing
the results; and (iii) adopting a code of conduct for the civil service and strengthening
financial disclosure by state officials.
The authorities broadly shared the fiscal ROSC recommendations and have
39.
started implementing them. In particular, they are preparing a draft organic public finance
law to improve budget procedures and transparency of public finances. Staff encouraged the
authorities to continue implementing the other recommendations of the ROSC (Box 8).

Box 8. Fiscal ROSC
Although Algeria has carried out reforms over the past few years, the 2004 fiscal ROSC mission found
that the country meets the standard of the fiscal transparency code only in a limited number of areas.
Available fiscal data refer for the most part only to central government. Quasi-fiscal activities of stateowned banks and public enterprises remain inaccurately measured. The legal framework governing
budget preparation and execution, as well as government accounting and auditing, is not always
enforced. Finally, little information is disseminated regarding budget operations and the state of
government finance. Recommendations of the draft fiscal ROSC include:
•

Improve information provided to Parliament and the public, notably in the annual budget
law and through a broader dissemination of the existing fiscal data.

•

Clarify the roles of the various stakeholders in the public sector by enacting an organic law
governing financial legislation, limiting the use of special treasury accounts, replacing the
quasi-fiscal activities of public entities with direct support from the budget, and reforming local
government financing.

•

Strengthen fiscal management by modernizing the budget classification system and the
accounting framework, strengthening the audit system, and fully developing a medium-term
budgetary framework.

- 23 -

IV. OTHER ISSUES

40.
Staff commended the authorities for their active debt management and
welcomed their interest in making repurchases to the Fund ahead of schedule. It
encouraged them to take advantage of Algeria’s strong financial position to adopt a more
ambitious approach in repaying expensive debt ahead of schedule, and also to seek a
settlement of issues related to the debt to Russia. The authorities are also considering
officially requesting the rating agencies for a sovereign rating, as recommended by staff.
The authorities agreed with the principle of participating in the Enhanced
41.
Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. They indicated, however, that the
majority of Algerian debt is in kind, and considered not eligible for restructuring. The
authorities also noted that debt to Algeria had not been reimbursed, despite the clause of
comparable treatment of creditors.
Staff noted the efforts made by the National Statistics Office to improve the
42.
national accounts statistics, and change the consumer price index base scheduled for end2004. It regretted, however, the lack of prudential data on the financial sector. Staff urged the
authorities to start preparing such data. It also recommended that Algeria move ahead in
modernizing the compilation of its economic and financial statistics based on the GDDS
standard before following through on the authorities’ intention to subscribe to the SDDS.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts with regard to anti43.
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT). The
authorities have established a Financial Intelligence Unit and submitted to parliament a draft
AML-CFT law.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

44.
Over the last three years, Algeria has succeeded in increasing economic growth
while keeping inflation low, but progress in creating a market economy was slow.
Growth was mainly driven by favorable developments in the hydrocarbon sector, the
expansionary fiscal stance, and the recovery in agriculture. In tandem, unemployment came
down gradually from its peak in 2000, but remains very high. Monetary management, in a
context of large external surpluses and a highly liquid banking system, was thus far able to
keep inflation under control. While progress continued to be made in liberalizing external
trade, other structural reforms stalled.
The main challenges facing the Algerian authorities in the period ahead are to:
45.
(i) achieve high, sustainable growth and make a significant dent in unemployment; and
(ii) manage the hydrocarbon wealth. The first challenge requires creating a business
environment conducive to private investment, which is key to diversifying the economy and
creating productive jobs. The large prospective hydrocarbon revenues allow for significant
public expenditure to support private sector development. At the same time, it is important to
reduce the vulnerability of public finances to oil price fluctuations and closely coordinate
fiscal and monetary policy to maintain macroeconomic stability.

46.
The policy reforms outlined in the 2005 budget and the economic program of the
government for the next five years go in the right direction. The increased political
stability and Algeria’s strong financial position have created an excellent window of
opportunity to effectively undertake these reforms without delay.
The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the 2005 budget is appropriate in light of
47.
the very expansionary stance of previous years. The containment of spending in 2005 is a
step towards reducing fiscal vulnerability. At the same time, government outlays on
infrastructure and in the social sectors remain significant. Given the sizable ongoing
reduction in customs tariffs, it is crucial to drastically reduce tax exemptions in order to
broaden the tax base and remove distortions.
The medium-term fiscal stance presented in the 2005 budget would gradually
48.
reduce the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit to a sustainable level, but the envisaged
spending adjustment will not be easily accomplished. In light of the projected decline in
oil prices in 2006 and beyond, this fiscal consolidation is appropriate. At the same time, it
will be important to strengthen the social safety net in order to mitigate the social costs of
planned structural reforms. Staff considers that controlling public expenditure requires strict
control of the wage bill and a careful selection of investment projects. Real government wage
increases should not exceed productivity increases in the nonhydrocarbon sector, while the
wage bill should be contained by downsizing the bloated civil service. In order to ensure a
high-quality public investment program, staff recommends that the government, in
cooperation with the World Bank, undertake a public expenditure review.
Staff encourages the authorities to set the fiscal management of hydrocarbon
49.
revenue in a long-term framework that is compatible with the sustainable spending of
hydrocarbon resources. It also recommends transforming the current hydrocarbon
stabilization fund into a savings/financing account that is fully integrated into the budget.
The planned fiscal consolidation will alleviate the burden on monetary policy to
50.
keep inflation under control. Nevertheless, monetary developments need to be closely
watched as the large excess liquidity in the banking system would continue to carry the risks
of an increase in inflationary pressures and nonperforming loans. Therefore, staff
recommends that part of Sonatrach’s liquidity be deposited directly at the BA and underlines
the need for the central bank to fully absorb any remaining excess liquidity.
BA’s exchange rate policy has served the economy well and currently there are
51.
no signs of misalignment. Staff encourages the authorities to continue implementing the
managed float in a flexible manner.

52.
Market-based structural reforms need to be implemented in a decisive manner.
Banking sector reform is a priority in this regard. Staff emphasizes the need to intensify
efforts aimed at putting financial relations between public banks and public enterprises on a
sound footing, and to significantly strengthen banking supervision. Transferring control of
several public banks to reputable foreign banks is essential to inject fresh know-how. The

- 25 -

ongoing foreign trade liberalization is key to integrating Algeria into the world economy.
Staff encourages the authorities to step up their efforts to modernize customs entry points and
accompany this opening up with greater regional cooperation. Staff also encourages the
authorities to embark on more ambitious privatization and further reduce the tax wedge to
help create jobs in the formal sector.
53.
Staff welcomes the interest of the authorities in Fund technical assistance to
ensure free convertibility for international current transactions and develop the foreign
exchange market.
Staff recommends a more ambitious approach to early repayment of external
54.
debt. It encourages the authorities to pursue their discussions with Russia to settle bilateral
debt issues. Staff also encourages Algeria to consider full participation in the enhanced HIPC
initiative.

55.
While Algeria has made some progress in improving transparency, it remains
important to vigorously address governance issues. Further efforts are needed to publish
government documents, undertake financial audits of public enterprises and publish the
results, strengthen financial disclosure by state officials, and implement the recommendations
of the forthcoming fiscal ROSC report. Algeria has published the Article IV consultation
reports since 2000.
Staff welcomes the efforts to improve the statistical base. Although data provision
56.
to the Fund is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, staff urges the authorities to
improve data provision on the banking sector, which is inadequate. Staff recommends that
Algeria subscribes to the GDDS before subscribing to the SDDS.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Algeria take place on the
57.
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ This includes the impact of banks' restructuring packages. The conversion of banks claims on public
enterprises in bank claims on the government results, other things being equal, in a decrease of credit to the
economy and an equal increase in credit to the government. The adjustment amounted to about DA 216 billion
in 2000, DA 311.6 billion in 2001, and DA 297 billion in 2002. The flow of net credits to the economy in 2003
(17.5 percent annual growth) exceeded the stock difference between 2002 and 2003, because of the liquidation
of two private banks.
2/ This includes the debt-rescheduling proceeds blocked in special accounts at the Bank of Algeria.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g =
real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and
rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Assumes that oil prices drop to 19$ per barrel and NHGDP growth rate declines by an average of 1 percentage point per year compared to the baseline scenario during 2005-09.
7/ This test assumes new external borrowing in order to achieve the same accumulation of reserves as in under the baseline scenario.
8/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt
inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - p (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Assumes that oil prices drop to 19$ per barrel iand NHGDP growth rate declines by an average of 1 percentage point per year compared to the baseline scenario during 2005-09.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement

From January 21, 1974 to October 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was determined on
the basis of a fixed relationship with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time to time. On
October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through daily
fixing sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by an
interbank foreign exchange market as of January 2, 1996. Algeria’s exchange regime is
currently classified as a managed float with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. At
the end of November 2004, the average of the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar was
US$1 = DA 73.03, equivalent to SDR 1 = DA 112.17. No margin limits are imposed on the
buying and selling exchange rates in the interbank market, except for a margin of DA 0.017
between the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Algeria for the dinar against the
U.S. dollar.
Full surrender requirements are in effect on hydrocarbon export proceeds. Limits on the
making of payments for invisible transactions and current transfers, which have remained
since Algeria accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3 and 4, in 1997, are
indicative according to the authorities. Controls on capital transactions are extensive.
Last Article IV Consultation

The discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultation with Algeria were held in Algiers during
October 1–13, 2003. The staff report (Country Report 04/33) was discussed by the Executive
Board on January 14, 2004 and published on February 10, 2004.

APPENDIX II

Algeria: Relations with the World Bank

(As of October 31, 2004)
The World Bank’s portfolio in Algeria comprises 11 active operations and 62 closed loans,
with cumulative net commitment of $4.5 billion, of which $3.2 billion have been repaid. Net
commitments for the 11 current operations amount to $474 million.
The Country Assistance Strategy is dated June 2003. The main goal of the Bank’s
partnership is to support the reforms to accelerate growth, generate employment, and reduce
poverty and vulnerability. The Bank will focus its support on (i) fiscal sustainability and
hydrocarbon revenue management; (ii) removing constraints to private sector-led growth;
and (iii) articulating and implementing a strategy for better public service delivery. To that
effect, a program of analytical and advisory services, institutional capacity building, demand
driven lending and/or risk mitigation through structured loans, hedging products, and
guarantees is being implemented.
Loan approvals in FY00 ($97m), FY01 ($42m), FY02 ($31m), and FY03 ($183m) supported
the Algerian government in its effort to implement policy and institutional reform in the
telecommunications, energy and mining, and transport sectors, budget system, financial
system infrastructure modernization, mortgage finance, rural employment, as well as
capacity to respond to earthquake and flood emergencies. No new loans were approved in
FY04 and none is in the pipeline for FY05. The government is not interested in World Bank
lending given the current macroeconomic and fiscal situation.
The quality of the Algeria portfolio improved over the last few years following strong
measures to enhance supervision and close old and poorly performing operations. However,
procurement processes in Algeria are slow and require intensive supervision and rigorous
support for institutional development. Five projects are scheduled to close this fiscal year.
In some cases, extensions may be requested but will be dependent on meeting certain
conditionalities.
A Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) is ongoing. A Country Financial
Accountability Assessment is scheduled in FY05. An IDF grant to strengthen the monitoring
and evaluation capacity in the Direction Générale des Relations Financières Extérieures
(DGRFE) of the Ministry of Finance is being implemented. It supports DGRFE in the area
of coordination, assessment, and monitoring and evaluation of donor-funded projects. All
these should help further improve portfolio performance.
Recent analytical work has included a private sector assessment, an investment climate note,
a macroeconomic strategy note, a financial sector assessment report and an agriculture/rural
development note. Work has started on poverty analysis, judicial system, education and
transport.

APPENDIX III

Algeria: Statistical Issues

Following the expiration of the extended arrangement in May 1998, the reporting of statistics
to the Fund generally deteriorated, particularly with respect to the overall quality and
timeliness of data reported between missions. The lack of financial resources allocated to the
compilation of statistics, insufficient inter-agency coordination, as well as concerns about
accuracy and subsequent reluctance to publish provisional data, are partly responsible for this
situation. If this deteriorating trend is not reversed it may reach a point where adequate
surveillance is not possible.
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission designed an action plan in a manner that
would facilitate Algeria’s eventual subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS). STA believes that the optimal strategy for Algeria to subscribe to the SDDS is to
participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) as an interim step. The GDDS
would provide a comprehensive and consistent framework for improving Algeria’s statistics,
attract the required technical assistance from the Fund and other donors, and serve to signal
to the world Algeria’s seriousness about improving its statistics.
Real sector

Real sector data is being reported to STA on an irregular basis and sometimes with
substantial lags. IFS import trade data at current prices are derived from Direction of Trade
Statistics. The September 2002 multisector statistics mission recommended that priority be
given to move the compilation of national accounts according to 1993 SNA. An STA mission
visited Algiers during March 2004 to assist the National Statistical Office with the
development of quarterly national accounts. A follow-up mission was conducted late
November/early December 2004. The first quarterly data are expected to be ready for
publication by the end of the year.
Government Finance

Algeria reported government finance statistics (GFS) for the period 1994–2002 for
publication in the GFS Yearbook. However, the institutional coverage of the data reported is
limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts. Clarification has been sought
from the authorities regarding the important question of the basis of recording of the latter
(net versus gross recording). No sub-annual data are submitted for IFS publication.
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission recommended the designation of a
coordinator and the assignment of at least one economist for the compilation of GFS data.
The authorities have not yet followed up on their initial intention to assign GFS leadership to
the General Directorate of Accounting in the Ministry of Finance. A first task would be the
establishment of an automated bridge table between the detailed monthly Treasury ledger
(Balance générale), regularly produced by the latter, and the GFS table (Situation Résumée
des Opérations du Trésor —SROT) in order to ensure a more timely production of quarterly

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

and monthly GFS, as well as a more timely report to the Fund of annual and quarterly data.
The on-going changeover to an enhanced chart of accounts of the Treasury would offer an
ideal opportunity to revamp the way GFS compilation is organized and carried out in
Algeria.
The mission further recommended (a) that proceeds of the oil stabilization fund (FRR) be
shown as revenue (rather than financing); (b) the compilation of more detailed breakdowns,
in particular relating to the item “other transfers”; (c) a more appropriate reporting of the
three large debt assumption operations carried out over the past decade; and (d) further work
on the financing and the reconciliation with monetary statistics. The mission noted that
meeting the GDDS and eventually the SDDS standards would require substantial efforts in
terms of extension of coverage (consolidating the operations of social security and Wilayate,
and subsequently of other administrative bodies and municipalities).
Monetary Accounts

Monetary data are broadly adequate for policy formulation and monitoring of economic
developments. In particular, coverage has improved with the consolidation of data from the
national savings bank (CNEP). However, reporting of balance sheet data by some
commercial banks is very untimely, and most commercial banks do not report complete data
needed to compile the monetary survey. Prudential data reported by banks are untimely and
very unreliable. The September 2002 STA multisector statistics mission recommended
expanding further the coverage of the monetary survey to include banking operations of the
National Mutual Fund for Agriculture (CNMA) and strictly enforcing the reporting
obligations of banks by introducing high penalties.
Balance of Payments

The September 2002 multisector statistics mission noted the following: (i) the Bank of
Algeria ’s legal authority to collect data is limited to banking and financial institutions only;
(ii) data sources need to be expanded by conducting enterprise surveys in addition to
traditional exchange-based records; (iii) a more rigorous and uniform application of the
residency criterion should be followed; (iv) quarterly data are compiled but not regularly
disseminated; and (v) international investment position data are not compiled. Algeria does
not report Balance of Payments data to STA, and there are no BOP data in IFS or in the
BOPSY.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Algeria
On January 12, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Algeria.1
Background
Faced with low growth and high unemployment—and in the context of buoyant hydrocarbon
revenue—Algeria adopted a four-year fiscal stimulus plan in 2001. Real GDP growth has
strongly recovered from its slowdown in 2000. Inflation has remained subdued, and the
country’s external position has strengthened significantly. The pick-up in growth has also led to
a considerable drop in the still high unemployment rate, while the fiscal stimulus could increase
fiscal vulnerability.
Algeria’s economic performance was favorable in 2004. Real GDP growth is expected to
decrease to about 5½ percent in 2004 from 7 percent in 2003, due to a slowdown in the
expansion of hydrocarbon output and in agriculture following the 2003 bumper crop. As a result,
the unemployment rate is expected to continue to decline.
The rise in the oil price on international markets has further strengthened Algeria’s external
position. Despite strong import growth, the external current account surplus is projected to
increase further in 2004, reflecting higher hydrocarbon export prices. Gross external reserves
increased to US$37.3 billion by end-September, covering almost two years of imports.
After early debt repayment of about US$900 million to the African Development Bank and Saudi
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Arabia, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 35 percent in 2003 to
25 percent this year.
The fiscal stimulus to overall demand persisted in 2004. The government’s fiscal policy is
expected to lead to an increase in the primary nonhydrocarbon budget deficit from 29½ percent
of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2003 to almost 32 percent in 2004. Nevertheless, higher oil prices
are expected to allow for an overall stronger fiscal position.
Monetary developments were characterized by a significant rise in the amounts of the central
bank’s liquidity absorption, in the context of a substantial increase in net foreign assets. Broad
money growth is expected to be contained to about 16 percent in 2004, and inflation to remain
below 4 percent.
While structural reforms remained slow, some progress was achieved in banking reform and
trade liberalization. The authorities have strengthened public banks’ performance contracts and
advanced in modernizing the payment system. They also revised part of the legislative
framework in line with WTO rules, while pursuing negotiations towards Algeria’s WTO
accession.
Following presidential elections, the government strengthened its resolve to push ahead with
external trade liberalization and other structural reforms, including in the banking sector.
The fiscal policy proposed in the 2005 budget represents a turning point in the direction of
government finances. With the control of public expenditure outlined in the budget, the
nonhydrocarbon primary deficit in percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP is projected to be reduced
gradually over the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Algeria’s strong macroeconomic performance in recent years,
which has been marked by higher economic growth, low inflation, and rapidly growing
international reserves. Unemployment has come down gradually, although it remains very high.
Favorable world energy prices played a major role in achieving these results, but a fiscal
stimulus also added impetus to economic growth. Furthermore, Algeria’s economic outlook for
2005 and beyond remains favorable.
Going forward, Directors called on the authorities to seize the opportunity provided by the
current favorable economic climate and improved security situation to consolidate
macroeconomic stability, sustain high economic growth, and significantly reduce
unemployment. The key challenges in achieving these objectives will be to accelerate the
transition to a market economy, diversify the sources of economic growth, and establish a
framework for sound management of the country’s hydrocarbon wealth. To meet these
challenges successfully, the Algerian authorities will need to accelerate the implementation of
structural reforms, with emphasis on strengthening the financial sector, creating a business
environment conducive to private investment, and increasing the competitiveness and resilience
of the economy.

-3Directors acknowledged that achieving the appropriate balance between using large
hydrocarbon revenues for investment in physical and human capital to accelerate the transition
to a more diversified market economy and saving the hydrocarbon wealth for future generations
represents a key challenge for a natural resource-rich economy. In this context, they considered
that within a fiscally prudent framework, the Algerian authorities should persist in their efforts to
transform the economy. They welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to set fiscal policy
within a long-term framework that delinks public spending from fluctuations in hydrocarbon
revenue. Many Directors supported the idea of transforming the current hydrocarbon
stabilization fund into a savings/financing account that is fully integrated into the budget.
Directors commended the authorities for the prudent medium-term fiscal policy presented in the
2005 budget. They noted that the planned fiscal consolidation will put the public finances on a
path that is compatible with the sustainable spending of hydrocarbon resources. Directors
regarded the containment of spending in 2005 as a first step towards reducing fiscal
vulnerability. They acknowledged that priority capital and social spending should be protected,
including programs for human capital development, and noted the sizeable capital budget
planned for the medium term. However, they stressed that the investment process will need to
be carefully managed to reduce waste, minimize the impact on current spending in the future,
and enhance transparency. They underscored the importance of careful selection of public
investment projects on the basis of efficiency and absorptive capacity considerations. In this
context, Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to conduct a public expenditure review in
cooperation with the World Bank. They also supported the development of an adequate social
safety net to help cushion the adverse short-term impact of reforms. Directors also emphasized
the importance of increasing non-hydrocarbons revenue through strengthening tax
administration and broadening the tax base.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continuing resolve to focus monetary policy on maintaining
low inflation. They reiterated their concern about the potential impact of the high excess liquidity
on macroeconomic stability and financial system soundness. Therefore, most Directors
encouraged the authorities to deal with the hydrocarbon company’s deposits outside the money
market and to mop-up the residual excess liquidity.
Directors observed that managed float of the exchange rate continues to serve the country well.
They welcomed the Bank of Algeria’s commitment to continue implementing the managed float
in a flexible manner to bolster resilience to external shocks and export diversification prospects.
Directors supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance to improve the
exchange system and develop the foreign exchange market to help reduce the large spread
between the official and parallel market exchange rates.
Directors urged the authorities to give priority to developing an efficient and sound banking
system. They drew attention to the adverse impact on the banks’ balance sheets stemming from
lending to loss-making state-owned enterprises. Directors therefore welcomed the tighter
control of public bank managers and the inclusion of subsidies in the 2005 budget to replace
some loans to loss-making enterprises. They emphasized, however, that these subsidies should
be temporary and set in the context of a public enterprise restructuring program. Directors also
called for implementation of the other recommendations made in the 2003 Financial System
Stability Assessment. They urged the authorities to reverse the decree prohibiting public entities

-4from dealing with private banks, to move ahead with the privatization of a number of public
banks, and to significantly strengthen bank supervision. They welcomed the establishment of a
Financial Intelligence Unit, and encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the
implementation of legislation to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors commended the important progress achieved in trade liberalization and the
authorities’ commitment to reform trade within a multilateral framework, ahead of joining the
World Trade Organization. In particular, they welcomed the continuing implementation of the
comprehensive tariff reform since 2001 and look forward to early ratification of the EU
Association Agreement. They encouraged the authorities to improve customs administration in
order to combat corruption and smuggling more effectively, and to strengthen regional
cooperation.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce the state’s direct involvement in the productive
sectors through more rapid and extensive privatization of state-owned enterprises.
They cautioned that making privatization conditional on the maintenance of jobs and activity
could hinder the privatization program, and recommended replacing these conditions with social
safety net measures. More generally, Directors called for a clear articulation of Algeria’s
privatization strategy so as to provide unambiguous signals to private investors.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to improve governance, which they
considered crucial to improve the investment climate and prospects for private sector-led
growth. They welcomed the preparation of a draft organic public finance law to improve fiscal
transparency, and urged the authorities to take further steps to improve transparency, including
implementation of the recommendations of the 2004 Fiscal Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC).
Directors welcomed the authorities’ active debt management and looked forward to an early
resolution of bilateral debt issues with Russia. Several Directors saw room for a more ambitious
approach to the pre-payment of external debt, given Algeria’s high level of foreign reserves.
Although commending the authorities’ decision to grant debt relief on a case-by-case basis to
HIPC-eligible countries, Directors encouraged Algeria to participate fully in the enhanced HIPC
Initiative.
Directors welcomed the ongoing efforts to address Algeria’s statistical weaknesses. They urged
the authorities to strengthen data coverage, quality, and timeliness, particularly with respect to
banking sector data. In this regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to join the General
Data Dissemination System, with a view to subscribing subsequently to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Algeria
January 12, 2005

1.
My Algerian authorities thank staff for their well-focused report and informative
Selected Issues paper. They appreciate the high-quality technical assistance and policy
dialogue and helpful advice. They value highly the Board’s and staff views in support of their
continued commitment to stabilization and reforms, leading to significant achievement over
the past decade, including in attaining macroeconomic stability and considerably improving
the institutional environment. At the same time, the authorities’ efforts have improved the
security conditions and increased political stability, particularly following the April 2004
Presidential Elections. The authorities, however, are cognizant of the challenges ahead for
attaining sustained high private sector-led growth that would allow a permanent reduction in
unemployment and improve social welfare. As indicated in their medium-term economic
program, they are determined to take advantage of the progress achieved thus far and the
prevailing favorable conditions to press ahead with the remaining reform agenda.
2.
Macroeconomic indicators continued to strengthen in 2004, leading to the
achievement of 5.5 percent growth on average over the three-year period of the Economic
Recovery Plan (ERP), which resulted in a per capita gain of over 3 percent per year. Though
still high, unemployment has declined. Prudent monetary policy helped keep inflation at
4 percent, while the external position continued to strengthen with the current account
recording a surplus of 15 percent of GDP; international reserves reached a record level. The
external debt-to-GDP ratio continued to decline, partly on account of early debt repayments,
reaching 24.7 percent from 34.9 percent at end-December 2003, and the debt-service ratio
decreased further to 16.1 percent.
3.
The supportive fiscal stance under the ERP has benefited capital expenditure, which
had been constrained for years, including to address urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction
of damaged infrastructures related to terrorism and natural disasters. At the same time,
current spending declined by 2 percent in 2004 in nominal terms and dropped to below
20 percent of GDP from 23.3 percent in 2003. Total expenditures are expected to decline by
2.5 percentage points to 31.6 percent of GDP in 2004, allowing a sizeable fiscal surplus of
over 5 percent of GDP. In these circumstances and given that inflation is under control, the
authorities believe that the fiscal stance has been helpful in achieving the goals of the ERP.
4.
Monetary policy remained geared towards containing inflation. The sizable increase
in net foreign assets represented the major source of the monetary expansion. Nevertheless,
broad money will be contained at 16 percent in 2004, allowing for a moderate growth in
credit to the economy in the context of a further decline in net credit to the Government and
sterilization of part of the hydrocarbon revenues. In its continued efforts to mop up excess
liquidity, the central bank (BA) increased the amounts of deposit auctions significantly. In
line with staff recommendations, BA has recently decided to mop up all excess liquidity. The
substantial increase in reserve requirements at end-2002 also contributed to liquidity control.
In addition, the regulatory framework of this instrument has been adjusted in 2004 to allow
for increased flexibility. The authorities’ envisaged fiscal stance, and the continuation of the

-2early external debt repayment policy should help to keep inflation at its low level.
Nevertheless, BA stands ready to take additional measures, if necessary.
5.
As the staff report underscores, the exchange rate policy has continued to serve the
economy well. Following BA’s intervention in the second half of 2003 to offset the earlier
depreciation, attention has focused on avoiding undue misalignment. The authorities remain
committed to a flexible exchange rate policy and believe that the present spread between the
official and parallel exchange rate is attributable to informal import activities and tax
evasion. They will continue to integrate the informal sector and improve tax and customs
administration as part of their ongoing efforts to further liberalize the economy and join the
World Trade Organization (WTO). They have requested Fund technical assistance to
improve the payments and exchange rate systems with adequate safeguards against undue
capital outflows. The mission will also be requested to look into the causes of the spread and
recommend further policy actions.
6.
Negotiations for WTO accession are now at an advanced stage. Efforts to modernize
the legislative framework in line with WTO regulations are continuing with the revision of
the Code of Commerce, following earlier issuance of the new legislation on international
trade, free trade zones, protection of intellectual property rights, and competition. To prepare
and monitor effective implementation of the Association Agreement with the European
Union, a high-level, multi-sectoral permanent committee has been established at endDecember 2004 and will report monthly to the Government. Ratification of the Agreement is
expected in the near future. Implementation of the comprehensive tariff reform is proceeding
as scheduled; the customs tax has been eliminated and the temporary additional duty tax has
been reduced further to 12 percent as of January 1, 2005, to be eliminated on January 1,
2006.
7.
In the fiscal area, modernization of the tax administration has benefited from recent
Fund technical assistance, and progress is being made in the operationalization of the Large
Taxpayer Unit and the establishment of tax units for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Efforts are also underway to re-organize the Ministry of Finance with, inter-alia, the creation
of a department for the design of fiscal policy. Work is also progressing, with World Bank
assistance, in modernization of the budgetary process. Moreover, in line with the
recommendations of the fiscal ROSC, a draft organic law governing public finances is in
preparation with Fund technical assistance.
8.
Privatization of public enterprises continued with the divestiture of 50 small- and
medium-sized enterprises in 2004. In addition, the privatization of the large sugar processing
enterprise has been finalized recently, and the remaining state-owned stake in the partially
privatized detergent company has been divested to the foreign partner. Negotiations on
privatization of other enterprises and discussions with potential investors are in progress. The
Government has recently announced that all but a limited number of public enterprises, such
as Sonatrach (the oil company) and Sonelgaz (the electricity company), are eligible for
privatization.

-39.
Building on the FSAP recommendations for the banking sector, a comprehensive
strategy is being articulated that will include privatization of a number of public banks. The
Ministry of Finance has tightened its control on public banks through strengthened
performance contracts. Modernization of the payment system and the information and
accounting systems is in progress. The latter should significantly improve the quality and
timeliness of data reporting and should further facilitate the conduct of banking supervision
by BA, which continues to be strengthened with Fund technical assistance. Following the
recent fraudulent bankruptcy of two private banks, resulting in large losses of public entities’
deposits, the Government has temporarily prohibited public units from dealing with private
banks, while supervision is being strengthened. Comprehensive on-site inspections have been
conducted to evaluate public banks’ loan portfolios in order to determine their provisioning
needs. The inspection reports have been recently finalized and submitted to the Banking
Commission. This explains the delay in providing staff with the requested information,
which will be provided shortly. Efficiency of the public banks is to be enhanced by the recent
measures taken to replace quasi-fiscal activities with direct budget support. In line with
FSAP and fiscal ROSC recommendations and following preliminary measures taken in the
2004 Budget Law, the 2005 Budget provides for appropriations in this regard; work is being
undertaken by the Ministry of Finance to assess additional needs in this area. Progress is also
being made in AML/CFT issues with the recent Parliament approval of the related
comprehensive law.
10.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability is a centerpiece of the authorities’ medium-term
strategy. Key in this regard is ensuring medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. The fiscal
program for 2005-2009, which envisages a progressive reduction in the ratio of the
nonhydrocarbon primary deficit to nonhydrocarbon GDP, attests to the authorities’ strong
commitment in this regard. Current and capital expenditures are slated to decline in terms of
GDP through appropriate measures, including wage containment, civil service reform, and
further rationalization of capital expenditure through careful project selection and
monitoring. In this latter regard, the authorities would welcome World Bank assistance to
conduct a Public Expenditure Review, with priority to be given to sectors where expenditure
is highest, including water, public works, health, and education sectors. At the same time,
social spending will be preserved and, as the staff report acknowledges, the safety net may
need to be expanded as the pace of implementation of structural reforms is accelerated. The
envisaged fiscal strategy should allow for sizeable fiscal surpluses, which are to be
accumulated in the stabilization fund. In this connection, the staff paper on the fiscal
management of hydrocarbon revenues provides useful guidelines to ensuring medium- and
long-term fiscal sustainability. The paper underscores the importance of intergenerational
equity issues in the use of exhaustible resources. While this concept is yet to be
unambiguously defined, the authorities believe it should not be limited to financial savings
alone as a wide range of social and infrastructure spending would also benefit future
generations. Moreover, early debt repayment would reduce the fiscal burden for future
generations.
11.
The authorities are resolved to complete the process of implementation of the
remaining structural and institutional reform agenda in the medium term. While work is
advancing in clearly articulating their strategy in this regard, implementation is already

-4underway in a number of areas, including in the fiscal area, public enterprises restructuring
and privatization, the financial sector, and the judiciary system. Enhanced efforts are also
directed to reforming the health and education sectors with the aim of enhancing efficiency.
To ensure successful implementation, the authorities are building public support through
enhanced communication and consultation.
12.
In line with their active debt management policy, the authorities are considering
proposals to proceed with further early debt repayments to bilateral and multilateral creditors.
13.
The authorities reiterate their strong support for the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and are
considering further support to HIPCs. While noting that a major portion of their outstanding
debt to Algeria consists of arrears on debt in kind, they have expressed willingness to
examine comprehensively the issue with the Fund.
14.
Finally, the authorities look forward to the Board discussions, and, in line with their
continued commitment to transparency, they consent to the publication of the staff report, the
Selected Issues paper, and the fiscal ROSC paper.
