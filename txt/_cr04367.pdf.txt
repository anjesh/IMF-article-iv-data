INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with
Antigua and Barbuda
Approved by Ratna Sahay and Matthew Fisher
November 1, 2004
Economic Background: Antigua and Barbuda is a three-island economy in the eastern Caribbean, with a
combined land area of 443 square kilometers, population of about 75,000, and per capita GDP of about
US$10,100. It is one of eight members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), and its GDP
accounts for 25 percent of the combined ECCU GDP. The ECCU has a common central bank, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar. The EC dollar
has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. Antigua and
Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions (see Appendix I).
Political Situation: Antigua and Barbuda has a bicameral parliament consisting of 17 appointees in the
Senate and 17 members of the House of Representatives, who are elected to five-year terms. Prime Minister
Baldwin Spencer’s United Progressive Party (UPP) won the election in March 2004, unseating the Antigua
and Barbuda Labor Party (ALP), which had been in power since 1976, prior to independence in 1981.
Currently, the UPP has 12 seats, the ALP 4 seats, and the Barbuda People’s Movement 1 seat in the House.
Previous Board Discussion: At the conclusion of the last Article IV Consultation on October 24, 2003,
Executive Directors expressed concern at the authorities’ continued expansionary fiscal stance in the face of
growing public debt. They viewed the accumulation of arrears as an indication of a substantial budgetary
financing gap, and were deeply concerned that this could lead to disorderly fiscal adjustment. They urged
the authorities to pursue a path of fiscal consolidation, including by containing the public sector wage bill
and strengthening the budgetary process, and supported the authorities’ efforts to reschedule and refinance
the public debt. They also stressed the importance of improving the business climate, particularly by
addressing public concerns about longstanding governance issues.
Discussions: A staff team comprising D. O. Robinson (Head), J. Chai, R. Goyal (all WHD), P. Khandelwal
(PDR), and R. Krelove (FAD) held discussions in St. John’s during September 13–25. The mission met with
the Minister of Finance, other senior government officials, the leader of the Opposition, the National
Economic and Social Council (NESC), as well as representatives of a trade union, the private sector, and
civil society. ECCB and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) staff participated in the discussions. R. Sahay
(WHD), C. O’Loghlin, and C. Gust (both OED) joined the mission for the final discussions.
Statistical Issues: Antigua and Barbuda is a participant in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). Major improvements in all areas are needed to facilitate effective surveillance (see Appendix II).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Rapid private sector–led growth in the 1980s gave way to public sector led
growth, albeit at a slower pace, accompanied by deteriorating institutions and
fiscal mismanagement. High growth in the 1980s was driven by the development of
the tourism sector. Since then growth has slowed considerably, due to a combination
of exogenous shocks—natural disasters, the September 11 shock, and the tightened
regulation of offshore activities—and policy slippages, including governance issues.
The public sector was used as employer of last resort and as fiscal pressures mounted
deficits were financed by running arrears to all creditors and nontransparent loans.

•

Growth has strengthened since mid-2003, due to a rebound in tourism, but fiscal
imbalances remain very large, the debt stock is high, and arrears continue to
mount. Tourism has rebounded strongly as the global economy strengthens and
security concerns eased. Fiscal imbalances narrowed modestly, in large part due to
expenditure compression as financing constraints tightened. Arrears accumulation is
estimated at 10 percent of GDP in 2003, with a slightly lower level expected in 2004.

•

The new administration that took office in March 2004 has reiterated its
campaign pledge to return normalcy to fiscal and debt relations, and improve
governance and transparency. After 27 years in opposition, the new administration
is determined to undertake bold measures to address the economic imbalances. The
government’s strategy is to be announced with the submission of the draft 2005
budget, in late November. Townhall meetings are being held in order to build
consensus for needed reforms, and a joint press conference between the Minister of
Finance and the Fund mission was held at the conclusion of the Article IV mission.

•

An upfront fiscal adjustment of around 4 percent of GDP is needed as a first
step in closing the fiscal imbalances. Achieving this adjustment will require a major
tax reform—including the introduction of a Personal Income Tax—and a
comprehensive public sector reform to achieve fiscal savings and enhance the quality
of service provision. A significant downsizing of the public sector is needed—there
are currently 13,000 central government employees, close to 40 percent of the labor
force—and an appropriate safety net, including severance payments and retraining
options, should be put in place for displaced workers.

•

Institution building is needed to sustain the fiscal adjustment and enhance
growth prospects. Priorities for institution-building include the public sector reform,
strengthening the budget process, and enhancing transparency. These steps will also
improve the investment climate, raising growth prospects.

•

Even with a large fiscal adjustment and robust growth performance, the
economy will remain vulnerable and public debt high for many years to come.
The combination of high debt, susceptibility to hurricanes, and a tourism-dependent
economy, point to an unusually high level of risk and the need for a contingency plan.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Rapid private sector-led growth in the 1980s gave way to public sector-led
growth, albeit at a slower pace, accompanied by deteriorating institutions and fiscal
mismanagement. The tourism sector emerged as the dominant sector following the closure
of the traditional sugar and cotton industries during the 1970s. The development of tourism,
supported by high foreign direct investment (FDI), produced growth rates of 6½ percent a
year during the 1980s. Since then, growth has halved, with tourism receipts falling by more
than 20 percent of GDP relative to their 1993 peak and FDI stagnating at a fairly low level
(Figure 1). The retreat of the private sector can be traced to four factors:
•

Weak institutions and governance issues resulted in a deteriorating investment
climate. During the 1980s, a series of large public investments, surrounded by
governance issues, failed. The granting of discretionary tax concessions was common,
further distorting the investment climate. Public sector debt rose rapidly, the
government started running arrears, and the integrity of the budgetary process was
eroded as the government began meeting its obligations selectively. As regular
financing sources dried up, deficits were financed by loans from special interest
groups in a nontransparent manner.

•

The incidence of natural disasters increased during the 1990s. Four large hurricanes
in the 1990s caused considerable damage to hotels, roads, and other infrastructure.

•

September 11, 2001, the global overhaul of offshore regulation, and the ban on
internet gaming hurt the two main private sector growth industries. Tourism receipts
fell sharply in 2001 and 2002. The offshore sector (principally banking and
gaming)—targeted by the authorities as an emerging growth sector and employing
8 percent of the labor force in 2000—declined dramatically.

•

Use of the public sector as employer of last resort produced an inefficient civil
service, increased fiscal pressures, and prevented labor markets from adjusting.

Despite debt relief from official and some private creditors, fiscal imbalances
have widened and the debt situation has worsened since the mid-1990s. Major official
creditors—Canada, Italy, and the U.K.—and some private creditors provided bilateral debt
relief in 1996–2000. As the economy slowed,

Social and political context
3.
Measures of social well-being are
generally strong, but some are
deteriorating with long-term consequences
for human development. Per capita GDP is
the highest in the ECCU. However, the
illiteracy rate is also the highest, having
increased significantly since the 1960s. In
part, this may be related to migration trends,
particularly the large influx in recent years of
workers and their families from other
CARICOM nations where illiteracy rates are
much higher.

The United Progressive Party (UPP) was elected into office in March 2004,
defeating the incumbent Antiguan Labor Party (ALP) for the first time in 27 years. The
ALP, headed throughout the period by a member of the Bird family, gave a high priority to
maintaining popular support by using the public sector to pay high wages and provide jobs to
the unemployed. Key issues in the elections were fiscal management—highlighted by the
government incurring wage arrears in the run-up to the elections—and governance. The new
UPP government has reiterated its campaign pledges to return normalcy to fiscal
management, implement civil service reform, and enhance accountability and transparency,
while preserving the high level of social conditions.

Statistical issues
5.
The statistical database is extremely weak, severely hindering analysis of
economic developments. While there are longstanding weaknesses in all areas of statistics,
key shortcomings are:
•

Data on government expenditures since mid-2003 are incomplete as expenditure
control and recording broke down ahead of the elections.

•

The public debt database is very weak—only limited information is available on
domestic debt and the coverage, and documentation, of external loans is incomplete.

•

Balance of payments data are subject to a wide margin of error—only partial trade
data have been compiled since 1991 and the coverage of other balance of payments
flows is incomplete.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS

6.
Economic growth accelerated in mid-2003 and is anticipated to reach 4 percent
for 2004, driven by a sharp recovery in the tourism sector. A rapid increase in tourist
arrivals since the second half of 2003, as the world economy strengthened and global security
concerns eased, combined with continued growth in construction and government services
resulted in growth reaching close to 5 percent in 2003. Growth is expected to slow slightly
in 2004 as a continuing stagnation in credit to the private sector from the banking sector
points to weak private sector investment. Inflation remains low under the ECCU regional
currency board arrangement (CBA).

A modest improvement in fiscal outcomes is expected in 2004, but the
government remains unable to meet its budgetary obligations. Revenues in the first half
of the year are significantly higher than the same period of last year, reflecting stronger
growth, and a large increase in stamp duties reflecting a surge in real estate sales. Collections
for the year as a whole are expected to improve only modestly as growth tapers off and
revenues from petroleum products decline in the absence of full pass-through of recent world
price increases. Initial expenditure policy adjustments have increased the wage bill in the
near-term—wage increases were granted to nurses and the police, while the decision to retire
public servants who exceed the retirement age led to an increase in severance payments. The
primary deficit of the central government is expected to improve by ¾ percent of GDP
over 2003, but the government remains unable to meet its obligations—the accumulation of
new arrears is likely to fall modestly, but still reach 9½ percent of GDP.
9.
With the recovery in the tourism sector, the external current account deficit has
narrowed, but arrears continue to mount. The depreciation of the real effective exchange
rate of the EC dollar had little impact

Monetary aggregates have
continued to grow in line with
economic growth. Net credit to the
public sector increased modestly, as
government deposits have been drawn
down, but gross lending to government
has declined. Credit to the private sector
has stagnated and banks have used
deposit growth to accumulate net foreign
assets (NFA). A sharp increase in NFA in
late 2003 was largely reversed by mid2004, and NFA have reverted to trend.

The regulatory and supervisory framework for offshore banks has been
strengthened significantly over the last few years. A Basle Core Principles assessment of
the offshore banks was conducted in February/March 2004 as part of the ECCU regional
FSAP and is expected to be finalized shortly. The existing system was found to be fully or
largely compliant with most principles, and the authorities have already responded to several
of the identified weaknesses—for example, by strengthening bank examination procedures to
address credit policies, loan loss provisioning, large exposure limits, and connected lending.
However, some banks are not yet in compliance with the new standards.
13.
Some progress in other structural reforms continues. After a long delay, the
ASYCUDA customs systems has been introduced at two ports of entry, which both
strengthens customs administration and significantly improves the flow of data on external
transactions. The recent implementation of the fourth stage of CARICOM’s Common
External Tariff also shows a commitment to fulfill regional obligations.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
14.
The new administration reiterated its commitment to address the longstanding
fiscal imbalances, normalize relations with creditors, and improve governance. Since
assuming office, the government has been working closely with the SATAP team (with the
assistance of the CARTAC advisors) to identify the magnitude of the economic imbalances
and develop their own view on policy options. The government’s strategy was outlined to
donors in July and described in broad terms during the joint press conference held with the

- 11 Fund mission at the conclusion of the Article IV discussions. Key objectives are to return
normalcy to the fiscal and debt situations—including through civil service and tax reform—
and to support growth by strengthening the investment climate. The detailed strategy is to be
announced in November, with the draft 2005 budget, with Townhall meetings initiated in
early-October to build consensus for the key measures.
15.
Discussions focused on policy options for achieving the government’s objectives.1
It was agreed that the depth of the imbalances is such, and inefficiencies so ingrained within
the system, that marginal policy changes would not be sufficient to achieve a clear departure
from the past. Thus, a bold upfront reform effort is needed to demonstrate the new era of
fiscal responsibility. The discussions were organized around four interrelated areas:
•

Bringing normalcy to fiscal policy, planning, and management: the budget should
meet its obligations in a timely manner and relations with creditors should be
regularized. This would require the implementation of a major tax reform and a
downsizing of the public sector;

•

Enhancing growth prospects: by creating an enabling environment for the private
sector to flourish and to absorb labor shed from the public sector;

•

Institutional reform: changing the incentive structure so that institutions deliver the

16.
The new administration discussed the mission’s findings with the public,
demonstrating their willingness to become more transparent. The previous government
did not heed the Fund’s advice, nor permit public dissemination of the Article IV conclusions.
The new administration’s desire to publish the Article IV staff report (for the first time) and
the holding of a joint press conference with the Fund to present the mission’s findings,
constitute a significant increase in the effectiveness of the Fund’s policy advice to Antigua
and Barbuda.
B. Normalizing the Fiscal and Debt Situation
17.
The authorities noted their intent to undertake significant fiscal reforms to
restore normalcy to fiscal relations, beginning with the 2005 budget. They stressed that
all policy options were currently on the table, including politically difficult measures such as
public sector retrenchments and the introduction of a personal income tax (PIT).2

Discussions drew on the ECCU regional surveillance reports (IMF Country Report Nos. 04/299 and 04/335)
discussed at the Executive Board on May 5, 2004 and the ECCU regional FSAP.
2

The PIT was a critical factor in the 1976 elections in which the UPP (which supported the PIT) was defeated
by the ALP.

- 12 18.
Addressing the outstanding stock of arrears to creditors accumulated over many
years would be a clear sign of a change in the fiscal regime, but could have significant
short-term fiscal costs. The mission estimated that converting all existing arrears into a
long-term bond would raise interest costs by 6 percent of GDP in 2005.3 Given the
weaknesses in the debt data, the mission strongly recommended that prior to embarking on
such a scheme, a careful verification of claims—including those to external creditors as well
as domestic suppliers—be undertaken. The authorities recognized the short-term costs from
clearing arrears, but emphasized the desirability of such a step both for the credibility of the
fiscal regime change and as a means of providing fiscal stimulus to domestic suppliers.
Regarding the Social Security Scheme (SSS) the mission noted that while the SSS has so far
been able to meet its obligations in a timely manner, problems could arise going forward
since the SSS is already experiencing a cashflow deficit with current contributions below
pension payments. Thus, it is important that the budget begin to meet at least the current
contributions.
19.
The mission recommended a fiscal adjustment in 2005 of around 4 percent of
GDP, though a financing gap—substantially lower than in recent years—would still
remain. While such an adjustment would reduce fiscal stimulus in the near-term, the overall
impact on growth would be largely offset by a positive credibility effect on private sector
investment. Given the magnitude of the fiscal imbalances—the budget has, for several years,
been financed by the accumulation of around 10 percent of GDP a year in arrears—the
proposed fiscal adjustment in 2005 would not eliminate the financing gap, but would provide
a credible signal of the authorities’ intent to address the fiscal problems. Absent the arrears
clearance, the financing gap would be about 3 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed with
the broad order of magnitude of the proposed fiscal adjustment and its feasibility.
20.
With further adjustment over the medium term, the debt stock would decline
gradually to a more manageable level (see Annex I). Under unchanged policies and
assuming that new financing can be obtained, the debt stock would simply continue to rise
throughout the medium term. Under the fiscal adjustment scenario with the regularization of
arrears in 2005, the debt stock would rise initially, but subsequently decline. The pace of the
decline would be critically determined in large measure by the average cost of new
borrowing and the terms on which arrears are cleared.

The interest rate on the bond is assumed to be 10 percent—slightly below the rates currently charged by

- 13 -

21.
Even with a strong and sustained adjustment effort, the debt level will remain
high for many years and all available options—including asset sales—should be
explored to reduce debt more rapidly. The authorities noted that some asset sales were in
progress—the Royal Antiguan Hotel, for example, had recently been sold and the PCS
telephone component of the APUA would soon be put out to tender. They were also
discussing options with a number of creditors for restructuring obligations. The mission
welcomed these efforts and emphasized the importance of conducting any approach to
creditors on a good faith basis and to preserve inter-creditor equity through a coordinated
approach to creditors rather than through uncoordinated bilateral negotiations.
Fiscal reform
22.
The mission proposed that the initial brunt of the fiscal adjustment be borne by
raising revenues, with noninterest expenditures likely to increase modestly in the near
term. Revenues have averaged 20 percent of GDP, well below the 25–35 percent of GDP
collected in the other ECCU countries. On the expenditure side, the financing constraints of
recent years have resulted in a sharp reduction in all budgetary items apart from wages and
pensions, and the mission urged continued expenditure restraint—including delaying the
implementation of new expenditure programs. While the needed civil service reform will
generate savings over the medium term, the authorities emphasized that it would add to
expenditures in the near term given the severance packages specified in the Labor Code and
the need to provide training opportunities for labor that is released.
23.
The authorities and staff agreed that there was a need to ensure that the tax
reform was consistent with existing administrative capacity and that the tax burden did
not fall too heavily on low income groups. Staff noted that the proposed tax measures
would yield significant revenues in the near-term, while not overstretching tax administration,
and achieve a broader and more equitable tax burden (Box 1). The introduction of a
progressive personal income tax would ameliorate the bias against low-income groups in the
existing tax system, which depends heavily on indirect taxes.4 The mission recommended
that the PIT be introduced at mid-year and be designed, at least initially, in as simple a
fashion as possible, to enable sufficient time for the needed administrative preparations. The
tax base could also be broadened over the medium term through the introduction of a broad
based consumption tax, or VAT.

4

A large number of combinations of rates and thresholds to be used in the PIT are possible. The mission
recommended that the threshold be set in such a way as to keep the number of taxpayers at a manageable level,
with the rates reaching a maximum of 25–30 percent, below the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent.

- 14 BOX 1. A STRATEGY FOR TAX REFORM
The tax system suffers from a number of structural weaknesses. Personal income is not taxed, which, in
addition to the lost revenue, severely complicates the administration of the corporate income tax.
Administration of the property tax has been weak, resulting in a tax that is viewed as inequitable and
raises relatively little revenue. An appropriate system of petroleum price taxation has been adopted but is
not applied, resulting in a significant revenue loss. The system of hotel taxes is unnecessarily
complicated by having a number of overlapping taxes with marginally different tax bases. At the same
time, the tax system is compromised by an extensive array of tax concessions, with exemptions widely
granted for taxes on business income and on imports, under statutory incentive schemes as well as the
exercise of ministerial discretion.
Measures for 2005
Important policy changes that can be undertaken during 2005 include:
•
Introduction of a personal income tax (PIT) to raise revenue equivalent to about 3 percent of
GDP at an annual rate;
•
Proceeding with the reforms of the property tax, to make it a fairer and more productive tax by
extending coverage and moving valuations to a market basis (raising an additional ½ percent of
GDP in 2005);
•
Greater flexibility in petroleum pricing, raising ½–1 percent of GDP;
•
Simplifying the system of hotel taxes; and
•
Limiting tax concessions to a maximum of EC$120 million (which is at least 2 percent of GDP
lower than concession levels in recent years).
Continuing the reforms
Tax reform in the years beyond 2005 should focus on the following measures:
•
Improving the efficiency and equity of the PIT while enhancing its revenue yield by moving
toward a global tax on all incomes, based on self-assessment, and by continuing efforts to bring
the self-employed into the system. PIT collections could reach 4–6 percent of GDP;
•
Rationalizing the system of social benefit charges, and integrating their collection with that of
the PIT;
•
Addressing the structural weaknesses in the corporate tax base, lowering the tax rate, and
normalizing the tax treatment of unincorporated businesses;
•
Rationalizing the system of investment incentives, so that they are rule-based, transparent, and
provide an effective encouragement to investment and growth. In this regard, adopting a broadbased system of accelerated depreciation under the corporate tax should be considered as an
alternative to concessions;
•
Increasing revenues from the property tax to about 2½ percent of GDP, by raising rates and
further broadening coverage.
•
Replacing the current system of indirect taxes with a broad-based tax on consumption, for
example a VAT, complemented by a limited set of excise taxes including vehicles, petroleum
products, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco.

authorities make use of the provisions in the
Fiscal Incentives Act to revoke existing
concessions. In addition, the mission urged the elimination of discretionary concessions, and
embedding in legislation the current practice of restricting concessions from consumption
taxes to capital goods. Renewed efforts on a regional basis to agree on a concessions regime
were also encouraged.
25.
Recent increases in world oil prices have not translated into higher retail prices,
resulting in a significant loss of budget revenue. While the retail price of gasoline is
established through a formula that would in principle result in the pass-through of
movements in world oil prices, an implicit ceiling of EC$8 per gallon has been maintained.
The authorities argued that there are concerns that raising prices beyond this level could hit
low-income groups that relied on public transportation. The mission stressed that the existing
system generated a significant revenue loss as well as distorting economic signals. Thus, the
mission recommended additional flexibility be permitted in the retail prices of petroleum,
and that concerns for the impact on vulnerable groups be addressed through a strengthened
social safety net.
26.
A formal social safety net should be introduced to provide well-targeted support
to vulnerable groups rather than the broad based subsidies implicit in recent
expenditure initiatives. In line with campaign pledges, the authorities have introduced a
school uniform program and are discussing the introduction of a free school meals program.
The mission noted that providing such programs for all would be a very expensive means of
supporting low-income households and did not seem warranted in light of the difficult fiscal
situation. Thus the mission urged that the poverty assessment that is to be undertaken next
year with the assistance of the CDB be used to identify the target groups.

retrenchments, is required. An initial step was
taken through retiring public sector employees who were beyond the retirement age.
However, before moving further they stressed the need to ensure that appropriate severance

- 16 packages are in place and that opportunities are provided for retrenched public sector
employees to acquire skills to facilitate a move into the private sector. The mission
encouraged a comprehensive audit of positions and functions be undertaken in order to
eliminate ghost workers, avoid duplication of functions, and enable the downsizing to occur
in an orderly fashion.
28.
The fiscal adjustment envisaged over the medium term would in large part
result from the measures introduced in 2005. The PIT would produce significant revenue
gains as it is fully implemented and the base is broadened, while expenditure savings from
the public sector downsizing would begin to accrue in 2006 and beyond. The mission
recommended that this point be emphasized in the budget documents by including three or
five-year budget projections to illustrate the benefits in the years ahead.
C. Growth-Enhancing Reforms
29.
Raising growth potential over the medium term will require reforms across a
broad spectrum. Absent such reforms, growth can be expected to slow to about 1½ percent
a year due to the debt overhang and the uncertain policy environment hindering private sector
activity. Growth could reach 5 percent a year and discussions focused on reforms that would
enable the economy to attain its potential.5
30.
Available indicators suggest some loss of competitiveness, reinforcing the need
for structural reforms to spur growth (Figure 2). The REER measured relative to other
tourism-based Caribbean economies indicates a sharp recent loss of competitiveness—
principally relative to the Dominican Republic. Antigua and Barbuda’s share in stay-over
tourist arrivals relative to the Caribbean as well as the ECCU have demonstrated a gradual
decline, as has the value of tourism receipts. Preliminary data suggest a sharp recovery in
tourism volumes for 2003, though it is unclear as to whether this was due to extensive
discounting by tour operators. Hotel operators were, however, not unduly concerned about
the level of profitability in the sector. Wage restraint in the public sector, and a move to
performance-based wage increases, would support competitiveness through its signaling
effect on the private sector.

5

Regressions of Antigua and Barbuda’s growth rate against industrial country output—a proxy for tourism
demand—suggest that growth could reach slightly over 5 percent a year over the medium term.

Priority reform areas include:

•

Strengthening the investment climate. The authorities noted their desire to create a
one-stop investment shop, which would provide a clear contact point for potential
investors—assistance from FIAS has been requested. The authorities acknowledged
that, as in other countries in the region, the extensive concessions granted in an
attempt to stimulate investment and employment creation had severely distorted
competition between enterprises, created opportunities for corruption, and led to
substantial revenue losses. They were in broad agreement with the mission’s
recommendations to rein in concessions (as described in paragraph 24), but noted that
given the competition for investment between the islands, full elimination would not
be possible.

•

Improving the efficiency and reliability of public utilities. Regular disruptions to
services have led much of the private sector to install their own utilities. Production
costs at APUA (Antigua Power and Utility Association) substantially exceed the price
at which power can be purchased from private suppliers, reflecting limited capital
investments in recent years and overemployment. The mission encouraged a thorough
review of the efficiency of production at APUA with a view to reducing operating
costs and eventual privatization with appropriately regulated tariffs.

•

Further trade liberalization. Progress has been made in reducing tariffs in the context
of CARICOM agreements and some steps were taken to limit the widespread and ad
hoc exemptions from customs duties.6 The mission welcomed the authorities’ actions
in this regard and urged them to also eliminate quantitative restrictions and limit
licensing requirements to strictly monitoring purposes rather than an attempt to
influence the development of particular industries.

•

Deepening regional integration and cooperation. Given the small size of local goods
and factor markets, closer regional cooperation can provide new growth opportunities.
The authorities noted that while progress in the region towards the Caribbean Single
Market Economy had been slower than envisaged, several key aspects had already
been de facto implemented in Antigua and Barbuda. In particular, while the formal
legal basis for free labor mobility was not in place, work permits had been granted
liberally.

•

Resolving the internet gaming dispute. In March 2004, the WTO ruled in favor of
Antigua and Barbuda in its complaint against the U.S. action to block internet gaming
companies operating in Antigua and Barbuda. The authorities noted that bilateral
negotiations are under way to find a solution so that a once booming industry can
re-emerge.

6

Data are not available on the impact of these changes on the average tariff rate.

- 19 -

D. Institution-Building and Governance
32.
Staff fully agreed with the government’s intentions to strengthen institutions to
enhance the effectiveness of policy-making and its implementation. The authorities
recognize that overemployment, low morale, and inefficiency in the public sector has
undermined the delivery of public goods and services. At the same time, the nontransparent
business environment and ad hoc financial arrangements with creditors had discouraged new
private initiatives. New legislation—a Freedom of Information Act, an Integrity in Public
Life Act, and an Anti-Corruption Act—that is under preparation could provide a sound legal
basis for efforts to enhance governance.
33.

Institution-building should focus on:

•

Civil service reform. The use of the government as the employer of the last resort has
produced a massive public service that is inefficient and unmotivated. The overstaffing of
the civil service, the absence of performance incentives, the two-tier system of employees
with differing benefits and terms of employment, and apparent acceptance by managers
of frequent absences and late arrivals, urgently need to be addressed. Apart from the
fiscal burden, such a system was causing difficulties in hiring and retaining highly skilled
staff. A comprehensive civil service reform was needed that would focus on streamlining
the functions of government, ensure the right skill mix to deliver the needed government
services, and provide the right incentives—including wage decompression and a
performance-based system of rewards and penalties to recruit and retain strong
performers. Retrenchment by enforcing retirement regulations, voluntary separations with
packages, layoffs of those on the payroll but not performing their duties was
recommended. A safety net to ease the pain of large scale retrenchment would also be
needed.

•

Enhancing transparency and accountability of the public sector. The existing
constitutional requirement of auditing public accounts at least once every year should be
enforced and the accounts, or at least a summary, published. The authorities noted that an
audit of all government accounts was under way, but that the application of penalties was
difficult.

•

Strengthening budgetary institutions. The mission emphasized that achieving effective
control over expenditures was a clear priority. As a first step, an effective and transparent
quarterly cash and commitment management plan needed to be developed. This would
require that the legal basis for accountability and reporting requirements be strengthened,
and that the ministry of finance have the legal authority to penalize departments failing to
comply with reporting or spending requirements. The authorities agreed with the need to
strengthen cash and commitment control mechanisms and noted that progress was being
made in introducing a new computerized system within the treasury.

34.
Staff commended the authorities for establishing a National Economic and
Social Council with the objective of generating broad consensus for government policies.
Town hall meetings to discuss policy options, ahead of the announcement of the budget in
November, had already begun taking place. Staff suggested that a greater understanding of
public policies and economic issues by the public could be achieved through a broad

- 20 -

dissemination of relevant economic data in a timely manner, public discussion of the
quarterly monitoring reports produced by the policy unit in the ministry of finance, regular
government presentations to the public on economic developments, and publication of
independent and external reports on the country.
35.
There is a need to strengthen the statistical database to ensure that it provides
relevant, accurate, and timely information to policy-makers. The mission encouraged the
authorities to explore options for strengthening the coverage of the national accounts,
especially the tourism sector and related services, improve labor market data, strengthen the
debt database, and enhance the monitoring of public enterprises. The authorities fully agreed
with the mission’s assessment, and noted that they were requesting technical assistance in
many of these areas.
E. Vulnerabilities, Crisis Prevention, and Management
36.
While Antigua and Barbuda has lived with a high debt stock and considerable
arrears for many years, vulnerabilities have risen. The government relies on a revolving
credit facility provided by a group of domestic banks to meet its current obligations, and an
unfavorable decision from one participating bank could trigger a liquidity crunch. Key to
reducing such roll-over risk is the maintenance of confidence that the government is pursuing
a credible strategy to address the fiscal and debt imbalances. Other risks include a natural
disaster—Antigua and Barbuda is one of the most exposed countries in the world to
hurricanes—a downturn in the tourism sector, or an adverse event in one of the neighboring
countries that generates a general loss of confidence on prospects in the region.
37.
Measures have been taken to reduce the impact of natural disasters, but more
can be done. Following the rash of hurricanes in the mid-1990s, stricter building codes were
adopted, utility cables were located underground, public awareness campaigns initiated, and
the National Office of Disaster Services was strengthened. Stricter enforcement of building
codes and land use guidelines, and higher insurance penetration, could further mitigate the
costs of disasters. Insurance of government assets could also be improved, as only a small
fraction of government assets—airport and port facilities—are insured.

Several hurricanes have hit Antigua and Barbuda since 1995 causing extensive damage to infrastructure
and property. The damage caused by Hurricane Luis in 1995 was particularly severe. Electricity outages lasted
for six months, tourism facilities were closed for several months (and in some cases simply closed), and real
GDP declined by 5 percentage points.

38.
Further strengthening the prudential and regulatory framework would reduce
financial sector vulnerabilities. Approval of the proposed Amendments to the Uniform
Banking Act that are currently under discussion could significantly enhance the effectiveness
of banking supervision and address many of the weaknesses identified in the ECCU regional
FSAP. Efforts underway to further strengthen the supervision of the offshore banking
sector—including the introduction of a risk-based prudential guideline for capital adequacy
and formal arrangements for information-sharing with the ECCB on systemically important
offshore banks with domestic affiliates—would also reduce risks.
39.
The high near-term risks call for a contingency plan. Given the economy’s large
vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks, the mission recommended that the authorities develop,
in consultation with the ECCB, a contingency plan with detailed responses and
responsibilities in the event that an adverse shock occurs.

- 22 -

40.
The ability of adverse developments in Antigua and Barbuda to directly affect
the rest of the region is low. While Antigua and Barbuda is the largest economy in the
ECCU, the debt and arrears problems are well known and creditors have discriminated
among islands. Cross-border linkages—both financial and trade—are low. The principal risks,
however, stem from a general confidence effect in the region, for example a deposit run in
the region that caused a reevaluation of the health of financial systems throughout the region.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Fiscal mismanagement and the deterioration of institutions over the past two
decades led to a large build up of public debt and a proliferation of a culture of
nonpayment. As financing sources dried up, increasing recourse was made to earmarking of
revenues to creditors and the government simply ran arrears to domestic and external
creditors, private suppliers, and social agencies—the Social Security Scheme, the Board of
Education, and the Medical Benefits Scheme. Matters came to a head in late 2003, when the
government began to run arrears on wage payments.
42.
The new administration’s resolve to address Antigua and Barbuda’s deep-rooted
problems head on and their openness in discussing these difficult issues is welcome.
However, bold and swift actions are needed to break from past practices and establish the
government’s credibility. The depth of the imbalances is such, and inefficiencies so ingrained
within the system, that marginal changes will not be sufficient to achieve a departure from
the past.
43.
A new economic strategy that would mark a distinct change in regime has three
distinct components. First, fiscal consolidation and transparency that aims for a manageable
public debt stock. Second, raising economic growth rates by creating an enabling
environment for the private sector to flourish. And third, rebuilding institutions that would
support both the fiscal and growth objectives.

- 23 -

44.
In view of the large financing constraints and the high public debt, a large
upfront fiscal adjustment is urgently needed. Fiscal consolidation would necessarily
involve a close look at tax policy and administration, abolishing discretionary tax exemptions
that cost the budget nearly 10 percent of GDP annually, a review of public expenditures, and
public sector reform. It may also be necessary to delay the implementation of new
expenditure initiatives unless these can be better targeted.
45.
Public sector employment as a share of the labor force is among the highest in
the world and should be re-evaluated as a matter of priority. Retrenchment by enforcing
retirement regulations, voluntary separations with packages, layoffs of those on the payroll
but not performing their duties is strongly recommended. A safety net to ease the pain of
large-scale retrenchment will also be needed.
46.
Growth potential in Antigua and Barbuda is high and should be exploited with
vigor. To raise economic growth rates, it is critical that the playing field is leveled for foreign
as well as local private sector participants. A one-stop shop should be established and
bureaucratic procedures streamlined for new business initiatives. The role of the public sector
should be reduced to providing basic public goods and services that are complementary to
private sector activities. Enhancing efficiency in public utilities should be prioritized. Given
the large share of Antigua and Barbuda in the ECCU region’s GDP, staff encourages the
government to take a lead role in supporting and actively engaging in regional initiatives
such as the Caribbean Single Market Economy that could provide new opportunities for
growth.
47.
Rebuilding public institutions is necessary to both implement and sustain reform
efforts, and to facilitate meeting the growth and fiscal objectives. In the budgetary area,
an effective and transparent system for cash and commitment management should be put in
place. Incentives should be introduced in the civil services that rewards good performers and
penalizes the poor ones. To raise the morale in the public sector, the two-tier system of
employees should be abolished and replaced by one. Sufficient salary differentiation is
needed to reflect the significance of the job content. Public accountability and transparency
can be enhanced by closer monitoring of public enterprises, routine auditing of all
government accounts, improving customs and tax administration, and the introduction of a
system of effective penalties for those not complying with these requirements.
48.
To facilitate policy-making, there is an urgent need to strengthen the quality and
coverage of the statistical database. Improvements are needed in the coverage of the
national accounts, especially the tourism sector and related services, monitoring labor market
developments, public debt accounting and customs, and recording public sector performance.
49.
Even with the implementation of bold reforms, Antigua and Barbuda will
remain vulnerable to external shocks given the frequency of natural disasters, the high
debt, and the openness of the economy. The country is highly dependent on economic
conditions in the industrial countries and, by extension, is highly vulnerable to shocks that
impact industrial country growth, such as global interest rates, world oil prices, and global
security conditions. Staff recommends that the authorities formulate a contingency plan to
avert short-term crises and to continue with efforts to strengthen financial sector supervision
and to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

- 24 -

50.
Staff are strongly encouraged by the new government’s resolve and initiatives to
implement the much needed but difficult reforms. Several steps have already been taken
to improve transparency and governance and increase public awareness. An overhaul of the
tax and expenditure policies and administration is ongoing. Discretionary tax concessions
have already been reduced and are expected to fall further. Welcome steps are being taken to
strengthen supervision of offshore banks. The openness of the new government to engage in
policy dialogue with the opposition, academics, civil society, and international institutions is
welcome.
51.
It is recommended that Antigua and Barbuda remain on the standard 12-month
Article IV cycle.

1/ Central government only.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

ANNEX I

Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative Fiscal Scenarios
Two fiscal scenarios are considered—a passive scenario and a strong adjustment
scenario, the latter of which has two financing scenarios. In the adjustment scenarios, the
government is assumed to clear all outstanding arrears and the residual financing gaps
through issuance of a long-term bond, with the scenarios differing with respect to the
assumed interest rate on the bond: a market interest rate—assumed to be 10 percent—in one
case and below market rates—assumed to be 5 percent—in the other. In the strong
adjustment scenario, the fiscal adjustments lead to smaller financing gaps, and in turn lower
interest costs in the outer years than in the passive scenario.
Passive scenario. The authorities continue current policies with large overall deficits that are
financed commercially. Financing is assumed to continue to be available, no matter what
level the debt stock reaches. Absent improvements in the investment climate, growth remains
driven by the public sector, with a temporary boost from construction and other activity
related to the Cricket World Cup, and slows to around 1½ percent over the medium term.
Under this scenario, the central government primary deficit stays at about 3 percent of GDP
and public debt increases to over 140 percent of GDP by 2009 and over 250 percent of GDP
by 2015.
Strong adjustment—financing gaps filled by commercial borrowing. A fiscal adjustment
of 4 percent of GDP is assumed for 2005 and further adjustment over the medium term, with
the primary balance moving from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2004 to a surplus of
8 percent of GDP by 2009. Growth is assumed to converge gradually over the medium term
to the estimated growth potential of 5 percent a year, with some deviation around the trend
associated with the Cricket World Cup in 2007 and an initial dampening effect from the large
fiscal adjustment. The clearance of arrears is likely to add around 6 percent of GDP to
interest costs, contributing to the large residual financing gaps in 2005–2006. With the
financing gaps filled through commercial borrowing, the debt stock declines only very
gradually, remaining in excess of 100 percent of GDP in 2015.
Strong adjustment—financing gaps filled by borrowing at below market rate. The paths
of GDP growth and fiscal adjustments are the same as in the scenario above, but the cost of
financing is lower, resulting in smaller residual financing gaps. The debt stock thus declines
faster, reaching 100 percent of GDP by 2009 and 65 percent of GDP by 2015.

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which
manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasicurrency board.
Antigua and Barbuda accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in
November 1983. It maintains an exchange system free from restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions with the exception of restrictions
maintained against terrorists and terrorist organizations that were notified to the Fund.

APPENDIX II

Antigua and Barbuda: Statistical Issues
Antigua and Barbuda has been a participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since October 2000. Its statistical database is deficient in coverage and quality,
hindering an accurate assessment of the flow of funds within and across sectors in the
economy. There are significant problems with real, fiscal, and balance of payments data.
1.

Real sector

National accounts compilation has been plagued by the continued absence of time-series data
on trade since 1991. This has had a serious impact on the estimation of value added in some
sectors, especially construction and wholesale and retail trade. For construction, alternative
data sources include building applications approved annually and the government’s public
sector investment projects. Wholesale and retail trade estimates are inflated based on
movements in the CPI and patterns of consumer spending where there is not enough data
derived from annual surveys.
The consumer price index is calculated using weights drawn from an income and expenditure
survey conducted in 1998/99. Foreign trade data have recently been compiled,
covering 1999–2001. Data on production have not been reported in recent times to STA.
STA reports data received from bulletins produced by the ECCB. There is little coverage of
labor market developments, as no official data for wages or unemployment are available. The
labor ministry produces annual estimates of employment based on information from the
Social Security Board, but these are subject to a wide margin of error.
2.

Government finance

Annual and quarterly data on central government finances published by the ECCB are
broadly in line with the methodology set up in A Manual on Government Finance
Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). However, Antigua and Barbuda has not been reporting
statistical information in recent years to STA for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook and IFS
publications, which needs to be rectified. Data on public sector debt are particularly weak.
3.

Monetary statistics

Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of six weeks.
The data are reported to the Fund regularly. However, the quality control of the data needs to
be strengthened, as there has been some unexplained large movements in commercial banks’
foreign asset positions. Moreover, the depository corporations survey does not include the
accounts of credit unions that accept demand and other deposits. The ECCB is aware of the
need to improve coverage of the monetary statistics and is taking steps to collect reliable data
on credit unions.

- 42 -

4.

APPENDIX II

Balance of payments

Balance of payments statistics are provided to STA by the ECCB. These data are reported on
an annual basis only. Reporting of data on reserves and external debt is in accordance with
Antigua and Barbuda’s participation in the GDDS. The latest data published in the
International Financial Statistics are for 2002. Data on foreign investments are also
problematic due to the low response rate of investment surveys.

Antigua and Barbuda: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of August 24, 2004)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on June 28, 2001. The main goals of the strategy are to
reduce income insecurity and vulnerability at the national and household levels, and build
human and institutional capacity to meet the challenging economic and social environment
facing these small states.
The CAS, which covers the period FY 2002–06, does not include any lending to Antigua and
Barbuda. However, during the implementation period, the country has benefited from
participation in projects financed through grants from the Global Environmental Facility;
coverage in analytical reports such as the OECS Institutional and Organization Capacity
Review, the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment, the Financial Sector Assessment
Program, a report on Environmental-Sustainability in Tourism in the OECS, and the
upcoming OECS Growth and Competitiveness Study; and support to the OECS as a whole
through the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program for the analysis of large scale
energy options for the sub-region. Antigua and Barbuda also currently participates in the
Emergency Recovery Program which supports investments and builds institutional capacity
to enhance security at airports and ports, through a parallel project financed by the Caribbean
Development Bank.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 22, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda
On November 15, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.1
Background
Economic growth accelerated in mid-2003, reaching close to 5 percent for the year as a whole,
driven by a sharp recovery in the tourism sector. Strong tourism arrivals data for the first half
of 2004, improved tax collections to end-June, and continued growth in deposits with the
banking system, point to the economic momentum carrying over into this year, with growth
anticipated to reach 4 percent in 2004. Inflation remains low under the currency board
arrangement.
Fiscal imbalances narrowed in 2003 as financing constraints forced expenditure compression.
The primary balance of the central government improved by 3 percent of GDP in 2003. While
payments on wages and salaries plus transfers increased modestly, other expenditure items—
particularly payments for goods and services—were cut sharply. Arrears—obligations incurred
by the central government but not paid—are estimated to have increased by 10½ percent of
GDP during 2003.
A modest improvement in fiscal outcomes is expected in 2004, reflecting the continuing
recovery in growth and a small net positive effect from policy adjustments, but the government
is able to meet only some of its obligations in a timely manner. Revenues in the first half of the
year are significantly higher than the same period of last year, reflecting stronger growth and a

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

large increase in receipts from stamp duties due to a surge in real estate sales. Collections for
the year as a whole will likely show only a modest improvement, as the tourism growth is
anticipated to taper off in the second half of the year and revenues from petroleum products
decline in the absence of pass-through of recent increases in world oil prices. Initial
expenditure policy adjustments have added to the wage bill in the near-term—wage increases
were granted to certain groups of workers, while the decision to retire public servants who
exceed the retirement age led to an increase in severance payments. The primary deficit of the
central government is expected to improve by ¾ percent of GDP over 2003, but the
accumulation of new arrears is likely to fall only modestly to 9½ percent of GDP.
With the recovery in the tourism sector, the external current account deficit has narrowed.
The real depreciation of the EC dollar had little impact on the trade balance. The current
account deficit was financed by FDI into the tourism sector, land sales to nonresidents, and a
further increase in arrears.
Monetary aggregates have continued to grow in line with economic growth. Deposit growth
has been used by commercial banks to increase foreign asset holdings, as credit to the private
sector has stagnated and net credit to the public sector has increased only marginally.
The regulatory and supervisory framework for the offshore banks has strengthened
significantly over the last few years. Bank examination procedures were recently amended to
address credit policies, loan loss provisioning, large exposure limits, and connected lending.
Progress in broader structural reforms has been made. Particularly noteworthy is the longdelayed introduction of ASYCUDA at two of the ports of entry which will both strengthen
customs administration and significantly improve the flow of data on external transactions.
The implementation of the fourth stage of CARICOM’s Common External Tariff also shows a
commitment to fulfill regional obligations.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the new administration’s resolve to address Antigua and
Barbuda’s deep-rooted problems head-on and its openness in discussing difficult issues.
Fiscal mismanagement and deterioration of institutions over the past two decades have
resulted in a large buildup of public debt and of domestic and external payments arrears.
Directors urged the new administration to adopt a medium-term economic strategy aimed at
fiscal consolidation, raising economic growth rates by creating an enabling environment for the
private sector to flourish, and rebuilding institutions to support the fiscal and growth objectives.
Directors called for a large upfront fiscal adjustment as a key step in regaining fiscal balance
and clearing arrears. This would involve increasing revenue through strengthened tax policy
and administration, including a reduction of tax exemptions and the reintroduction of a
personal income tax. Directors urged a comprehensive public sector reform to reduce
expenditure—including through reduction of the very high level of public sector employment—
and to enhance the efficiency of government service provision. This should be accompanied
by the introduction of an appropriate safety net.
Directors emphasized that re-building institutions is crucial for implementing and sustaining the
reform effort, and ultimately for achieving the authorities’ growth and fiscal objectives. They

recommended putting in place an effective and transparent system of cash and commitment
expenditure management, introducing incentives in the civil service to reward good
performers, and reforming the two-tier system of public sector employment. They also
recommended that steps be taken to enhance public accountability, transparency, and
governance, including: closer monitoring of public enterprises, routine auditing of all
government accounts, improving customs and tax administration, and introducing a system of
effective penalties for noncompliance with tax laws.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take steps to enable Antigua and Barbuda to achieve
its high-growth potential. While welcoming the authorities’ plan to establish a one-stop window
aimed at streamlining bureaucratic procedures for new business initiatives, Directors
recommended leveling the playing field for foreign and local investors, limiting the role of the
public sector to providing basic public goods and services that are complementary to private
sector activities, and enhancing efficiency in public utilities. Directors encouraged the
government to take a lead role in supporting and engaging in regional initiatives, such as the
Caribbean Single Market Economy, which would provide new opportunities for growth.
Directors were encouraged by the continuing progress in strengthening the regulation and
supervision of the offshore financial sector. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
continue to work closely with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to further strengthen the
supervision of domestic banks, including by approving and implementing the amendments to
the Uniform Banking Act, and to ensure an appropriate level of supervision for nonbank
financial institutions.
Directors noted the urgent need to strengthen the quality and coverage of the statistical
database in the areas of the national accounts—especially the tourism sector and related
services—labor market developments, the public debt, and monitoring the outcomes of the
broader public sector. They also saw room for greater regional collaboration on data issues.
They encouraged the authorities to enhance reporting under the GDDS, and to seek technical
assistance through CARTAC and other donors.
Directors expressed concern about the high level of vulnerabilities facing Antigua and Barbuda
in light of the frequency of natural disasters, the high debt, and the openness of the economy.
They encouraged the authorities to formulate a contingency plan to respond to shocks, and to
continue with efforts to reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and mitigate the impact of natural
disasters.

Statement by Kevin G. Lynch, Executive Director for Antigua and Barbuda
November 15, 2004

Key Points
•

My Antiguan and Barbudan authorities broadly share the analysis and conclusions of
the well-balanced staff report.

•

The authorities understand:
¾ The need for a substantial policy change, starting with a major restructuring of
fiscal policies.
¾ The need to build public understanding on the need for change. The
authorities held a joint press conference with the staff to publicize the
conclusions of the mission in late September – a historic first, and wish to
publish the staff report – another first.
¾ The need to build credibility, which requires improved transparency, improved
governance, improved statistics and a medium-term game plan that is adhered
to.
¾ The need to handle adjustment in a way that puts the focus on private sectorled growth, retrains workers and reduces disincentives.

•

The upcoming budget, to be presented at the end of this month, will be a key
deliverable. To promote broad social consensus on the measures being considered, a
series of town hall meetings began after the joint press conference.

•

Initiatives to improve transparency and governance have already been undertaken.
Discretionary tax concessions will be reviewed and a “one-stop shop” government
investment agency will be established by year-end.

•

The authorities have requested technical assistance to strengthen the statistical
database.

My authorities appreciate the well-balanced staff report...
My Antiguan and Barbudan authorities would like to thank the staff for its work in
conducting the Article IV consultation. They view the Article IV exercise very much as an
opportunity to take advantage of IMF expertise to assess the country’s policies. The staff
report is well-balanced and my authorities broadly share its analysis and conclusions.
And recognize the need for a substantial break from the policies of the past...
As noted in the staff report, a new government came to power in Antigua and Barbuda with a
large majority in Parliament following the elections in March of this year. The previous

-2government had been in power since 1976. The new government is facing several economic
challenges.
Integral to the future performance of the economy is the recognition by my Antiguan and
Barbudan authorities that the fiscally unsustainable policies of the past cannot continue. The
most immediate challenge is to begin to implement a strategy to deal with the inherited fiscal
imbalances and the growing debt (and arrears) problem. My authorities recognize that these
must be brought under control and that overcoming them will need sustained strong action.
The backbone of the authorities’ strategy will be a major restructuring of fiscal policies...
My Antiguan and Barbudan authorities are committed to fiscal prudence and eliminating
arrears. In order to achieve this, they are of the view that the best policy would be to raise
revenues in conjunction with a reduction in expenditures. Given the urgent nature of the
policy reforms needed, they will present their next budget on November 30 – signaling a
clear break from the past, when budgets were not presented until the fiscal year had already
begun.
To ensure that the message of a need for change would be heard throughout the country, the
authorities hosted, for the first time ever, a joint press conference with the staff at the
conclusion of the mission in late September. This was very well-attended by members of the
media, an opportunity which my authorities took to signal a clear break from the policies of
the past and to communicate the need for reform. They also have communicated to the staff
that they wish to publish the staff report, another first.
Following on this, my authorities held a series of consultations and town-hall meetings to
reinforce public awareness of the economic and budgetary realities of the current situation
and sought reactions and inputs from the people in relation to the tax options being
considered.
Revenues will need to be increased....
Revenues in the country, averaging about 20 percent of GDP, are much lower than in other
ECCU countries. The authorities have discussed a number of options at recent town hall
meetings in advance of the upcoming budget to increase tax revenues. Among the options
being considered are the introduction of a personal income tax (PIT), reforming the way
property taxes are calculated and the introduction of a VAT or sales tax. As noted in the staff
report, Antigua and Barbuda has not had a personal income tax since 1976. The introduction
of a progressive PIT would lessen the burden on low-income groups, by comparison with the
current heavy reliance on indirect taxation. Another important factor in increasing revenues
will be to reduce the amount of discretionary tax concessions granted to businesses, which
currently cost about 10 percent of GDP.
In conjunction with a reduction in expenditures...
Public sector reform and transformation will need to be tackled head-on with hard decisions
being made as to the optimal size of the public sector and how to render efficient services to
the people of Antigua and Barbuda. As noted in the report, the public sector in Antigua and
Barbuda employs more people as a share of population (17.3 percent) or the labour force

-3(37.1 percent) than any other country in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU).
Consequently, while there is a clear need to reduce the size of public sector employment,
there is a need also to mitigate the social impact of public sector downsizing. A social safety
net will be required for those who need it as well as a retraining program to help prepare
public sector employees for new opportunities.
The debt burden will need to be reduced in order to reduce vulnerabilities and reach
ECCU convergence guidelines...
On debt issues, the authorities are currently pursuing discussions with the domestic
commercial banking sector with a view toward consolidating and rescheduling the
government’s debt to these banks and also negotiating a more favourable rate of interest,
which at present varies between 10 percent and 15 percent per annum. The authorities are
also actively engaged in discussions with local suppliers to clear arrears. With respect to
external debt, discussions with external creditors have commenced.
Monetary policy is appropriate...
The authorities are satisfied with the common monetary and exchange arrangement with the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The currency union has been extremely stable and
has contributed to low inflation not only in Antigua and Barbuda, but across the entire ECCU
region. The ECCB also regulates and supervises Antigua and Barbuda’s banking system.
Discussions are underway on the proposed Amendments to the Uniform Banking Act to
enhance the effectiveness of banking supervision and address many of the weaknesses
identified in the ECCU regional FSAP. The Basle Core Principles assessment of the
country’s offshore banks, conducted in February/March 2004 as part of the ECCU regional
FSAP, found that the existing system was fully or largely compliant with most principles.
The authorities have already responded to several of the identified weaknesses by
strengthening bank examination procedures to address credit policies, loan loss provisioning,
large exposure limits, and connected lending.
The near-term outlook for economic growth is positive...
My Antiguan and Barbudan authorities are confident that the economy will rebound. Real
growth of about 4 percent is expected in 2004, led by tourism. The number of visitors to the
country in 2003 increased by 16 percent, breaking the trend decline since 2000, and total
expenditures by these visitors increased by about 10 percent, the largest gain in recent years.
The outlook for tourism is positive given the favourable trends in the global economy, and
the addition of St. John’s as a new stop for several cruise ship lines. Inflation is low and
stable, the regulatory and supervisory framework for offshore banks has been strengthened
significantly over the last few years, and the ASYCUDA customs system has been
introduced at two major ports of entry to strengthen customs administration and improve the
flow of data on external transactions.
But the private sector will need to be crowded in to increase growth prospects further...
It is clear that the private sector must play a lead role in generating growth, but what changes
can best support the private sector to become the lead engine of growth? Private sector-led
growth requires more foreign direct investment. To this end, the government of Antigua and
Barbuda has announced that a government investment agency will be established by the end

-4of the year. This initiative is a matter of urgency since the Ministry of Finance is inundated
with requests from potential investors and groups seeking concessions which have been
worth approximately EC$170-200 million per annum (about 10 percent of GDP) – the
highest in the ECCU. The “one-stop shop operation” will lay out all the directives for both
foreign and local investors in a transparent manner and will ensure a level playing field for
all. The criteria for and list of concessions will be tabled in Parliament to ensure that the
process is public and open. Technical staff from the OAS and other international agencies
are assisting in the formulation of the legislation for the agency.
Improving governance will also be crucial for a well-functioning economy...
The authorities recognize that tackling governance issues will be central to the process of
developing Antigua and Barbuda and see that improving transparency, accountability and
integrity in all areas of governance is crucial. To this end, Prevention of Corruption
legislation, Freedom of Information legislation, and Integrity in Public Life legislation was
passed in early November. In addition, a code of conduct has been agreed for Ministers.
These measures were implemented to unequivocally ensure that state resources are used for
the benefit of the people.
To build support for the bold measures required to turn around the economic situation, the
authorities are actively working to build the needed consensus...
As noted earlier, the authorities undertook a series of consultations and town hall meetings to
ensure that there will be wide ownership of the measures to be contained in the upcoming
budget. To maintain consensus needed throughout a period of sustained fiscal and structural
reform, the authorities have created the National Economic and Social Council (NESC),
which was constituted by an Act of Parliament. The NESC involves all sections of civil
society and gives them a voice in shaping the government’s economic and social policy.
Technical assistance will be required to improve the coverage and quality of economic
statistics...
My Antiguan and Barbudan authorities agree with the staff that the quality and coverage of
the statistical database needs to be strengthened in order to facilitate policy-making. As
noted in the report, strengthening the coverage of the national accounts, especially the
tourism sector and related services, improving labour market data, strengthening the debt
database and enhancing the monitoring of public enterprises is required. To this end, the
authorities have requested technical assistance in many of the areas identified by the staff.
Natural disasters are a potentially large source of exogenous shocks to the economy which
can only be mitigated, not eliminated...
On the issue of vulnerabilities to natural disasters, Antigua and Barbuda has been hit with
three significant incidents in the past decade (Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995,
Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Hurricane José and Tropical Storm Lenny in 1999). These
disasters caused cumulative damage of about 40 percent of GDP. Steps have been taken to
reduce the effects of future natural disasters, but the risks cannot be completely eliminated.
The staff’s advice to develop a contingency plan, in consultation with the ECCB, with
detailed responses and responsibilities in the event that an adverse shock occurs is welltaken. However, given that any one hurricane/tropical storm can severely damage many of

-5the region’s islands, and there may be limits to self-insurance, more thought is required on
how the high risks of such large exogenous shocks to the ECCU region might best be
addressed.
