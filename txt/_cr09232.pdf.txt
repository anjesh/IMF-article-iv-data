I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
1.
The global financial crisis and the contraction of world trade have pulled the
French economy into a severe recession and put its financial sector under strain.
Structural features combined with early policy action have helped soften the downturn, which
is somewhat less pronounced than in the euro area as a whole. Nonetheless, unemployment
has risen steeply since mid-2008, while consumer price inflation has come down rapidly.
With the fiscal stance easing in 2008, the budget deficit exceeded the Maastricht ceiling.
French banks faced the need to write down toxic assets, and government recapitalization and
liquidity measures were required to support the sector. While significant, financial sector
losses remained below those in peer countries.
2.
The expected gradual recovery of the global economy and long-standing supply
rigidities are likely to slow the pace of the recovery. The near-term outlook is challenging
with real GDP projected to drop by 3 percent in 2009, followed by a gradual recovery next
year. The unemployment rate is likely to surpass 10 percent in 2010. Although inflation is
expected to remain below zero in the coming months, deflation is unlikely to set in given
entrenched nominal wage and price rigidities. The risks to the outlook are mostly tilted to the
downside in view of the sensitivity of the French economy to a worse-than-foreseen
contraction in the European Union and underlying tail risks, in particular in the financial
sector. Over the medium term, potential output growth is projected to slow, and the output
gap is expected to narrow only gradually.
3.
The key policy challenge is to align actions to counter the crisis with
indispensable longer-term reforms to strengthen financial stability, safeguard fiscal
sustainability, and deepen the reform of labor and product markets to boost France’s
competitiveness and economic growth.
4.
Further actions are required to fully uncover and, if needed, address underlying
vulnerabilities in the banking sector. Banks’ net earnings have dropped sharply and their
leverage remains relatively high. The unfolding economic downturn and ensuing rise in
defaults might exert further stress on the financial system. As French banks are exposed to
mature markets, they are vulnerable to potential spillovers from systemic countries. In
addition, one bank has a sizable exposure to Central and Eastern Europe. Undertaking
rigorous, EU-wide coordinated stress tests to determine banks’ capital and liquidity needs,
and appropriate disclosure of the results are important. On the basis of such stress tests, the
authorities should assess if there are needs for follow-up actions to further recapitalize banks,
and for measures to ensure the soundness of their balance sheets.
5.
France has played an active role in promoting international regulatory and
supervisory reforms. In light of the integrated financial markets in Europe and their close
links to the rest of the world, such reforms need to be coordinated at the European and

4
international levels. France’s strong support can help to bring the European regulatory reform
to a successful next stage. In addition, it is important to strengthen international cooperation
on financial sector exit strategies, particularly on deposit guarantees and bank-asset
guarantees, to avoid creating destabilizing financial flows.
6.
The fiscal response to cushion the downturn has been appropriate. In addition to
the full operation of sizable automatic stabilizers, fiscal stimulus measures in 2009-10
amount to above 1½ percent of GDP, and are estimated to raise real GDP by about 1 percent
cumulatively. The measures are mostly front-loaded and relatively well diversified, with an
emphasis on temporary investment expenditures and various tax breaks. An additional
temporary effort for 2010 might be needed in the event that the economic downturn is deeper
and more protracted than currently anticipated. Since fiscal space in France is limited, there
would only be room for a modest additional effort, while it is important to ensure that all
discretionary stimulus measures are indeed temporary.
7.
France’s main fiscal challenge is to avoid an unsustainable public debt
dynamics. The impact of the recession will lead to uncomfortably high fiscal deficits and a
further debt build-up in 2009 and beyond. Moreover, rising government expenditures related
to the aging of the population will put pressure on the public finances. Staff welcomes the
multi-year budget framework law adopted in January 2009 as a good opportunity to credibly
strengthen fiscal consolidation. However, this approach needs to be reinforced by adopting
more realistic growth assumptions, clearly articulating specific measures to contain spending
at all levels of government, and streamlining tax expenditures and social contribution
exemptions. The consolidation progress achieved by the central government should be
complemented by strengthening fiscal responsibility of local governments. Continued efforts
are also required to preserve the sustainability of the social security system.
8.
Decisively pursuing structural reforms is essential for boosting competitiveness
and growth, safeguarding fiscal sustainability, and raising welfare. Important measures
have been taken since the launch of the Government’s 2007 economic program but much
remains to be done to reduce long-standing structural rigidities. In view of the high returns,
further action should focus on job creation, and on improving market efficiency and
productivity. International experience has shown that strengthening labor market activation
and training policies can be successful even in difficult economic times. Continued minimum
wage moderation will support job creation for young and low-skilled workers, and improve
labor-cost competitiveness. Raising the legal retirement age would help promote senior
employment. The recent establishment of a single Competition Authority should help to
further strengthen competition policies. The EU Services Directive also provides an
opportunity for deregulating professional services.
9.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the regular
12-month cycle.

II. CONTEXT: INTO THE STORM
A. A Severe Recession Hit France in 2008
10.
The global crisis is exacting a heavy toll on the French economy. Oil and food
price shocks, the worsening of the financial crisis, and the global economic downturn already
buffeted the economy in 2008, when real GDP growth slowed to a sluggish 0.4 percent. As
world trade collapsed in the last part of the year, exports and business investment sharply
contracted. A strong inventory correction contributed to a cumulative drop in real GDP by
2.7 percent over the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Because of France’s
lower trade openness and its

is relatively more resilient
but will most likely also be affected, with a lag, by rising unemployment and the continued
weak household confidence. For 2009 as a whole, the authorities and staff expect real GDP to
contract by 3 percent, with a tepid recovery starting only in 2010.
11.
Unemployment is on the rise again.
The unemployment rate reached a low of
7.5 percent in February 2008, about
¾ percentage point below the previous
cyclical trough in June 2001. Since then, the
rise of the unemployment rate has been steeper
than in previous recessions, increasing to
9.3 percent as of May 2009. The likely further
deterioration in the labor market and the
uncertainty about income prospects are
weighing on consumer confidence and
spending.

The 2008 inflationary shock was potent but short-lived, and inflation is expected
to continue falling in the coming months. The surge in energy and other commodity prices

nominal wage and price rigidities would
prevent deflation from setting in. While a sizable output gap will subdue price increases,
inflation is expected to rebound somewhat to about 1 percent in 2010.
13.
Monetary conditions have eased and lending rates have come down, but market
financing costs remain elevated. The monetary conditions index (MCI) has come down
sharply since mid-2008, reflecting ECB easing, including through unconventional measures.
Although the ECB has aggressively supported bank liquidity following the worsening of the
financial crisis in the latter part of 2008, money market activity has fallen sharply and credit
has decelerated further. As of end-June, bank lending rates had declined from their heights at
end-2008 by more than 100 basis points to around 4 percent for medium- and long-term loans
and by about 200 basis points to around 3 percent for short-term loans. Corporate spreads
have also narrowed but remain at a still high level of 255 basis points.
14.
The fiscal stance eased in 2008 and the fiscal deficit exceeded the Maastricht
ceiling. The general government deficit increased from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to
3.4 percent in 2008, triggering a reopening of the European Commission excessive deficit
procedure (EDP).1 While primary expenditures were kept in check,2 revenues were affected
by the worsening economic situation and by tax cuts granted under the law on work,

recently been opened.

2

The lower real growth rate of primary expenditures of 0.3 percent in 2008, compared to the average over the
last decade of 2.2 percent, is partly the result of the pick-up in inflation but also reflects tighter control of health
expenditures and lower spending growth of local governments.

employment, and purchasing power (Loi de Travail, Emploi et Pouvoir d’Achat, TEPA).3
Although the TEPA law provides incentives to work more, it also entails sizable annual
budgetary costs (0.3-0.5 percent of GDP in 2008).
B. The Financial Sector is Weathering the Crisis Comparatively Well
15.
French banks have been affected by the global financial crisis but have proved
relatively resilient thus far.4 French banks have written down a large proportion of assets
relative to their initial value. Total losses and write-downs of French banks since the onset of
the crisis account for about 3 percent of losses and write-downs around the globe,
considerably less than those of banks in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Switzerland, and
less than the share of French banks in the global banking system.5 The relatively less negative
impact of the crisis on French banks thus far could reflect in part their relatively conservative
lending practices and the consistent supervisory coverage of all lending institutions by the
Commission bancaire. The crisis has resulted in a sharp drop in earnings and a significant
rise in costs but most French banks continued to register net profits in 2008. While valuations
of French financial stocks have declined steeply since end-2006, the deterioration was
nevertheless somewhat less than in the U.S. and other countries in Western Europe.
Reflecting rising global credit risk, CDS spreads of French banks have also increased
considerably, but again on average somewhat less than for other European banks.

The TEPA law was adopted in August 2007 with a scheduled implementation period of five years. It includes
the elimination of taxes and social security contributions on overtime work up to a ceiling; the deductibility of
mortgage interest payments; the quasi-elimination of the inheritance tax; and the reduction of an overall tax
ceiling to 50 percent of income.

Crisis.”

French banks account for about 10 percent of world banking assets.

8
16.
The authorities responded to the deepening of the crisis in 2008 by taking a
number of measures to recapitalize banks and support credit (Box 1). These measures
have helped to stabilize the financial system and thus far no French bank has ended up under
majority state ownership. Total new capital raised by French banks, including in financial
markets, accounts for about 4 percent of aggregate bank capital raised around the globe since
mid-2007, similar to their share in global bank losses and write-downs. Annual credit growth
slowed sharply from 13 percent in 2007 to less than 2 percent in April 2009. The credit
squeeze is far from over and its effects on the real economy are still unfolding.
Box 1. Measures Taken by the Government to Support the Banking Sector
The French authorities have taken the following measures to support the banking system:
•

In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, placed the French subsidiary of Lehman
Brothers under state administration.

•

Participated, with the governments of Belgium and Luxembourg, in the €6.4 billion
recapitalization of Dexia group and agreed to guarantee debts issued by Dexia for a period of one
year, extendable if necessary. The government contributed €1 billion and the Caisse des Dépots et
Consignations injected €2 billion. The government has also issued guarantees on Dexia’s
obligations (to a maximum €55 billion).

•

Set up the Société de Financement de l’Économie Française (SFEF), a bank refinancing agency
with the purpose of boosting bank lending to households, SMEs, and local governments. The
SFEF will be able to issue until end-December 2009 up to €265 billion (about 14 percent of GDP)
of government-guaranteed obligations with maturities not exceeding five years. French banks that
meet all prudential regulations will be able to borrow from the SFEF against collateral.

•

Established the Société de Prise de Participations de l’État (SPPE) for bank recapitalization
purposes. The SPPE is a fund of €40 billion (about 2 percent of GDP) that will finance itself on
the market with its debt being guaranteed by the government. The six largest French banks have
already obtained the first tranche of €10.5 billion in the form of Tier 1 qualifying subordinated
loans. A second recapitalization tranche has been announced in the same aggregate amount.

•

Supported the merger between Groupe Caisse d’Épargne (GCE) and Groupe Banque Populaire
(GBP) with a total capital injection by the SPPE of €5 billion, of which €3 billion will be taken by
the new merged entity.

Banks receiving state support must commit to increase credit to households, SMEs, and local
authorities at a rate of at least 3-4 percent per year. The banks are also obliged to keep the government
regularly informed on their progress in lending and must agree to follow certain compensation rules. In
particular, the government has recently issued a decree banning stock options and limiting bonuses for
bank managers; the decree is not retroactive and will run through 2010 but could be extended.

9
C. Macro-Financial Linkages Could Prolong the Crisis
17.
The deceleration of credit to the economy thus far was mostly related to waning
demand but financial sector problems could slow the recovery. Overall, the relative size
of the financial sector has been stable since 2000 and its contribution to growth is smaller
than in some other large economies. The links between the financial sector and the real
economy, including wealth effects, are estimated to be weaker in France than in the U.S. or
the U.K. Lending surveys indicate that the deceleration of credit to the private sector was
more related to slowing demand than to the tightening in lending standards. However, the
economic downturn may lead to an increase in counterparty risks for the financial sector and
adverse feedback loops. The household saving rate has remained broadly unchanged over the
last ten years, despite the doubling of house prices and significant fluctuations in equity
prices. At the same time, household confidence is sensitive to developments in equity
markets, and the deterioration of the financial environment could induce households to
increase their precautionary savings.
18.
House prices saw a correction in 2008 and remain under pressure. With an
average annual growth rate of about 10 percent, above the euro area average, nominal house
prices more than doubled over the last decade and were estimated to have been overvalued by
some 20 percent compared to fundamentals in 2007.6 House prices have declined so far by
about 7 percent from their peak in the beginning of 2008. The resulting decline in
construction activities has contributed to the economic contraction, although less than the
drop in manufacturing output.
19.
Negative wealth effects of the house price correction are mitigated by the
relatively low level of household indebtedness and the relatively difficult access to house
financing. Housing-related debt amounted to 35 percent of GDP and 53 percent of gross
disposable income in 2007, both below the euro area average. French households have the
most difficult access to mortgage financing among peer countries, and home mortgages are
granted largely on the basis of the repayment capacity of the borrower rather than the
(potential) value of the house.7 The lack of financial instruments that promote consumer
credit when households’ wealth increases would also prevent a sharp deterioration of
consumption when housing prices decline.8

6

See IMF, World Economic Outlook, The Changing Housing Cycle and the Implications for Monetary Policy,
April 2008.

7

The IMF World Economic Outlook of April 2008 contains a study that constructs a mortgage market index
that lies between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating easier household access to mortgage credit. The French
index has the lowest value of 0.23, while the index for Germany is 0.28, for the U.K. 0.58, and for the U.S. 0.98.

8

In France, there is no mortgage equity withdrawal and no fee-free prepayment. The typical loan-to-value ratio
is 75 percent and the average term is 15 years. Covered bond issuance accounts for only 1.6 percent of
residential loans outstanding and mortgage-backed securities issuance amounts to 1 percent of residential loans
outstanding.

10
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS: IMPLICATIONS OF THE GLOBAL DOWNTURN
A. Outlook is Challenging
20.
Economic activity in France is expected to contract less than in major partner
countries, but long-standing supply rigidities could hamper the recovery. Unlike the
U.K. and the U.S. economies, the French economy is not weighted down by unsustainable
levels of household debt. French growth has been less export driven than in Germany and its
production structure is relatively less specialized; as a result, the impact of the slump in
foreign demand has been less pronounced (Box 2). Also, labor markets in France are
relatively rigid, automatic stabilizers are important, and social protection is among the
highest in the euro area. While these characteristics shield France somewhat from the current
downturn, they are also likely to slow the pace of the recovery.
Box 2. Comparison of Business Cycle Fluctuations in France and Germany
The current downturn is deeper than in previous recessions. The recessions related to the oil crisis
of 1974-75, the breaking of the inflation spiral in the early 1980s, and the EMS crisis in 1992-93 lasted
on average three to four quarters and real GDP contracted by a maximum of 2.1 percent.
France has tended to experience less output volatility than Germany, with shallower recessions
and more sluggish recoveries. Over the past 40 years, France has experienced about two-thirds less
episodes of quarterly GDP contraction than Germany and two-thirds less episodes of consecutive
quarterly contractions (a standard definition of a recession). During these episodes, the output
contraction was generally smaller, but the subsequent recovery was also less strong.

France is partly buffered by a smaller industrial and export-oriented sector. During the last
decade, French exports to new EU members expanded relatively slowly and were somewhat hampered
by their concentration on consumer goods which made them vulnerable to competitive pressures form
emerging markets. Moreover, faster wage growth in France combined with the euro appreciation in
recent years aggravated underlying competitiveness problems. While the smaller export sector implied
that France benefited less from rising global demand, it also suffers less from its decline.

11
21.
The recovery is expected to be gradual, with GDP growth projected at ½ percent
in 2010 and at about 2 percent on average over 2011-14. Staff projects the fall in exports
to slow in the period ahead, in view of the expected bottoming out of the recession in partner
countries. Nevertheless, growth is expected to suffer from some further decline in net exports
in 2010, while investment will only gradually recover. The positive dynamics provided by a
resumption of private consumption and the gradual re-building of inventories will be modest.
Net exports are expected to be supportive from 2011 onwards, while the gradual increases in
investment and consumption should bring GDP growth above its potential rate. Nonetheless,
staff expects an output gap to remain by 2014.

seriously affected by a further contraction in the region. While the French economy is less
exposed to countries initially more affected by the global crisis, such as the U.S. and the
U.K., the spillovers from the steep downturn in Germany have been significant. A worsening
of the financial crisis would hurt banks’ balance sheets and could further depress credit

speed up the restoration of confidence. Recent
business indicators show some encouraging signs of stabilization, albeit at very depressed
levels. Developments in France are estimated to have a limited impact on other regions
outside the euro area.
B. Impact on Potential Growth
23.
Staff expects potential growth to slow by 1 percentage point to about 1 percent
in 2009-14, due to the combined impact of demographic changes and the current crisis
(Box 3). Official projections foresee a decline in labor force growth by more than ½ percent
in the next five years compared to the last decade, even under more favorable
macroeconomic conditions than the current ones. In addition, the sharp contraction of
investment and its expected gradual recovery are projected to reduce the growth rate of the
capital stock by ¾ percent. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth is also projected to be
lower in the short-run as the downturn will temporarily reduce allocative efficiency. Once the
adjustment following the crisis has been completed, potential growth is projected to rebound
to close to 1½ percent. The authorities have also revised their potential growth projections
downward but to a lesser extent. They argued that the recovery would be supported by a
stronger pick-up in business investment, while the structural transformations induced by the
crisis could support TFP growth, as for example experienced by the Nordic countries in the
1990s.

13
Box 3: Impact of the Crisis on Potential Output
Potential growth is expected to slow due to the combined impact of the current crisis and
demographic changes. To account for the impact of factor inputs, a simple Cobb-Douglas production
function has been used, calibrated with a capital-output ratio set at 0.4, broadly in line with the share of
capital income in GDP. In this set-up, annual potential growth is expected to decline from 2 percent in
2000-08 to 1 percent in 2009-14.
•

The growth contribution of the labor force is projected to decline by 0.4 percent, in line with the
2006 INSEE labor force projections. The impact on effective labor is only marginally compensated
by the end of the trend decline in working hours.

•

The growth contribution of the capital stock is projected to decline by 0.3 percent, reflecting the
broad standstill of investment in 2008

TFP growth is projected to suffer from

account for the adjustment cost of the

projections incorporate a discount of
½ percent in 2008-09, which gradually
disappears by 2014.

The long-term impact of the current crisis on potential output could be more severe than
assumed under the baseline scenario:
•

The INSEE labor force projections assumed that higher fertility, larger immigration, and higher
labor force participation rates (in part due to pension reform), should delay the decline of the labor
force to 2015. However, this projection was based on relatively favorable economic conditions.
Although the higher unemployment could force workers into the labor force to obtain
complementary income, the discouraged worker effect seems to dominate in France.1 In addition,
the mounting unemployment could also discourage inflows of migrant workers.

•

By forcing a restructuring of the economic landscape, the crisis may render obsolete a substantial
fraction of the existing capital stock.

IV. POLICY CHALLENGES: RESPONDING TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, SAFEGUARDING
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND INCREASING GROWTH
24.
In a difficult environment, France needs to address sometimes conflicting short
and medium term policy challenges. Short term policies have to respond the crisis, with an
emphasis on financial sector stabilization and an appropriately supportive fiscal stance. Yet
long-standing concerns—fiscal sustainability and more flexible structures to support
growth—are also weighing into the policy mix.
A. Policies to Preserve Financial Stability
25.
The authorities have taken important policy actions to support the financial
sector and showed concern about maintaining credit to the economy. Capital injections
through the SPPE have enhanced the banks’ capital adequacy; the upfront fiscal costs amount
thus far to 0.7 percent of GDP. The ability of the SFEF to attract a wide range of investors
from various market segments and to place debt at very tight spreads has helped banks to
expand their lending capacity at low funding costs. Thus far, the SFEF has issued €62 billion
of government-guaranteed debt. Also, the creation of an independent médiateur de crédit is
helpful to ensure fair lending practices. However, the numerical credit targets attached to the
government support of banks are prone to creating distortions. The authorities pointed out
that the credit targets reflect their concern about maintaining credit growth in the economy
and would be implemented judiciously, taking into account the declining demand for credit.
Government support of the merger between GCE and GBP with capital injections and the
setting of conditions for further government intervention were positive steps in moving
towards resolving problems in a subsidiary of these two banks (Natixis). The implementation
of some measures under the Paris-Place Financière initiative and the generalized distribution
of the Livret A are welcome steps to increase competition and efficiency in the financial
sector.
26.
Although capital adequacy ratios have improved, the banks’ leverage is still
relatively high. Government capital injections and the banks’ own capital-raising efforts
have helped to compensate the decline in retained earnings and raised the average Tier 1 ratio
from 7.7 in 2007 to 8.3 in 2008, in line with the average in peer countries. Leverage,
measured as the ratio of total assets to total capital, stabilized at 24. While banks have
improved their shock-absorption capacity, some amount of deleveraging may still be needed.
27.
The overall risk from exposure to emerging markets appears manageable. The
banks’ exposure to offshore financial centers and emerging markets is limited and
geographically diversified. Exposure to emerging markets represents 4 percent of total bank
assets (14 percent of GDP), similar to that of German banks and higher only than the
relatively low level of U.S. banks. The exposure is geographically diversified, with CEE
representing about 37 percent of the total exposure to emerging markets. Exposure to the

15
Czech Republic, Poland, and Russia accounts for half of the banks’ total exposure to CEE.
Among the three major French banks exposed to CEE only one bank has a sizable
involvement.

28.
The mature market bias of French banks suggests that spillovers from
aggravated financial sector stress in these countries would have a material impact on
their risk profile. French banks’ exposure to foreign markets is not excessive and tilts
towards mature markets. Foreign claims represent 33½ percent of bank assets and
125 percent of GDP, a moderate level compared with banks in peer countries. Exposure to
mature markets represents 85 percent of total foreign claims in 2008 (both interbank and
corporate lending), with exposure to Germany, Italy, the U.S., and the U.K. accounting for
half of the total exposure to mature markets. As a result, France is vulnerable to a further
deterioration of the financial systems in these countries.
29.
Pressures on bank earnings and profitability are mounting and the financial
turmoil will likely continue to exert an adverse impact on financial performance for
some time. Earnings risks come not only from decelerating lending, but also from the trading
book due to high market volatility and valuation uncertainty. With the turn of the economic
and credit cycle, as well as the ensuing rise in defaults, asset quality has deteriorated. The
share of impaired loans in the total loan portfolio increased slightly to 2.8 percent in 2008.
Increased risk aversion is reducing investors’ appetite for complex corporate and investment
banking (CIB) products and services, which would materially compress CIB revenues and
depress profitability. The unfolding feedback loops between the financial sector and the real
economy may lead to an increase in counterparty risk. Remaining toxic assets as well as other
risky assets held on the banks’ books, including leveraged buy-out (LBOs) and collateralized
loan obligations (CLOs), may incur additional losses and write-downs.9
9

At end-2008, remaining toxic assets of major French banks stood at about €18 billion and total exposure to
LBOs and CLOs amounted to €37 billion, together estimated at less than one percent of total bank assets.

16
30.
Additional measures, some of which are already in train, may be necessary to
strengthen financial stability. Specifically, staff makes the following recommendations:
•

Carry out rigorous, preferably EU-wide coordinated stress tests, focusing on the
quantity and quality of capital needed, followed up with appropriate disclosure;

•

On the basis of such stress tests, if needed, follow-up action should be taken to further
recapitalize banks and ensure sound balance sheets;

•

Continue to prompt banks to improve the quality of their capital by reducing the
proportion of hybrid capital and increase the proportion of core capital given
investors’ focus on capital quality;

•

Support confidence in the financial system through continued adequate supervision
and full transparency about the financial standing of key institutions; and

•

Continue to prompt banks to implement fully measures to strengthen internal controls
and operational risk management, and restructure CIB activities.

31.
Going forward, the French authorities agreed that maintaining adequate capital
and continued supervisory vigilance are needed. They were confident about the resilience
of the French banking sector and the adequacy of the banks’ capital level. They also noted the
improvement in corporate governance of mutual banks. Acknowledging the ongoing
deterioration in bank profitability and increase in counterparty risk, they agreed, however,
that additional write-downs may be needed and further losses from certain risky assets and
banking activities are a concern. Financial supervisors assured staff of their continued
vigilance and determination to timely take any action needed to ensure financial sector
soundness. They considered that the leverage ratio should be interpreted with caution in view
of possible differences in accounting practices. The stress tests conducted by the supervisory
authority based on end-2008 data showed the banks’ continued resilience under different
scenarios.10 The authorities also agreed with staff on the importance of carrying out further
EU-wide stress tests but emphasized the need for an agreed approach among all participating
member countries to disclosure of the results.
32.
International coordination and cooperation are essential and France has been
active in supporting European regulatory reform. The French authorities have proposed a
series of steps, including: (i) strengthening supervision of EU-wide financial groups; (ii)
harmonizing regulatory frameworks; (iii) undertaking joint supervision of cross-border banks
and insurance companies; (iv) enhancing transparency and surveillance of non-regulated
markets, credit rating agencies, and compensation; and (v) strengthening internal controls and

governance. France is instrumental in promoting hedge fund regulations and could play an
important role in supporting the recommendations of the de Larosière group.11 The
authorities expressed their continued strong support for international harmonization of
regulations and supervisory practices and their preference for a simple and clearly defined
capital adequacy measure. They also agreed with staff on the importance of strengthening
international cooperation on financial sector exit strategies, particularly on the maximum
coverage of deposit insurance and bank-asset guarantees across the European Union, to avoid
destabilizing financial flows.12
B. Providing Economic Stimulus While Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability
33.
The initial 2009 budget aimed at containing the fiscal deficit at 2.7 percent of
GDP, followed by a gradual consolidation to achieve fiscal balance by 2012. The budget
also included a set of revenue and expenditure measures aimed at boosting economic activity.
On the revenue side, cash-flow support through monthly rather than quarterly VAT
reimbursements and tax credits on R&D outlays aimed at relaxing liquidity constraints for
enterprises, especially SMEs. Combined with the third-year implementation of the TEPA law,
total tax relief in the initial budget represented 0.4 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side,
the introduction in July 2009 of a new earned-income supplement (Revenu de solidarité active,
RSA) that smoothes the effect of benefits thresholds to increase incentives for the low-skilled
to seek employment would increase social benefits by about 0.1 percent of GDP.13
34.
As the economic outlook deteriorated, the authorities adopted additional stimulus
measures and let the automatic stabilizers operate fully. The discretionary fiscal stimulus
amounts to above 1½ percent of GDP in 2009-10, and the automatic stabilizers are estimated
to amount to some 3 percent of GDP per year. The size of the discretionary fiscal stimulus is
suitable in light of the sizable automatic stabilizers, and is in line with the EU European
Economic Recovery Plan.14 The fiscal stimulus plan is well-diversified and the measures are
timely and relatively well-targeted (Box 4). Good public financial management helps to keep
the execution of the stimulus package on track. Although the counter-cyclical fiscal stance is
cushioning the downturn, it would, together with the drop in tax revenues, increase the
11

See http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finances/docs/de_larosiere_report_en.pdf. The group proposes to set
up: (i) a European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC) linked to the ECB to bridge macro- and micro-prudential
oversight; and (ii) a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) to oversee the work of national
supervisors.

12

The French deposit insurance limit has been kept unchanged at €70,000.

13

The total cost of the RSA is estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP, but its net cost (after accounting for savings
from consolidating previous low-income supplements) is only 0.1 percent of GDP, which is financed by an
additional social charge on investment income. In the December 2008 stimulus package, a one-off allowance
(€200) was disbursed in April to people likely to be RSA eligible.

18
Box 4: Discretionary Fiscal Stimulus and its Impact
Discretionary fiscal stimulus measures to date amount to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and
0.5 percent in 2010. The 2009 budget already contained some relief measures to households and
businesses, including the TEPA law and the implementation of the RSA. Subsequently, the
government announced a €26 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) fiscal stimulus plan (Plan de relance) for
2009-10, followed by a package of household tax breaks and social benefits (0.1 percent of GDP);
reduction of the VAT rate for restaurants to 5.5 percent (0.1 percent of GDP); loans to the car industry
(0.3 percent of GDP); and the phasing-out of the taxe professionnelle (0.6 percent of GDP). The last
two measures are not included in the headline

•

Public investment will be boosted by direct
infrastructure investment at the central government level, the provision of matching revenues to
local authorities, and infrastructure projects to be implemented by public enterprises.

•

Households will benefit from a temporary reduction of the personal income tax in 2009, public
expenditures on social housing, additional unemployment benefits, and the extension of the social
safety net through the RSA.

The stimulus is estimated to raise real GDP by about 1 percent cumulatively in 2009-10.
Estimates of fiscal multipliers vary widely but studies generally concur on finding a higher multiplier
for direct expenditures than for tax relief. In the case of France, staff estimates that the tax multipliers
are in the range of 0.2-0.4 and expenditure multipliers in the range of 0.9-1.1.1 Assuming a full
compensation of the local business tax in 2010, the discretionary fiscal stimulus is expected to result in
a net real GDP impact of 0.7 percent in 2009 and of 0.2 percent in 2010.

overall fiscal deficit to almost 7½ percent of GDP in 2009. Taking account of the upfront
fiscal cost of the financial sector measures, the public debt is projected to increase to
77.5 percent of GDP in 2009 from 67.5 percent in 2008.15
35.
In the event that the economic downturn will be deeper and more protracted
than currently anticipated, some additional fiscal stimulus might be needed in 2010 but
fiscal space is limited (Box 5). Given the uncertainty around the baseline forecast, a possible
worsening of the economic outlook cannot be dismissed. Taking into account the trade-off
between the costs of additional debt and the potential benefits of further stimulus, staff
estimates that France could afford only a modest additional fiscal effort. The authorities
indicated that any additional stimulus would focus on measures which have the largest fiscal
multipliers, e.g., public investment and targeted transfers. They also noted that a continued
accommodative monetary policy stance of the ECB would support the effectiveness of the
fiscal stimulus.
36.
In view of the strong need for medium-term fiscal consolidation, fiscal stimulus
measures should include sunset clauses or be automatically reversible. In particular, this
would be desirable for the recently implemented VAT reduction for restaurants that
introduces an additional distortion in the tax system without generating broader economic
benefits. The elimination of the part of the local business tax (taxe professionnelle) that hurts
business investment is an important step toward streamlining the tax system. The authorities
have indicated that its implementation will be guided by the principle of revenue neutrality,
while seeking not to add to the already high tax burden on enterprises.
37.
Over the medium term, the main fiscal challenge remains to consolidate the
public finances as unchanged policies would lead to an unsustainable debt dynamics.
The multi-year fiscal framework law adopted in January 2009 envisages reducing the
structural balance to close to zero by 2012. This fiscal consolidation is based on the
government’s commitment to moderate real expenditure growth to about 1 percent but
underlying growth assumptions seem overly optimistic.16 The government’s recent spending
proposals (excluding stimulus measures) for the 2010 budget are in line with the expenditure
targets contained in the fiscal framework law. In addition, the President has announced a new
national loan to finance strategic priorities. While the size and content of this plan are still
under discussion, significant new spending would not be consistent with fiscal consolidation.
Under current policies and taking account of the economic downturn, staff projects France’s
structural fiscal deficits over the medium-term to remain broadly flat at almost 4½ percent of
15
16

The debt numbers do not include guarantees on non-general government debt.

The growth rate of real expenditures of the central government would be limited to zero percent, of the local
government to 1¼ percent, and of the social security administration to 1¾ percent. Real GDP growth was
assumed to be 0.2-0.5 percent in 2009, 2 percent in 2010, and 2½ percent in 2011-12.

20
Box 5. How Much Fiscal Space has France for an Additional Fiscal Stimulus in 2010?
The benefits of additional fiscal stimulus must be balanced against the costs. In the current
context of financial crisis and severe downturn, a fiscal stimulus can help prevent a drastic further
deterioration in activity. However, fiscal priorities such as keeping the debt under control or promoting
policy credibility may outweigh the benefits of fiscal easing. Among the factors determining fiscal
space are financing and sustainability constraints, institutional limits, and credibility issues.
•

•

•

Financing constraints. Measures of
sovereign default risks have risen since
early 2008, showing an increased
perception of sovereign risk. However,
compared to its EU partners, France
enjoys a relatively favorable position and
ranks well compared to its peers.

Credibility factors. Historically, French fiscal policy has shown a deficit bias, responding
asymmetrically to shocks by loosening during downturns but only modestly consolidating during
expansions. Stimulus measures enacted during downturns have often become permanent, placing
upward pressure on the public debt. The multi-year fiscal framework law is an important step
forward to raise credibility.

GDP. Given the expected persistence of a negative output gap, the overall deficit will remain
largely above the 3 percent Maastricht threshold and the public debt ratio would surpass
90 percent by 2012. Looking ahead, rising debt service obligations will aggravate the fiscal
costs related to population aging. Therefore, decisive implementation of a clear consolidation
strategy at all levels of government needs to be anchored in the 2010 budget and pursued in
the new multi-year fiscal framework to be prepared next year. Historical experience indicates
that successful fiscal consolidations were often launched in the midst of economic downturns
or the early stages of recovery.
38.
Starting in 2010, strictly containing real expenditure growth is required to
initiate a reduction in the public debt ratio and bring the deficit below the ceiling of
3 percent of GDP. While preparing for contingency stimulus measures, the government
should at the same time adopt credible medium-term consolidation plans to anchor

21
expectations. The table below illustrates the fiscal outcome under two different assumptions
on the real growth rate of structural primary expenditures (i.e. excluding discretionary fiscal
stimulus and unemployment benefits). The baseline scenario, based on current policies,
acknowledges the efforts made since 2008 to contain spending growth, notably the
maintenance of non-replacement of every second retiring civil servant in the central
government, but also assumes a somewhat larger inertia of expenditures than assumed in the
multi-year fiscal framework law. It assumes a real growth rate of primary structural
expenditures of 1.4 percent, above the average potential growth rate, which would not enable
to stabilize the debt ratio nor reduce the deficit under the Maastricht ceiling. The second
scenario illustrates the effects of decisive consolidation efforts. It assumes that the real
growth rate of structural primary expenditures will be limited to 0.4 percent from 2010
onwards. This would ensure a steady reduction in the structural deficit. Given the persistence
of a negative output gap, the overall deficit would remain above 3 percent of GDP through
2013. After peaking in 2013, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would start to decline.

1/ Primary fiscal impulse: increment of the primay structural balance (not reported).
2/ Assume a growth of real primary expenditures (excl. unemployment and fiscal
stimulus) of 0.4 instead of 1.4 percent from 2010 onwards.

39.
Fiscal consolidation would benefit from institutional reforms in the budget
process:
•

The credibility of the budget needs to be strengthened. Since 2001, the balanced
budget goal has been announced but continuously postponed. In spite of repeated
commitments, the deficit has never dipped under 2 percent of GDP, which has
undermined the government’s credibility. The multi-year budgeting approach could
provide the framework to restore credibility to the process but should be reinforced by
clearly articulating specific measures to achieve the announced fiscal targets. The

22
authorities could also benefit from adopting contingency spending reduction plans.
Increased ownership of the consolidation goals at all levels of government could help
achieve the necessary expenditure restraint.

•

Basing budget projections on more realistic
macroeconomic assumptions would help
ensure that the objectives are achieved.
Overly sanguine growth assumptions are bound
to lead to disappointing revenue collection and
too high spending growth. The government’s
assumption of real GDP growth of 2½ percent
in 2011-12 appears too optimistic in light of the
current growth outlook.

40.
The general review of public policies (Révision Générale des Politiques Publiques,
RGPP) was launched in 2008 and the government’s commitment to pursue the ensuing
reforms is to be commended. However, the budgetary savings identified so far (½ percent of
GDP) are insufficient to bring the public finances on a sustainable path and the measures
identified in the RGPP to improve spending quality at the central government level need to be
complemented by similar reviews for other levels of government.
41.
The consolidation progress already achieved by the central government is
encouraging. The objective of zero growth of real expenditures by the central government
would need to be maintained even when rising debt service would force offsets in other
expenditures. The authorities indicated that they intend to continue to focus on reducing
public sector employment (non-replacement of every second retiring civil servant).
42.
Caution should be given not to erode the benefits of improved spending
discipline through further recourse to already very large tax expenditures and social
contribution exemptions (niches fiscales et sociales). In this respect, completion of the
general review of the tax system (RGPO) would help streamline tax expenditures.17 Some
countries (e.g., Canada) have succeeded in reducing tax expenditures, which tend to be
nontransparent and distortive. A key element is to incorporate the ongoing annual reviews in
the government budget; these reviews should assess these policies on their relevance,
effectiveness, and cost-efficiency. A thorough tax review would also help to streamline the
tax code, broaden the tax base, and move to more unified VAT rates, in order to increase tax
productivity and reduce incentives to shift activities to the informal sector. An increased use
of environmental taxation would match recent initiatives proposed by several European
countries.
17

Revenue losses are estimated at about €70 billion per year (some 3½ percent of GDP).

23
43.
Greater fiscal responsibility at the local government level is vital to healthy
public finances. Increased devolution of responsibilities to local governments has so far
failed to deliver more fiscal discipline through a clearer connection between the cost and the
benefits of public services. The civil service reduction implemented at the central level was
broadly balanced by hiring at the local government level. The spending drift by overlapping
regional and local government structures would need to be reassessed. In this respect, the
arrival of large cohorts of local civil servants at retirement age after 2010 provides an
opportunity for savings by extending the policy of non-replacement of every second retiring
civil servant to local governments. The authorities indicated their intention to take action
based on the recommendations of the Balladur Committee which focus on improving local
government effectiveness.
44.
With an aging population, continued efforts are necessary to ensure the
sustainability of the social security system. The reform of special pension regimes in 2007
and the gradual increase of the contribution period needed for entitlement to a full pension
will slightly reduce the significant projected financing gaps in the period ahead. Reforming
the structure of the pension system could limit its fiscal cost for new entrants in the labor
market. However, the legal pension age of 60 years remains considerably below that in other
euro area countries. The authorities have initiated welcome first steps toward discussing the
pension age with social partners, and this discussion should be intensified as part of the
planned social dialogue “Rendez-vous 2010.” With respect to health costs, expenditure
control has helped to reduce spending slippages, but further action is needed. It is also
important to adequately take account of rising long-term health expenditures resulting from
technical progress in health services and to start preparing an appropriate policy response.
45.
The success of fiscal consolidation will be helped by progress in implementing
the structural reform agenda. Although France is not expected to grow out of its public
debt, measures to raise labor force participation and productivity would significantly
contribute to ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability.
C. Competitiveness and Structural Reforms Critical for Higher Growth
46.
The French economy needs to boost its potential output. It is therefore crucial to
pursue steadily the reform agenda started in 2007, as structural rigidities would also
negatively affect the expected pace of the recovery. Significant structural reforms have been
initiated but lack of competitiveness remains the main issue behind the current account
deficit and structural rigidities still hamper labor and product markets.
47.
Despite a modest improvement since end-2007, a competitiveness gap, in
particular with Germany, remains. The current account balance has improved in late 2008,
after an almost continued deterioration since 2002, although foreign market shares have
continued to slide. Since 2002, the REER has appreciated by 10 percent (both based on
consumer prices and on unit labor costs), reflecting in part the 40 percent appreciation of the

24
euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate over the same period. However, the REER, based on
consumer prices, is only 1 percent higher than its average level over the past 30 years.
Assessments based on the CGER methodologies point on average to a small overvaluation in
2008, which was partly corrected by end-March 2009. Overall, the evolution of the REER
cannot fully explain France’s disappointing export performance. While higher wage increases
in France than in the euro area as a whole were compensated by somewhat higher
productivity growth, the rise in unit labor costs vis-à-vis Germany has resulted in a loss of
competitiveness. Supply rigidities in responding to changing global demand have also
hampered export performance. Wage moderation and structural reforms are needed to close
the competitiveness gap.

48.
Increasing the employment rate would boost potential output, smooth
distributional inequalities, and help restore fiscal sustainability. France has one of the
lowest employment rates among OECD countries—especially among seniors, low-skilled,
and young workers. Lifting the French employment rate (65.2 percent of the labor force)
gradually to the average level in the euro area (67.3 percent) would boost the potential growth
rate by up to ½ percent over the medium term and reduce unemployment-related government
expenditures by up to 1 percent of GDP. The labor market modernization law (Loi de
Modernisation du Marché de Travail, MMT) adopted in June 2008, following negotiations
with the social partners, has somewhat eased labor contract regulations and lifted some
restrictions of the 35-hour work week but the tax and social contribution exemptions of
overtime work weigh heavily on the public purse. Vigorously pursuing labor reforms should
include:
•

Fully equipping the unified job placement agency (Pôle emploi) to effectively boost
support to unemployed workers and strictly enforce job-search requirements.
International experience points to the need to focus on job training, placement
services, and cooperation with private agencies, in order to strengthen activation
policies.

•

Helping low-skilled workers enter the job market. The recently introduced RSA is a
step in the right direction to remove inactivity traps keeping potential low-skilled

25
workers out of the labor force. In addition, moderation of the relatively high minimum
wage (SMIC) needs to be pursued in order to help low-skilled workers find a job and
reinforce the trend decline in the share of workers paid at the SMIC.18 The creation of
the independent expert commission for SMIC review is a welcome step in this regard.
Beyond labor costs, low-skilled workers are also penalized by the lack of competition
in several service sectors that prevents innovation and job creation.
•

Promoting “senior labor.” France has implemented several reforms, notably the
gradual withdrawal of the waiver on job-search requirements for older unemployed
workers and the gradual increase in the contribution period needed for obtaining a full
pension. In addition, the government and the social partners should find an
understanding on the need to raise the legal retirement age to facilitate entry for older
workers. Effective vocational training and activation policies are also required to help
senior workers rejoin the labor market.

49.
Further product market reforms are essential for energizing economic growth,
creating jobs, and increasing consumer welfare. The inflation dynamics initiated by the
boom in energy and commodity prices in early 2008 have highlighted some concerns about
price-setting in food and retail markets. Promoting competition would be a durable way to
raise purchasing power, while supporting productivity growth and enhancing
competitiveness.
50.
Retail trade has been partially liberalized but important steps remain to be
taken. Staff welcomes the recent establishment of a single and reinforced Competition
Authority, which should help implement stronger competition policies and increase the
visibility of resulting benefits. The economic modernization law (Loi de Modernisation de
l’Economie, LME) has eased some restrictions on new retail establishments but discounters
continue to face administrative limitations to entry into the French market. Deregulating
opening hours and sales periods of stores would promote a more competitive environment
leading to lower prices for consumers. Also, the benefits to the consumer of ending price
regulations on key products, for example over-the-counter drugs, would be enhanced if
followed by market liberalization.
51.
The EU Services Directive provides an opportunity for further liberalization
that should be fully seized. The OECD has identified that in France entry barriers and
restrictions on professional services go beyond what is needed for consumer protection.
Introducing greater competition in health-related services and professional services to
businesses and individuals (notaries, accountants) would be a welcome structural reform.
18

The share of workers paid at the minimum wage in France (15 percent) is about double the average in OECD
countries, SMIC moderation will be required for some time to reestablish a motivating wage scale.

France–Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC): Module I–Fiscal Transparency

October 17, 2000

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 01/196, 11/05/01

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 04/345, 11/03/04

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and
has introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information.
Notable areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to
include more complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals
principles in a number of areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested
that further steps could be taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget
presentation, provide a more consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation
process, and improve the reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general
government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which
has become fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the
first multi-annual fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal
objectives for the period 2009-12. The budget is organized along missions and provides
details on the level of appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which

4
the expected results of the mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been
given the new assignment of certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accrualsbasis accounting has been confirmed. Parliamentary oversight powers have been
strengthened.

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noticed that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high
priority by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of
the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major
agencies disclose their objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open
processes of policymaking and regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by
dissemination of relevant information to the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for
internal conduct, integrity, and accountability. However, the staff noted that the framework
for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual insurance firms is not as well defined and
suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency of monetary policy was not assessed
by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the European System of Central
Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of
mutual insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation
created a single supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et
Institutions de Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA)
and mutualities’ supervisor (CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was
strengthened and the powers of the supervisory authorities extended.

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de
France for the production of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the
reporting burden and the confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably
through the CNIS. Professionalism is central to the statistical operations of the two
institutions, internationally and/or European accepted methodologies are generally followed,
the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is remarkable, statistics are relevant
and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of
INSEE as the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing
between the Banque de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved;
classification and valuation methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency
between the current account of the balance of payments and the goods and services account
in the national accounts improved; the timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual
national accounts aligned; and identification of data production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations,
including by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater
use of firm-level data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying
work on portfolio investment income with the objective of starting to record those
transactions on an accrual basis.

IMF Country Report
No. 05/186, 06/08/05

Summary: The report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory
and regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS.
The degree of observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French
banking sector has been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well

6
capitalized. Systemic vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained.
Securities markets are large and sophisticated.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the French financial sector, a number of issues emerged
from the FSAP, including (i) concentration in banking may have reached a point where
further consolidation could intensify concerns over the scope for collusion and long-term
stability where many banks could be considered “too big to fail;” (ii) banks’ large and
growing portfolios of fixed-rate residential housing loans could represent a longer-term risk
in the event of large increases in funding costs and/or a significant fall in real estate prices;
(iii) some administered savings schemes and other policy measures give rise to costs and
impede financial market innovation. These schemes are not well targeted to achieve intended
social goals and are not well aligned with current priorities, such as strengthening the pension
system; (iv) the banking system’s rapid accumulation of capital strengthens banks’ resilience.
This accumulation is harder to control for mutual banks, given their legal restrictions on
remuneration of their members. And, for all banks, it could encourage expansion through
expensive takeovers and risky new ventures; (v) the supervisory system of the financial
sector is composed of specialized segments. Coordination mechanisms need to be further
adapted. Additional steps should be considered in the future as cross-sectoral financial
groups become more prevalent; (vi) the consolidation of the French stock and futures
markets with others in Europe has increased the importance of effective cooperation across
national jurisdictions. Moreover, the authorities face the challenge of adjusting to and
effectively implementing the significant regulatory overhaul that took place in late 2003; and
(vii) the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities is generally
sound and modern. However, there is some room for improvement in the clearing and
settlement of retail payments and securities, where the multilateral netting systems lack fully
adequate safeguards to ensure timely settlement in case of default.

7
ANNEX II. FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund
is adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and
financial data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France
subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in
electronic form from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques)
and the profusion of data from various institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of
finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have helped to build an infrastructure, in which all
data can be easily accessed through the Economic Data Sharing System. A data ROSC
mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and the report was
published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was published in November
2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central
Bank framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms
developed by STA. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are
also disseminated in the quarterly IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics.
France follows the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data
for GDP and its expenditure components are available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and
quarterly accounts provide reliable information, although estimates from the two accounts
differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to be aligned to the annual ones. In
2005, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2000 prices.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the
source data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally
responsible for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is
consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it
includes expenditure tables and government revenues by subsector (central government,
miscellaneous central government agencies, local governments, and social security
administration).
Balance-of-payments statistics should be interpreted with caution, given large errors and
omissions. Greater coherence between the external current account and the rest of the world
account in the national accounts is needed. In this regard, work with promising early results
has been undertaken on the transportation account.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with France
On July 29, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with France. 1
Background
The global financial crisis and the contraction of world trade have pulled the French economy
into a severe recession and put its financial sector under strain. Structural features combined
with early policy action have helped soften the downturn, which is somewhat less pronounced
than in the euro area as a whole. Nonetheless, unemployment has risen steeply since mid2008, while consumer price inflation has come down rapidly. With the fiscal stance easing in
2008, the budget deficit exceeded the Maastricht ceiling. French banks faced the need to write
down toxic assets, and government recapitalization and liquidity measures were required to
support the sector. While significant, financial sector losses remained below those in peer
countries.
The authorities responded to the deepening of the crisis in 2008 by adopting fiscal and financial
sector measures. In response to the crisis automatic stabilizers were allowed to operate fully,
with further support provided by a discretionary fiscal stimulus package (above 1½ percent of
GDP for 2009-10). The fiscal measures are mostly front-loaded and relatively well diversified,
with an emphasis on temporary investment expenditures and various tax breaks. The
authorities also undertook a number of measures to recapitalize banks and support liquidity.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Those measures have helped to stabilize the financial system and thus far no French bank has
come under majority state ownership. France has been playing an active role in promoting
international regulatory and supervisory reforms in support of increased cross border
cooperation in financial stability.
Important structural reform measures have been taken, or are under review. Progress includes
the establishment of a single Competition Authority with enlarged powers, the creation of a
unified job placement agency, and the partial liberalization of retail markets. Further action in
the areas of pension reform, job creation, and on improving market efficiency and productivity
are under debate.
The near-term outlook is challenging with real GDP projected to drop by 3 percent in 2009,
followed by a gradual recovery in 2010. The risks to the outlook are mostly tilted to the
downside in view of the sensitivity of the French economy to a worse-than-foreseen contraction
in the European Union and underlying tail risks, in particular in the financial sector. The steep
increase in unemployment could further shake confidence and weaken private consumption. A
worsening of the financial crisis would hurt banks’ balance sheets and could further depress
credit growth. At the same time, lower trade openness and higher social protection are expected
to continue to shelter the French economy relative to its peers.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the French economy has not been immune from the global crisis.
The country is in deep recession, unemployment is rising, and the financial sector is under
strain. Nevertheless, France has been somewhat less affected than the euro area as a whole
due to its relatively low trade openness and large social safety net. The authorities’ early policy
response, together with the economy’s structural features, has helped soften the downturn and
stabilize the financial system. Directors commended the size and composition of the fiscal
stimulus measures—with full play of France’s sizable automatic stabilizers.
Directors noted that the near-term economic outlook remains challenging, with GDP growth
expected to contract by 3 percent in 2009 and to recover only gradually in 2010. Risks are tilted
to the downside, and the crisis could also dampen potential output growth, calling for continued
progress with the structural reform agenda. Directors recognized, however, that near- and
medium-term economic projections are subject to unusual uncertainty at the present juncture.
Directors saw the main challenge to fiscal policy as the provision of short-term stimulus without
derailing medium-term fiscal consolidation objectives. A number of Directors considered that
some modest additional fiscal action might be needed if downside risks materialize, but should
be focused on temporary and investment-based measures given France’s limited fiscal space.
A number of other Directors, however, saw no scope for additional fiscal support, in light of the
sizable stimulus already in train and the pressing consolidation needs.
Directors stressed that safeguarding medium-term fiscal sustainability and avoiding
unsustainable debt dynamics is a key priority for the coming years, and they welcomed the
authorities’ determination in this regard. Important steps already taken in this direction are the
adoption of a multi-year budgeting framework, zero-growth expenditure at the central

3
government level, and the ongoing reduction in public sector employment. Directors
encouraged the authorities to build on these measures by embarking on a resolute medium
term consolidation effort. The strategy should be underpinned by realistic growth assumptions,
the articulation of specific expenditure savings at all levels of government, and the streamlining
of tax expenditures. Directors looked forward to institutional steps aimed at ensuring that efforts
by the central government are accompanied by enhanced fiscal responsibility at the local level.
With an aging population, continued efforts are necessary to ensure the sustainability of the
social security system.
Directors observed that high supervision standards and cautious lending practices have helped
French banks weather the financial crisis relatively well. They considered that the government’s
intervention in the banking sector has been well-handled, while suggesting that further
intervention should not be ruled out. It will be important to continue to closely monitor banking
sector risks, in view of potential spillovers from mature markets. Directors underlined that
further, preferably EU-wide coordinated, stress tests would help assess the need for any followup actions to address capital and liquidity needs. Directors commended the authorities’
leadership in bringing forward international regulatory reforms, particularly on strengthening
supervision of EU-wide financial groups, and supported their call for coordination on exit
strategies from financial sector support.
Directors called for sustained further progress on France’s reform agenda. They welcomed the
authorities’ determination to tackle long-standing structural weaknesses alongside near-term
crisis-related efforts, with a special focus on labor and product market reforms. To boost
competitiveness and growth, safeguard fiscal sustainability, and raise welfare, Directors
recommended efforts to foster job creation—especially for young, low-skilled, and senior
workers. This would include continuing moderation in the setting of the minimum wage,
activation policies such as job training, and raising the legal retirement age to promote senior
employment. Directors welcomed the recent establishment of a single Competition Authority
and recommended to draw on the EU services directive for deregulating certain professional
services.

Statement by Ambroise Fayolle, Executive Director for France
July 29, 2009
We wish to thank staff for a thought-provoking report that conveys a broadly fair picture
of the current situation of the French economy and the challenges it faces.
The discussions with the team were very much appreciated by the French authorities, in
addition to providing useful input for their own assessments at this critical juncture. The
French authorities set great store in the surveillance exercise and have full confidence in
the Fund’s expertise as illustrated by the fact that they shared in confidence with staff the
aggregated results of the stress tests of the French banks. They fully agree with the need
to align actions to counter the crisis with indispensable longer-term reforms. It is in that
spirit that they have handled the situation so far.
Resilience to the crisis: appropriate policies and structural features
The French economy has not been immune from the extraordinary global crisis: 2009 is a
year of recession and unemployment has risen. My authorities’ forecasts are broadly in
line with staff, even if they tend to see risks as being more balanced around their similar
baseline scenario. While acknowledging that the current situation calls for great caution
when forecasting, the recent satisfactory data that have just been released for the second
quarter could lead to an upward revision for the second half of 2009.
Three features have helped smooth the impact of the crisis rather well compared to
some other advanced countries, as acknowledged by staff:
- appropriate ad hoc policies : (i) the fiscal stimulus (1 ½ percent of GDP
according to staff, a little more according to my authorities who acknowledge that
staff had to abide by a Fund-wide methodology) which was diversified,
effectively front-loaded, and with an emphasis on temporary investment
expenditures and tax breaks ; and (ii) the measures to support the banking
sector : creation of an independent médiateur du crédit (i.e. Ombudsman)
between banks and borrowers ; setting of indicative credit targets for banks ;
creation of a bank refinancing agency (SFEF) to help bank lending to households,
SMEs, and local governments; creation of a bank recapitalization agency (SPPE),
available on a voluntary basis ; support of two banks (Dexia group, in close and
efficient cooperation with the governments of Belgium and Luxembourg ; Groupe
Caisse d’Epargne and Groupe Banque populaire, which are about to merge, with a
partial capital injection from the SPPE) ;
- sizeable automatic stabilizers, that amount to 3 percent of GDP, and constitute
a key element of government support to the economy;
- structural features pertaining notably to its growth model (where private
consumption plays a significant role), the high level of social welfare – including

2
unemployment benefits, an ambitious and comprehensive long standing
regulation framework of financial institutions and, last but not least, sound
household and banks’ behavior. In that regard, my authorities agree that the
lending practices of the banks and the consistent supervisory coverage of all
lending institutions (para. 15) played a significant role.
Financial sector: a relevant business model and sound supervision
We are grateful for the Selected Issues, which provide useful input to the debate, in
particular the section on “French banks amid the global financial crisis”.
French banks have proved to be relatively resilient. The financial crisis has taken its
toll on bank profits and market financing costs remain elevated in relative terms, but two
key features of the French banks can be put forward to explain why they have weathered
the crisis comparatively well.
First, most French banks have a universal banking business model. Their activities
are well diversified and retail banking accounts for an important share of their profits.
Consequently, they also rely on a large deposit base for their funding. In addition, their
lending practices are rather conservative, in particular in the mortgage sector where
lending standards are based on households’ ability to service their debt according to their
revenues rather than on the value of their purchases.
Second, banks have been protected by a sound supervision model. As recalled by
staff, the stress tests conducted by the Commission bancaire showed the banks’ continued
resilience under different adverse scenarios. This said, the global financial and economic
environment is still highly uncertain and my authorities will continue to remain vigilant
and closely monitor the situation of the sector.
The crisis must also be seen as an opportunity to rebuild a sounder international
financial system less likely to give birth to turmoil of this magnitude. Looking forward,
my authorities are determined to keep on top of the domestic, European and international
agenda the timely implementation of the ambitious decisions agreed by the G-20 Leaders
regarding the reform of financial regulation.
Fiscal: an unprecedented effort to keep expenditures under control
My authorities entirely agree with staff on the need to keep a sound public debt
strategy. They are very attached to preserving the credibility of the budget1. As a
consequence, they have stuck to the objective of zero growth of real expenditures of the
central government.
1

In that regard, the second bullet point of para. 39, page 22, should be nuanced : between 1997 and 2007,
differences between draft finance law and consensus, forecast or actual, were not biased in a systematic
way ; and it is fair to recognize that 2008 and 2009 are two exceptional years.

3

An unprecedented effort to reduce public sector employment is under way (nonreplacement of every second retiring civil servant in the central government) that has
been reaffirmed during the crisis. A strong emphasis is put on controlling health costs and
local authorities’ expenditures.
My authorities take good note of staff’s recommendations on institutional reforms
in the budget process. They discussed extensively with staff the issue of increased
ownership of the consolidation goals at all levels of government. They share the goal but
have to comply with the constitutional and political environment. They have committed
to consider how to adopt and implement many important, although highly sensitive,
measures put forward in a recent report drafted by a bipartisan group, chaired by former
Prime Minister Balladur, notably the adoption of an annual target for local expenditure
growth. A draft law is currently under preparation by the government and could be
presented to parliament in the very near future.
More broadly, the general review of public policies (RGPP), launched in 2008 at the
government level, has been extended to other levels of government, as recommended
by staff, starting with state-owned firms.
As for tax expenditures and social contribution exemptions, the multi-year fiscal
framework law enacted in January 2009 has adopted the principle of strict
neutrality (i.e. any adoption of such an exemption must be fully compensated by a cut in
expenditure). My authorities thank staff for the useful discussion during the mission, as
reflected in para. 42. This issue is at the top of the agenda of my authorities. As for the
environmental taxation, former Prime Minister Rocard has been asked to chair a
bipartisan mission to explore the modalities of the adoption of a carbon tax. A decision
should be reached soon by the government in the context of the upcoming 2010 budget.
Structural reforms: building on the momentum
Staff’s assessment of the negative impact of the crisis on the potential growth in the
short run seems pessimistic, with a trend much lower than that of the OECD, among
others, not to mention the French government. Given the significant implications such a
figure can have on structural balance assessment, we look forward to a more general
discussion on potential growth in systemic countries as promised by management.
Among other nuances to staff’s calculations:
- since 2003, several measures taken by the authorities have put a halt to the
decreasing trend of time work ;

4
- staff considers for granted that the crises only have a negative impact on total
factor productivity (TFP), whereas this effect is in fact ambiguous and is therefore
considered with caution by other institutions and economists ;
- some assumptions are inaccurate. For instance, it is stated in box 3 that the
INSEE labor force projection “was based on relatively favorable economic
conditions with a gradual reduction of unemployment”, when in fact these
projections were based on a constant labor force participation.
That said, my authorities are totally convinced of the need for structural reforms in
the short and longer run and are determined to stick to their reform agenda, as
acknowledged by staff in its two previous article IV consultations. This agenda aims at
promoting competition, raising the employment rate, and increasing the flexibility of the
labor market.
My authorities’ determination for reforms has not decreased with the crisis. A lot
has been accomplished since the last article IV consultation. Let me underscore a few
achieved as well as ongoing reforms, most of which having been mentioned in the report
: (i) competition : the unique and reinforced authority (an IMF recommendation) is in
place since March ; the legal and institutional framework of retail trade has been
considerably liberalized ; the distribution of Livret A (savings account) has been
generalized ; (ii) working hour flexibility and the rise of labor force participation : a
much more liberalized contract relationship, easement of the 35-hour week legislation,
broadening of the authorization of work on Sunday, unification of the job placement
agency, no government boost to the minimum wage for the third year in a row,
introduction of a new earned income supplement, the revenu de solidarité active (RSA)
that smoothes the effect of benefit thresholds to increase low-skilled employment ; (iii)
promoting “senior labor” : possibility to combine pension and salary, increase in
pension for those who retire later…
More broadly, my authorities are determined to tackle the challenges of an aging
population. Beyond the 2007 reform of special pension regimes and the gradual increase
of the contribution period, in 2010 the authorities will hold a public and nation-wide
debate on the legal retirement age.
International support
France remains committed to provide financial support dedicated to mitigating the impact
of the crisis on countries hit hard. As for the IMF, France assumes its full responsibilities
as a shareholder: it has entered into a bilateral loan agreement of $15 billion with the
Fund and has provided $1 billion to the PRGF-ESF trust fund.
