ST. LUCIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation
with St. Lucia
Approved by Ratna Sahay and Matthew Fisher
December 6, 2005
• Economic Background: St. Lucia is a small open island economy, with a population of around
162,000 and per capita GDP of about US$4,700. It is one of eight eastern Caribbean countries and
territories comprising the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), and its GDP accounts for
25 percent of the combined ECCU GDP. The ECCU has a common central bank, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (E.C.) dollar. The
E.C. dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976.
St. Lucia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Fund
relations are summarized in Appendix I.
• Political Situation: St. Lucia is a Westminster-style democracy with a bicameral parliament
consisting of the Senate (11 seats) and the House of Assembly (17 seats). Prime Minister
Dr. Kenny Anthony of the St. Lucia Labour Party (SLP) has been in office since May 1997. The next
elections are due by December 2006.
• Last Article IV Consultation: At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultations on May 5,
2004, Directors expressed concerns about vulnerabilities associated with increasing debt and
emphasized the importance of strong upfront fiscal adjustment and continued moderation in
expenditures. They further emphasized the need to accelerate structural reforms, encouraging the
authorities to step up their efforts to foster a conducive business environment, while reducing costly
tax incentives to investment, and promoting labor market flexibility and labor productivity to preserve
competitiveness. The staff report is at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2004/pn04128.htm.
• Discussions: A staff team comprising H.P. Lankes (PDR, Head), W. Keller, C. Faircloth, and
S. Roache (all WHD) visited Castries during July 4–18, 2005. The team met with Prime Minister and
Minister of Economy Dr. Kenny Anthony, other members of Cabinet, senior government officials,
and representatives of the private sector and trade unions. ECCB and Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB) staff also participated in the discussions. R. Sahay (WHD) and K. Lynch and P. Jenkins
(OED) attended the final meetings.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

St. Lucia’s GDP growth has slowed since the 1980s and public debt has risen
rapidly in recent years. The development of tourism did not fully compensate for the
declining production of bananas and other export products since 1990. A restrictive trade
regime, high cost of capital, and labor market rigidities appear to have hampered
structural change. Public debt built up as the authorities attempted to stimulate growth,
contributing to making the economy more vulnerable to shocks.

•

The recent pick-up in economic activity provides an opportunity to address these
challenges. GDP growth is accelerating, based on tourism and related investments, and
is expected to exceed 5 percent in 2005 and 2006. The positive growth outlook provides
a window to reduce the fiscal imbalances and adopt measures to strengthen competition
and flexibility in labor and goods markets.

•

Fiscal policy should aim to set public debt on a rapidly declining path. While fiscal
deficits have narrowed since 2003, the budget for the current fiscal year would sharply
set back fiscal consolidation. However, in light of capacity constraints, the full
implementation of budgeted capital expenditure is unlikely. Regarding the medium term,
there was agreement on targeting a primary surplus of 3−4 percent of GDP by
FY 2008/09 which would reduce debt to below 60 percent of GDP by the end of the
decade.

•

Fiscal consolidation should be based on a combination of revenue and expenditure
measures. Staff and the authorities broadly agreed on most key elements of such a
program, including lowering capital spending to historical levels, sustained moderation
in civil service wage growth and employment, the implementation of a VAT, and the
need to protect the yield of the petroleum tax through fuel price adjustments. The
authorities were concerned that a large reduction of tax concessions would render the
economy uncompetitive vis-à-vis other islands that also offer such concessions.

•

Long-term growth would benefit from a stronger outward orientation, and
measures to promote domestic investment and labor market flexibility. Staff
recommended cutting peak import tariffs and licenses to promote export diversification,
lowering the cost of capital by easing foreclosure laws, better targeting investment
incentives, raising labor mobility under the CSME to broaden the available skills mix,
and strengthening assistance programs to help ease the movement of banana workers
into other sectors while cushioning the social impact. The authorities were committed to
trade integration and greater competition, but argued that reforms required time.

•

There has been some progress in addressing financial and natural vulnerabilities.
Still, the stock of nonperforming loans remains high and should be closely monitored.
St. Lucia has a well-designed disaster prevention and mitigation framework, but
enforcement will be key. Public assets should be insured against natural disasters to a
greater degree.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
St. Lucia is a small, open, tourism-based economy that is highly vulnerable to
exogenous shocks. Tourism accounts for almost three-quarters of St. Lucia’s exports, and
imports are the dominant source of consumption, investment, and tax revenue. Though less
exposed to hurricanes than islands in the northern Caribbean, St. Lucia has been affected by
seven major storms in the past 20 years.

St. Lucia’s service sectors have grown considerably over the past two decades,
but GDP growth overall has declined since the 1980s. Growth averaged 7½ percent per
annum during the 1980s, as tourism and banana production took off, but has slowed to less
than 2 percent per annum. since 1990. While tourism continued to grow, agriculture and, to a
lesser extent, manufacturing shrank in absolute terms.
3.
Falling banana exports contributed to the slowdown in growth, but there has
also been a decline in other exports. Banana exports have suffered from rising costs and the
gradual erosion of preference

The share of trade in GDP fell from 142 percent in 1987−96, to 121 percent in 1997−2004, a period during
which that ratio increased in most other countries. Using a gravity model that takes into account its location,
income and size, staff estimates that St. Lucia under-trades in merchandise by 20 percent in a sample of 140
countries, and by 34 percent relative to other microstates. For comparison, the same model suggests that the
ECCU region (excluding St. Lucia) under-trades by 12 percent.

St. Lucia scores well on
several social indicators, but
unemployment remains high.
Results from a Core Welfare
Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ)
survey designed with UNDP
assistance indicate near-universal
adult literacy, strong health
indicators, and fair access to social
services (Annex III). The
unemployment rate declined from
20 percent in 2003 to 18 percent by
end-2004, but is significantly
higher among the youth and women.

A restrictive trade regime, high cost of capital and labor market rigidities
appear to have contributed to the decline in investment and growth since the 1980s. It is
likely that the existing inward bias

than in its OECS peers,3 although the government has questioned these results.

Box 1. The Cost of Capital in St. Lucia
Economic theory and a range of
empirical evidence suggest that the cost
of capital is an important determinant
of investment. The financing cost of
capital is comprised of three elements.
First, the weighted-average cost of debt
and equity finance, with the weights
determined by historical financing shares.
Second, the depreciation rates of existing
capital. Third, tax effects including the
corporate income tax rate and capital
allowance policies, but excluding tax
concessions (many of which lower
operating costs rather than the cost of
capital).

Since 2000, the post-tax cost of capital in St. Lucia has averaged around 16½ percent, more than
1½ percentage points higher than during the 1990s. Rising real interest rates explain most of this increase.
Spreads of commercial lending rates over deposit rates in St. Lucia have, since 1999, averaged 8.4 percent, the

The real post-tax cost of capital for St.
Lucia’s domestic private sector was
around 15 percent in 2004.1 Depreciation,
estimated for St. Lucia using global
depreciation rates weighted according to the
sectoral composition of the economy,
accounts for the largest share of the cost of
capital. The next largest contributor is the
post-tax real interest rate. It is estimated that
investment in St. Lucia has been financed
mostly by debt. Tax reforms in the early
1990s lowered the tax burden on capital, but
high and rising real interest rates
subsequently eroded the present value of
future capital allowance deductions.

Refers to the “Hall-Jorgensen” real financing cost of capital. The figures in the table show the effect of tax
policy in St. Lucia on the cost of capital. The figure shows the cost of capital on a pre-tax basis for St. Lucia and
other ECCU countries for which data were available. The weights for the cost of financing are based on the
ratio of outstanding bank credit over the nominal capital stock for the domestic private sector: 55 and 45 percent
for debt and equity for St. Lucia, respectively. Depreciation rates were estimated using the OECD STAN
database. The cost of equity was estimated as the sum of the three-month Euro dollar interest rates, plus the
equity risk premium. This uses a country-specific risk factor, which is the coefficient of excess returns of a
weighted portfolio of global and emerging market assets to the excess returns of the global equity market (i.e., a
capital asset pricing model beta). The weights in this portfolio attempt to reflect the risk-return profile of
investment in that country, based on sectoral contributions to GDP. This scales the expectations-based global
equity risk premium (based on the ten-year U.S. treasury bond, the global stock market dividend yield and an
estimate of long-term nominal dividend growth).

Public debt levels have risen rapidly since the late 1990s, although they remain
below the region’s average. While St. Lucia has had a history of prudent fiscal policies,
budget deficits widened after 1999, following the economic slowdown. The central
government deficit deteriorated from an average of 0.2 percent of GDP during the 1990s to
4.5 percent since FY 2000/01, with public debt rising rapidly from 39 percent in
FY 1999/2000, to over 67 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05. While St. Lucia’s public debt
ratios remain below those of its ECCU partners, the deterioration in its fiscal balance in
recent years has been more pronounced.

7.
Commercial borrowing coincided with a period of declining concessional
assistance. ODA inflows, an important source of infrastructure finance in the 1980s and
early 1990s, fell from an average of 3 percent of GDP in 1990−96 to 1 percent in 1997−2004.
8.
Parliamentary elections are due to be held before the end of 2006 and pressure
to spend is mounting ahead of the 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC). Prime Minister
Dr. Kenny Anthony, who leads the St. Lucia Labor Party (SLP), is in his second term of
office, having been re-elected in December 2001. The SLP presently occupies 6 of 11 seats
in the Senate and 13 of 17 seats in the House of Assembly. The opposition United Workers
Party (UWP) has been highlighting unemployment and rising public debt as key concerns.
St. Lucia has been selected to host—among others—the England team and several important
games between February and May 2007. In view of the size, international visibility, and
popularity of this event, the government has made the games a central plank of a strategy to
market St. Lucia abroad and energize domestic businesses.

Box 2. Past Staff Policy Advice
Since 2000, staff policy advice has centered around the need to control the growing public debt. Staff proposed
prioritizing capital outlays, curtailing current spending, tax reforms and a regional approach to reducing costly
tax concessions. While the authorities downplayed staff’s sense of urgency about the debt build-up, initial steps
towards fiscal consolidation have been taken in the past two years. Fiscal imbalances narrowed as revenue
responded to a pick-up in economic activity and spending remained restrained. Longer term reforms have been
progressing slowly and preparations for the introduction of a VAT have met with delays.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS
9.
Economic activity has picked up since 2003 and growth is likely to accelerate
further in 2005. Real GDP

continued to trend downward,
while other agriculture and manufacturing have shown little dynamism.
10.
Investment in tourist resorts and infrastructure is fueling demand for
construction. The government expects investment in tourist resorts to add about 1,100 new
hotel rooms by early 2007, an increase of 30 percent over the current stock. Combined with
public investment plans, demand for construction is projected to grow by around 20 percent
in each of 2005 and 2006. Companies intend to recruit foreign labor, with the assistance of
the authorities, but shortages of labor and materials are nevertheless likely.4 According to
private sector representatives, the rapid build-up in resorts is straining existing capacity

4

Such shortages were associated with a large rise in public investment in the early 1990s. Cement and bitumen
were reportedly in short supply during the mission in July.

in water, power, road, training, security, airlift and other services. Staff project that following
an intense period of construction, activity in this sector will decline sharply leading to a
deceleration of GDP growth and a strengthening of the external current account in 2007–08.
11.
Together with higher oil prices, demand for construction is contributing to a rise
in inflation. Wages in construction are reportedly increasing, and consumer price inflation,
which averaged 1.1 percent during 2001−04, reached 4 percent over the 12 months to July,
2005. The partial pass-through, in August 2005, of higher oil prices to fuel and transport
prices will have a further direct impact on the consumer price index of 1 percent (Box 3).
With a pick-up in money demand, broad money (M2) grew by 13 percent per annum through
July 2005, and credit to the private sector (primarily consumer lending) has been expanding
strongly.
Box 3. Managing the Rise in Oil Prices
St. Lucia maintains a system of fixed prices for most petroleum products. Retail prices are adjusted
infrequently, and the government absorbs the impact of changing import prices through a variable levy. The
system is similar to that in other ECCU countries, with the exception of Dominica which has a mechanism to
pass through international prices.
Fuel prices were increased in August, adjusting for part of the recent rise in oil prices. The price increase,
by EC$1 per imperial gallon (12 percent), briefly re-established a positive tax margin on fuel before a sharp oil
price increase in September. An additional increase by EC$2 would, at August 24 fuel import prices, have
restored the average tax margin prevailing in 2002 (when petroleum taxation accounted for 2.4 percent of GDP
in tax revenues). Prices for kerosene and cooking gas (LPG) were left unchanged at highly subsidized levels for
social reasons, at an estimated cost to the budget of around EC$2 million (0.1 percent of GDP).

It is recommended to adopt a flexible pricing mechanism. Adjusting petroleum prices continuously,
according to a transparent price-setting formula, would reduce the need for ad hoc adjustments, allow full passthrough to consumers and instill more efficient energy use. Concerns over the possible adverse impact on the
poor can be met through more targeted, means-tested forms of support. Over time, it would be desirable to return
to earlier levels of taxation. The ECCB Monetary Council in October recommended that countries adopt a
common oil pricing mechanism that is transparent, credible, and predictable.
As most goods are imported, higher fuel prices affect primarily the cost of local transportation, and the
impact on growth appears to have been modest. Fuel prices and those of bus transport (which were also
adjusted) have a weight of a little less than 10 percent in the CPI, so the direct impact of the August increases is
around 1 percent. The wider impact on inflation will depend, in part, on the extent to which fuel price increases
feed into salary and wage demands.

The budget for FY 2005/06 would sharply reverse fiscal consolidation, despite
continuing wage restraint, but is unlikely to be implemented in full. As approved, the
budget would cause the overall fiscal balance to deteriorate to -12.3 percent of GDP. A neardoubling of capital expenditure explains much of the shift in the fiscal stance. However,
capital spending is likely to face implementation constraints.6 Furthermore, revenue
collection in the first quarter of the fiscal year, exceeded projections by 14 percent. The
budget reduces the maximum corporate tax rate by two percentage points to 30 percent, and
grants new tax concessions aimed at promoting agri-business cooperatives and tourism.
5

6

Excluding grants, the overall balance in FY 2004/05 strengthened by 1.3 percent of GDP.

Since 1990, public investment has tended to be in the range of 7−8 percent of GDP and has rarely exceeded
10 percent of GDP.

10

- 13 -

Current spending is to increase by 10 percent, mostly due to a sharp rise in unallocated (socalled “reserve”) expenditures and transfers. On the positive side, the share of government
wages and salaries in GDP is budgeted to remain constant after having declined since 2000.
14.
While public debt has continued to grow, St. Lucia has borrowed on favorable
terms in the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM).7 Public debt grew over
4 percentage points to almost 68 percent over the two years to March 2005. The budget for
FY 2005/06 would add a further 7 percentage points. At the same time, the RGSM has
allowed St. Lucia to replace foreign with E.C. dollar-denominated debt, with new issues at
declining spreads over U.S. treasury bills. As of March 2005, 28 percent of the outstanding
public debt stock was classified as domestic, compared with 25 percent a year earlier. To
finance budgeted expenditure in FY 2005/06, net new bond issues in the RGSM equivalent to
9 percent of GDP would be needed to supplement multilateral and grant financing.
15.
The current account deficit is projected to widen by 3 percentage points to
16 percent of GDP in 2005, financed largely by foreign direct investment. Following
sharp but broadly balanced growth in imports and tourism receipts in 2003 and 2004, the
current account balance is set to decline due to a surge in construction-related imports
(including of labor services). At the same time, net FDI is expected to grow by 57 percent to
US$93 million (11.4 percent of GDP) in 2005 and to accelerate further in 2006.
16.
Private remittances may be a significant source of finance that is underestimated
in the balance of payments.8 Based on net migration rates drawn from a range of sources,
including the World Bank WDI database, staff estimates the stock of St. Lucian emigrant
households at around 44,000, largely in the United States and United Kingdom. According to
a 2001 U.K. government survey, average annual remittances to the Caribbean amounted to
US$1,094 per household (U.S. estimates tend to be higher), yielding an annual remittance
flow for 2004 of US$48 million (6.3 percent of GDP), compared to the current ECCB
estimate of US$27 million.
17.
The E.C. dollar has depreciated in real terms vis-à-vis key tourism markets since
2003, but competitiveness is less strong by other measures. The weakening of the U.S.
dollar (to which the E.C. dollar is pegged) since 2003 has boosted tourism sales in the
European markets. At the same time, real wages have risen at an annualized rate of
1.7 percent since 1992, while productivity (measured for the export sectors of tourism,
agriculture, and manufacturing in Figure 2) has remained unchanged. Although subject to
cyclical variation, this implies an increase in unit labor costs and may partly explain an
increase in unemployment over the same period. In view of the common exchange rate peg in
the ECCU, price and wage pressures linked to the current construction boom may undermine
competitiveness and the emergence of a more diversified export structure.
7

In 2004, the government placed EC$157 million (7.6 percent of GDP) in six and ten-year bonds on the RGSM
at an average interest rate of 6.4 percent. The borrowing program exceeded the government’s financing needs in
FY 2004/05. About EC$72 million remain available for the current year.
8

Private remittances are likely to be captured, in part, as portfolio inflows in the balance of payments.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
The current strength of the economy provides an opportunity to tackle
St. Lucia’s growing debt and adopt structural measures to bolster long-term growth.
Staff noted that a sound fiscal policy was complementary to the objective of promoting
sustained growth, and that there was further room to improve the climate for domestic
investment and to strengthen the economy’s international integration.
19.
The authorities engaged in an open discussion with staff and, while there were
differences regarding the pace of reforms, there was broad agreement on their general
direction. The authorities agreed that debt needs to be brought down, but noted that capital

- 15 -

spending would increase ahead of the 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC). Tax concessions had,
in the authorities’ judgment, been effective at attracting foreign investment, and any reforms
would have to be based on a careful review. They were committed to deepening regional and
international integration—including more competitive labor markets—but highlighted the
fiscal dependency on trade taxes and argued that the local industry needed more time before
it could compete. Staff suggested that plans for the CWC were compatible with fiscal
consolidation since tax revenues were strong and there was scope to prioritize capital
spending, that tax concessions could be better targeted, and that trade reforms could be
embedded in a medium-term framework of regional and multilateral integration.
A. Fiscal Policy and Public Debt
20.
The authorities stated their intent to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio by
tightening fiscal policy over the medium term, but faced constraints in 2005 and 2006.
With assistance by SATAP,9 the authorities had developed a budget scenario that would trim
public and publicly guaranteed debt to below 60 percent of GDP by 2010. However, the
immediate priorities were to ensure the successful staging of the CWC in 2007, as well as to
remedy deteriorating infrastructure, tackle crime and strengthen education and hospital
services, which limited the scope for fiscal consolidation in the short run.
21.
Staff noted that delivering on the government’s priorities seemed compatible
with a stable debt ratio in the current fiscal year. Due to the strong GDP performance tax
returns were likely to exceed budget projections by about 2.5 percent of GDP in FY 2005/06.
Active expenditure management (see paragraphs 23−25) could further contribute to reducing
the government’s primary deficit from the budgeted 8.5 percent of GDP, to 1.5 percent,
leaving the fiscal stance broadly unchanged from FY 2004/05. Indeed, such an outcome was
not only desirable but likely in view of budget implementation constraints.
22.
Over the medium term, a rapid decline in debt could be achieved through a

GDP by 2010. This would require the central government to achieve a swing in its primary
balance of 4−5 percent of GDP, to between 3 and 4 percent of GDP by FY 2008/09−FY
2010/11. The adjustment would be balanced between expenditure and revenue measures. In
contrast, a passive scenario that assumes no change in the policy stance would cause debt to
rise rapidly, reaching 90 percent of GDP by FY 2010/11. The fiscal and debt paths under
different scenarios are set out in Box 4, and Annex I summarizes key fiscal
recommendations.
23.
The staff recommended that capital expenditures be limited to high-priority
projects. In FY 2005/06 and FY 2006/07, capital spending could be held to about 9 percent
of GDP, or EC$430 million cumulatively, through a tight focus on infrastructure linked to the
CWC and on grant-financed projects for education and health.10 Staff recommended that
post-CWC capital budgets should not exceed the historic execution rate of around 6 percent
of GDP, unless new sources of grant funding could be identified.
24.
In FY 2005/06, implementation constraints are likely to cause below-budget
capital spending, and the authorities agreed with staff that in the medium term, capital
spending would have to decline. Project execution had in fact been well below plan in the
first quarter of the fiscal year, and expectations were now for capital spending of a little over
EC$200 million in FY 2005/06 (compared with the budgeted EC$336 million). The
authorities acknowledged that an ex-ante selective approach could help ensure that budgetary
funds were well targeted in the face of competition for construction and other resources. The
government had opted for low-cost solutions in preparing the CWC (e.g., a temporary rather
than permanent stadium expansion), and was proceeding with longstanding plans to establish
a Project Monitoring Committee. Implementation of a medium-term capital budgeting
framework had been delayed by the scarcity of qualified personnel.

Apart from ticket sales and licenses, Cricket World Cup St. Lucia (CWCSL), a nonprofit agency responsible
for organizing the CWC, relies on government subsidies. The government has budgeted EC$78 million
(3.5 percent of GDP) to cover the immediate costs for organization and stadium extension, including an access
road. Discussions with CWCSL suggest that additional related infrastructure projects might total
EC$127 million (5.1 percent of GDP) and include water supply and road links for the key tourism areas and
addressing bottlenecks in the national road network. Certain upgrades of the two airports and harbor facilities
would be executed by the financially independent parastatal St. Lucia Air and Sea Port Authority (SLASPA).

- 17 -

price inflation in the ongoing (triennial) public sector salary round. At the same time, the
budget envisages additions to the public sector payroll, focused on security and education
services. In the staff’s view, this increased the urgency of proceeding with a planned civil
service review, and to extend its scope from a review of competencies and responsibilities to
exploring appropriate levels of public employment. Budgeted reserve (unallocated)
expenditures, which show a sudden rise by 1 percent of GDP over the previous year, should
be subject to tight disciplines and careful prioritization. Continued spending restraint was
also important in light of uncertainties over the planned introduction of universal health care
(UHC), whose costs had not yet been assessed.11
26.
Priorities on the revenue side should be to reform (a) oil pricing and taxation,
(b) the tax concessions regime, and (c) the structure of indirect taxation:
•

Fuel prices: The authorities adjusted fuel prices by EC$1 (12 percent) subsequent to
the mission, on August 24 (Box 3). Fuel pricing should seek, over time, to restore the
petroleum tax revenue of 2002, and price adjustments be made automatic and
formula-based.

•

Tax concessions: The mission argued the need for tighter disciplines on tax
concessions, which represented a cost to the budget equivalent to at least 23 percent
of tax revenue collected in 2004 (6 percent of GDP). The review of the Fiscal
Incentives Act, recently commissioned by the authorities, would be an opportunity to
discontinue discretionary concessions; shorten the duration of statutory concessions;
and examine less costly and more targeted ways of promoting investment (see
paragraph 29). Concessions should also be individually reviewed and recorded by the
Ministry of Finance.12

•

Indirect tax reform: Work has begun to design a value-added tax (VAT), which
would replace the existing multiple consumption taxes as recommended by the OECS
Tax Reform and Administration Commission (2002). A target date for its introduction
has not yet been announced. Even if revenue-neutral in itself, this reform would
increase the economic efficiency of taxation, and staff recommended aiming for a
single flat rate with no exceptions. Early action would need to be taken to develop
accounting frameworks for such a reform, in particular in the business community.

11

The government is considering to finance the UHC through indirect taxes. In the mission’s view, these should
be additional to the revenues proposed under the active fiscal scenario.

12

In response to the Prime Minister’s request for an analytical paper on tax concessions during the previous
Article IV consultations, staff presented IMF Country Report 05/305—2005 Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union—Selected Issues, Chapter V “Tax Concessions and Foreign Direct Investment in the ECCU” by J. Chai
and R. Goyal to the Prime Minister. For the ECCU as a whole, the paper concludes that tax concessions had
been expensive while their benefits in terms of attracting foreign investment had been marginal.

Box 4. St. Lucia’s Debt Dynamics
100

Projections prepared by staff show that a continuation
of current policies generates explosive debt dynamics,
even assuming the FY 2005/06 is not fully implemented.
This passive scenario is driven by the sharp increase in the
capital budget, related in part to the Cricket World Cup, that
remains above historical norms over the projection period.
The passive scenario caps capital expenditures at about
10 percent of GDP (as compared to a budgeted 15 percent)
to reflect likely capacity constraints on execution.
Nevertheless, the increase in public investment combined
with rising interest rates (associated with increasing global
interest rates projected in the IMF’s World Economic
Outlook) would rapidly increase the central government’s
borrowing requirements, pushing St. Lucia’s debt ratio
above 90 percent of GDP by FY 2010/11.

A policy stance that aims to contain the fiscal deficit, however, can quickly set debt dynamics on a
downward path. Using the same underlying growth and interest rate assumptions, the IMF’s active (baseline)
scenario aims for a reduction in St. Lucia’s debt ratio below 60 percent of GDP by 2010. This is based on a
slightly more ambitious fiscal strategy than that proposed by the Ministry of Finance centered on: (i) bringing
the capital budget before grants back to historical norms (6 percent of GDP); (ii) the introduction of VAT in
2007/08; (iii) a staged reduction in tax concessions; and (iv) containing the wage and salary bill.
While the staff’s active scenario is consistent with stable debt dynamics, it is nonetheless subject to a
number of downside risks. Staff conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to a series of shocks: (i) a
2 percent reduction in annual GDP growth relative to the baseline; (ii) an increase in the average interest rate on
new borrowing of 2 percentage points starting in 2005/06; (iii) a combination of the low growth and high
interest rate scenarios; and (iv) a sizable natural disaster in 2005/06 that causes a same-year 3.5 percentage point
decline in real GDP growth and a 8 percent of GDP increase in expenditure spread out over three years.
The sensitivity of the debt ratio varies considerably across scenarios. In the event of a natural disaster, the
debt ratio is expected to rise by over 10 percentage points to 76 percent of GDP in 2007/08 before reverting to a
downward path. In contrast, combined growth and interest rate shocks set debt dynamics on a permanently
higher path that exceeds staff’s active scenario by 13 percentage points by 2010/11. These sensitivities
underscore the importance of prudent debt and fiscal management to minimize debt-related vulnerabilities.

27.
Tax administration is being strengthened, though further steps could be taken to
improve collections. Though delayed, the authorities are moving closer towards
establishment of a unified Revenue Authority. Plans for implementing an automated customs
information system (ASYCUDA++) and the Single Taxpayer ID are on track and should
facilitate the shift towards risk-management and administrative simplifications in border
taxation. At the same time, there is a need for stronger resolve in ensuring collections on the
Hotel Occupancy Tax, since only about 60 percent of taxes due are currently collected. And
although the reassessment of the rental value of high-end properties has been largely
completed, incremental revenue from property taxation will remain limited due to tax
concessions.
B. Enhancing St. Lucia’s Growth Potential
28.
St. Lucia has successfully developed its tourism industry, but will face challenges
in sustaining and further enhancing economic growth. The recent and planned expansion
in stay-over capacity attests to the continued potential for tourism-based growth.
Nevertheless, staff recommended that St. Lucia tackle the underlying causes of the slowdown
in GDP growth since the early 1990s. Restoring higher levels of growth on a sustained basis
would require structural reforms aimed at broadening the economic base, and ensuring the
continued competitiveness of the tourism sector.
29.
Foreign investment is growing, but the cost of capital should be reduced to
stimulate domestic investment. Staff recommended reforming insolvency laws, which
raised lending costs by making it difficult to foreclose on delinquent borrowers. Together
with other members of the ECCU, the interest floor on savings accounts could be lowered or
eliminated (currently 3 percent) over time, since it drives up lending rates. Staff also noted
that fiscal consolidation would be expected to put downward pressure on commercial rates
by reducing the government’s borrowing requirement. Finally, tax incentives could be better
targeted at reducing capital at risk, at lower fiscal cost, through use of tax credits and
assistance with start-up training.13
30.
There was agreement on the need to promote labor market flexibility and to
ensure that an appropriate mix of skills was available to local businesses. Staff
considered that flexible labor markets were especially important to safeguard
competitiveness under the common currency arrangement with other ECCU members, and
encouraged further progress in integrating CSME labor markets in order to increase the
supply of labor and broaden the range of available skills—a constraint consistently
highlighted by business representatives.14 The authorities noted that inward labor mobility
13

Many existing tax concessions are not directly linked to investment spending, and hence the cost of capital,
and tax holidays are heavily discounted by start-ups that may be cash-flow negative in their early years.

In the same vein, a World Bank study (reference in footnote 3) recommends better targeting of educational
curricula at business needs, perhaps with input from the private sector.

within the CSME (currently limited to five categories of workers) should increase from 2006
when independent service providers, such as craftsmen, would gain establishment rights.
31.
Staff recommended reforms to the foreign trade regime with a view to raising
competitiveness and outward orientation. It argued that high levels of protection for local
manufacturing and farming drove up costs for downstream users and exporters, favored
inefficient production for the small domestic market, and had not succeeded in building
competitive industries (Box 5). Specifically, staff recommended replacing restrictive licenses
with tariffs, reducing the import service charge, which also applies to intra-CSME trade,
from 5 to below 2 percent, consistent with international standards, and sharply reducing peak
tariffs, possibly in a multilateral context, in order to mitigate CARICOM trade diversion and
the inward bias of the trade regime.
32.
The authorities were committed to regional and global trade integration, but
emphasized the need to address adjustment costs. Tariffication of licenses was under
consideration. Stepwise liberalization under the CSME would proceed, but there was concern
that the local industry was not yet fully prepared for competition, and was facing structural
disadvantages such as costly utilities. Deeper regional integration required the establishment
of a development fund to support the weaker CARICOM members. Liberalization of extraregional trade was also constrained by fiscal revenue considerations. Staff argued that
integration itself would lower costs (for example, of inputs), reduce the need for tax
concessions and broaden the range of supplies. At the regional level, it would allow for
economies of scale in the provision of collective government and business services. A
credible medium-term framework of liberalization would provide time and incentives for
industry to adjust, and the fiscal dependence on tariff revenues could be reduced through the
planned tax reforms.
33.
In light of the expected erosion of EU banana preferences, the mission
recommended diversifying production and mitigating the social impact. EU prices have
strengthened since 2000, but the impending resolution of a WTO dispute brought by Latin
American producers is likely to

Box 5. Import protection
Import barriers protect St. Lucia’s domestic production from foreign competition. The simple average
import tariff, at 8.9 percent excluding the unusually high service charge of 5 percent, is below the developing
country median (12.3 percent). But the average hides significant tariff protection for the relatively small range
of goods that are produced locally. Nonautomatic licensing adds further to protection, although its impact is
hard to quantify. This box provides staff’s estimates of protection for 24 firms accounting for 82 percent of the
value of manufacturing output for which detailed accounts were available. Protection is likely to be at least as
high for nonexport agriculture (the average agricultural tariff is 21.5 percent and that for manufacturing imports
6.9 percent).

Manufacturing Firms

Staff calculations suggest a median effective
rate of protection (ERP) in manufacturing of
over 50 percent. The figure shows the
distribution of the ERP for the sample. The ERP
afforded to a firm is the percentage increase in
firm value added due to the net effect of tariffs
on competing imports and the tariffs it pays on
its inputs. Tariffs on import competing goods in
the sample averaged 19 percent. At the same
time, import duty paid was just 8 percent of the
estimated value of these firms’ imported inputs
(partly as a result of tax concessions). The
relatively low domestic value added typical of
small economies, which import most primary,
intermediate and capital goods, further raises the
ERP.

CARICOM agreement provides for special

import licenses, which are applicable to all imports, including those from CARICOM countries. A further 12
items are protected through licensing under CARICOM provisions for industrial development in less developed
country members. Approval of licenses typically requires demonstrating that similar products cannot be
purchased locally. As licenses cover 80 percent of the output of the mission’s sample of manufacturing firms,
the ERP estimates almost certainly understate actual protection.

Available assistance could be most effectively applied to easing the transition by providing
retraining or supporting business start-ups through investment tax credits or grants, and by
building appropriate social safety nets for older workers.

financing were an added reason to reduce outstanding debt over time.
36.
St. Lucia has a well-designed disaster mitigation and preparedness program,
though further steps can be taken to ensure the program’s effectiveness. There is strong
commitment to addressing vulnerabilities to natural shocks. The National Emergency
Management Organization (NEMO), chaired by the Prime Minister, has developed full-scale
disaster simulation exercises and tested its coordination function in the context of Hurricane
Ivan. The authorities have also taken action to fill a longstanding void on building code
standards. Against this backdrop, staff noted the importance of stepping up inspection
activities to ensure enforcement of these new standards and highlighted a role for a coherent
retrofitting scheme to bolster the resistance of existing structures. The mission also suggested
that disaster risk to public assets could be further mitigated by taking better advantage of risk
transfer mechanisms available in local insurance markets,15 and by participating in the
ongoing World Bank initiative to develop a regional catastrophe insurance pool.

15

Indeed, catastrophe cover for property is available in the domestic insurance sector, but government buildings
and offices are for the most part left uninsured.

The mission recommended continued monitoring of vulnerabilities in the
financial sector. Vulnerability indicators showed a modest weakening in the overall health
of the banking sector since December 2004. The ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets had
declined slightly, while nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios remained stubbornly high and well
above the ECCU average, especially for domestically licensed banks. Mild improvements in

laws aimed at easing foreclosure would assist efforts to reduce NPLs.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
St. Lucia faces the challenges to enhance long-term growth potential and reduce
unemployment, and to reverse the rapid rise in public debt. There is a need to facilitate
structural change in the economy, as the expansion of the tourism sector was insufficient to
compensate for the decline in banana production and manufacturing since the early 1990s. At
68 percent of GDP, public debt, which built up as the authorities attempted to stimulate
growth, is now creating significant vulnerabilities. This coincided with a sharp reduction in
concessional financing.
39.
The recent pick-up in economic activity provides an opportunity to address these
challenges. GDP growth is accelerating, based on tourism and related activities and
investments, and is expected to exceed 5 percent in 2005 and 2006. This should ease both the
shift in the fiscal balance required to begin reducing debt, and the adoption of measures to
strengthen competition and flexibility in labor and goods markets. At the same time,
bottlenecks in construction are increasing the risk of inflation, and while the real effective
exchange rate (REER) has depreciated over recent years, labor market measures of
competitiveness give rise to concerns.
40.
The government has made commendable progress since 2003 in reducing fiscal
imbalances, but the still fragile debt situation makes it important to build on this
achievement. While there has been moderation in current spending, much of the
improvement has been cyclical. And the budget for the current fiscal year, if implemented,
would sharply set back fiscal consolidation. Without resolute action, the public debt could
increase to more than 90 percent of GDP by FY 2010/11. The authorities should actively
manage the capital budget and prioritize spending to prevent further growth in the primary
deficit, and target a shift towards a primary surplus in the range of 3−4 percent of GDP by
FY 2008/09. Still, even with the resulting reduction in the debt ratio below 60 percent in
FY 2010/11, the public finances would remain highly vulnerable to shocks, and the
authorities should aim to continue lowering debt over the medium term.
41.
The recommended fiscal path is compatible with the government’s key shortterm priorities. Staff recognizes the importance of the forthcoming Cricket World Cup
(CWC), as well as other pressing social objectives and infrastructure needs. But many
planned investments do not appear to be linked to these priorities and should be culled or
postponed. Competition for construction resources also calls for an ex ante more selective
approach to capital spending within a medium-term budget framework, rather than risking
unexpected implementation delays in priority areas.
42.
Fiscal consolidation over the medium term is best achieved through a
combination of revenue and expenditure measures. Capital budgets should be scaled back
to their historical levels, while the planned civil service review should aim to underpin
sustained moderation in spending and employment. The yield of the petroleum tax should be
restored through further adjustments in fuel prices and eventual conversion into an excise tax.
The system of tax concessions is extremely expensive, and should be subject to tight

- 25 -

disciplines; broader changes would require a regional approach given competition at the
margin for foreign investment. Implementation of a modern system of VAT and excises will
improve the efficiency of taxation and would create space for trade reforms.
43.
St. Lucia could take further measures to promote domestic investment and labor
market flexibility. Domestic investment outside of tourism has been weak, hampering
structural change. The cost of capital is high, which suggests a need to ease foreclosure laws,
to review the ECCU savings rate floor, and to better target investment incentives at the
capital at risk (e.g., through tax credits and training assistance). There is evidence of labor
market rigidities, and labor mobility under the CSME would offer obvious benefits by
broadening the available skills mix and offering new opportunities for the unemployed.
44.
The economy’s growth potential would benefit from a stronger outward
orientation. Given its small size, St. Lucia relies on foreign demand for growth. But the
foreign trade regime has a surprisingly strong inward bias. St. Lucia should take steps—on its
own and with CARICOM partners—to lower peak tariffs and eliminate restrictive licenses
which draw scarce resources into noncompetitive activities, drive up costs of tourism
services and impede export diversification.
45.
The banana sector will decline further, and assistance programs should aim to
ease the movement of workers into other sectors while cushioning the social impact.
Given the social implications of the decline, its external trigger and the likely impact on the
government budget, there is a strong case for external assistance to manage adjustment.
46.
Prudential indicators point to some progress in strengthening the banking sector
since the last Article IV consultations. Nevertheless, the stock of nonperforming loans
remains stubbornly high—partly reflecting legal impediments to foreclosure—and after an
earlier decline, balance sheet exposure to the public sector is rising again. These indicators
should be closely monitored, especially in view of an eventual tightening of liquidity
conditions in financial markets.
47.
St. Lucia has a well-designed disaster prevention and mitigation framework. The
program has benefited from strong political leadership. There is nevertheless scope to iron
out remaining implementation and enforcement issues in line ministries, and to take better
advantage of insurance mechanisms to reduce public asset exposure.
48.
The quality of economic data in St. Lucia, though high relative to other ECCU
countries, offers scope for improvements. The implementation of the Core Welfare
Indicators survey was a major achievement. But the national accounts, as well as consumer
price and wage data, remain subject to frequent revisions and are partly based on outdated
samples and weights. There is insufficient information on private remittances, which are
potentially large, and consideration should be given to establishing a regular survey of
financial institutions.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX I

Fiscal Policy Recommendations
This annex box summarizes specific measures recommended by the mission to strengthen the fiscal
balance and reduce public debt over time. Several of these measures have been under consideration
by the authorities or are under implementation already.
Expenditure measures
•

Capital expenditures should be capped at a cumulative total of EC$430 million in FY 2005/06
and FY 2006/07, which involves pushing ahead with CWC expenditure but postponing
nonpriority capital expenditure. In the medium term, capital expenditure should revert to
historical norms (6 percent of GDP) under a rolling Public Sector Investment Program.

•

Minimize spending authorizations in FY 2005/06 under the “reserve” and discretionary
expenditure accounts.

•

Re-dynamize the civil service review, including reviewing staffing levels and adapting the skills
profile. More generally, the authorities should continue to exert discipline to limit wage and
salary increases to the rate of inflation.

Revenue measures
•

Continue adjusting pump prices of fuel to reflect oil price developments and restore the 2002
yield of the petroleum tax, while cushioning the impact on poor households, for example, by
limiting pass-through for LPG. Over time, convert the petroleum tax into an excise at a specific
rate, and ensure automatic petroleum price adjustments to reflect market developments.

•

Strengthen the yield of existing taxes by limiting and better targeting concessions (e.g. property,
import, and corporate tax concessions). Corporate tax rates could be reduced in line with the
streamlining of the concession regime.

•

Replace the existing consumption tax with a new broad-based transactions tax and selected
excise taxes. Consider folding part of the import service charge into the new transactions tax.

•

Proceed with administrative reforms, including establishing the Revenue Authority, and
introducing ASYCUDA++, the Single Taxpayer ID and risk-based customs management.
Strengthen collection efforts, especially for the Hotel Occupancy Tax.

Prioritization and monitoring
•

Tighten coordination of capital and other expenditure in the run-up to the CWC in order to
ensure limited construction and project management capacity is focused on priorities.

•

Implement medium-term budget framework.

•

Evaluate the cost of Universal Health Care and design financing mechanisms that ensure budget
neutrality and are economically efficient (such as a broad-based transactions tax).

ANNEX II

The Banana Sector in St. Lucia
The banana industry, once a major growth driver, has shrunk as a proportion of the St. Lucian
economy. For the four years through 2004, the share of real value added by the industry was a little
over 2 percent, which compares to an average of around 6 percent for the previous decade and the
peak of just over 12 percent recorded in 1988.
Despite its diminishing contribution to the overall economy, the industry remains important for
three reasons. First, it remains a major employer in the economy, particularly for older workers
without social protection. Second, its multiplier effects have typically been high; for example, in
terms of indirect employment. Third, bananas have been a significant source of export earnings and
have provided diversification relative to the increasingly dominant tourism sector.
High production costs are one factor explaining the demise of the banana industry. St. Lucia, in
common with other Windward Islands, has production costs slightly higher than in Africa, but a
number of surveys estimate that the cost is three times higher than in Latin America. Productivity in
the agriculture sector, of which bananas have accounted for 50 percent of production over the last
decade, has nearly halved since the early 1990s (text figure paragraph 33). The challenges faced by
St. Lucia and other Caribbean producers are not easily overcome. Even an aggressively restructured
industry would face difficult geographic obstacles to achieving the cost base of Latin American
competitors (Table 1).

structure on third-party countries (non-EU

steadily reduced and will qualify for duty-free entry by the start of 2006. The EU offered a MFN tariff
level of €187 per ton in September, 2005 but this was successfully challenged by non-ACP exporters
to the EU. A new proposal had not been agreed by mid-November, 2005. Table 2 shows the estimated
effect of different tariff levels on ECCU banana production. This analysis was conducted on the
assumption that production levels are a smooth declining function of the tariff level. However, the
large fixed costs of transportation and marketing suggest that production may not be viable even at
tariffs above the €150 per ton that would suggest nonviability on the basis of this study.

The erosion of EU preferences has already had a clear negative effect on market share. The
U.K. has been the traditional market for Caribbean producers and yet the volume of fruit sent to the

- 29 -

ANNEX II

U.K. from the Windward Islands in 1992 and 2003 was 275,541 tons and 67,317 tons respectively,
implying a decline in market share from about 45 percent to 15 percent.16
The decline of the banana industry has major implications for employment and, potentially,
social cohesion. In the 1990s (the most recent rigorous estimates available), around 20,000 people
were directly employed in the industry. Indirectly, around 60,000 people, or nearly one-third of the
population, were dependent on the industry for employment and income.17 In recent years this is
likely to have fallen, but agriculture (largely bananas), excluding indirect employment, still accounted
for just under 10,000 jobs and 15 percent of the workforce at the end of 2004.
Banana workers are typically older than workers in other industries and often lack insurance
and pension coverage. The St. Lucia Census of Agriculture in 1996 indicated that the average age of
small holding farmers was rising and that the average age was nearly fifty.18 Agricultural holdings
have also been decreasing in size, leaving farmers increasingly reliant on small, unproductive parcels
of land. The average size of a holding was 6.9 acres in 1961, 5.4 in 1986 and just 4.4 acres in 1996.
The decline of the banana industry also increases reliance on the dominant tourism sector for
export earnings. Although their share of exports has declined over a long period, excluding tourism,
bananas are still estimated to be worth 20 percent of the value of merchandise exports. Bananas have
also provided some diversification from tourism. Since 1990, excluding the effect of September 11,
2001, the correlation of the value of banana exports and tourism receipts is -0.3. Years in which
tourism receipts have declined saw an average increase in banana export values of 15 percent.
Policy options
St. Lucia, along with other Caribbean countries, has received compensatory aid from the EU
(in particular, the SFA and STABEX) to meet export losses in the banana sector. Since 1994,
St. Lucia received €153m from both schemes. STABEX is now discontinued, but substantial unspent
sums remain to be disbursed. Disbursements have been unpredictable and irregular, impeding their
effectiveness. A new instrument (FLEX) has been introduced and is intended to be used for general
budget support
Government policy is increasingly focused on managing the decline, with a reduced emphasis
on direct industry support. The government’s compensatory fund allocation procedure now has
three objectives: (i) agricultural diversification and banana commercialization; (ii) general economic
diversification; and (iii) social recovery. In the past, the return from funds used to directly support the
industry has been low. Although new projects, such as the subsidization of more productive tissue
culture, continue to evolve, it is unlikely that St. Lucian producers can regain any competitive
advantage over Latin American producers.

This implies that scarce public resources may be best directed towards easing the transition
away from bananas, particularly of banana workers. Examples include the provision of retraining
grants, or in the case of those seeking self-employment, subsidizing the cost of start-up businesses
through the provision of investment tax credits or grants.
Options that involve a focus on agriculture may offer limited payoffs. One option for the industry
is to target a market niche. Currently, 17 percent of Windward Island bananas are sold to the “Fair
Trade” market,19 for which farmers receive higher prices. The size of this market in the EU may be
limited, and it is unlikely to restore industry growth. A shift to alternative crops will still leave
farmers at a competitive disadvantage, given St. Lucia’s geographic endowments (see Table 1).

ANNEX III

St. Lucia: Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) Survey
At end-2004, the Department of Statistics of St. Lucia surveyed over 1,300 households, using
the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey methodology, and issued a
summary report that contains indicators of households’ living standards and access to social
services. The CWIQ is aimed at rapidly establishing a reliable set of basic social indicators
and to regularly monitor welfare and social developments for various segments of the
population. The St. Lucia CWIQ survey is the first of its kind in the Caribbean; it is available
on the St. Lucia Department of Statistics’ website: www.stats.gov.lc. (Some results are
included in the Social and Demographic Indicators section of Table 1).
The indicators on access to social services are generally quite strong: (i) adult literacy is
89 percent, as a result of high primary and secondary school enrollment, 93 and 79 percent,
respectively; (ii) 80 percent of patients are satisfied with ready access to medical services, of
which 95 percent are delivered by professionals; and (iii) 92 percent of the population has
access to safe water and the same percentage uses nonwood fuel for cooking.
The household structure in St. Lucia is marked by loose partner relationships: (i) only a
quarter of household heads are legally married and 30 percent live in common-law unions
and visiting partnerships; (ii) a high proportion of children, about 62 percent, are living
without their parents; and (iii) the dependency ratio is low in both rural and urban areas, but
significantly higher among the poorest.
The main social problems are unemployment and rising crime: 19 percent of the
population is unemployed and an additional 8 percent is underemployed. Unemployment is
particularly high among females (25 percent) and the youth (39 percent). Crime appears to be
increasing, with 6 percent of the surveyed reporting that they have been the victim of a crime,
compared with 4 percent in 2001.

Note: The medium-term projections for real GDP growth are the same for both passive and active scenarios. Strong economic activity is favoring,
in the short-term, a fiscal outcome along the lines of the active scenario. The principal assumption underlying the active scenario is that fiscal
balances are higher. This would likely have an ambiguous effect on GDP growth over the medium term by: (i) reducing aggregate demand,
which is negative for growth; and (ii) crowding in the private sector, which is positive for growth. In the absence of a full economy model in
which these effects may be assessed, there was insufficient information to deviate from the passive projection.
There is a pronounced decline and recovery in real GDP growth in the 2007–10 period. The current account deficit is also projected to narrow
sharply before widening again in 2008. These projections reflect the large but temporary surge in economic activity, fuelled by public and
foreign direct investment in 2005–07, related to the Cricket World Cup in 2007.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks

1/ The public sector is defined as the Central Government. Public debt therefore excludes gross debt not guaranteed by the Central Government, which amounted to US$20.7 million in 2004FY.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 9/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

B. Bound Tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2006–10 7/
A2. No policy change (constant primary balance) in 2006–10

A. Alternative Scenarios

APPENDIX II

St. Lucia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of November 3, 2005)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY 2006−09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (i) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (ii) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened
creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities will focus on leveraging available
donor grant financing. Following the recommendations of the recently completed growth and
competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA support would focus on providing
technical and financial assistance for interventions to support these two pillars.
An indicative Base Case lending scenario consists of about US$51.3 million in IDA
resources for the four OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines). This amount includes the estimated IDA country allocations for each of
the four countries during FY 2006−09, and an IDA regional allocation of US$15.2 million
for two regional projects: US$12 million for Catastrophe Risk Insurance and US$3.2 million
for Infrastructure and Utilities Reform. Planned lending to St. Lucia amounts to
US$16.7 million under the Base Case lending scenario and consists of two investment
projects: Public Sector Modernization Infrastructure and Utilities Reform, and a Social
Protection Program.
I.

PROJECTS

There are six active World Bank projects in St. Lucia for a net commitment of approximately
US$43 million.
The St. Lucia Water Sector Reform Technical Assistance was approved in December
2001 for US$2.6million. It supports the Government of St. Lucia’s goal of improving the
water and sewerage service provision through private sector participation (PSP) in the
operation of WASCO, the water supply and sewerage utility. The project finances the
development of a regulatory framework, the preparatory work for PSP transaction as well a
dissemination and consensus building campaigns.
The World Bank on March 8, 2002, approved US$20.9 million in loans and credits to support
Emergency Recovery Projects in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The projects support efforts aimed at fostering recovery from
the fallout of the events of September 11, 2001. The projects support: (i) efforts to safeguard
the productive capacity of the tourism sector by securing energy imports; (ii) investments to
enhance security at airports and ports; and (iii) the development of institutional capacity to
develop security programs as mandated by international civil aviation and maritime transport
agencies. The Bank’s support to St. Lucia under this project is for US$6.3 million.

APPENDIX II

The OECS Education Reform Project is a follow-up to the Basic Education Project. It was
approved in June 2002 for US$12.0 million, and was signed in September 2002. It is
expected to become effective by the end of 2005. This is one of several subprojects included
in a regional horizontal APL. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital in
the OECS which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of their economy and more
sustainable growth. This objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to
secondary education; (ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with
more direct interventions at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and
(iii) strengthening management of the sector and governance of schools.
The St. Lucia Disaster Management Project II was approved in June 2004 for
US$7.5 million. The project aims at further reducing the country's vulnerability to adverse
natural events (hurricane, floods, etc.) through investment in risk management activities. The
project has the following four components: (i) Physical Prevention and Mitigation Work
Component; (ii) Strengthening Emergency Preparedness and Response; (iii) Institutional
Strengthening; and (iv) Project Management.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project approved in July 2004 for US$6.4 million
will support the national program, which aims to prevent and control the spread of the
epidemic, and to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the disease on the population. The
project will use a two-pronged strategy: targeting interventions at high risk groups, and
implementing nontargeted activities for the general population. The first component—
Community and Civil Society Initiatives—will finance HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
support activities of Civil Society Organizations, women's organizations, professional
organizations, trade unions, and private sector organizations. The second component will
support the response to HIV/AIDS by nonhealth sector line ministries, namely basic crosscutting HIV/AIDS activities which all ministries are expected to implement under their
respective sectoral HIV/AIDS programs. The third component will strengthen the Ministry of
Health’s capacity in providing technical guidance for the national response to HIV/AIDS;
specifically, it will strengthen HIV/AIDS related services for prevention, treatment, and care
delivered through the health care system. Finally, the fourth component will help build the
institutional capacity for scaling up responsiveness, by financing technical advisory services,
training, staffing, equipment, goods, and general operating costs.
The Telecommunications and ICT Development Project approved in May 2005 for
US$543,000 aims at improving access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT
services to achieve socio-economic development in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS). The project has four components: (i) strengthening the national and regional
regulatory frameworks and promoting additional competition in the telecommunications
sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean
Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory
Commissions (NTRCs) by providing assistances to revise the regional and national sector
legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime; (ii) reviewing current universal
access policy, creating related guidelines, and providing financial support to establish a
Universal Service Fund (USF); (iii) improving growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled

services through utilization of broadband infrastructure; and (iv) ensuring management and
administration of the overall project.
The St. Lucia Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project, approved in May 2005
for US$7.7 million will support a short term investment program to carry out critical works
required to achieve the following objectives: (i) alleviate the water shortage in the North of
the country. The infrastructure works proposed will allow the utility to supply the entire
North of the island with a more efficient, continuous and reliable service; and (ii) implement
urgent investments that will result in additional revenues, reduce the likelihood of
commercial users (important sources of cross-subsidy for poor consumers) abandoning the
system, and improve the potential of a successful partnership between the government and
the private sector.
II.

ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK

The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to (i) public sector capacity in
the OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review, (ii) the OECS
Procurement Assessment Review, and (iii) the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment.
In conjunction with the Fund, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was
completed in early 2004. The Bank also recently completed an OECS study on Growth and
Competitiveness. Work is ongoing on a review of large scale energy options for the OECS,
under the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program. A fiscal issues report, which
includes a review of public expenditures in St. Lucia, has also been completed.
St. Lucia will benefit from ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities to support
the new CAS’ two main pillars, including the following activities: Caribbean Air Transport
Rationalization report, Caribbean Skills and Curriculum Study, Caribbean Recent Economic
Developments in Infrastructure study, Caribbean Financial Sector and Regulation report,
Caribbean Social projection strategy review, and a regional study on Crime, Violence and
Exclusion.

APPENDIX III

St. Lucia: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of October 31, 2005)
CDB’s operations in St. Lucia have been designed to support the economic and social
development efforts of the government by financing priority capital projects, providing
technical assistance and engaging in policy dialogue on key development issues. Guided
by its mandate and the development objectives of the government, the CDB has
collaborated with St. Lucia in such areas as: (i) the formulation and implementation of
macroeconomic, social, and sectoral policies geared towards providing a framework for
growth; (ii) infrastructure development to facilitate private sector investment; (iii) human
resource development to facilitate economic growth and diversification and the reduction of
poverty; (iv) direct and indirect lending to agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing;
(v) environmental protection to promote sustainable development; and (vi) poverty reduction.
St. Lucia is the second largest user of CDB resources, accounting for US$242.4 million
(9.8 percent) of net cumulative loans, contingent loans, equity, and grants approved from
1970 to 2004. Of this amount, US$115.6 million were provided from the Ordinary Capital
Resources while the remainder was from “soft” resources. New loans and grant approved in
2004 amounted to US$5.5 million, however net loans, contingent loans, equity and grants
approved during 2004 reflected a negative position of US$94,000 due to cancellations of
previous loans and grants. At the end of December 2004 St. Lucia had a total outstanding
loan balance of US$125.0 million compared to US$102.2 million at the end of 2003. An
additional loan of US$22.6mn to finance additional project costs encountered in the Road
Development program was approved during 2005. Disbursement of loans, contingent loans,
equity and grants during 2004 reached US$28.5 million, while that disbursed during 2003
amounted to US$20.6 million. Disbursement during January to October 2005 amounted to
US$16.9 million.

APPENDIX IV

St. Lucia: Statistical Issues
St. Lucia’s statistical database compares well with those of its ECCU peers, but its accuracy
and timeliness should be further improved in order to meet the authorities’ needs and achieve
adequate standards for Fund surveillance. Persistent weaknesses in coverage, frequency,
quality, and timeliness continue to hamper effective economic analysis and policy
formulation, in particular regarding the national accounts, the public sector outside central
government, and the balance of payments. Also, comprehensive and regular labor statistics
are not available. The Ministry of Finance publishes bi-annually an economic and social
review, which includes statistics covering developments in many macroeconomic sectors.
The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) publishes a quarterly economic and financial
review and an annual balance of payments for each member country.
St. Lucia is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its metadata,
which include detailed plans for statistical development in the main macroeconomic areas
over the short and medium term, have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org) since September 21, 2000.
Real sector
The authorities are developing a new methodology for the computation of the GDP, aimed
mainly at obtaining better sectoral estimates, but the process is being delayed by data
collection problems. Attempts are being made to compile quarterly GDP estimates with
funding from the Organization of American States (OAS). Given the increasing importance
of tourism activities, a new comprehensive survey of the sector seems necessary to establish
key data, such as average length of stay in different types of accommodations and average
daily expenditure by type of tourist arrival. This information should then be cross-checked
with other related activities, i.e., restaurants and transportation, to ensure consistency. A
recent mission from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) helped
the authorities develop export and import price indices and undertook initial work on
measuring price developments in the tourism sector. A survey to establish the consumer
basket for a new CPI has been much delayed, and work should be accelerated to quickly
replace the 1984 index. Another area in need of improvement is reporting on labor statistics,
in particular, private and public employment and wages.
Public sector finance
Reporting of central government data has improved substantially over the last few years, but
deficiencies remain in the rest of the public sector. The authorities are reporting monthly data
on the central government’s current revenue and expenditure, using a Fund-compatible
economic classification, with lags of a couple of months. However, frequent and substantial
revisions of figures reported suggest that further improvements to the process are needed.
With regard to the rest of the public sector, the periodicity and timeliness of data reporting
should be improved; annual financial statements and projections are currently obtained
directly from the entities during Fund missions and partially consolidated public sector

- 54 -

APPENDIX IV

accounts are compiled by the Fund staff. Data on domestic debt of the public sector are not
available on a regular basis. No fiscal data are reported to STA for publication in the GFS
Yearbook or in IFS.
Money and banking
The ECCB compiles monetary data on a monthly basis with a lag of about six weeks. The
information is reliable and is reported on a regular basis.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis. Although recent
data provide a more detailed breakdown of goods than in the past, in other areas they do not
provide sufficient detail to enable publication of the full detailed classification used in the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data for 2002 and revised data for
earlier years are published in the IFS. In general, enhanced data sources and better
compilation procedures are needed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of balance of
payments statistics. Efforts should also be made to compile quarterly balance of payments
statistics.
External debt
The Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive database for public and publicly guaranteed
external loans that provides detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of disbursements
and debt service. Information on bonds placed abroad is compiled annually and monthly data
are provided only at the staff's request. Recently, the quality of information on these bonds
has weakened as the desegregation between resident and nonresident holders was
discontinued. It would be useful to restore this level of detail.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 9, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with St. Lucia
On December 21, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with St. Lucia.1
Background
St. Lucia’s economy is dominated by tourism, which accounts for almost three-quarters
of the island’s exports. Though less exposed to hurricanes than other Caribbean
islands, St. Lucia remains vulnerable to natural and other exogenous shocks.
Since 1990, the production of banana and other export products has been declining.
Banana exports have suffered from rising costs and the gradual erosion of preference
margins in the EU market. A restrictive trade regime, high cost of capital, and labor
market rigidities appear to have delayed structural change.
Economic activity in St. Lucia has been slowing since the 1980s, but it has picked up
since 2003, driven by tourism and related investments. Real GDP growth was 4 percent
in 2004 and is expected to exceed 5 percent in 2005 and 2006. The rebound in tourism
since 2003 was facilitated by a favorable global environment, and investment in tourist
resorts and infrastructure is fueling demand for construction ahead of the 2007 Cricket
World Cup. Plans exist to increase the stock of hotel rooms by about 30 percent,
or 1,100 new units. At the same time, inflation, which had been subdued under the
ECCU currency board arrangement, has recently pointed upwards, reaching 4.4 percent
in the 12 months to November, 2005. The partial pass-through, in August 2005,
of higher oil prices to controlled fuel and transport prices may further add to price
pressures.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

Central government fiscal policy has tightened markedly since 2003 and deficits have
narrowed. The 2005/06 budget would sharply set back fiscal consolidation but full
implementation of the high levels of budgeted capital expenditure appears unlikely due
to capacity constraints. The overall fiscal deficit for FY 2004/05 narrowed to 4 percent of
GDP, and the primary deficit to 1 percent of GDP, compared to a primary deficit of
5.1 percent of GDP in FY 2002/03. The improvement reflected public sector wage
restraint, reduced capital spending and cyclical factors boosting tax revenue as the
economy recovered.
The rapid rise in public debt in recent years has slowed with total public debt reaching
almost 68 percent of GDP by end-FY 2004/05. But while this is lower than the debt
ratios of other ECCU countries, it remains high by international standards, thus exposing
St. Lucia to financial risks. As regards the banking sector, the stock of nonperforming
loans in commercial banks’ balance sheets remains high and well above the ECCU
average.
Real depreciation of the E.C. dollar against major currencies has strengthened the
external competitiveness of the tourism sector as measured by a competitor-based real
effective exchange rate. Other measures indicate that rising real wages, stagnant
productivity, and recent price pressures may undermine competitiveness and the
emergence of a more diversified export structure.
Regarding the external balance, increasing tourism receipts have not fully compensated
for declining agricultural and manufacturing exports over recent years. Imports are being
boosted by strong consumer demand and investment activities related to the Cricket
World Cup. The current account deficit is set to widen through 2006, but should begin to
narrow thereafter as investment demand eases. This deficit is expected to be largely
financed by foreign direct investment related to the tourism sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the recent strong growth performance of St. Lucia’s economy,
with a recovery in tourist arrivals and strong investment in tourism infrastructure more
than offsetting the continued decline in banana exports. Directors commended the
authorities for their record of prudent public debt management—the best within the
ECCU—and for the progress made in fiscal consolidation over the past two years. At the
same time, Directors cautioned that more recently, public debt had risen sharply,
and they urged the authorities to take advantage of the robust growth to follow through
with plans to reduce the debt over the medium term. They considered that the
authorities are well placed to avail of the economy’s present strength to address the
economy’s structural and fiscal challenges, so as to lay the groundwork for continued
sustainable high growth in the long term and a reduction in unemployment.
Directors underscored the importance of continued progress toward fiscal consolidation.
The FY 2005/06 budget, which calls for a large increase in capital spending, would set
back progress in this regard. Directors considered that much of the fiscal improvement
in recent years has reflected cyclical factors, and a combination of revenue and
expenditure measures is still needed to strengthen the underlying fiscal position.

-3-

These include rebuilding petroleum tax revenues and converting the petroleum tax into
an excise tax, limiting the growth of the civil service wage bill, and eventually introducing
a modern system of VAT and excise taxation. Directors emphasized in particular the
need for greater discipline over tax concessions, and called for a regional approach to
phasing out such concessions that curtails destructive competition for investments.
The need for careful management and prioritization of capital expenditures was also
noted, which would help to lessen the emerging strains on capacity stemming from the
construction boom and to contain inflationary pressures.
Directors noted that the banana sector is likely to continue to contract owing to
competitive pressures and the coming erosion of its trade preferences in export markets.
Efforts to ameliorate the social impact of the sector’s decline should include labor
retraining, support for business start-ups, and the creation of an appropriate safety net
for older workers.
Directors considered that, to boost St. Lucia’s growth potential, the investment climate
should be strengthened, competitiveness enhanced, and the outward orientation of the
economy further increased. They encouraged efforts to lower the cost of capital by
easing foreclosure laws, reviewing the ECCU savings rate floor, and better targeting
investment incentives. Directors noted that the real effective exchange rate has
depreciated in recent years. Nevertheless, given the ECCU exchange rate arrangement,
St. Lucia’s competitiveness needs to be supported by increased labor market flexibility
and measures to improve skills and opportunities for the unemployed. Directors also
recommended lowering peak tariff rates and eliminating restrictive licenses that draw
resources into noncompetitive activities, drive up the cost of tourism services, and
impede diversification.
Directors welcomed the progress that has been made in strengthening the banking
sector. However, nonperforming loans remain high and balance sheet exposure to the
public sector is rising, warranting close monitoring, especially if liquidity conditions in
financial markets tighten.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the timeliness and accuracy
of data for economic analysis and policy-making, especially with regard to the national
accounts, and consumer prices and wages. They also recommended strengthening
information on private remittances by introducing a regular survey of financial
institutions.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
St. Lucia may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
