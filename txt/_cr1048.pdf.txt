Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Uruguay
Approved by Rodrigo Valdés and Dhaneshwar Ghura
October 21, 2009
 Mission. A staff team comprising Mr. Gelos (head), Ms. Babihuga, and Mr. Sosa (all WHD);
Mr. Zanna (SPR); and Mr. Wezel (MCM), conducted the 2009 Article IV consultation
discussions during September 3–17, 2009. Staff met with Central Bank President Bergara,
Minister of Finance García, Minister of Energy and Industry Sendic, other key senior officials,
and representatives of the IDB, the World Bank, and the private sector. Mr. Vogel (OED) also
participated in various meetings and Mr. Valdés (WHD) joined the mission for the concluding
meetings.
 Previous consultations. The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive
Board on October, 24, 2008. At that time, Directors noted that prudent macroeconomic
policies, aided by favorable external conditions until mid-2008, had enabled Uruguay to
maintain vigorous export and economic growth, lower unemployment, and significantly
reduce vulnerability to shocks. However, they noted that the Uruguayan economy remained
vulnerable. Most Directors considered that fiscal policy had been expansionary, with the
primary balance deteriorating since 2006. They stressed that, with the gross public debt ratio
still relatively high, it would be essential to maintain high primary surpluses to reduce the debt
burden further. Directors welcomed the operations carried out to improve the debt profile and
to reduce debt dollarization.
 Analytical work. Topics for selected issues papers were discussed with the authorities early in
the process, and preliminary results were presented during the mission. The Selected Issues
Papers include work on: (i) the impact of commodity prices on growth and the fiscal position
in Uruguay; (ii) the role played by regional factors in driving output fluctuations in Uruguay,
and the vulnerability of the Uruguayan economy to regional shocks; (iii) an assessment of the
real exchange rate in Uruguay; and (iv) a discussion of the system of dynamic loan loss
provisions in Uruguay.
 Exchange system. Uruguay has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains a
floating exchange rate system free of restrictions on current international payments and
transfers, and there are no significant controls on capital inflows.
 Statistical issues. Uruguay subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) in
February 2004, and meets the SDDS specifications.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Uruguay entered the global recession with a more resilient economy than in past
episodes. Strengths stemmed from a more robust and well-regulated banking system, a solid
external position, and a more flexible exchange rate regime. In addition, skillful public debt
management had greatly reduced financing vulnerabilities. Generally sound policies had
taken advantage of the benign external conditions prevalent up to the crisis to consolidate
macroeconomic stability, reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, and lower poverty levels. All these
factors, together with low leverage levels by companies and households, underdeveloped
capital markets, and banks’ low exposure to foreign toxic assets, contributed to dampening
the impact of the global crisis.
2.
The authorities’ policy response adequately balanced different trade-offs in
response to the global shock. Fiscal policy was maintained at broadly keeping the
significant increase in nominal expenditure growth as planned, allowing automatic stabilizers
to work, and dampening the impact of lower export and private investment demand.
Concerns about an overshooting of the exchange rate during the period of financial
turbulence led to forceful but temporary intervention. Persistent inflationary pressures
resulted in a more restrictive monetary stance than in other emerging markets. This policy
mix was largely appropriate, partly because Uruguay’s economy was still operating around
potential.
3.
The economy is well positioned to benefit from the global recovery. Considerable
FDI in recent years has contributed to substantial productivity improvements in the tradable
sectors, including in agriculture and agribusiness. Combined with a stable macroeconomic
environment, this will help Uruguay to benefit from the recovery of global demand for its
exports. Nevertheless, the near-term growth outlook still entails risks, and the Uruguayan
economy remains significantly dependent on developments in the region.
4.
In the short term, there is no room for loosening monetary policy. Inflation
expectations remain clearly in the upper half of the target range, and most core inflation
measures are above it. Looking forward, rising commodity prices, substantial recent wage
increases, the (moderate) fiscal impulse, and the ongoing recovery will continue to push
consumer prices upward. Currently, staff considers the real exchange rate to be broadly in
equilibrium.
5.
Near-term fiscal policy should be cautious. The authorities are encouraged to
contain expenditure growth in non-priority areas while fully executing programs in the
budget with higher multipliers, such as planned public investment and social programs. For
next year, staff would advocate limiting the deficit to around 1 percent of GDP, in light of
still relatively high debt levels. This would also help keep fiscal policy broadly neutral.
6.
Looking forward, planning for energy-related contingencies could be improved.
In light of recurrent droughts in recent years, staff encourages the authorities to consider

4
mechanisms to incorporate this risk into budgeting. This could be achieved through the
adoption of insurance mechanisms or the establishment of a countercyclical energy fund.
7.
Reducing debt to more comfortable levels remains important. Lower debt levels
would further reduce financing costs, minimize the risk of conducting procyclical fiscal
policy during downturns, and would lay the basis for adopting a rules-based countercyclical
policy framework. For this reason, in the five-year budget to be adopted next year, the new
authorities should seek to return to more ambitious targets. Specifically, staff proposes that
the authorities target on average an overall deficit of at most 0.4 percent of GDP (equivalent
to a primary surplus of around 2.3 percent of GDP) starting in 2011 in order to bring down
gross debt to below 40 percent of GDP by 2014.
8.
Uruguay should aim for lower inflation rates. Despite achieving single-digit
inflation over the last several years, Uruguay’s inflation record still compares unfavorably
with that of many other successful emerging markets. Lower inflation levels would allow to
reap associated growth benefits, protect the poor, promote de-dollarization, and avoid the
need to recur to costly measures when inflation threatens to break the 10 percent barrier.
9.
The monetary policy framework could be strengthened further. A stronger
commitment to the inflation target range, possibly along with enhanced accountability, could
play a key role in improving the credibility of monetary policy. In this context, consideration
could be given to strengthening the central bank’s autonomy. Exchange-rate intervention
should remain consistent with and clearly subordinated to the inflation objective.
Communicating monetary policy within an explicit, forward-looking framework (based on
forecasts) could also enhance the credibility of monetary policy. Enhanced credibility, in
turn, could play a key role in the de-dollarization process.
10.
Advances in the energy sector as well as in public sector reform would help raise
potential growth. Staff encourages the authorities to continue strengthening efforts in
promoting private investment to expand power generation capacity as well as to improve
infrastructure in other areas. An important challenge to enhancing the business climate
further will be to continue promoting public sector efficiency, reducing red tape, and
improving the governance of public enterprises.
11.
Reducing poverty further remains a challenge. Building on the significant
progress achieved so far, further fostering social inclusion of disadvantaged segments of
society remains a key goal in Uruguay. While private sector growth will continue to play the
main role in this endeavor, the state needs to continue prioritizing budget resources to sustain
and improve well-targeted social programs.
12.
It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation with Uruguay will take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

II. BACKGROUND: A GLOBAL CRISIS BRINGS NEW CHALLENGES
13.
In the run-up to the global crisis, Uruguay boasted one of the fastest growing
economies in Latin America. Supported by favorable global conditions and generally sound
macroeconomic policies, real GDP growth averaged 7 percent in 2005–08, peaking at close
to 9 percent in 2008, with activity running significantly above potential in the period before
the international financial crisis. Private investment rose to record levels and unemployment
fell to historic lows.

14.
The Uruguayan economy was better prepared to face the current global shock
than in the past. Improved fundamentals included single digit inflation, a more robust
banking system, substantial international reserves, a more flexible exchange rate regime and
external current account deficits more than financed by record levels of FDI. In addition,
skillful public debt management had greatly reduced vulnerabilities in this area, in particular
by improving the maturity structure of debt.
15.
While activity slowed down with the global recession, the impact appears to have
been short-lived. Before the crisis, real GDP growth had already been projected to moderate
in 2009 to close to 5 percent as the temporary effects related to the start of operations of the
Botnia pulp mill wore off. Overall, the impact has been milder than in many emerging
market economies, and concentrated largely in some export-oriented sectors (Box 1); the

in capital formation. The unemployment rate rose temporarily but has fallen back to
7.2 percent in August, near historic lows. Overall, the economy does not seem to have
developed any substantial slack.
16.
After coming under pressure during the period of financial turbulence, the peso
has been appreciating again in recent months. In the initial wake of the crisis, as foreign
investors sold positions and domestic agents re-dollarized portfolios, the central bank (BCU)
focused on preventing excessive exchange rate volatility, intervening forcefully while
allowing the exchange rate to adjust. The peso depreciated by almost 30 percent against the
US dollar between August and December 2008—the first time in recent decades that such a
large nominal adjustment occurred without a financial crisis. More recently, the currency has
recovered, and with capital inflows resuming, current pressures are again on the upside. In
bond markets, after shooting up in line with other emerging markets, yields and country risk
have stabilized near pre-crisis levels. Throughout this period, gross international reserves
have continued to increase and net reserves (excluding private banks’ holdings) are above
their September 2008 levels. FDI contracted by 42 percent y/y in the first semester, but
remained an important external financing source.

The financial sector has held up considerably well. Deposit growth has remained
steady at about 15 percent, helping to maintain a strong level of liquidity in the banking
sector. Part of this deposit growth has stemmed from the pick-up in non-resident deposits,

levels are still low at 26 percent of GDP. The adverse impact of the currency depreciation on
balance sheets (many companies but few households are indebted in dollars) has overall been
limited in light of low leverage levels by the private sector.1

Fiscal policy was maintained at broadly keeping the significant increase in
nominal expenditure growth as planned. The authorities have not implemented any major

Due to inflation concerns, monetary policy has remained relatively tight. As
many countries were entering a marked easing cycle, the authorities tightened monetary
policy amidst inflation concerns, raising policy rates by 225 basis points to 10 percent in
January 2009. With inflationary pressures diminishing (headline CPI inflation fell from close
to 10 percent in January to 6.3 percent in June) and economic activity deteriorating, the BCU
cut rates—by 100 basis points in March and 100 basis points in June. Facing renewed
upward pressures on the currency, the authorities have been intervening again to smooth the
appreciation. In September, 12-month CPI inflation bounced back to 6.9 percent (compared
to a target range of 3–7 percent).
20.
Presidential elections are scheduled for October 25th. José Mujica, from within
the ruling Frente Amplio (FA) coalition and former president Luis Alberto Lacalle, from the
Partido Nacional (PN) are leading the polls in a highly contested election, and a second
round on November 29 is likely. The new authorities will take over the administration in
March 2010.

Loan loss provisions are about seven times loan delinquencies, not least due to the cushion of statistical
provisions that banks have built since 2001 (currently 2½ times non-performing loans; see Box 5).

Box 1. Determinants of Cross-Country Differences in the Output Impact
of the Global Crisis
A cross-country analysis on the factors explaining the extent to which mean Consensus growth projections
were revised between August 2008 and August 2009 reveals that:


Economies with higher credit growth and more leverage were hit more strongly.



More flexible exchange-rate regimes allowed to absorb the shock more easily.



For emerging markets, the financial channel trumps the trade impact.1

Among emerging markets, and also compared to the region, the growth impact of the crisis on Uruguay
was relatively mild, with a growth revision of -3.8 percentage points, compared to a median revision
among emerging markets of -6.4 percentage points. A low degree of leverage (credit over deposits) and a
flexible exchange rate regime clearly dampened the impact of the shock. The simple model fits the
Uruguayan case well, explaining 3.3 percentage points of the revision. Further factors that contributed to
reducing the impact were the lack of developed capital markets and banks’ low exposure to toxic assets.

The results suggest that the REER is broadly in line with its equilibrium value. All estimated
deviations are smaller than ten percent. Four out of the five estimations indicate that the peso
would need to appreciate slightly to reach its equilibrium value. For instance, the reduced-form
approach estimates an undervaluation of about 4–5 percent.

III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
21.
The economy is well positioned to benefit from the global recovery. For 2010 growth
is expected to reach 3.5 percent, slightly below trend growth. However, with little room to
provide further stimulus, developments in the near term will significantly depend on external
developments. Given their strong influence on the Uruguayan economy, developments in the
region will be of particular importance. Uruguay’s linkages with Argentina have weakened in
recent years, but the two business cycles remain highly correlated (see Box 3). Medium-term
prospects are good, as considerable FDI in recent years has contributed to substantial
productivity improvements in the tradable sectors.
Lower international oil prices and
22.
domestic demand adjustment are
reducing the current account deficit.
Despite the decline in export values, the
current account deficit is expected to narrow
from 4.6 percent of GDP to 1.6 percent this
year and 2.5 percent in 2010, partly
reflecting a terms-of-trade improvement
(estimated at around 9 percent this year).

Inflationary pressures are likely to persist. With the level of output around potential,
23.
inflation expectations remain clearly in the upper half of the target range, and most core inflation
measures are above it. Risks emanate from the resurgence of commodity prices, the ongoing
recovery, a (moderate) positive fiscal impulse, and persistently high real wage growth, above
productivity growth in the last few quarters (Figure 2).

24.
The fiscal position could deteriorate further. After declining in 2008, the primary
fiscal surplus is worsening further in 2009, as revenue growth slows down in line with economic
activity, public energy companies face higher drought-related costs (of about 1.6 percent of GDP)
for the second consecutive year, and public spending continues to rise.2 The overall deficit is
projected to nearly double, from 1.4 percent of GDP last year to around 2.6 percent of GDP in
2009, the largest deficit since the 2002–03 crisis. To help cover this deficit, the authorities have
secured credits of about 4 percent of GDP from multilateral organizations; more recently, they
placed a US$500 million bond on the international market, which secures financing through
2010. The gross public debt ratio, which had fallen steadily since 2003 to 59.7 percent by endDecember 2008, is projected to increase slightly this year.3 Downside risks to the fiscal outlook
stem mainly from uncertainty in the global growth outlook.

The drought implied that hydroelectric generation had to be replaced by more expensive imports of electricity
or oil-based generation. Last year, this cost had been compounded by very high oil prices.

3

Net public debt (excluding central bank’s net reserves) stands at around 50 percent of GDP.

11
Box 3. Uruguay: The Influence of Regional Factors 1/
The Uruguayan economy has historically been sensitive to changes in regional conditions. The Uruguayan business
cycle has been highly correlated with that of Argentina—notably more so than with that of Brazil, despite the larger
importance of Brazil as a destination for Uruguay’s exports. Shocks stemming from Argentina have had large and
rapid effects on Uruguay’s GDP growth, with the largest response occurring one quarter after the shock.2/

than in the past), including:


A large share of trade in regional goods—goods that are tradable only within the region;3/



Argentine FDI flows —including in real estate and in the agriculture sector, and



Significant Argentine deposits in Uruguay’s banking system.

How vulnerable is Uruguay to disruptions in the region? While a crisis in the region would negatively affect
Uruguay—mainly through real channels—it is not likely to trigger a financial crisis in Uruguay:


Not every crisis in Argentina was followed by a crisis in Uruguay, as evidenced by the 1989–90
hyperinflation in Argentina;



The regional concentration of exports (including tourism) has declined significantly in recent years, reducing
Uruguay’s vulnerability to the region—especially to Argentina;



The exposure of the Uruguayan banking system to Argentina is considerably smaller;



Brazilian crises—while affecting economic activity—have in the past not triggered financial crises in
Uruguay;



Uruguay has entered the current global crisis with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals; and



Uruguay’s banks are much healthier, and prudential regulation has been strengthened.

Box 4: Commodity Prices, Growth and the Fiscal Position1/
Booms and busts in Uruguay have historically coincided with corresponding commodity price
movements. The correlation between growth and prices of Uruguay’s commodity exports is positive.
Periods of high growth have historically been preceded by periods of rising commodity prices. Similarly,
periods of downturns have been preceded by a sharp declines in commodity prices.

Since 2004, rising agricultural commodity prices have boosted economic activity and indirectly led to
higher tax revenues, including through their positive impact on growth in neighboring countries.
However, the concurrent oil price shock has led to a deterioration in Uruguay’s terms of trade, and
resulted in sizeable fiscal costs.
An analysis using VAR and Bayesian VAR techniques, controlling for the indirect impact through
Argentina and Brazil (two large net commodity exporters with significant economic linkages to
Uruguay), shows that:
a. An increase in commodity prices has a direct positive and significant effect on growth in Uruguay,
lasting approximately one year.
b. Commodity price shocks also have a strong effect on Argentine growth, which in turn affects
Uruguayan growth. There is no evidence of similar transmission channels through Brazil.
c. Commodity price shocks initially improve the primary balance (as spending falls more than
revenues—which suffer as public enterprises take a hit from the oil shock), but the ensuing recovery of
expenditures to previous levels (including on account of higher subsidy-related outlays) quickly
deteriorates the primary balance. These effects are relatively short-lived, with a duration of 2–3 quarters.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Short term
25.
There is currently no clear-cut case for further stimulus. With activity around
potential, an ongoing recovery, and an expected growth rate of only slightly below potential
next year, there is no obvious need for strengthening domestic demand further. Moreover, the
risk of a W-shaped global recovery argues for retaining some scope for policy flexibility.
26.
Near term fiscal policy should be cautious. Staff and the authorities agreed that
despite a significant reduction in

The literature points to rising risks at relatively low levels of debt in emerging markets. Reinhart, Rogoff, and
Savastano (2003) establish a minimum “safe” debt/GDP threshold of 35 percent for emerging markets, but argue
that for some countries, this threshold could be as low as 15 to 20 percent.

14
27.
There is no room for further monetary policy easing at this point. With real
short-term-interest rates at around one percent, the current monetary stance is not particularly
tight. In staff’s view, a further normalization of real interest rates looking forward should be
expected, but its pace depends partly on the degree to which the fiscal stance alleviated the
burden on monetary policy. While the authorities highlighted the divergence in core inflation
indicators, they agreed with staff that inflationary pressures persisted, and required vigilance
on the part of the BCU. Currently, both staff and the authorities consider the real exchange
rate to be broadly in equilibrium (see Box 2).
Medium-term
28.
A return to more ambitious fiscal targets would be important to reduce public
debt to more comfortable levels and lower the risk of conducting procyclical policy.
Over the past years, buoyant revenues and the room provided by significantly-lower-than
expected interest payments have been used to support additional expenditure, while the
structural balances have been declining since 2006. Staff suggested that for the five-year
budget plan to be adopted next year, the new authorities should seek to return to more
ambitious targets. Specifically, staff proposed that the authorities target an overall deficit of
at most 0.4 percent of GDP (equivalent to a primary surplus of around 2.3 percent of GDP)
starting 2011 to bring down gross debt to below 40 percent of GDP by 2014. Barring revenue
measures, this would imply some restraining of nominal expenditure growth; this should be
feasible as the recent sharp wage (and associated pension) growth is unlikely to be sustained.
The authorities agreed in principle that there could be some scope to contain expenditure
growth looking forward but did not see the need to keep expenditure increases systematically
below those of potential output in the medium term. Staff also argued that Uruguay’s
expenditure structure was relatively inflexible, and that a further buildup in budget rigidities
should be avoided.5 The authorities as well representatives from the opposition and private
analysts agreed with the impetus for reducing debt further.
29.
The credibility of the fiscal policy framework would be enhanced by improved
Energy Related Fiscal Costs of Droughts
planning for contingencies. Staff and the
authorities agreed that fiscal policy should seek to
minimize risks stemming from recurring droughts
by better integrating related fiscal costs into
budgeting. To this end, at least until the
underlying structural energy problem is solved,
staff suggested that the authorities consider
creating an “energy fund” which could be drawn
upon during drought years. The cost of such an

insurance mechanism would, in turn, need to be translated to tariffs. The authorities agreed
with the need to tackle this issue and are also exploring possibilities of insuring against
extreme weather shocks.
30.
Staff argued that in the medium term, Uruguay should aim for lower steadystate inflation levels, and aligned with the center of the target range. Twelve-month
inflation has averaged 7.5 percent since 2006, and the authorities have repeatedly needed to
recur to ad-hoc measures to contain inflation from reaching two digits (which would have
triggered more frequent pension and wage adjustments), while leaving the economy with
little room for active monetary policy. A balanced policy mix—with a more neutral fiscal
policy—would aid in reaching lower inflation levels. The authorities pointed out that
ongoing structural changes with associated relative price changes made it difficult to assess
the optimal inflation level for a developing country like Uruguay. Uruguay also needed a
wide target range since, as a small, very open and dollarized economy, it was exposed to
more shocks than most emerging markets, while the transmission mechanism of monetary
policy was not particularly robust. Moreover, the authorities did not currently see a public
demand for substantially lower inflation rates.

The monetary policy framework could benefit from improved transparency,
communication, central bank autonomy, and accountability. A stronger, more credible
framework would not only help achieve lower inflation rates but also foster the
de−dollarization process.

16


Transparency of foreign-exchange interventions. Recurrent exchange rate
intervention has occasionally contributed
Banking system dollarization
to a lack of clarity about the monetary
(in percent)
framework and sometimes led to tensions
with the inflation objective. Staff argued
that intervention should be consistent with
and clearly subordinated to the inflation
target. The authorities stressed that
reaching the inflation target was the main
objective of monetary policy, that
intervention was only aimed at limiting
short-term volatility in a small market, and
that intervention volumes had been reduced significantly. The private sector,
however, has in the past tended to see policies as aiming for maximum peso weakness
subject to inflation remaining in single digits.



Communication. The authorities agreed that communication could be improved
using a forward-looking framework; to this end the BCU was working on improving
forecasting models and strengthening its communication so as to improve credibility.



Autonomy and accountability. Enhancing the central bank’s autonomy could be
important to enhance credibility. Having a more formal accountability mechanism
regarding the inflation objective may also be helpful toward that goal. The authorities
did not see a need to change the BCU’s formal status at this point.

32.
Staff emphasized, and the authorities agreed, on the need to achieve further dedollarization. While the use of the peso in lending to households has increased, corporate
credit remains firmly dollarized. Moreover, during the recent period of financial turbulence,
the private sector instinctively sought refuge in the US dollar, as historically has been the
case in periods of volatility. In recent years, the authorities have taken several regulatory
steps to promote de-dollarization, including the imposition of limits on net open foreign
currency positions for banks; higher capital requirements for foreign currency loans; higher
reserve and liquidity requirements on foreign currency deposits; and tighter loan
classifications of consumer loans in foreign currency as well as of large corporate borrowers
failing stress tests of a strong depreciation. Still, further measures are planned, including
extending the yield curve in pesos and developing a local market for exchange rate hedges.
33.
While the banking system’s vulnerability at this point is low, its profitability is
declining substantially. Stress tests as of May 2009 indicate that banks are generally
resilient to sizeable macroeconomic shocks (the shocks are shown in Box 5). That said,
banks’ profitability remains depressed, with the return on average assets falling slightly to

40

17
0.9 percent in June 2009.6 Factors behind the low profitability include low international
interest rates (as a relatively large part of assets are placed abroad), high reserve
requirements with low remuneration, fiercer competition for high-quality borrowers, as well
as rising wage costs. In a recent move, the BCU reduced reserve requirements on peso
deposits from 25 to 20 percent, and on dollar deposits from 35 to 30 percent, partially
reversing the hikes from May 2008.

34.
The regulatory framework is being refined further. Since the 2002–03 banking
crisis, Uruguay has persistently updated its prudential regulation, introducing, inter alia,
explicit liquidity requirements, capital charges for market and operational risks, limits to risk
exposures, as well as forward-looking loan classification and provisioning rules.7 Earlier this
year, the authorities published a set of regulations specifying the preconditions for selling
investment instruments issued by third parties, and bolstering the rights of bank clients
(particularly credit card holders). The authorities explained that they were moving towards
consolidated supervision of financial groups, which they hoped to begin applying next year.
35.
Progress has also been achieved in other financial sector areas. The financial
sector reform law adopted last year includes a substantially improved bank resolution
framework. The new deposit insurance agency foreseen in the law was formally established
in September. A law on capital market reform aimed at improving the legal framework in the
areas of securities registration and settlement, and providing for the supervision of brokerage
houses was passed in the Lower House. The restructuring of state-owned housing bank BHU
has progressed; with a much leaner structure, and its recapitalization about to be completed,
the institution has cautiously begun to lend again.

6

This figure is biased upward by the performance of the single state-owned bank (Banco República del
Uruguay). When excluding this bank, the return on assets turns negative (-0.1 percent).

Box 5. Dynamic Loan Loss Provisions in Uruguay 1/
Uruguay introduced dynamic (countercyclical) provisions in September 2001––as the first country after Spain.
Banks are required to provision each year an average of one percent of their total loans to the non-financial
private sector less specific loan losses incurred, until these provisions reach 3 percent of loans. This ensures
that provisions for non-performing loans are less volatile than otherwise, thanks to the nature of the
contribution rule that yields larger provisions when credit grows fast and loan delinquencies are low.
Conversely, during downturns banks can cover rising loan losses by tapping into their funds of dynamic
provisions.

Time

To assess the buffer provided by dynamic provisions, loan losses predicted by the credit risk model of the
BCU under certain macroeconomic shocks are set to equal the overall stock of dynamic provisions. Backward
solving the system then yields the magnitude of the shocks required to deplete the stock of provisions. The
results show that banks’ dynamic provisions would fully cover the loan losses expected to be caused by a
sizeable shock, while only cushioning part of the losses in a full-blown crisis. While overall, provisions
appear sufficient, it seems too early to conclude that the system is overprovisioned given uncertainties about
the magnitude of credit cycles looking forward.

36.
The authorities recognize that improvements in the energy sector are crucial to
avoid bottlenecks and enhance the growth potential. They highlighted the planned and
ongoing projects in this area, including generation capacity expansions through traditional
and alternative energy sources, improvements in the connection with the Brazilian electricity
network, and exploring possible gas and mineral deposits. Staff argued that private
investment could be promoted through public-private partnerships (with adequate risk
sharing), and the development of a competitive spot market for electricity.
37.
Reforming the public sector remains a key element of the agenda towards
enhancing the investment climate. Staff highlighted the need to streamline regulations and
reduce the administrative burden on the private sector and stressed the importance of
strengthening corporate governance in public enterprises. 8 The authorities agreed that there
was scope for a thorough review of these issues. They explained efforts at reducing
administrative procedures for private companies, including a plan to drastically simplify the
opening and closing of businesses. Staff also inquired about the effects of labor market
regulations passed in recent years, including the implementation of tripartite negotiations; the
authorities argued that so far there was no evidence of any adverse impact, citing the fact that
unemployment had barely risen with the downturn.
38.
Improving social inclusion will be important for sustainable growth. A
significant share of public resources has been directed to social ends, with the share of
central government social expenditures (comprising mainly outlays in health, housing, and
education as well as social security benefits and transfers) in total rising from 57 percent in
2003 to 75 percent in 2008, and the authorities highlighted that poverty levels had fallen
from around 32 percent in the aftermath of the 2002 crisis to currently 20 percent. There was
broad agreement that continuing to improve carefully targeted social programs through
budget re-prioritization remained an important policy objective.

Uruguay continues to rank unfavorably in some international comparisons of red tape (such as starting a
business, registering property, or dealing with construction permits).

Figure 3. Uruguay: Policy Responses to the Global Crisis
While allowing the exchange rate to adjust amid intervention, monetary policy has been guided mainly by inflation
concerns. Although there has been no explicit fiscal stimulus package, the fiscal position is projected to deteriorate in
light of still strong expenditure growth and lower revenues.
The exchange rate adjusted to the external shock, with the central bank
intervening to smooth volatility.

After tightening policy amid inflation concerns, the central bank
has recently cut rates as inflation has declined.

Figure 4. Uruguay: External Developments
Although the global crisis has negatively affected trade and capital inflows, particularly FDI, sovereign spreads
have normalized and gross international reserves continue to increase.
The current account balance has improved on the back of a
declining oil import bill...

…and a less pronounced deterioration of exports than that of
non-oil imports.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)

ANNEX 2. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of September 7, 2009)
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uruguay was approved on June 9, 2005. The
CAS envisaged a base case scenario of up to US$800 million in new lending over the period
FY05–10, and proposed to rebuild the investment portfolio with new operations supporting
investments in infrastructure, social programs and innovation.
The Bank’s strategy was anchored around a series of programmatic development loans
(DPLs) supporting the Government in key policy areas. The first DPL (SPDPL) for
US$75 million was approved by the Board of Directors together with the CAS on June 9,
2005. It supported reforms in social policies as well as important measures taken by the
Government with respect to health, education and social protection. A subsequent DPL, the
First Programmatic Reform Implementation Development Policy Loan (PRIDPL 1) in the
amount of US$100 million, was approved by the Board of Directors on May 30, 2007. This
operation supported the Government’s reform program in taxation, business climate and
capital markets development, and aimed at improving the social protection system. The
US$100 million PRIDPL1 was disbursed in local currency in May 2008, as the World Bank
became the first foreign issuer to launch a public bond in (inflation indexed) Uruguayan
pesos. This was the first that the World Bank has issued a local currency bond for the
purpose of a back-to-back disbursement of a specific loan.
A CAS Progress Report (PR) to assess progress in implementing the program outlined in the
2005 CAS and lay out a program for the remainder of the CAS period (FY08-FY10) was
approved on April 1, 2008. The CAS PR confirmed the validity of the overall thrust and
long-term goals of the 2005 CAS and recognized the important economic developments that
have taken place since the 2005 CAS was approved, most notably Uruguay’s full recovery
from the 2002 crisis.
The current investment portfolio comprises eight investment projects totaling
US$261.9 million in commitments, with an undisbursed amount of US$123.9 million as of
September 7, 2009. Seven of these investment operations have been approved since the
beginning of the new CAS period. These include two investment operations for Integrated
Natural Resources and Transport Infrastructure and Rural Access, in the amount of
US$30 million and US$70 million respectively, approved by the Board on June 9, 2005
together with the CAS. In addition, in December 2006, the Board approved a Supplemental
Financing for the Foot and Mouth Disease Project in the amount of US$6.5 million. On May
30, 2007 an Institution Building Technical Assistance Project in the amount of
US$15 million was also approved (together with the First PRIDPL).
In addition, the second phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for OSE Modernization
and Rehabilitation Systems (US$50 million) was approved on July 28, 2007. Another

5
investment loan in support of the Promoting Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Project
was approved on May 1, 2007 in the amount of US$26 million, and a Non Communicable
Disease Prevention Project in the amount of US$25.30 million was approved on
August 28, 2008.
In addition to investment lending, a second PRIDPL in the amount of $400 million was
approved on 3 February 2009 and has been fully disbursed. This operation continues the
support provided under PRIDPL1 for the implementation of key reforms in taxation, business
climate and capital markets, as well as the social protections system, where the loan builds on
the achievements of the SPDPL.
The Bank has also engaged with the authorities in an active AAA program. In FY08, the
program has included completion of a Programmatic DPR in Infrastructure, a PSIA on Tax
Reform, an Investment Climate Assessment and a Non-Lending Technical Assistance
(NLTA) on Strengthening Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation in Social Policies. A
second phase of the NLTA on Strengthening Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation in
Social Policies and a Study on the Payments System was completed in FY09, and a Railways
Sector Study, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focusing on trade, a Study on
Family Farm Development and one on Opportunity and Informality are under preparation for
FY10 delivery. The Policy Notes which will inform the next Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) are also under preparation and will be finalized in the third quarter of FY10, while the
new CPS is expected to be presented to the Board of Executive Directors in the fourth
quarter of FY10.

ANNEX 3. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 15, 2009)
The Inter-American Development Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country
Strategy for Uruguay on March 15, 2006. The Bank’s Country Strategy supports the
Government’s policy, which seeks to consolidate growth and improve the population’s social
welfare. In support of this longer-term goal, the Strategy focuses on the following priority
areas: (i) improving public sector management, to increase its efficiency and efficacy, while
supporting fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) enhancing regional and international
competitiveness of domestic output and encouraging private investment in order to promote
sustainable growth; and (iii) reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion.
The Bank’s strategy proposed a lending scenario of about US$1.2 million for the five-year
period 2005–09, which was thought to be consistent with Uruguay’s five year budget plan,
annual amendments approved by Congress, and the maintenance of a relatively neutral net
flow of Bank resources (during this period of concentrated external-IFI maturities). At
present we estimate that total approvals will add to US$920.5 million for the period, a total of
77% of planned resources.
This program included lending to support the Government in the key policy areas of
competitiveness, the social sectors and poverty reduction, and public sector management. To
this end, within the area of competitiveness, a loan for a program to support the productivity
and development of new livestock products, for US$15.8 million, was approved in July 2005;
an investment project to improve cluster competitiveness for US$9 million was approved in
July 2006; and a two-year programmatic loan to improve competitiveness for a total of
US$150 million––for US$75 million each––is under preparation, with the first loan approved
in January 2007 and expected approval of the second loan in March 2009; and a loan to
strengthen the institutional capacity for international insertion, for US$5.4 million was
approved in April 2008. In the social sector area, a sector loan, for US$250 million, was
approved in August 2005, to support the development and implementation of Government’s
social policy aimed at reducing poverty, improving the human resource base among the poor,
and strengthening the sector’s institutional framework; and a loan for sanitation, for
US$118.6 million, was approved in January 2006, to improve the standard of living of the
population in Montevideo by increasing the coverage of sanitation service and reducing
pollution in the bay; a sanitation program for Ciudad de la Costa for US$43 million; also in
Montevideo, a program to support the modernization of the harbor ($40 million), and two
loans to improve transportation (US$80 million and US$100 million) and a neighborhood
improvement program for US$70 million was approved in October, 2008.
Within the public sector management area, a loan to support the public debt management unit
for US$2.45 million was approved in November 2005; and a three year programmatic loan to
support improvements in tax administration and public sector management is being prepared.

8
The first loan for US$50 million was approved in October 2006; a second loan for
US$285 million was approved in early-2009 while the amount for the third loan is still to be
determined; a program related to e-government management for US$5 million was approved
in March 2008; a program to support the social security system for US$3.2 millions was
approved in December, 2008; a program to support the entities in charge of public oversight
for US$2.2 million was also approved in December 2008.
As of September 15, 2009 the Bank’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the
financing of 35 projects; two of which are to the private sector without sovereign guarantee.
The lending portfolio, largely aligned to the administration’s priorities and consistent with
the Bank’s Country Strategy, amounts to US$1,379.9 million, of which US$510.4 million are
pending disbursement. Portfolio performance related to investment loans in 2009 is relatively
normal and disbursements will totalUS$495 million in 2009. PBL disbursements, focusing in
Tax Administration, at US$285 million aimed to support government in the middle of the
international financial crisis, compensating for the lack of market financing, related to the
crisis. The Bank’s Operational Program for 2009 has 4 additional investment loans with
sovereign guarantee in the agricultural, financial, education and infrastructure sectors and
two operations without sovereign guarantee with the private sector supporting trade.

ANNEX 4—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 14, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.
National Accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005)
and adopted the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93). However, national accounts
statistics still have a number of shortcomings, limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long
publication lags, inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly
accounts. The central bank (BCU) compiles and disseminates annual GDP estimates in
current and at previous year prices by the production and expenditure approaches, as well as
quarterly constant price GDP estimates by the production and expenditure approaches. Gross
national income, gross disposable income and gross savings are also available annually.
Consumer prices: Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular
and timely basis for publication in the IFS. The consumer price index has a base period of
March 1997 = 100, and the base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001.
Coverage of the CPI is limited to the capital city. The authorities do not provide trade price
and volume indices for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Government finance statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state
enterprises and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems
with the timeliness of the data on local governments. There are also problems with the
timeliness of financing and debt data reported for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical
publications. Information on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data
respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central
government and total public sector. The information reported for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on revenue and expense for the
consolidated central government, and the general government’s operations on financial assets
and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt). However, data on
revenue and expense for local governments have not been reported since 1994.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in
accordance with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities
have yet to report monetary data using the standardized reporting forms (SRF). In April
2003, a STA mission visited Montevideo to assist the authorities in the adequate recording of
the loans funded from the Fund for the Stabilization of the Banking System in the Central
Bank’s balance sheet. The mission’s recommendations have been implemented and were
reflected in the IFS June 2003 issue.

10
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a
quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on
balance of payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for
publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The new surveys
would also allow for improved coverage of the private sector in the IIP.
Uruguay started disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data
template on the Fund’s external website in 2005. The BCU also disseminates quarterly
external debt statistics on its website, although not in the format envisaged by the SDDS.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in
February 2004 and is in observance.

Data ROSC published on October 1, 2001.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
or in the International Financial Statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Uruguay
November 9, 2009
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
In the presidential elections on October 25th, José Mujica from the governing Frente
Amplio received 48.0 percent of all votes, compared to 29.1 percent for Luis Alberto Lacalle
from the National (Blanco) Party and 17.0 percent for Pedro Bordaberry from the Colorado
Party. Consequently, there will be a run-off presidential election on November 29th; Mr.
Bordaberry has announced his support for Mr. Lacalle. The Frente Amplio obtained the
majority of seats in both chambers of Congress.
3.
To dampen the effects of exchange-rate volatility and potentially limit appreciation
pressures, the central bank recently announced various measures. They include: (i) fostering
the creation of a market for foreign-exchange forwards, with market participation of the
central bank; (ii) reducing reserve requirements on US dollar deposits by 5 percentage points
(to 25 percent) over the next 5 months; (iii) refunding deposits for export prefinancing
operations at the central bank in pesos instead of US dollars; and (iv) signing a letter of intent
with the Brazilian central bank to implement a bilateral payment system, enabling to conduct
trade transactions in local currency. In the past two weeks, appreciation pressures have
lessened somewhat, and intervention levels in the foreign-exchange market have been
substantially lower.

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Uruguay
On November 9, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Uruguay.1
Background
The Uruguayan economy has held up considerably well in the face of the global recession. In
recent years, Uruguay had taken advantage of favorable global economic conditions to
consolidate macroeconomic stability while building up significant buffers. Improved
fundamentals included a more robust and well-regulated banking system, substantial
international reserves, a more flexible exchange rate regime, external current account deficits
more than financed by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), as well as reduced debt vulnerabilities.
Together with low private sector leverage levels, these factors have helped to dampen the
impact of the global recession.
The impact of the crisis appears to have been relatively short-lived. Real GDP contracted by
2.3 percent (quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted) during the first quarter of 2009, as the
decline in external demand leaned on key export-oriented sectors, and a severe drought
affected activity in the agriculture, livestock and energy sectors. Private consumption and
investment decelerated while the unemployment rate rose only little, and temporarily. In the
second quarter, real GDP expanded again, by 0.5 percent (quarter-over-quarter, seasonally
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
adjusted), led by a recovery in manufacturing and commerce. Overall, the economy is now
expected to grow by at least 0.6 percent in 2009.
The policy response to the crisis has sought to balance different risks. Concerns about an
overshooting of the exchange rate during the period of financial turbulence led to forceful but
temporary intervention. Persistent inflationary pressures resulted in a more restrictive monetary
stance than in other emerging markets. After coming under pressure late last year, the peso has
been appreciating again in recent months and capital inflows have resumed, while yields and
country risk have stabilized near pre-crisis levels. Core inflation remains in the upper half of the
target range in an economy that is still operating around potential.
Fiscal policy has been maintained at keeping nominal expenditure growth as planned. The
authorities have not implemented any discretionary stimulus plans, besides specific, limited
measures to support particularly affected sectors. However, with strong expenditure growth,
lower-than-expected revenues and drought-related costs (of 1.6 percent of GDP), the overall
fiscal deficit is projected to deteriorate further in 2009 to 2.6 percent of GDP.
In 2010, the recovery is expected to strengthen, with growth projected to reach 3.5 percent.
Medium term-prospects are good, as considerable FDI in recent years has contributed to
substantial productivity improvements in the tradable sectors.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ achievements in reducing Uruguay’s
vulnerabilities, which have enabled the economy to withstand well the global recession.
Directors praised in particular Uruguay’s sound macroeconomic policies and skilful public debt
management; its robust and well-regulated banking system; its solid external position—
underpinned by a flexible exchange rate regime; and its advances in poverty alleviation. Low
private sector leverage and minimal bank exposure to foreign toxic assets have also helped to
limit the transmission of the global crisis to Uruguay. Directors noted the quick turnaround in the
Uruguayan economy, welcoming the resumption of growth in the second quarter of 2009.
Directors commended the authorities’ policy response to the global recession. The monetary
policy stance was appropriately tighter than in other emerging markets in light of inflation
concerns, while fiscal policy was geared to broadly maintaining the significant increase in
nominal expenditure as planned, allowing automatic stabilizers to work. Directors agreed that
there is no clear case for strengthening domestic demand further, given that the Uruguayan
economy is still operating around potential. Looking forward, the recent sizable inflows of
foreign investment and associated productivity improvements should enable Uruguay to benefit
from the recovery of global demand for its exports.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should continue to aim at debt reduction. While recognizing
that the recent increase in the fiscal deficit reflected largely temporary factors, they considered
that the still high levels of public debt call for a cautious approach going forward. Directors
therefore welcomed the authorities’ intention to contain growth in non-priority areas in the near

3
term, while preserving room for much-needed infrastructure and social outlays, and encouraged
the authorities to seek to return to more ambitious fiscal targets over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the achievement of single-digit inflation over the last several years, while
noting that inflation remains relatively high. Against this backdrop, they did not see room for
monetary easing in the near term, and encouraged the authorities to aim for lower inflation rates
over the medium term. This would allow Uruguay to reap associated growth benefits, protect the
poor, promote de-dollarization, and avoid the need to resort to costly measures should inflation
threaten to reach the 10 percent threshold. Directors noted the staff assessment that the real
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Directors considered that, building on recent improvements, Uruguay’s monetary policy
framework could be strengthened further. This could be achieved through an even stronger
commitment to the inflation target range, while ensuring that exchange-rate intervention remains
limited to addressing volatility and consistent with the inflation objective. Consideration could
also be given to strengthening the central bank’s autonomy, enhancing accountability, and
improving communication. Strengthening credibility would be key to de-dollarize the economy
further.
Directors welcomed Uruguay’s achievement in bringing prudential regulation and supervision of
the banking sector up to international best practices, drawing on Financial Sector Assessment
Program recommendations. They supported the authorities’ intention to move towards
consolidated supervision of financial groups starting next year, and encouraged them to
continue strengthening the framework as needed.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to improve productivity and the business
climate. They welcomed the efforts to promote public sector efficiency, reduce red tape, and
improve the governance of public enterprises. It will be important to further strengthen efforts to
promote private investment in the electricity sector. Directors agreed that planning for energyrelated contingencies could be improved to avoid bottlenecks and enhance the growth potential.
Directors commended the authorities’ achievements in reducing poverty. They highlighted the
need for further fostering social inclusion and improving targeted social programs through
budget re-prioritization.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country

Statement by Mr. David Vogel Alternate Executive Director for Uruguay
November 9, 2009
From Uruguay’s Worst Crisis ...
1.
Seven years ago, Uruguay suffered the deepest economic, financial, and social crisis
in its history. In about six months, the country's financial system lost almost half of its
deposits; after the abandonment of the crawling band, the exchange rate followed an
overshooting process and depreciated more than 80 percent (at the end of 2002 relative to the
end of 2001); unemployment rates steadily climbed to almost 20 percent; the gross public
sector debt–to-GDP ratio increased to above 100 percent and the rollover of the public debt
highlighted a critical issue which was exacerbated when some analysts confused liquidity
with solvency aspects, and temporary with permanent effects. The crisis drove a large
number of the population to poverty, while many others decided to emigrate.
... to a Promising Future
2.
The current situation is completely different. After exhibiting an average economic
growth of approximately 7 percent over the last five years, Uruguay's GDP will end this year
with a positive variation, as economic activity has already increased in the second quarter of
2009; unemployment rate is just above 7 percent; the country is continuing to attract a
significant amount of direct investment; inflation is fully under control; the financial sector is
showing a remarkable, sound performance; public debt indicators have improved
substantially; and poverty rates have significantly declined together with migration flows.
What Happened in the Meantime?
3.
During bad times, and when daunting challenges had to be faced, Uruguay
relied on its solid traditions and democratic institutions. The country ratified its strong
tradition of honoring its debts and commitments in general; and, once again, Uruguay’s
political system demonstrated a noteworthy responsibility to deal with sensitive issues.
Following the rule of law, Uruguay was able to overcome the crisis and contain social
tensions.
4.
Uruguay enjoys a high level of political stability which is critical. For instance,
with regard to some last episodes, it is worth highlighting that in October 2009 the President
invited three former Presidents from two opposition parties to inaugurate a significant
investment from a foreign company aimed to further increase Montevideo’s seaport
infrastructure, allowing the country to enhance its position as a key hub in the region.
Something similar occurred in early October when the President invited his predecessor—
from an opposition party— to the inauguration of a new airport under whose government this
private investment was decided to be implemented. Beyond the critical importance of the

2
above-referred investments, these facts once again reveal Uruguay’s political stability.
Meanwhile, recent national elections were held in a sound democratic environment, as usual.
5.
Alleviating the conditions of the most vulnerable sectors of society has been a
high priority. Needless to say, an economic and financial crisis such as Uruguay endured
mostly affects these sectors, and improving their conditions largely exceeded the recovery of
economic growth. Beyond the role of the automatic stabilizers in this regard, the situation
required decisive plans (particularly the Plan de Emergencia Social) which were
implemented in a transparent manner, having been of vital importance to meet imperious
social needs. It is important to note that, as envisaged, the Plan de Emergencia Social was
temporary, and after its completion new social plans have been implemented, which are more
focused on removing the roots of poverty, and giving the most vulnerable people the
necessary instruments and conditions to reemerge economically and socially. In 2008,
poverty rates continued decreasing from 26 percent in 2007 to 20.5 percent, while extreme
poverty (indigence) declined from 2 percent to 1.5 percent.
6.
Policies have aimed at attaining economic and social sustainability. Meeting these
objectives together is not only possible but essential to enter a virtuous cycle. Therefore, with
a pragmatic approach, the government implemented fiscal policies fully consistent with the
objective of ensuring fiscal sustainability, while implementing the above-referred social
plans. Fiscal policies have been gradually set up, considering the imperious need to attain
fiscal consolidation and give strict priority to social policies, for which there has been a
critical reorganization of expenditures.
7.
Public debt indicators have shown tremendous progress. Gross public sector debtto-GDP ratio is currently below 60 percent (and net public debt-to-GDP-ratio has exhibited a
dramatic decline, considering also the increase of international reserves). Furthermore, and
beyond this specific case, when comparing debt dynamics across countries, it is necessary—
among other things that could allow us to compare more consistently among indicators—to
take into account the burden of future pensions on public debt indicators. In this regard,
Uruguay’s debt indicators fully include the effects of a major pension system reform
implemented more than a decade ago. Indeed, nearly US$ 4 billion (about 13 percent of
GDP) of public debt are held by the Pension Fund Administrators (AFAPs).
8.
The skillful and professional work of the Debt Management Unit (created in
2005) has also allowed the country to strengthen its fiscal position while creating more
space for social expenditures. Thus, Uruguay has been able to lengthen public debt
maturities (from 7.4 years in 2004 to 12.8 years in 2009), take firm steps in its dedollarization (89 percent of the debt was denominated in foreign currency five years ago
while 71 percent is currently), and reduce its interest costs. The country’s financing needs are
well covered for the coming years, with most of the debt being at fixed rates; and Uruguay
has been able to obtain some contingent lines, all of which have driven the country to
substantially minimize vulnerabilities and risks in this regard.

3
9.
Monetary policies have aimed at keeping inflation in check, which is essential
not only to further improve the investment environment, but also as a critical way to
protect the most vulnerable sectors of society. During a period where the rise in
international commodities prices exerted significant pressures on domestic prices, the Central
Bank implemented the needed measures to address the situation. When many countries,
including Uruguay, exhibited a temporary deviation of inflation rates from their targets, the
authorities were especially eager to prevent inflation rising above 10 percent, which would
have fed inflationary pressures through second-round effects due to the introduction of
indexation mechanisms, making it even more difficult to reach the target range (from 3
percent to 7 percent). Therefore, the government, demonstrating again its commitment to
maintaining low and stable inflation rates, and incurring a fiscal cost, collaborated, under
exceptional circumstances, with the monetary policy to avoid the possibility of the abovereferred second-round effects. Currently, twelve-month inflation (6.5 percent in October) and
inflationary expectations (6.15 percent in October 2009-September 2010) are well within the
Central Bank’s target range.
10.
Maintaining a flexible exchange rate system and without pushing against the
wind, the Central Bank has simply intervened in the exchange rate market to smooth
volatility. Interventions have led to an increase in international reserves, allowing Uruguay
to build up a considerable financial buffer in this regard. The authorities fully agree with the
staff’s conclusion that “there is no evidence of competitiveness problems and a potential
misalignment of the real exchange rate”.
11.
Labor market developments provide another sample of the efforts towards
reinforcing economic and social stability. After a substantial decrease in real wages during
the crisis (about 20 percent in 2002 and 4 percent in 2003), a considerable rise has been
observed in recent years, which should be seen in the context of a recovery from the deep
decline. This process was also accompanied by a significant increase in productivity.
Unemployment figures (showing historic low levels) along with those associated with
economic activity, inflation and investment clearly demonstrate that income policies and
labor reforms have been meticulously carried out, considering the need to be consistent with
the authorities’ broad concept of stability.
12.
Regulation and supervision of the financial system has been substantially
strengthened. The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) undertaken by the IMF and
World Bank staff has provided an important input in this regard, and its suggestions were
carefully considered by the authorities when the reforms were analyzed and implemented.
Among other things, it is interesting to note a recent IMF Working Paper on Uruguay1, which
concludes “the gradual but persistent reforms have brought financial regulation and
supervision generally up to international best practices, while also embracing innovative
elements such as dynamic provisions and explicit liquidity requirements”. Furthermore, after
1

“Modernizing Bank Regulation in Support of Financial Deepening: The Case of Uruguay”, IMF Working
Paper 09/199.

4
having successfully faced arduous challenges, public banks (BROU and BHU) are exhibiting
noticeable transformations, where functioning and incentives have changed dramatically.
13.
Market and product diversification allows Uruguay to be substantially less
dependent on regional events. We also note a substantial decrease in non-resident deposits,
which, of course, further weaken regional economic and financial linkages. Chapter III of the
Selected Issues is very eloquent in showing Uruguay’s current situation and outlook as less
exposed from occurrences in the surrounding region. Of course, regional developments do
not pass inadvertently in Uruguay, but diversification and structural changes have
significantly minimized risks of contagion.
14.
Support from the international community has been key, although it does not
necessarily ensure success, as it critically depends on the authorities’ ownership. We
recall once again that just after the Stand-By Arrangement was approved in June 2005,
Uruguay’s Minister of Finance at the time publicly underlined “this is the economic program
of Uruguay and not of the Fund” establishing a powerful proof of political leadership. In the
Buff statement issued on June 6, 2005, the authorities’ strong commitment to make Uruguay
“a successful case for the benefit of the Uruguayan people and also for the Fund” and “their
firm willingness to establish a well articulated exit strategy from the Fund’s financial
support” was underscored.
15.
Effectively, the exit strategy was well-articulated, and after Uruguay repaid its
outstanding debt to the Fund—based on economic and financial arguments— the
authorities’ ownership of the program was demonstrated once again. They have
continued to be extremely successful in approving the envisaged reforms established in
Uruguay’s agenda. Among many others, these reforms included those on the tax system and
revenue administration, autonomy to the Central Bank, the approval of the bankruptcy law,
and the above reforms on the financial system and BHU.
16.
Until 2008, Uruguay and the rest of the world enjoyed a favorable external
environment; as noted in other occasions, positive cycles can be capitalized to establish
pillars for higher and sustainable growth or may sometimes lead to dilapidation.
Clearly, Uruguay chose the first option. At the same time, it is important to underscore that
the favorable external environment was less benign in Uruguay than in many other countries,
to the extent that Uruguay is an oil importer (as noted by the staff “the concurrent oil price
shock has led to a deterioration in Uruguay’s terms of trade) and, combined with years of
severe drought (oil products were necessary to substitute the lack of hydroelectric power),
substantial fiscal costs were incurred. Admittedly, the international situation until 2008
generated an abundance of liquidity, and Uruguay, based on its sound policies, reforms and
traditions, has been able to benefit from the situation to successfully attract direct investment,
although it seems to be well beyond the international environment, to the extent that it has
continued to benefit even after the crisis erupted.

5
Facing the International Crisis
17.
A year ago, during the last Article IV Consultation on Uruguay, precisely when the
international crisis started to demonstrate its powerful virulence, the Uruguayan authorities’
confidence in the country’s position to face the crisis was emphasized. Evidently, the
authorities’ confidence was well based. Of course, as a small and open economy, Uruguay
has been affected by the crisis, exhibiting a slowdown from the high growth rates of past
years. However, the effects have been very moderate and the country only showed a decline
in GDP in the first quarter of 2009, having continued to grow thereafter. It is worth
underlining that the above-referred growth performance during the crisis has been attained in
the context of extremely moderate countercyclical fiscal policies, which allows Uruguay to
present a sound fiscal outlook, to the extent that its solid basis are maintained, and the
situation was temporarily affected especially by the drought. Meanwhile, revenues (relative
to GDP, which has continue rising) will increase in 2009 in comparison with 2008. In this
regard, it is important to give an appropriate interpretation of the situation and outlook
without confusing temporary with permanent factors. Moreover, financial indicators show a
remarkable resilience. Therefore, Uruguay’s economic outlook is seen as promissory, which
have driven to the continuation of a positive process in terms of investment –especially FDI
which, meanwhile, entails positive effects on the labor market (it exhibits records in terms of
employment and unemployment) all of which more than offsets the negative effects of the
international crisis.
Looking at the World and the Future
18.
The authorities are fully aware of the need to continue implementing structural
reforms and basically share many of the staff’s views in this regard. Clearly, further progress
in the energy and public sectors is warranted to continue enhancing Uruguay’s business
environment and boost potential growth; as usual in every country, macroeconomic policies
need to be refined consistently with new circumstances and future challenges (for example,
to the extent possible, the authorities are eager to continue progressing towards a more
formal framework of countercyclical fiscal policies); and, of course, although many
important advances have been made so far, much remains to be done with respect to social
issues.
19.
At the same time, the authorities are very satisfied with the efforts made and outputs
obtained so far. Policies and reforms have been guided by their firm conviction of the need to
increase opportunities for all, encouraging not only access to knowledge but also generating
it by boosting research, while further inserting the country into the global economy.
Although there have been many structural reforms in recent years in different areas—for
instance, the substantial transformation of the provision of public health services—perhaps
the most emblematic has been the Plan Ceibal, whereby one laptop with Internet connection
has been provided to every child in public schools. This may be the reform which best
reflects the authorities’ objectives to achieve higher and sustainable growth, enhance the
level and quality of employment, improve social conditions, and increase social equity.
