Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and G. Russell Kincaid
February 10, 2004
•

A staff team—Messrs. Doyle (head), Kanda, and Lazar (all EUR), Mr. Taube (FAD), and
Mr. Almekinders (PDR) visited Bosnia and Herzegovina during December 3–18, 2003 for
discussions for the 2004 Article IV Consultation and to complete discussions for the fourth
review of the SBA (see staff report). It was assisted by Ms. Fichera, Ms. Milic, and
Ms. Selimovic-Mehmedbasic in the Resident Representative’s office.

•

The Fund staff met: (a) at the State level, the Chair of the Council of Ministers Mr. Terzic; the
Minister of Finance and Treasury Ms. Maric; Central Bank Governor Mr. Nicholl; (b) in the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: the Prime Minister Mr. Hadzipasic, the Minister of
Finance Mr. Vrankic; the Minister of Defense Mr. Nikolic, and (c) in the Republika Srpska: the
Prime Minister Mr. Mikerevic; the Minister of Finance Mr. Krsmanovic; the Minister of
Defense Mr Stankovic. The Fund staff also met with High Representative Lord Ashdown, and
representatives of the international community, business and labor.

•

The last Article IV discussion was held on February 25, 2002, and Directors’ comments may be
found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2002/pn0229.htm. The discussion for the second
and third reviews of the SBA held on June 6, 2003 and Directors’ comments may be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr0381.htm.

•

Nationalist, but reform-oriented parties are in coalition in various combinations at all levels of
government, with national elections next due in Fall 2006. A new Central Bank board was
smoothly installed as the mandate of the old expired in August 2003. The Office of the High
Representative (OHR) will be scaled back significantly from mid-2005 alongside an ongoing
shift from the US-led military force to a token EU force.

•

The authorities have agreed to the publication of the staff report.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Economic transition and aspiration to EU accession frame Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s (BiH) medium-term economic goals. Rapidly declining reconstruction aid
inflows, refugees returning in numbers, and constitutional change—as the role of the Office
of the High Representative (OHR) is reduced—are key constraints within which these
ambitions must be prosecuted (Box 1). Can it be done?
2.
The record suggests that Bosnia can achieve much. Since Dayton in 1995––in the
context of a large peacekeeping force, external debt forgiveness, two Stand-By arrangements,
and extensive TA—progress has been remarkable:
•

Since 1995, real GDP has trebled, exports are up ten-fold, and inflation has stabilized at
industrial country rates (Figure 1).

•

Backed by the currency board, the KM has largely replaced other currencies, the banking
system has been privatized, recapitalized, and better regulated, and the fiscal deficit has
strengthened 9 percentage points of GDP in 4 years, taking the balance to a small surplus
in 2003. In this context, international reserves have risen to 5 months of imports.

•

Of two million refugees at war’s end, some 370,000 have returned from abroad and a
similar number of internal refugees have returned to their pre-war locales. House building
and repair is evident everywhere.

3.

And an impressive reform agenda is underway:

•

The newly-approved framework Law on indirect taxation will greatly strengthen the
fiscal system (¶30).1 This innovative package underlies plans to replace sales tax with
VAT in 2005–06.2

•

A plan to restructure unsustainable domestic claims on government of over 200 percent
of GDP has been announced. Restructuring will lower the NPV of such claims to
10 percent of GDP, with the legislative basis for this anticipated for mid-2004; 3

•

Major defense reforms are anticipated for 2004 centralizing command and control
structures, continuing demobilization, and facilitating accession to NATO’s partnership
for peace;

and repair is evident everywhere.

Bosnia and Herzegovina comprises of two Entities; the Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation.
The RS is highly centralized and predominantly Serb, accounting for 1/3 of the BiH population. The
Federation is highly devolved with 10 autonomous ethnically based cantons. It is mainly Bosniac
and Croat and accounts for the remaining 2/3 of the population. The Entities have co-dominion over
the tiny Brcko district, which abuts both. (See map.)
The Entities and Brcko enjoy significant autonomy including on key aspects of fiscal policy. The
State Government has limited responsibilities, including customs, foreign affairs, and foreign debt
service, and it has negligible revenue raising powers.
On behalf of the main powers party to Dayton, the High Representative oversees the political
aspects of the Dayton Peace agreement. The office enjoys sweeping powers to pass or veto laws,
ban political parties, and remove individuals from elected office and the civil service. These powers
have been extensively used. The incumbent has been extended until mid-2005 but it is anticipated
that if a successor is appointed, the role will be considerably scaled back and recast.

•

The judicial system is being overhauled, with an exercise to selectively reappoint judges
nearing completion and a new system of commercial courts about to begin operations;

•

And since mid-2003, bank regulators have stepped up enforcement of key liquidity and
forex exposure regulations, with these rules scheduled for full enforcement by mid-2004.

Alongside, a raft of further measures is anticipated under the authorities’ largely home-grown
and 6-month “Action Plan” of largely administrative measures in support of this broader
agenda (¶32). And an EU feasibility study has been completed, setting the stage for EU
accession negotiations to commence.
4.
But policy implementation has been uneven. Privatization has all but stalled in the
past three years, the late 1980s voucher privatizations left most affected firms adrift without
effective corporate governance, and significant mismanagement of energy utilities has come
to light. Private business is over regulated, lacks reliable or timely legal redress, and
corruption appears widespread. Furthermore, the popular tendency to view anything less than
1990 levels of prosperity as policy failure, compounded by reconstruction-cum-adjustment
fatigue, has spawned a series of destabilizing fiscal initiatives. And extensive devolution,
limited implementation capacity, and latent aspirations in some quarters to see the Dayton
settlement fail frequently combine to produce policy gridlock. Unraveling this has required
the frequent intervention of the OHR, and is reflected in the extensions to both SBAs.
5.
Furthermore, the coming challenge of economic transition and EU accession is
daunting:
•

Growth has slowed markedly with output still only half pre-war levels, unemployment
appears to be above 20 percent and much higher among the youth, 1/5 of wages are
unpaid each month, ⅓ of the population live around or below the poverty line, and only
half of output comes from the private sector, even including the voucher-privatized sector
(Tables 1a –1b).

•

Alongside house building, corporate loss-making estimated at some 3 percent of GDP,
and a post 2001 credit boom (Tables 2a–2b), the external current account deficit widened
to around 18 percent of GDP in 2002. With reconstruction aid inflows and reverse
currency substitution tailing off, medium-term external financing and sustainability issues
loom large; (Tables 3a–3d)

•

And the policymaking machinery to tackle all this is fractured: no institution is charged
with macroeconomic analysis or fiscal coordination; and the quality of statistics
significantly clouds policy design and the effectiveness of Fund surveillance.4

But with due allowance for poor data quality, recent macroeconomic trends
provide some—albeit qualified—comfort (Figures 2 and 3).

Fiscal consolidation of 2½ percentage points of

corrective actions on the monetary side to curb

In this context, the trade and current account
deficits appear to have begun to correct.
Imports have reportedly decelerated while
exports, buoyed by the marked depreciation
of the KM in real effective terms—as the

Manufacturing has all but stood still and
drought has cut agricultural output by 1/5. The
power sector in the RS and construction and
communications appear the most robust sectors
(Text Table 4, ¶6).

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
7.
Transition and eventual EU accession are to be sought in difficult circumstances.
Though much has been achieved and the public is impatient for further progress, their
tolerance for the sacrifices necessary is qualified, the macroeconomic imbalances appear
stark, and policy-making processes tend to seize up without the OHR “oil in the wheels.” As
BiH is weaned off of foreign aid, the challenge is to establish both economic and political
conditions for sustainable growth.
8.
The authorities agree that corporate revitalization is at the center of the
economic component of this task. It appears to be key to prospects for exports, investment,
and domestic savings. Accordingly, given progress on the fiscal and monetary sides that has
already been secured, discussions focused on how to reconcile some divergence of
perspective on how to strengthen companies, how to calibrate labor market and fiscal
initiatives in support of this endeavor, and how to strengthen economic institutions in
anticipation of the OHR’s exit.

A. External Sustainability and Macro Outlook in 2004

medium term, significant adjustments are needed. Staff and the central bank (CBBH)

correction was evident, particularly given aid flows (budget support grants, capital grants for
reconstruction, and loan disbursements) set to decline from 4 towards 1 percent of GDP
within five years, and risks of volatility in transfers, remittances and refugee repatriation of
capital, in response to policy slippages or other political and economic shocks.

“reform” scenario, this adjustment would likely have to be led by corporate savings—
increased profitability borne of radical corporate restructuring. The authorities noted that
since the need for new corporate and public fixed investment was so obvious and large, these
projections could understate the needed adjustment in domestic savings. And they argued
that economic growth would stop altogether—a “status quo” scenario—without structural
reforms strong enough to generate this adjustment. Staff concurred (Annex I).
11.
The immediate outlook in 2004 was encouraging, but significant risks remained.
The authorities rely almost completely on staff macroeconomic projections and in that
context, they agreed that a recovery in agriculture from the 2003 drought, alongside a pickup
in international markets, would boost activity and the external current account balance—
taking the former to some 5 percent and the latter to 15 percent of GDP in the context of
anticipated strong fiscal policies. Inflation would remain low, anchored by the currency
board. But risks around this baseline were not trivial. Bank credit growth, while
decelerating, was still strong and could put pressure on the external current account
(particularly in a context in which bank access to external credit was improving). More
generally staff noted the significant imbalances and political fragilities, which raised the
vulnerability to external shocks. Finally, enterprise restructuring, once initiated in earnest,
could involve short term downside risks for growth and employment. On the other hand, over
the medium term enterprise restructuring was critical if the recent momentum towards
external correction was not to be lost.
B. Corporate Restructuring
12.
At present, corporate lossmaking is a central counterpart to the external
imbalance. The authorities noted that many former-Yugoslav conglomerates were essentially
dismembered during the 1992–95 conflict. Eight years on, new corporate governance
structures—control of SOEs by newly established government ministries and, for those
privatized through vouchers, new mutual funds (PIFs)—have proven inadequate to meet the
challenge. Furthermore, staff observed that in the absence of a bankruptcy threat, many SOE
and voucher-privatized firms essentially face cash rather than profits constraints. With banks
shunning such companies, their credit limits are essentially defined by scope for arrears
accumulation on taxes, inter-company credits, and wages—hence the evidence of persistent
heavy corporate loss-making on an accruals basis, and muted expansion of bank credit to
enterprises. Only the pure (not privatized) private sector and the grey economy seem to be
required to pay an adequate return on equity.
13.
•

Four initiatives to correct these difficulties are underway:
The governance of SOEs is being strengthened. In 2002, the OHR prohibited mass
replacement of SOE management that typically followed national elections, thereby
preventing a further round of managerial instability. But parent ministries still lack the
capacity for effective supervision. Limits on wage bills of individual or groups of
enterprises have not been considered as supervisory tools, but the authorities considered

- 10 -

that the necessary collection of cash and accruals wage data may be feasible only in
flagship SOEs. This puts a premium on privatization.
•

Privatization has restarted. But the authorities’ ambitions confront foreign investor
aversion to the Balkans, public perception that past sales have failed or been corrupt,
capacity constraints in the privatization agencies, and the challenge of selling insolvent
enterprises—given accumulated arrears and the absence of bankruptcy procedures. Staff
welcomed the renewed privatization drive under the authorities’ Action Plan which has
resulted in ten tender issues in 2003 and establishment of working groups to determine
medium-term privatization strategy. But they underscored need to strengthen
privatization agencies and advised against proposals to promote sales by indiscriminate
relief of tax arrears for indebted SOEs. Instead, pending effective bankruptcy procedures,
case-by-case out-of-court voluntary debt restructuring by all creditor groups, backed by a
government threat to liquidate SOEs whose creditors refused to cooperate, would be
more cost effective and more likely to lead to sales.

•

The governance of voucher-privatized firms is under review. The authorities noted
that ownership in such firms is highly dispersed and the 22 PIFs are undercapitalized and
ineffective. But progress is impeded by a rule preventing accumulation of any stake in a
PIF larger than 5 percent, and further rules preventing PIFs from holding more than
10 percent of their portfolio in one firm or, in the Federation, more than 30 percent of a
firm’s stock. As these rules prevent PIFs from providing effective corporate governance,
the authorities are reviewing them. Alongside, the two Entity stock markets will be
strengthened to facilitate transactions, sales of remaining government stakes will be
aimed to encourage concentration of ownership, and, in the RS, further takeovers will be
encouraged under recent legislation. Staff welcomed these initiatives and intentions to
better inform shareholders of their rights.

•

And a more business friendly environment is being established. While commercial
legislation is broadly EU-consistent, the authorities acknowledged that implementation
was weak; in particular, the new commercial courts would only begin operations in 2004,
becoming fully proficient only some years later. Staff welcomed initiatives to establish a
collateral registry and to lower business registration and regulatory burdens—the latter
under the “Bulldozer” initiative.
C. Labor Markets

14.
Corporate weaknesses are coupled with labor market rigidities. Though firms,
including SOEs are free to opt out of collective agreements—which set a myriad of floors on
wage rates and define employment terms and conditions—social pressures often prevent
them from doing so. In part, these pressures succeed because if firms cannot pay the agreed
wage rates, employees strongly prefer cuts in cash wage payments to cuts in accrued wage
rates—in their view, this protects jobs; and back pay may be settled if the company recovers,
by a new investor, or failing those, by the government. But, staff noted, this generates
mounting enterprise indebtedness—impeding reorganization and sale—and it weakens

- 11 -

market discipline in the determination of nominal accrued wage levels. And therefore,
although these practices render aggregate cash wage rates flexible—and more flexible than
accrued wage rates—this is an expensive form of flexibility.
15.

Collective agreements cause three further difficulties:
•

Wage arrears must be settled before a worker may be released. Though this follows
EU norms, the authorities agreed that this impedes firms’ ability to restructure, given
the stock of wage arrears.

•

IBRD research shows that the wage structure disproportionately rewards age and
years of service, and that employee turnover is exceptionally low, both signs of deep
sclerosis.

•

And the Federation applies a “feedback loop” in nominal wage setting because wage
floors in the collective agreements are indexed monthly to average wages.

16.
All this had led to increasing wage pressures, jeopardizing the prospects for
sustainable export-led growth. Staff emphasized concern that nonbudget cash wages were
rising rapidly in 2003 at the expense of employment and cash profits—the latter in the
Federation (Text Table 5).

collected—and the confusing role of multiple reconstruction and transition shocks. Further,
they noted that wage arrears were concentrated in no-hoper SOEs and that private (not
privatized) companies typically remunerate well above the floors set in collective
agreements. Staff concurred that further work was needed to evaluate the actual level of
wages and competitiveness, and hence the required depth of enterprise restructuring. But
high unemployment, deceleration of activity, and the external current account deficit together
suggested that the problems should not be underestimated (Box 3).
17.
Accordingly, staff urged reforms: accrued wage rates need to decline at least to
levels of cash wage payments; settlement of wage arrears might be better handled through
bankruptcy than severance procedures; the Federation wage feedback loop should be
abolished; and consideration should be given to switch to a firm-level system of wage
bargaining, perhaps with a single low minimum wage with allowance for labor market
entrants. The authorities noted likely strong social resistance to all these ideas, especially the
first. But the RS authorities observed that their plans to switch during 2004 from the current
wage system for the budget to a “statutory” system common in other countries, alongside
significant retrenchment of workers, could set a useful precedent for SOEs to follow in
reforming wage setting arrangements.
18.
Gaps in the social safety net also need to be addressed. Unemployment and
pension schemes cover basic needs. But many workers have lost eligibility for these through
their employers’ default on contributions. Staff emphasized that these concerns have to be
addressed within budget parameters.
D. Fiscal Policy in 2004 and the Medium Term
19.
Fiscal policy needs to reflect the scarcity of domestic savings. The authorities’
medium-term projections show maintenance of a primary surplus of some 1 percent of GDP
over the medium term—in support of the current account correction (Table 5). Furthermore,
plans were announced in December to restructure domestic claims so as to secure fiscal
sustainability—by lowering all the government’s obligations to 10 percent of GDP in NPV
terms, leaving government debt on a sustainable path, consistent with the targeted primary
surplus (Annex I, Table 6a–6b). These targets match projections in staff’s “reform scenario”
(Text Table 6 above). But in light of the many uncertainties, notably concerning capital
inflows in the balance of payments and the path for domestic private savings, staff
underscored that the authorities should stand ready to tighten their fiscal stance further, if
necessary, and should implement the domestic claims plans without delay.

21.
The authorities noted that the RS budget was less restrictive than those for the
Federation and State. The latter anticipated a broadly unchanged stance compared with
2003, consistent with the target consolidated primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP. But
symptomatic of capacity constraints, technical errors appeared in the documents submitted to
the assembly, and consequently the RS approved budget anticipated a loosening of some
1/3 of a percentage point of BiH GDP. Accordingly the RS authorities committed to lower

- 14 -

spending by that amount through the execution of spending authorizations during 2004,
unless revenue exceeds projections (¶27). Staff welcomed this correction.
22.

Further ahead, fiscal restructuring is in prospect.
•

The authorities hope to lower tax rates and the share of tax in GDP while meeting
demands for spending by promoting economic growth and combating tax evasion.
Staff noted that with government revenue and spending at 47 percent of GDP,
spending should also be better targeted, notably in the case of war veterans and the
wage bill, allowing a shift in spending to investment and operations, alongside
reductions in tax rates and the tax burden. Staff regretted that opportunities for
reductions in tax rates, notably for labor, in 2004 had been overwhelmed by pressure
for spending, and called for renewed effort along these lines.

•

With the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) law enacted, preparations for the VAT will
accelerate. Staff proposed VAT introduction by mid-2005, a date the authorities
regarded as optimistic. But they agreed that consensus on a precise revenue allocation
formula for ITA collections and on the relationship between the ITA and the sales tax
administrations was needed soon.7

•

Reductions in effective customs tariff rates—which average some 8 percent with the
highest tariff rate at 15 percent (excluding agriculture)—will continue as Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs), mostly with FRY countries, go into effect in 2004. Staff
regretted BiH’s recent unilateral three-month postponement of their full
implementation due to producers’ concerns, noting that this could complicate other
trade negotiations and aspirations to secure accession to the WTO in 2004. Further
ahead, the abolition of tariffs on EU imports before accession should be anticipated,
perhaps by adoption of a multi-year phased reduction in rates, supporting industrial
restructuring and allowing anticipation of revenue losses. 8

•

Following special audits of electricity utilities in 2003, corrective actions, mainly in
respect of internal reporting and transparency, will be implemented in consultation
with the IBRD.

23.
If the broader structural and fiscal reform agendas are to be implemented, fiscal
coordination needs to be strengthened. The authorities acknowledged the lack of
frameworks to target, allocate, enforce, and monitor realization of the consolidated fiscal

7

Ibid., Chapter 5.

- 15 -

balance of BiH, as well as lack of adequate analysis of current macroeconomic
developments. These gaps ultimately compromise fiscal support for the currency board.9
24.
The ITA board could take on some of these tasks. The authorities agreed that as
the sole institution where the three key fiscal representatives would meet and coordinate
regularly on indirect tax matters, the ITA board constituted a natural forum for broader fiscal
coordination. Staff noted particular need for a mechanism to decompose annual targets for
the consolidated BiH fiscal balance into its State and Entity components and for a rule to
determine annual Entity obligations to the State so as to avoid the protracted annual ad hoc
negotiations on this and facilitate medium term fiscal planning. While the former could prove
technically challenging, the latter could be resolved simply and could operate from the 2005
budget.
25.
Implementation of agreed consolidated fiscal targets would require continued
strong control over borrowing by sub-entity levels of government. Staff accordingly
endorsed the authorities’ intentions to retain strict borrowing rules for local governments and
extrabudgetary funds, while noting that there was also scope for some relaxation in the rules
at Entity central government level starting in 2004 to allow bridging finance.
E. Statistics
26.
Economic analysis necessary to support effective policy coordination would
require enhanced statistics. There has been no population census, there is no demand-side
decomposition of GDP, CPI weights date back to 1987, balance of payments data are highly
uncertain, no current consolidated BiH fiscal data are collected, and labor market data are
suspect. The two entity agencies act independently and the state level institution lacks
resources for coordination. The authorities noted that unification of the agencies was under
discussion, a director for the State statistics institution was being recruited, and household
and FDI surveys were underway. Staff welcomed these steps but underscored the centrality
of better macroeconomic statistics to aspirations for better design of macroeconomic policies.
F. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Issues
27.
The authorities noted that the credibility of the currency board had been firmly
established. The reforms to reserve requirements from mid-2003 and the installation of the
new CBBH board in August had proceeded smoothly, inflation was low, international
reserves were strong, the banking sector had been successfully privatized, depositor
confidence in it was reflected in booming deposit growth, and leading BiH banks had begun
to obtain access to international capital markets. Further, the commitment of the governments
to the currency board arrangement was unequivocal. Staff welcomed these successes, but
underscored that decisive corporate reform would be essential to maintain them.
9

- 16 -

28.
Rapid credit growth in 2003 had begun to be addressed (¶14–17). The credit
boom which followed the surge in bank deposits since 2001 has eased somewhat, in the wake
of the mid-2003 monetary and regulatory tightening. These were the first discretionary policy
actions the central bank and regulators had taken which had been stimulated, at least in part,
by macroeconomic concerns. The authorities were satisfied with the results as signaled by the
banks’ compliance and the credit slowdown, but staff noted that the deceleration was modest
and that the associated pressure on the current account deficit remained significant. But to
stem pressure on the central bank’s income, the rate of remuneration of excess reserves was
lowered again from end-December. Staff noted that credit creation would eventually slow as
the main sources of funding for credit—increases in the money multiplier and declining
NFA—both had “natural”, albeit as yet unknown, ceilings, and that banks were concerned
that creditworthy borrowers were increasingly hard to find (Table 2a). But in the meantime,
staff welcomed the corrective steps taken during 2003. They also noted that the regulatory
reforms were raising banks’ demand for excess central bank deposits, stemming the growth
of credit and therefore diminishing need for generous remuneration of excess balances.
Nevertheless, international reserves could fall if banks unwound excess holdings with the
central bank and credit growth remained a concern. Accordingly, staff emphasized that the
bank should maintain close surveillance on the pace of credit growth and stand ready to make
further adjustments in its instrument settings—including to the rate of reserve
requirements—as needed.
29.

Various initiatives to strengthen central bank operations were under review.
•

The CBBH intends to review its instrument settings more often. Staff noted that this
would mark a change from the policy automaticity and would require clear public
explanations and increased research capacity. The bank had no plans to issue central
bank bonds given concerns to preserve its income.

•

The CBBH might take on a lender of last resort function within the currency board
arrangement. Staff noted that this function was already partly played by the parents of
foreign-owned banks, and therefore suggested that other initiatives might warrant
higher priority.

•

If the Entity authorities concur, the monetary authorities hope to take responsibility
for banking supervision in 2005 given the increasing integration of the banking
market and the need for to secure the coordination and independence of supervision.
Staff noted that international experience showed that this could work, but cautioned
that supervision should not weaken during any institutional transition.

consolidation
reducing risks
from remaining smaller banks, and banks minimizing exposure to weaker corporate
borrowers, banking risks appeared to be under appropriate control. Anti-moneylaundering
regulations and reporting requirements met international standards and were being enforced.
Regulators’ key concern—shared by staff—was that banks could not be insulated from
broader economic difficulties, perhaps indirectly through bank exposure to households, and
that immunity of supervisors from prosecution for the good faith conduct of their tasks was
insecure. Staff also cautioned that rapid credit growth to households in the uncertain legal
environment could presage loan losses, but regulators saw little evidence from loan servicing
behavior to date to validate these concerns.
31.
The authorities regarded continuation of the currency board as essential. Though
BiH’s diversified trade orientation and coming structural adjustments might, in other
circumstances, warrant a more flexible monetary and exchange rate regime, the authorities
considered that a case that the exchange rate was uncompetitive was not persuasive, that a
change to the regime or the peg would compound difficulties in securing necessary corporate
restructuring, and, in the absence of structural reforms, it would simply cause inflation.
G. Relations with the Fund
32.
The two Stand-By Arrangements realized their core goals. In accord with
Directors’ surveillance recommendations, the first aimed to establish the central bank and
support reconstruction, while the second focused on fiscal consolidation, harmonization of
indirect taxes, and sustainability through the restructuring of claims on government. The
credit boom of 2003 had not been anticipated, but corrective actions were taken. Both SBAs
had been extended––the first by two years and the second by four months––reflecting

- 18 -

implementation difficulties. The domestic claims plan provides for settlement of nonresident
claims for frozen foreign accounts. In this context, staff will encourage the authorities to
accept the obligations of Article VIII; section 2, 3, and 4. The authorities seek a successor
extended arrangement on the basis of their record and in support of the structural reform
agenda ahead. While noting that the request would be considered, staff pointed out that BiH
would become a prolonged user of Fund resources by the end of such an arrangement and
that assurance would be needed that implementation difficulties in the past would not recur.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
To say that Bosnia and Herzegovina has come a long way but has much further
to go considerably understates the case. The economic disaster evident in 1995 is already a
distant memory, with output, exports, incomes, and international reserves much increased,
refugees returning in numbers, and inflation down to industrial country levels. But the postconflict boom is largely over, and macroeconomic imbalances are—if data are to be even
half-believed—stark: the external deficit, corporate lossmaking, and unemployment are high
and severely constrain the prospects for sustainable growth. This is an agenda to challenge
any country, let alone one with such fractured decision-making institutions which faces a
fundamental political transition––the OHR’s prospective exit. And while much has been
achieved, policy slippages and implementation delays have persisted.
34.
The core and most urgent economic task is corporate restructuring. This is
critical to boost competitiveness, domestic savings, and private investment, which are
currently insufficient to maintain a high growth rate over the medium term. The authorities’
intentions to strengthen control over SOEs and to reinvigorate privatization should now be
transformed into specific steps and implemented boldly. But quick-fixes will not help,
notably concerning over-indebtedness of SOEs and eligibility for social safety net benefits:
though sales can barely proceed with these debts and gaps in benefit eligibility must be filled,
indiscriminate write off of tax arrears and blanket extension of benefit rights are not the
answer. Instead, while the legal system is developed to handle bankruptcy, voluntary debt
workouts involving all creditor groups and a conditional and limited, well-costed extension
of benefit eligibility are more promising—albeit slower—approaches. Alongside, regulations
governing mutual funds need to be refocused to strengthen corporate governance and
initiatives underway to curb the regulatory, legal, and tax impediments to business need to be
deepened.
35.
Labor market institutions need to be transformed alongside. Wage arrears should
be resolved through bankruptcy rather than severance mechanisms, the formal wage feedback
loop in the Federation should be abolished, and a shift to free firm-level bargaining could
remove key distortions. These reforms, along with those focused on corporate governance,
herald replacement of credit with profit constraints in corporates, alignment of accrued and
paid wage rates, an end to the culture of nonpayment, and clearance of labor market sclerosis.
They will also help to moderate wage growth, and engender a better balance between wage
and employment growth outside the budget.

- 19 -

36.
Fiscal support for these endeavors will be key. Given the scarcity of domestic
savings, the first fiscal task is to avoid drawing on them—hence the authorities’ commitment
to maintain the strong fiscal balance already established is appropriate. In this context,
initiatives to strengthen tax administration—including steps towards a VAT—are welcome,
while determination to contain spending pressures will need to be strengthened. Second, as
an essential ingredient to encouraging fixed investment, fiscal sustainability must be assured.
Thus, the authorities’ path-breaking plans to restructure domestic claims on government are
critical and should be implemented without delay. They also open the way for accession to
Article VIII status, which is encouraged. And third, fiscal policy should aim to reduce the
burden of taxation, particularly on labor, and to raise public investment, requiring curbs in
current spending. To this end, and to facilitate wage moderation in the private sector, a more
cautious increase in the wage bill of the RS would have been preferred in 2004. It is now
essential that the RS plans to restructure budget employment and remuneration in 2004 are
executed well within the wage bill ceiling and that other mooted restructuring of current
spending is accelerated.
37.
The fiscal and structural reform agenda will require strengthened fiscal
institutions and macroeconomic data. The authorities are encouraged to implement their
intentions to develop the ITA board for this purpose. But if this fiscal coordination is to
work, profound statistical deficiencies will need––finally––to be corrected. And preparations
to determine permanent arrangement for annual financing for the State for administrative
transfers and to adjust the revenue allocation arrangements within the Federation should
commence soon.
38.
All this is necessary to support the currency board in a sustainable growth
environment. Consolidation of this institution has been impressive, including the smooth
transition to the new Central Bank Board last August. It remains the appropriate monetary
and exchange rate framework for BiH. CBBH plans to shift to more frequent review of its
instrument settings will require transparency and strengthened research. And aspirations to
incorporate banking supervision into the Bank have merit, but should not occur at the
expense of the quality of regulation during the transition.
39.
Given prospects in 2004 for further external correction and pickup in growth,
financial policies are well calibrated:
•

The authorities appropriately anticipate a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP in
2004, consistent with fiscal sustainability, but need for a further tightening in 2004
and beyond cannot be ruled out in the highly uncertain and opaque environment, and
implementation risks in three major spending reforms––defense, the wage bill, and
state level functions––will require close monitoring. In this context, the unilateral
decision to delay, even briefly, full implementation of agreed regional FTAs is
regrettable, posing needless risks to the WTO accession process.

•

The recent reduction in the rate of remuneration on excess reserves while leaving the
rate of required reserves unchanged appropriately balances the risks. Looking ahead,

- 20 -

policy should aim to maintain downward pressure on bank credit growth given
external and prudential concerns.
•

Progress to phase in bank forex exposure and liquidity regulations has been good and
should be continued, and the core capital in the system has been appropriately
strengthened. But uncertainties in the legal immunity of regulators should be
resolved, and risks that the recent rapid credit growth could presage debt servicing
difficulties should be kept under close review.

40.
This sweeping agenda will tax implementation and absorptive capacity to its
limits, requiring deft and determined handling. But the timing is right: reform momentum
is established; national elections are next due in three years; and frictions between the
Entities, which have so impeded policy implementation in the past, are in decline. It will be
difficult, but it can be done.
41.
Notwithstanding progress under the SBA, any successor arrangement would be
contingent on the strength of the authorities’ commitment to confront the structural
challenges ahead.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with BiH be held on the
standard 12-month cycle, subject to the applicable Executive Board decision on Article IV
consultation cycle.

ANNEX I

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
This appendix reviews indicators of public debt sustainability in Bosnia and
Herzegovina under the staff’s baseline scenario and discusses macroeconomic and debt
indicators under an alternative “no policy change” scenario.10 It presents the staff’s
baseline scenario for general government debt in percent of GDP, average interest rates and
access to new credit for the period through 2009, and alternative scenarios based on shocks to
various key macroeconomic variables. The shocks are expressed as temporary deviations
from the baseline, and are defined relative to historical averages for the period 1999-2003,
without considering dynamic feedbacks.
2.
BiH’s general government debt relative to GDP has been brought down
substantially during the past five years. This was in part related to the regularization and
cancellation of old debts denominated in non-convertible currencies. However, real GDP
growth rates averaging 5½ percent and a major improvement in the primary deficit have also
helped to reduce the debt to GDP ratio from 66 percent in 1999 to 34 percent at end-2003.
3.
At the end of 2003, virtually all of BiH’s external debt was public debt and
almost all public debt was denominated in foreign currency. General government debt to
the banking system, which is denominated in domestic currency, amounted to ¼ percent of
GDP. Moreover, as a result of creditworthiness problems, private external debt is also very
limited.
4.
The debt-servicing burden of BiH’s external debt is manageable. The
rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club and London Club groups of creditors in 19981999 substantially reduced the burden of the relevant debts. Moreover, BiH has received
concessional loans from the World Bank and more than half of total debt is owed to the
World Bank. In 2003, interest and amortization payments amounted to 0.7 and 1.4 percent of
GDP, respectively.
5.
BiH’s current and projected indebtedness is comfortable, even in the face of the
common array of shocks (Table 6a). This fundamentally reflects that economic growth is
projected well above real interest rates and because the primary fiscal balance is projected to
remain firm through 2008. Taking into account the concessionality of much of BiH’s debt,
this suggests that BiH has capacity to settle at least some of the vast amount of domestic
claims without compromising medium-term sustainability.
6.
A second more focused framework, which abstracts from “particular” features
of the Bosnian economy currently, indicates that recognition of claims worth 10 percent
of GDP in NPV terms can be sustainable. This framework operates in NPV terms. On
latest estimates, the NPV of BiH’s public external debt is about 26 percent of GDP, given
10

ANNEX I

that much of it is on concessional terms. In this context, if real interest rates are assumed at
2 percentage points higher than real growth, the debt ratio is on a declining path with a
primary balance of 1 percent of GDP, the 2003 outturn (base case scenario in the Text
Table)11 This exercise therefore confirms the finding of the standardized debt sustainability
analysis, that there is scope for a debt settlement. The question faced by the authorities was
how much more debt could be recognized before risks become significant. In scenario (a)

assumptions and considers recognition of 10 percent of 2003 GDP in new debt. Here debt
ratios are on a declining trend, falling to 33 percent of GDP in 2010.
7.
The authorities decided to limit the total cost of the plan to settle the vast
amount of domestic claims on government to 10 percent of 2003 GDP in NPV terms.
Current plans call for the settled of claims in cash (4 percent of GDP) to be paid out over a
number of years, and in very long term bonds (6 percent of 2003 GDP in NPV terms). It is
envisaged that four categories of bonds will be issued with a combined face value of about
28.5 percent of 2003 GDP, and a weighted average maturity and grace period of 36 and 26
years, respectively. To keep their NPV down, the bonds will pay no or very low interest. The

11

In the very long run, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s external debt will be rolled over into debt
instruments with a market-based interest rate and real growth will have converged to
industrial country levels.
12

The riskiness of this strategy is confirmed by the finding, reported in the recent WEO, that
emerging market economies whose public debts exceed 50 percent of GDP face a high risk
of economic crisis and that the sustainable public debt level for a typical emrging market
economy may only be about 25 percent of GDP (See “Public Debt in Emerging Markets: Is it
Too High?”, Chapter III in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook of September 2003)

- 23 -

ANNEX I

final modalities of the plan to settle domestic claims will be decided upon full verification of
all claims, while adhering to the 10 percent of 2003 GDP limit for the total costs of the plan.
8.
The conclusions from the debt sustainability analysis as presented in Tables 6a
are not affected by the implementation of the domestic debt plan. The face value of the
outstanding stock of public debt will increase (Table 6b). However, given the envisaged long
grace period of the bonds and the fact that the new debt will be denominated in domestic
currency, the implementation of the domestic debt plan will not increase BiH’s vulnerability
to shocks over the medium term.
9.
The steady worsening of the public debt ratio under a “no policy change”
scenario highlights the risks associated with possible delays in implementing the
reforms of the corporate sector and the labor market outlined in the main text of the
report. The projected course of key macroeconomic variables in the absence of necessary
reforms is summarized in Table 6c. The expansion of exports, required to sustain overall
growth in the economy, would come to a halt. Compared to the baseline scenario, this would
give rise to permanent output losses and a commensurately smaller tax base. As a result,
government revenues will be insufficient to satisfy the demands for additional public
spending. Given that the government has no recourse to borrowing from the central bank,
new domestic spending arrears will be accumulated, adding to the outstanding stock of
domestic debt and exacerbating vulnerabilities to external and domestic shocks.

Herzegovina (CBBH) was subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By
Arrangement which was approved on August 2, 2002. A safeguards assessment of the
CBBH was completed on October 28, 2002. The assessment identified certain weaknesses
and made appropriate recommendations, as reported in Country Report No. 03/4. According to
information obtained from the authorities, all of the recommendations have been
successfully implemented.

APPENDIX I

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on
August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament approved an amendment to the
CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro, under a currency board
arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro. Small denominations of
KM notes have been in circulation since June 22, 1998; large denominations and coins were
introduced in August 1998, and December 1998, respectively. The convertible marka (KM) is
the currency used for operations and transactions with the Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions resulting from measures taken with respect to frozen foreign currency
deposits as identified in Country Report No. 02/52.
IX.

Last Article IV Consultation
Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the twenty-four month cycle, subject to the provisions of the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on February 25, 2002.

APPENDIX II

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: IMF–WORLD BANK RELATIONS

Partnership in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Development Strategy
BiH’s Development Agenda

1.
The authorities of BiH recognize the importance of maintaining satisfactory
macroeconomic performance while accelerating structural reforms. As demonstrated through the
PRSP preparation process, Government has embarked on reforms to address several key
economic challenges, including: (i) creating a predictable and coherent investment environment
within a single economic space; (ii) promoting private sector activity within an improved
business environment; and (iii) strengthening governance whilst combating corruption.
2.
Submitted to the World Bank and the IMF in December 2001 for information, not linked
to any Bank or IMF operation, Government’s I-PRSP emphasized the development of an
entrepreneurial society within a single economic space while combating corruption and
strengthening governance. As with the I-PRSP, the major focus of the ongoing full PRSP
preparation process is the economy’s heavy reliance on foreign assistance, high formal
unemployment and the low level of domestic production. It further emphasizes corruption
problems across many sectors and the poor quality of public services. The strategy also points to
greater cooperation between the Entities if progress is to be made on expanding the economy and
integrating BiH’s political and economic structures into a wider Europe. The central theme of the
strategy is that poverty can only be effectively combated through greatly expanded private sector
activity.
3.
BiH’s recently completed poverty profile, developed on the basis of the recently
completed Living Standards Measurement Study, confirms the importance of generating new
private sector jobs to poverty alleviation and improving employment prospects for the young and
secondary household earners; but also points to the need to raise wages among the working poor
and general skills levels in the workforce, while protecting children and households headed by
inactive adults. As a result, the upcoming PRSP is expected to address issues covering the
effective implementation of pension and health reform, the reorientation of the social safety net
to protect children and the non-pensioned elderly, a strengthened education system and improved
productivity in the productive sectors.
4.
The Coordination Board for Economic Transition and EU Association, charged with
overseeing the preparation of the PRSP - following finalization of the second draft of the PRSP
in June 2003 – in July 2003 adopted an action plan of priority actions in the areas of fiscal
reform, public debt management, business environment, financial sector, labor market, public
administration reform, statistics and EU integration. This action plan complements that of a plan
adopted in 2002, mainly focused on improving the business environment.
5.
Mindful that perceptions of widespread corruption not only discourage sound investment
but constitute a serious problem for the most vulnerable in society, the Coordination Board
earlier also adopted in 2002 a comprehensive anti-corruption action plan. The plan covers: (i)

- 54 -

APPENDIX II

legislative improvements; (ii) institutional strengthening activities; and, (iii) educative activities.
The plan is under implementation with notable achievements having been made in improved tax
and customs collections.
6.
Some steps have also been taken recently to further strengthen key BiH State institutions
and activities. This in large part has been undertaken in the context of the SAP with the European
Union. A State Border Service has been operational for some time as has a Communications
Regulatory Authority (CRA). Legislation has also been passed which provides for a State deposit
insurance agency and a State body to regulate energy transmission. In addition, the State has
played an aggressive role to liberalize external trade and open up regional markets. Trade
agreements have been signed with Slovenia, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro
and Turkey and are under negotiation with Albania, Bulgaria and Romania, while WTO
membership is being actively pursued.
7.
The second draft of the PRSP also stresses the importance of comprehensive public
administration reform to reduce the size of government in the face of declining external
assistance, the sustainability of the social protection system and the need to strengthen human
capital by reinforcing family and community life and improving education and health services.
Government has been advised that follow-through is necessary, however, to successfully deepen
policy reform in these areas, particularly as concerns the determination of the best administrative
structure for BiH consistent with both the Dayton Peace Agreements and a country aspiring to
become a member of the EU.
The Bank and the IMF concluded in their joint letter to Government that BiH’s
8.
I-PRSP provided a satisfactory initial framework to help spearhead the country’s transition to a
self-sustaining economy, and to fight poverty. However, Government was urged to provide
greater clarity on strategic priorities and modalities for the implementation of policy reforms
against a hard budget constraint. In this regard, the authorities are paying special attention to
integrating the policies and priorities being developed under the PRSP into medium term
expenditure frameworks of State and Entity governments.
9.
Preparation of the full PRSP started in early 2002. After extensive consultation across
both Entities the authorities completed the first draft of their full PRSP in November 2002,
presenting it to stakeholders for review. This draft document formed the basis of a further round
of consultations under the auspices of the newly formed governments following the October
2002 elections and the second draft was completed in June, 2003. The PRSP is now expected to
be finalized in January of 2004. This represents a delay to their original schedule as Government
wished to incorporate some of the elements of the European Commission’s Feasibility Study in
the stabilization and association process, into the finalized PRSP. The Feasibility Study was
completed in the last quarter of 2003.
10.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting BiH in maintaining macroeconomic stability and
ensuring fiscal sustainability. A new one year Stand-by-Arrangement (SBA) was approved by
the IMF’s Board of Directors in August 2002 and is scheduled to expire in November 2003. The
SBA appeared to be on track to successful completion until the RS Prime Minister in November

- 55 -

APPENDIX II

2003 announced wage increases that could have resulted in a 17% increase in the wage bill.
Fund discussions with the BiH and RS authorities are ongoing which could result in this increase
being revisited, while a once-off payment is made to settle wage arrears. The SBA was extended
a second time from end of December 2003 through February 2004 to allow for completion of the
fourth and final review. As a matter of priority, structural conditionality has focused on issues
related to short term fiscal consolidation.
11.
The World Bank has taken the lead in policy dialogue on structural and institutional
reforms in several select sectors. Bank assistance focuses on assisting the authorities: (i) reach
agreement on a medium-term strategy for further public finance reform, which reduces the size
of the public sector, ensures minimum capacities and competencies are developed at the State
level for effective policy formulation and execution, and promotes the efficient delivery of
services at the local level; (ii) follow through on their ongoing efforts to create an investorfriendly economy that promotes SME development; (iii) complete long delayed reforms to the
social safety net, to ensure that scarce public resources are used efficiently to protect the most
vulnerable in society. Specific assistance has been designed to support BiH in the finalization of
its PRSP.
12.
Progress is being made especially in areas (i) and (ii) above. A US $44 million Business
Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC) was approved by the World Bank in May 2002. The third
and final tranche of the Second Public Finance Adjustment Credit (PFSAC II) was disbursed in
November 2002. A Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) was completed in May
2002. These instruments were key elements of the Bank’s program as outlined in the full, June
2000, Country Assistance Strategy.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas

13.
The IMF and the World Bank maintain a close collaborative relationship in supporting
the Government’s structural reforms. The IMF focuses on fiscal sustainability, monetary policy
and bank supervision, while the Bank Group focuses increasingly on structural issues related to
private sector development, strengthening governance and institution building. Effective
collaboration between the Bretton Woods organizations will continue to be important in assisting
BiH implement the PRSP.
Strengthening Institutions and Governance

14.
Fiscal stabilization efforts over the past two years led to a dramatic reduction in the
budgetary gap, which was reduced from over 9 percent of GDP in 1999 to less than 2 and a half
percent at the end of 2003, and net arrears accumulation slowed dramatically largely as a result
of initial reforms in the pension system. Nevertheless, with public spending at 55 percent of
GDP, the size of government is not sustainable in the context of BiH’s future resource
availability. Further fiscal consolidation of GDP is expected through a combination of measures
supported in the near term by the ongoing SBA. Medium term fiscal consolidation will be taken
up in new Bank operations targeted at: (i) rationalizing and improving the efficiency of public

- 56 -

APPENDIX II

expenditure in the current multi-layered and fragmented governance structure; (ii) reducing the
proportion of public expenditure spent on wages and salaries–by restricting overall recruitment
and compensation in the context of a broader public administration reform agenda; (iii) limiting
extensive and generous veterans’ entitlements; (iv) reducing expenditures in the defense and
public order and safety sectors (over and above the reductions already achieved in 2001); and (v)
significantly increasing the efficiency of expenditures in the education, health and social welfare
sectors.
15.
Recent Bank sponsored reviews are now helping BiH in defining these medium term
policy directions. The PEIR (FY02) entitled From Aid Dependency to Fiscal Self Reliance pays
particular attention to: (i) fiscal policy and expenditure challenges if growth and stability are to
be assured in the medium term; (ii) inter-government relationships from municipalities up to
State government; (iii) fiscal balance between these various levels of public administration; (iv)
financial management and public procurement capabilities; and (v) social service spending–
particularly in the areas of social welfare, education and health. The PEIR is the capstone study
to the subsidiary and self standing Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) (FY02),
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) (FY03); and a local government finance
study entitled Creating a Stable Decentralized Fiscal System (FY03).
16.
The PEIR emphasizes that: (a) while notable achievements have been made in improving
the performance of certain public institutions, fragmented governance structures with ill-defined
goals, hamper nation building and efficiency benefits from decentralization. The costs, both
economic and social are substantial because fragmentation hinders the efficient use of public
resources; and (b) in order to achieve more coherent and harmonized policy formulation and
implementation, the State’s role as an integrative force needs to be strengthened, while
rationalizing the public sector’s overall role in the economy. In government’s efforts to
rationalize public expenditures while enhancing the delivery of services, the authorities plan to
seek Bank adjustment support in an Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit
(EMSAC, FY04). Preparation of the program which this Credit supports is well advanced and has
taken place in close collaboration with the IMF. Nevertheless, the recent RS government
decision to raise wages, resulting in an overall increase in the wage bill in 2004, has significantly
compromised the program supported by EMSAC. The program is being refocused and
redimensioned to take this into account.
17.
Support is ongoing to: (i) facilitate BiH’s efforts to reduce military expenditures through
a Pilot Labor Redeployment Project (FY00); (ii) strengthen local government through a Local
Development Project (FY00) and the Mostar Water Project (FY00); (iii) strengthen public
management of the power sector, providing for a State regulator for the transmission of
electricity under a Power III Project (FY01); and (iv) improve trade and transport infrastructure
and services through a Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (FY01) and a Road
Management and Safety Project (FY02).

- 57 -

APPENDIX II

Fostering Private Sector-Led Growth

18. Accelerating restructuring reforms remains the central challenge to BiH becoming a selfsustaining economy. Current projections call for a redoubling of reform efforts in order to
achieve financial sustainability by the end of the decade. Moreover, even though significant
fiscal consolidation has recently been achieved, a substantial reduction in the public sector is
still required if BiH is to remain on the sustainable fiscal path. For its part, the Bank has
followed through with detailed discussions with Government on the recommendations set forth
in the PEIR.
19.
The World Bank closely coordinates with the IMF through discussions on issues of
private sector development. Most notably, collaborative efforts have focused on ensuring that
bankruptcy laws are modernized. With initial rounds of labor market and banking reform
completed (supported by two recently closed IDA adjustment credits), such collaboration proved
integral to the successful implementation of Bank assistance over the short term period. During
the period July 2002 to December 2004, the Bank will focus on helping the authorities follow
through on the remaining three elements of their strategy for private sector development: (i)
privatization; (ii) improving the business enabling environment; and (iii) SME development.
20.
Given that SME and voucher privatization in non-strategic industries has largely been
completed, the Bank, along with other donors, is focusing its assistance on the privatization of
the larger strategic state-owned enterprises through a Privatization Technical Assistance Project
(FY01). While privatization of these enterprises has taken longer than expected and needs to be
accelerated, careful attention is required to ensure that: enterprises are privatized into a
competitive environment (in the case of utilities and transport, this often involves the elaboration
of a regulatory framework within the context of a well developed sector strategy); competent
strategic investors/managers are found; and, ownership and labor issues are resolved. Sustained
assistance into the medium term will, therefore, be required.
21.
The centerpiece of Bank assistance over the period to the definition of a new CAS in
2004, will be to help BiH achieve short-term results in implementation of key parts of its action
plan to improve the business environment. The objective is not only to mobilize new investment
but to initiate a critical change in investor perceptions of BiH. Attainment of targets specified
for second and final tranche release of the Business Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC)
(FY02) will be the particular focus of Bank assistance. This includes: (i) the development of a
common (inter-Entity) business registration system and attainment of reduced business
registration-time targets; (ii) introduction of a new collateral registry system; (iii) the
rationalization of business inspections, and, to this end, the attainment of key outcome targets;
and (iv) the adoption of new bankruptcy and liquidation legislation.
SME development is critical to expanding private sector activity and job opportunities.
22.
Increased competition in the banking sector and falling interests rates are improving SME access
to finance in the FBiH. Banking sector reforms in the RS, however, started later than those in
FBiH and are less advanced. A recently approved Private Sector Development Project (FY02)
will, therefore, provide much needed project financing to SME’s in the RS. Several donor

- 58 -

APPENDIX II

programs provide firm-based technical assistance for private sector development throughout
BiH, such as the IFC sponsored SEED initiative. Small-scale operators in the agriculture and
forestry sectors have less access to these programs because of the risks associated with their
operations. At the same time they are a vulnerable population group in terms of the country’s
poverty profile requiring sustained assistance. Further lending, leveraging other donor assistance,
for a Forest Development and Conservation Project and a new Small Scale Commercial
Agriculture Development Project was as a result approved by the Bank’s Board in FY03.
Labor markets. Looking to the future increased flexibility in labor markets will be key
23.
to BiH’s competitiveness, particularly in the context of the overall privatization program.
Substantial labor market reform, associated with job placement and conditions of employment,
were enacted in 2001, under a Bank supported reform First Social Sector Adjustment Credit
(SOSAC I). Nevertheless “wage-setting” remains a major rigidity in the labor market. In the
preparation of a new piece of economic sector work, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM),
now planned for 2004, the Bank is analyzing this issue and its impact on country
competitiveness, working in close collaboration with the IMF.
IFC’s strategy in BiH is multidimensional, encompassing all sectors of the economy, but
24.
particularly inherited competitive industries such as SMEs, wood, agribusiness, and areas of the
economy identified as having potential in the aftermath of the conflict, such as banking and
infrastructure. In the financial sector, IFC’s focus has been to build and strengthen financial
intermediaries, including assisting in privatization, establishing greenfield banks and working
with local financial institutions in their efforts to develop into high quality banks. Since FY01,
10 projects totaling US$63 million were committed to finance projects in: pharmaceutical sector;
micro finance institutions; credit lines to banks to support SMEs; bank privatization; and postprivatization support in the manufacturing sector . IFC also assists the SME sector through a
multi-donor South East Europe Enterprise Development (SEED) initiative, officially launched in
September 2000 and operating in Albania, BiH, FYR Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and
Kosovo. SEED provides firm-level support to the SME sector through investment advisory
services and advice to address constraints in the business environment; capacity building
programs for SMEs and Business Development Service Providers, and information and
knowledge relevant to the private sector.
Building Social Sustainability

25.
The Bank is supporting a program of social reforms focused on four key issues:
protecting the poor, strengthening human capital, social inclusion and ensuring environmentally
sustainable development. The human cost to delayed social protection reform is starkly
highlighted in the recent findings of the Poverty Assessment and PEIR. Both detail the failure of
the social safety net to protect the poor and significant inefficiencies in social assistance cashtransfer systems. Furthermore, the existing system is financially unsustainable without
significant restructuring. A delayed second Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSACII) now
planned for the first half of 2004 will support the authorities in their commitment to: (i)
transform veterans benefits to reflect fiscal realities and European practice by targeting benefits
on the most disabled veterans and dependent families of dead soldiers; (ii) support solidarity

- 59 -

APPENDIX II

funds for social and child assistance in both Entities, to ensure pooling of financial resources and
a reduction in regional disparities of benefits to the poorest; (iii) implementing minimum benefit
standards for disabled civilians, to ensure cash benefits are directed to the most disabled, and
public funds cover key aids; and (iv) promote participation from NGOs and other civil society
actors in the social protection system.
26.
The IMF is advising the World Bank regarding budget issues related to pensions
payments and war veterans benefits over the short to medium term. The Bank has concentrated
its efforts on identifying and promoting the structural changes in these systems necessary for
fiscal sustainability, consistent with the IMF’s own budget discussions with the BiH authorities.
The sustained public awareness and technical assistance needed to strengthen government and
NGO capacities to detail and implement these and other reforms are being supported through an
ongoing Social Sector Technical Assistance Credit (SOTAC) (FY01).
27.
Key elements of Bank support through to the definition of a new CAS in 2004 are to:
complete the process of follow-up assistance to the LSMS and the Bank’s Poverty Assessment;
ensure that findings are effectively incorporated into the PRSP; realistic monitorable indicators
are set; and, eventually, adequate evaluation and monitoring capacities are built up for
sustainable PRSP implementation.
28.
Initial feedback from consultations under the PRSP, confirmed by the findings of the
PEIR, indicate that government capacities to implement recent pension and health reforms need
be strengthened and severe inefficiencies in the education system need to be addressed. A Social
Insurance Technical Assistance Project, aimed at modernizing health and pension institutions,
was approved in FY03.
29.
The PEIR highlights wasteful expenditures and poor services and results in the education
sector, particularly in tertiary education. Furthermore, BiH’s poverty profile–indicating a high
correlation between poverty and level of education in any given household–underscores the need
to ensure that access to an efficient and modernized education system is greatly improved.
Nevertheless, the PEIR points, to significant financing problems in the sector, largely associated
with fragmented delivery and funding of services. The authorities, with the strong support of the
international community, regard consolidation and rationalization of the sector as fundamental to
quality improvements. To this end, a comprehensive education sector strategy is expected to be
completed with Bank support by the end of this calendar year, and a new Education
Restructuring Project is planned for the period up to the definition of the new CAS.
30.
BiH’s poverty profile also indicates that the poor tend to be concentrated in particular
semi-urban and rural communities which suffer from economic dislocation and social cleavages.
Often these communities have a high concentration of IDPs and refugees. Bank assistance will
continue to promote social inclusion, aimed at helping to ensure wider participation in postconflict growth, ethnic reconciliation and improved delivery of services to disadvantaged groups
through two projects approved by the Board over the last CAS period.

- 60 -

APPENDIX II

31.
Strategic planning for the environment to safeguard sustainable development has
witnessed consistent progress with the support of a recently completed IDF grant (FY00).
Through a process involving consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, an Environmental
Action Plan (EAP) has been adopted. An initiative to deal with one of BiH’s key environmental
problems, the disposal of solid waste, resulted in the Board approval of a Solid Waste
Management Project (FY02) which helps to consolidate dump sites and encourage private sector
activity in waste collection.
32.
As part of a regional initiative in South East Europe (SEE), the Development Learning
Center in BiH is well advanced in its preparation and became fully operational in May 2003. It is
expected to be a powerful tool in the training of civil servants and public policy makers in the
context of BiH’s civil service reform program; and in conveying critically important skills in the
areas of business management and policy to aspiring entrepreneurs and local businesses.
World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations

33.
The Bank’s Board discussed the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report for BiH on
November 12, 2002. The progress report determined that, in terms of reform targets and lending
triggers established in the 2000 CAS, BiH ended the CAS period in the base case. The remaining
public finance reform and enterprise and bank privatization detailed in the October 2001
progress report were completed, and a new program to strengthen the business environment was
successfully launched. However, restructuring of the social protection system in 2002 did not
proceed according to government’s original plan; as a result IDA assistance was not fully
committed over the CAS period. Pending completion of the full PRSP, the second CAS Progress
Report outlined the Bank assistance program up to December 2003. The CAS Progress Report,
while adhering to the assistance objectives laid out in the last CAS, was designed to support BiH
in the preparation and finalization of its first PRSP.
34.
Since 1996, forty-seven IDA supported projects have been approved, in addition to
twenty IFC operations, and fourteen MIGA guarantees. Of the US$984 million in IDA
commitments, US$780 million has been disbursed as of December 31, 2003. The BiH project
portfolio continues to perform better than the average Bankwide portfolio. There are no problem
projects. All QAG project and ESW reviews to date have rated products as satisfactory or above,
bar a rating for one adjustment operation of less-than satisfactory. Similarly all 25 closed
projects have received a satisfactory or better than satisfactory rating from OED. There are,
however, fundamental differences in the current portfolio of active projects with those of the first
generation “emergency” type operations. World Bank financing no longer covers 100 percent of
eligible project costs. The active portfolio is comprised of 20 projects, including 1 adjustment
operation and 19 investment loans (see Annex).
35.
Adjustment operations currently under preparation include the Second Social Sector
Adjustment Credit (¶25) and an Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC)
supporting further public administration reforms (¶16). An investment operation currently under
preparation defined in the CAS progress report is the Education IV.

APPENDIX III

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: STATISTICAL ISSUES

1.
The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war, implicitly gave responsibility for
statistical functions to the two Entities (The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Republika Srpska). In August 1998, the State created its own statistical institute, the Bosnia
and Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS) with a view to compiling country-wide
statistics in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies, consolidating data
produced by the Entities Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary coordinating agency
for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance was provided in
recent years, mainly by the European Union and essentially in the form of training seminars
and study visits. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) in May 1999, to provide technical assistance in the
development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics on the basis of the comprehensive
review conducted in early 1998 by the Fund’s Multisector Statistics mission and the
recommendations of Fund missions in the areas of monetary and balance of payments
statistics. A country page for Bosnia and Herzegovina in International Finance Statistics
(IFS) was introduced in July 2001.
A. Real Sector

In recent years, efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector
2.
statistics, but results have been mixed. The Federation and RS both have published nominal
GDP estimates using the production approach based on international standards
recommended by the 1993 SNA, since 1998 and 1999, respectively. However, in both cases,
production estimates at constant prices and GDP by expenditure are still unavailable and
informal sector activities are under-recorded. The preparation of a household budget survey,
to serve as the basis for revising price indices and to facilitate the compilation of GDP by the
expenditure approach, has begun. There are still no meaningful short-term business and
consumer surveys. Both statistical offices compile prices and production indices using
outdated methodologies, and consistent time series are not available. Industrial production
indices are prepared in each Entity, but there is no index at the country level. Labor statistics
are the weakest area for both Institutes, and data on employment, unemployment, and wage
rates are based on deficient methodologies.
B. Balance of Payments

3.
Trade data are published by Entities’ Statistical Institutes and balance of payments
statistics by the CBBH’s Research Department. The quality of the data is generally poor.
Merchandise trade data are not based on international standards and suffer from serious
undercoverage due to smuggling and undervaluation. The coverage of foreign aid data,
foreign investment, and workers remittances is inadequate. However, there are signs of
progress. The ASYCUDA customs information system has been introduced in both entities.
All customs posts were covered by the system by the end of 2002. Efforts to enhance the
system, including by improving communication and system security are ongoing, with
assistance from the EU and UNCTAD. Continued technical assistance will be provided

- 64 -

through the Fund’s Resident Statistical Advisor. The staff has recently adopted estimates of
private transfers provided by the CBBH.
C. Government Finance

4.
The CBBH has recently agreed, in accord with the finance ministers of the State and
two entity governments, to take the lead in compiling Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
on a countrywide basis, and recently assigned a team of three staff to work on the GFS. At its
request, STA fielded a GFS technical assistance mission in September 2003. The mission
examined the structure of the relations between BiH governments and advised on sector
classification for international comparison purposes. It developed a system to allow budget
data to be classified, aggregated, and consolidated into summary GFS aggregates for all BiH
governments, except for municipalities. This exercise also demonstrated that currently
available data do not provide a satisfactory basis for compilation of GFS. The mission
suggested enlisting the help of USAID to develop reporting systems that can electronically
link GFS codes with ORACLE accounting systems used in the Treasuries. Reporting systems
are still being developed.
5.
The mission developed a medium term development plan for fiscal statistics in BiH,
taking account of the problems posed by the complexity of the BiH government structure and
the difficulties faced by the CBBH in collecting and processing data. The mission
recommended a conservative approach, with the essential first step utilizing simple systems
and processes which allow summary GFS reports to be produced on a timely and regular
basis. Progress requires commitments by all parties to cooperate, as well as additional
computer resources and, in the long run, more staff, at the CBBH.
D. Monetary Accounts

6.
The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on both a countrywide and Entity
basis. Over the period 1996–2001, several Fund technical assistance missions have assisted
the authorities in establishing an integrated system for compiling countrywide monetary
statistics meeting Fund standards. The latest mission in December 2001, reviewed in
particular the recent institutional changes and accounting developments that have important
implications for monetary statistics and assisted in revising and updating the current
monetary data compilation procedures. The mission recommended improvements in, among
other areas, the presentation of IMF-related accounts in monetary statistics and compilation
of weighted average interest rates. The CBBH began, in early 2003, reporting weighted
average rates for bank deposits and loans for January 2002 onward for publication in IFS.
A follow-up monetary statistics mission has been scheduled for FY2004 to assist CBBH in
resolving data issues arising from recent developments in the financial sector, including
designation at end-2002 of the CBBH as the fiscal agent responsible for BiH’s financial
transactions with the IMF, and progress in privatization of banks in BiH.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
A mission visited Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to hold discussions for the
fourth and final review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for SDR 67.6 million
(40 percent of quota), approved by the Executive Board on August 2, 2002. Following
two two-month extensions approved on October 7, 2003, and December 31, 2003, the SBA
expires on February 29, 2004; three purchases of SDR 19.6 million, SDR 12.0 million, and
SDR 24 million were made respectively at the time of Board approval, on December 27,
2002 after the first review, and on June 11, 2003, after the combined second and third
reviews.1
2.
At the Board meeting for the second and third reviews, Directors applauded the
progress in fiscal consolidation under the program, but noted the immediate challenge
arising from booming credit to households and the associated sharp deterioration in the
external current account balance.
3.
The authorities have committed to sound policies. But social pressures for higher
public spending are strong, evidenced by difficulties in the Republika Sprska (RS) on budget
wages and pensions late in 2003.
II. BACKGROUND
4.
Bank credit to households has slowed somewhat after taking off in mid-2002
(Text Table 1). In the wake of bank privatization and reverse currency substitution as euro
notes were introduced, bank deposits soared, funding growth of bank credit to households of
over 110 percent (6 percentage points of GDP) during 2002. This boosted imports and raised

projected 9 percent for the year as a whole). This overshoot was funded largely by continued
faster-than-expected growth of bank deposits as households continued a portfolio switch
from cash to deposits, and by net inflows from abroad.

and could be significantly more if early data reported in Text Table 2 are confirmed (Figure

Box 1. Revisions to Trade Data
Staff estimates for trade are based on trading partner data in the
Direction of Trade Statistics while the Bosnian customs data
systems continue to strengthen. However, recent corrections to
DOTs data lowered imports and exports for 2002 and earlier.

output a quarter below 2002 levels. In this context, profitability appears to have strengthened
in the RS while deteriorating further in the Federation (Text Table 3). Consumer prices,
anchored by the currency board, were unchanged in 2003, despite the credit boom and the
agricultural supply shock.

Tighter liquidity and banking regulations are reinforcing downward pressure on
credit. Effective June 1 2003, a three-fold reform of reserve requirements—including foreign

In this context, remuneration for
excess bank reserves held with
the central bank was raised to full market rates, eliciting an increase in gross international
reserves by almost 4 percentage points of GDP between May and November 2003 (Text

Spending at State, Cantonal, and extra budgetary fund levels has also remained under control,
with the latter two on track to achieve balanced budgets. Entities continued to reconstitute
into the escrow accounts the sums spent in 2002 for severance payments under the
demobilization program; by Q3, about half of the sums spent had been reconstituted (Box 2).

Box 2. Escrow Flows and Balances, (End-September, 2003)
Since 2002, proceeds from privatization and the succession money from the former
Yugoslavia have been placed in escrow pending the settlement of domestic claims (column
1 in the table). Funds withdrawn from escrow (column 2)–– funding demobilization––are
required to be reconstituted into escrow (column 3). Balances are shown in column 4.

Progress on policy implementation under the program has been good, though
some actions covered by conditionality were implemented late:
•

End-September 2003 performance criteria were met, and almost all structural
benchmarks were observed (Tables 5a–5b).

•

However, the structural performance criterion on the adoption of the amendments
to banks’ foreign currency exposure regulations by end-June 2003 was missed by
one month on account of efforts to ensure coordination of the actions of the two
banking regulators.

•

The authorities committed to framework legislation for a single indirect tax
administration a month or so after the structural benchmark on this. The legal
framework unifying customs administration was established on July 1, 2003, but
physical unification will begin in early 2004.

-8-

•

The end-June structural benchmark to prepare a comprehensive strategy to settle
domestic claims was not observed, despite progress on the related preparations,
but an appropriate plan was adopted in December 2003.

10.
Despite this progress, completion of the discussions for the Fourth review was
delayed. This followed the unanticipated announcement by the RS authorities of their
intention to raise average pensions and budget wages by 20 percent by end-2003 and
subsequently by passage by the RS National Assembly of a budget for 2004 containing
inadvertent technical errors which rendered the budget inconsistent with understandings
reached with Staff. Implementation of the RS pension hikes began in October, leading to
nonobservance of the structural benchmark on the collection period in November.2 Collection
periods in December and January were, however, observed. Implementation of the wage rise
was postponed (see below), but budget workers received monthly payments of 1/5 of one
month’s wage arrears commencing in October (hence a 20 percent rise in cash wage
payments). This constituted nonobservance of the structural benchmark against clearance of
arrears prior to adoption of a comprehensive plan to restructure domestic claims on
government.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
Credit and imports have decelerated by less than anticipated, but corrective
measures have not had time to take full effect. Thus, discussions focused on the need to
ensure full application of the corrective steps, and relatedly, on the resolution to the RS
pension and wage issues and on preparations for the 2004 budgets.
A. Macroeconomic Framework for 2003–04
12.
The macroeconomic framework was reassessed in light of recent credit
developments, the 2002 GDP data, and the underlying structural constraints on activity
(Table 6). Allowing for uncertainty over the 2002 outcome, the signs of deceleration in 2003,
and drought, the authorities concurred that GDP growth could be 3½ percent in 2003—
slightly up on earlier projections given the slower-than-expected deceleration in credit. And
with the consolidated government budget heading for a small surplus and exports to Serbia
booming, a modest reduction of the current account deficit in 2003 was expected in parallel
with the smaller than earlier anticipated deceleration in credit. In 2004, with agriculture back
on track, and a strengthened external environment, GDP was expected to grow 5 percent,
though a continued deceleration in credit and the short-term impact of possible initiation of
deep enterprise reforms could be downside influences. But with exports buoyed by external
2

Under the SBA, the RS authorities are committed under a structural benchmark to stop
collections for monthly pensions by the 10th of the following month and to pay pensions with
collections to that point. In principle, if such collections fall short of need, that month’s
pension entitlements are reduced pro-rata.

-9-

demand and imports slowing with credit, the authorities concurred that the current account
deficit was expected to decline further to some 15¾ percent of GDP.
B. Monetary and Financial Policies
13.
The authorities noted that installation of the new CBBH Board in August—as
the mandate of the old expired—and arrangements made for a new governor from
end-2004 had occurred smoothly. Staff agreed that potential pitfalls had been successfully
avoided and welcomed the unequivocal commitment by the new Board to the currency board
arrangement (¶1).3
14.
The monetary authorities shared staff concerns with the impact of credit growth
on prudential risks and the current account balance. An appropriate balance between the
welcome and adverse aspects of the credit boom was sought, and this had motivated the
authorities’ decision to balance the liquidity and regulatory tightening with increased
remuneration of excess reserves, an approach which had helped to secure acceptance of the
reforms by the banks. The new reserve requirement regulations were being observed and
many banks already met the end-year core capital requirements.
15.
Nevertheless, credit growth remained rapid so full enforcement of the new
regulations was essential. This concern underlay understandings reached as prior actions for
completion of the review on observance of the forex exposure and core capital requirements

Policies.

noted it was too early to judge if the rate of reserve requirements should be raised, but this
would remain under review in consultation with staff.
16.
With policy to restrain credit focused on ensuring compliance with new rules,
staff noted concern that bank liquid assets had declined to well below prescribed limits.
Banks are required to match maturities fully to 90 days (declining to 90 percent for maturities
to 365 days). But they persistently fail to do so, despite application of the prescribed penalties
by regulators. Accordingly, the authorities proposed to review the regulations with staff, to
establish a clear regime of escalating penalties for non-observance, and any phase-in periods
for full enforcement. On that basis and, in fulfillment of a prior action for the review, the
regulators have prepared corrective plans for all banks not observing the regulations as at
end-September (¶4).
17.
The monetary authorities undertook to review the remuneration of excess
reserves. With banks increasingly obliged to hold deposits with the CBBH to meet the forex
and liquidity regulations, the case for full market remuneration of excess reserves to absorb
liquidity was diminished. Staff noted that reduced remuneration would strengthen the
profitability of the central bank and encourage banks to meet the tighter forex requirements
by desisting automatic indexation of KM credits to households rather than by borrowing from
their external parents and placing the funds with the central bank. Accordingly, the rate of
remuneration was reduced by one percentage point with effect from end-December 2003.
18.
The authorities noted that their actions would continue to provide support for
the currency board. Though BiH’s diversified trade orientation and coming structural
adjustments might, in other circumstances, warrant a more flexible monetary and exchange
rate regime, the authorities noted that the appreciation of the Serbian dinar had strengthened
BiH’s competitiveness, that a change to the regime or the peg would compound difficulties in
securing necessary corporate restructuring, and, in the absence of structural reforms, that it
would simply cause inflation.

C. Fiscal Policy
19.
Bank credit and trade balance trends indicated continued need for a strong
fiscal stance. In this context, the prospect of a shortfall of US$58 million (0.8 percent of
GDP) in the expected external financing from the IBRD and the EU in 2003, due to delays in
policy implementation, implied that the fiscal target would have to be strengthened (Box 3).

- 11 -

Box 3. Foreign Financing, 2003
The IBRD did not disburse under its Business
Environment credit (BAC) in 2003 because
policy actions needed to ensure observance with
the conditionality on businesses registration
processes were delayed by the political
transition. Furthermore, the new administrations
requested a delay to negotiations on reforms to
veterans benefits (SOSAC II) to allow them
time to assess the proposals. The associated
disbursements are now anticipated for 2004. In
addition, delays in meeting the conditionality
(with regards to bankruptcy law, competition
law and law on the insurance sector) for the
disbursement of the second tranche of program
assistance from the EU will push the
disbursement of the third tranche into 2004.

Accordingly, the authorities decided to tighten the 2003 deficit target by an
additional 0.4 percent of GDP. This implies a small surplus in the consolidated fiscal
accounts and a consolidation from 2002 of 2¾ percentage points of GDP (Text Table 6). The
remaining shortfall of 0.4 percentage points of GDP would be financed by smaller than
anticipated reconstitution of government deposits. This would be provided by delays to the
reconstitution of succession monies used in 2002 to fund military severance (Box 2), with
faster reconstitution now budgeted for 2004 as the delayed foreign disbursements are made
(¶6).

21.
Given revenue projections, the Entity expenditure ceilings for Q4 2003 were
derived from this framework. With Cantonal and local government balances on track, the
spending ceilings implied only a modest increase relative to Q3, but avoided unanticipated
reductions, and would be realized by strictly enforcing current quarterly authorizations for
spending to ministries (¶6).
22.
Looking ahead, the authorities noted that the fiscal challenge would be great.
Pressures from pensioners and budget workers were mounting in the Federation and had
resulted in the RS concessions of 20 percent increases in these items, proposed to take effect
before end-2003. Staff noted that budget resource constraints could not accommodate both
commitments and, in the context of low enterprise profitability, the budget wage proposals
risked provoking matching and unsustainable wage demands outside the budget.
23.
The RS authorities noted that pensioners’ demands had to be met: pensions were
low relative to wages; and funding for increases was available from increased collections and
from efficiencies in the central government budget for 2004. Accordingly, pensions were
increased and observance of the cutoff dates for the collection periods has been secured from
December, correcting the earlier breach of the structural benchmark on this matter.
24.
Given this social priority for pensions, the authorities proposed reformulating
their wage plans with the assistance of the IBRD. Wage increases would be adopted only
after a rationalization of the budget employment and remuneration structures to be
implemented from April 2004. The increase in budget remuneration payments (wage and
non-wage benefits, including settlement of wage arrears) in 2004 will be capped at 3 percent
(¶10). Given this cap, average budget remuneration rates could rise in April by at most
9 percent in line with targeted retrenchment, with increases to be implemented only as
dismissals are realized. Under the debt plan, the staggered payment of one month of wage
arrears would continue until March 2004 implying that, thereafter, many budget workers
would experience reductions in monthly cash payments. These wage adjustments bring a
three-year wage freeze to an end, and would allow a modest reduction in the gap between RS
and Federation budget remuneration levels. Risks that these budget wage rises could stoke
non-budget wage demands are attenuated by the moderation of the prospective average rise in
base wages in April, and their realization through restructuring.
25.
In this context, the authorities anticipate maintenance of a strong budget
balance. They are targeting a consolidated deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP—including one-off
items such as severance pay of some 0.5 percentage point of GDP (¶12 and 15 ). Allowing
for the one-off payments and the shift of some spending from 2003 into 2004 due to the
delays in foreign disbursements, the underlying primary surplus in 2004 would remain around
1 percent of GDP, in line with sustainability projections underpinning the plan to settle
domestic claims on government (see below). This fiscal approach would allow full
reconstitution of the funds withdrawn from escrow in 2002 (¶6 and 7).

- 13 -

26.
On the spending side, customs administration, intelligence services, and key
elements of military control will be shifted from Entity to the State in 2004—leaving
consolidated spending unchanged (¶16). In addition, major defense policy reforms—
including another round of demobilization and scaling back conscription—are anticipated,
yielding savings in defense wages in 2004 of some 1 percent of GDP, while reforms of
benefits for war veterans would hold spending there unchanged.
27.
Budgets for 2004 consistent with these understandings have been approved by
the governments of the Federation and State and parliamentary approvals are expected
shortly, while the RS situation is more complex. The RS Assembly approved the 2004
budget though technical errors appeared in the documents submitted to the assembly, as a
result of which, a budget was approved with a deficit some 1½ percent of RS GDP (½ a
percent of BiH GDP) higher than intended, half of which derived from an error in a reform of
funding for the road fund, and the other half attributed to spending. To correct this, the
authorities preferred not to return to the assembly, noting risks that this might reopen
discussions on the wage and pensions proposals. Instead, they corrected on the revenue side
by restoring the intended funding for the road fund, and on the spending side, by following
the successful precedent of the Federation in 2002 and preparing a budget implementation
framework which makes execution of specific items of spending (equal to the unintended
excess of some 0.7 percent of GDP) contingent on higher than budgeted revenues (¶10). The
authorities noted that items covered by the arrangement had been given disproportionately
large increases in the approved budget, they focus on current spending, and the correction
still leaves real spending excluding these items rising by 5 percent. On these grounds, staff
noted this approach was feasible and credible and accepted it, while observing that the
original errors signaled need for further strengthening of budget procedures and that a
resubmission of the budget to the national assembly would have been more transparent. All
these budgets incorporate consistent commitments regarding transfers to the State, and
fulfillment of the prior action on these transfers has been completed with the recent signature
of the protocol governing these transfers (Annex I of the SMEFP).
D. Other Fiscal and Structural Issues
28.
The authorities agreed that domestic claims on government impede fiscal
sustainability and medium-term growth prospects. Public debt of 35 percent of GDP is
combined with a variety of domestic liabilities—including frozen foreign currency accounts,
spending arrears, and citizens’ claims for war damages. Quantification of these liabilities—
notably war damage claims—is uncertain but they could, even excluding privatization
vouchers still outstanding, far exceed 200 percent of GDP. With legal suits for settlement of
claims mounting, the authorities argued that it was urgent to codify the claims into welldefined, legally watertight, politically tolerable, and macroeconomically sustainable
liabilities. The considerable logistical challenges involved had caused nonobservance of the
end-June structural benchmark for preparation of a plan to address these claims.

- 14 -

Box 4. Settlement of Domestic Claims on Government
The plans consist of four steps. First, war damage claims will be capped—by cancellation of
interest on them and by blocking further court awards. These actions are imminent. Second, the rest
of the legal basis for the settlement, including the terms of settlement, is targeted for enactment by
end-June 2004. Third, given current estimates of the stock of claims, the terms of settlement for
each class of claims have been determined identifying precisely which claims are written down and
by how much—with war damages and frozen foreign currency claimants taking the heaviest hits.
Fourth, claims will be paid out in cash (some 4 percent of GDP over several years) including from
escrow, and very long bonds (up to 50 years) issued by the Entities. Settlement will be subject to
verification of individual claims, and the terms of the settlement will be adjusted to maintain the 10
percent of GDP ceiling on claims if verification or other new information alters estimates of total
liabilities.
Staff projections indicate that, given foreign debt, these plans are consistent with fiscal
sustainability. In long run scenarios, trend growth of 3 percent, real interest rates of 5 percent, and a
primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP, implies that debt ratios within this ceiling will remain on a
modest declining trend. This is sustainable in the face of standardized short-run economic shocks
(low growth, increased international interest rates, etc). The plans imply a NPV of public debt of
some 40 percent of GDP, appropriately below the Maastricht guideline given Bosnia’s exposure to
shocks, risks that the accounting of claims may not yet be full, and Bosnia’s inability to borrow
externally in KMs. A full debt sustainability assessment will be provided in the forthcoming staff
report for the Article IV consultation. The phasing of the cash payouts will be determined in
consultation with staff in light of financing availability and macroeconomic considerations.

29.
Given the mounting legal pressures, adoption of a plan was established as a
prior action for completing the fourth review, which was fulfilled in December 2003
(Box 4). Fulfillment addressed both the slippage on the June structural benchmark and that
regarding settlement of arrears prior to adoption of such a plan. The authorities’ plan targets a
NPV of the domestic claims to be recognized at some 10 percent of GDP (¶11). Staff noted
that Bosnia’s resolution of such heavy domestic liabilities without inflation was a major
milestone—and possibly unique in international experience—and agreed with the authorities
that implementation would be difficult. In the first half of 2004, the estimates of total
liabilities will be refined (and settlement arrangements adjusted accordingly) and the full
legal basis for the plan will be enacted. In the meantime, some payments of arrears had
commenced—the staggered payment of one month’s budget wage arrears in the RS and of
pension arrears in the Federation. Staff stressed the need for implementation according to
schedule.
30.
The recent agreement pooling control over indirect taxes is a further milestone.
The product of one of the High Representative’s innovative commissions, it is proposed that
all indirect taxes will become the prerogative of State level legislation—securing
harmonization—but subject to joint Entities and State determination of policies with revenue
collected by a single administration, the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA). This paves the way for

- 15 -

the VAT, which the authorities intend to introduce in 2005–06. Agreements are still required
on a detailed revenue allocation mechanism for indirect taxes and for the determination of
funding for the State. In addition, plans will be needed to ensure continued effective
operation of the existing Entity sales and excise tax administrations in the run up to the VAT.
Staff unreservedly welcomed these advances and urged early resolution of the outstanding
issues, particularly concerning revenue allocation.
31.
Strengthening fiscal management remains a high priority. Ongoing initiatives
include expanding treasury operations, and strengthening fiscal transparency and intra-Entity
fiscal coordination (¶8).
32.
Structural rigidities
form the focus of the
authorities’ 6-month Action
Plan (Box 5). This ambitious
program draws on the PRSP and
is being implemented. Staff
noted that the plan reflected a
welcome strengthening in BiH’s
analytical and economic policymaking capacities. Staff
particularly welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to establish
commercial courts to handle
bankruptcies.

Box 5. Action Plan
The plan sets out an ambitious reform agenda—
covering 122 items—to be completed by March 2004. It
includes passing framework legislation for the ITA, a
target to issue 10 tenders for privatization within 6 months,
amending bankruptcy laws to limit the seniority of labor
claims, training bankruptcy officials, developing a plan for
medium term fiscal expenditure rationalization, the
domestic claims strategy, reduction of red tape under the
Bulldozer II initiative, reorganizing labor market
institutions, and efforts to improve exports and statistics.
While these are laudable objectives, the plan lacks
detail and there is little prioritization amongst the 122
items. Critically, the labor market proposals exclude
measures to improve wage flexibility—a key requirement
of any efforts to increase corporate profitability. While
good progress has been made on implementation, notably
with regard to bankruptcy laws and domestic debt claims,
completion by March 2004 is unlikely.

33.
Program and
surveillance work on Bosnia
continues to be bedeviled by
poor statistics. Despite
progress—notably that work on
Household Budget Survey has
begun—the authorities
emphasized that improvements
require better primary data, but donors appeared averse to assisting with this. The statistical
agencies have begun merger discussions and, in that context, the authorities hoped that the
appointment of a new Director and a Statistical Council—elements in the Action Plan—
would move matters forward.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is progressing, though the last months of 2003 were
hard going: the new central bank board was installed smoothly in August; the midyear
reforms to reserve requirements and bank forex exposure rules proceeded effectively; the

- 16 -

authorities’ 6-month “Action Plan” is appropriately ambitious; pathbreaking plans for
indirect tax, defense, and domestic claims on government have been agreed and have
commenced; a large fiscal consolidation has been secured since 2001; and, albeit stoked by a
credit boom, staff estimate GDP growth in 2002 of 5½ percent. But for many of these steps,
implementation will be challenging. And political pressures are mounting as highlighted,
notably, by the unexpected announcements of sizeable pension and wage increases in the RS
in 2003. However, remedial actions have been taken and Bosnia remains on track.
35.
The immediate macroeconomic concerns—the bank credit boom and the
external current account deficit—have begun to correct. Credit expansion has slowed
somewhat from its 2002 peaks and this deceleration will be reinforced as the mid-2003
monetary and regulatory strengthening take full effect. In that regard, the authorities’
commitment to see those decisions firmly implemented—the associated prior actions to
prepare corrective plans for non-compliant banks have been fulfilled—and to consult with
staff on the reserve requirement ratio are both welcome. In this light, a waiver for nonobservance of the end-June structural performance criterion on the issue of new forex
exposure rules is recommended because the latter were issued in July and are being enforced
with vigor. Alongside, the external deficit is declining; international reserves have risen and
consumer prices are again flat, all signaling the increasing strength of the currency board. The
review and enforcement of bank liquidity regulations—also a prior action which has been
fulfilled—will further strengthen these credit and external trends.
36.
Fiscal policies in 2003–04 continue to support these efforts to rein in the external
deficit. Consolidation of 2¾ percentage points of GDP in 2003 highlights these efforts.
Revenue in the RS and the State has exceeded budget projections and spending has been
tightly controlled, while revenue difficulties in the Federation central government elicited a
firm expenditure response after mid-2003. The consequent stronger-than-budgeted
consolidated deficit outturn also accommodates some slippage in the external financing
available for 2003. But because progress is being made to meet the conditions necessary for
those disbursements, domestic financing will partly bridge to these disbursements in 2004.
The strong fiscal stance will be maintained in 2004 with budgets targeting a small deficit in
the consolidated accounts—excluding severance payments—and an underlying primary
surplus in line with fiscal sustainability requirements. This will require careful
implementation by the RS of its “delayed payments” operation, and cancellation of the
relevant items if revenue does not overperform. This overall fiscal stance will provide
appropriate ongoing support to the monetary, regulatory, and enterprise reform initiatives,
which form the appropriate focus of efforts to rein in the external current account deficit.
37.
Alongside, fiscal and other structural reforms are making significant progress.
Though the proposals on indirect taxation were issued a month later than envisaged in the
end-June structural benchmark, the agreement is path breaking and, with the formal
unification of customs, has already begun to go into effect. The defense reforms lay out a
path toward unified military command and savings on defense spending even in 2004. The
need for further strengthening of budget procedures is evident from the difficulties in the RS

- 17 -

over the 2004 budget, and initiatives to strengthen them are encouraged, including extending
the treasury systems and improving coordination between central and regional fiscal
authorities. The plan to reorganize domestic claims on government will complete this set of
fiscal reforms and full implementation is strongly encouraged.
38.
These advances have not come easily, and risks remain. The macroeconomic risks
are significant, policy-making institutions still coordinate poorly, and significant delays in
policy implementation have occurred. Furthermore, while pressures for large wage and
pensions increases have been contained thus far, they remain a notable source of concern
especially ahead of the April 2004 RS civil service remuneration reforms, and these
pressures, along with the pace of reforms in 2003, are putting the fragile coalitions under
strain. The quality of macroeconomic data remains low, so there is always the risk of
unpleasant surprises. And the structural reform agenda ahead will test the will of the
authorities to its limit; enterprise reform and privatization, already largely completed in most
transition countries, has yet to begin in earnest, and yet unemployment is already likely above
20 percent. But the authorities, with the support of the international community, are acquiring
a record of finding solutions to apparently intractable problems, and this stands them in good
stead for the challenges ahead.
39.
In this context, the program remains an appropriate policy framework and
deserves the continued support of the Fund. A waiver for nonobservance of the
structural performance criterion on bank foreign exchange regulations is
recommended, as the deviation was temporary.

APPENDIX I

OVERVIEW OF THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, 2002–03
Against the background of declining GDP growth and high fiscal and current account
imbalances, the program negotiated in the spring of 2002 focused on fiscal consolidation and
structural reform.
Macroeconomic performance under the program has been favorable (Table 1). Real GDP growth
(2002–03 cumulated) turned out to be stronger than expected, inflation has stabilized to
industrial country levels, and international reserves rose significantly. The fiscal balance has
improved from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2001 to a small surplus in 2003. However,
despite significant increases in export growth, the improvement in the external current account
balance was disappointing, largely because a rapid expansion of domestic credit to households
boosted imports. Corrections measures were taken to that effect in the course of 2003 (including
in the form of prior actions for the program’s third and fourth review) which have yielded
significant results.
The role of the fiscal system as a policy instrument was strengthened. Tax competition has
diminished and major progress was made towards the harmonization of indirect taxation and the
creation in December 2003 of a new framework for indirect taxation. Budget execution was
bolstered by strict implementation of ceilings on government borrowing to commercial banks
and a number of other measures including monthly cutoff dates for the collection of revenue and
payments by pension’s funds. Demobilization brought sizeable savings in 2003 after severance
payments were completed in 2002. And, privatization receipts were placed in escrow pending a
reorganization of domestic claims on government that was adopted in December 2003.
The new CBBH board was installed smoothly in August 2003, confirming the currency board
created 6 years earlier. The PRSP has been completed and approved by parliament after extensive
consultations with the civil society. A number of reforms were introduced with the support of
the IBRD designed to stimulate the private sector, including a new bankruptcy framework. But,
except in the banking sector, little progress was achieved in relation to privatization.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (CBBH) was subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By
Arrangement which was approved on August 2, 2002. A safeguards assessment of the
CBBH was completed on October 28, 2002. The assessment identified certain weaknesses
and made appropriate recommendations, as reported in IMF Country Report No. 03/4.
According to information obtained from the authorities, all of the recommendations have
been successfully implemented.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on
August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament approved an amendment to the
CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro, under a currency board
arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro. Small denominations of
KM notes have been in circulation since June 22, 1998; large denominations and coins were
introduced in August 1998, and December 1998, respectively. The convertible marka (KM) is
the currency used for operations and transactions with the Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions resulting from measures taken with respect to frozen foreign currency
deposits as identified in IMF Country Report No. 02/52.
IX.

Last Article IV Consultation
Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the twenty-four month cycle, subject to the provisions of the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article IV consultation
was concluded on February 25, 2002.

APPENDIX III

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: IMF–WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Development Strategy
BiH’s Development Agenda
1.
The authorities of BiH recognize the importance of maintaining satisfactory
macroeconomic performance while accelerating structural reforms. As demonstrated through
the PRSP preparation process, Government has embarked on reforms to address several key
economic challenges, including: (i) creating a predictable and coherent investment
environment within a single economic space; (ii) promoting private sector activity within an
improved business environment; and (iii) strengthening governance whilst combating
corruption.
2.
Submitted to the World Bank and the IMF in December 2001 for information, not
linked to any Bank or IMF operation, Government’s I-PRSP emphasized the development of
an entrepreneurial society within a single economic space while combating corruption and
strengthening governance. As with the I-PRSP, the major focus of the ongoing full PRSP
preparation process is the economy’s heavy reliance on foreign assistance, high formal
unemployment and the low level of domestic production. It further emphasizes corruption
problems across many sectors and the poor quality of public services. The strategy also points
to greater cooperation between the Entities if progress is to be made on expanding the
economy and integrating BiH’s political and economic structures into a wider Europe. The
central theme of the strategy is that poverty can only be effectively combated through greatly
expanded private sector activity.
3.
BiH’s recently completed poverty profile, developed on the basis of the recently
completed Living Standards Measurement Study, confirms the importance of generating new
private sector jobs to poverty alleviation and improving employment prospects for the young
and secondary household earners; but also points to the need to raise wages among the
working poor and general skills levels in the workforce, while protecting children and
households headed by inactive adults. As a result, the upcoming PRSP is expected to address
issues covering the effective implementation of pension and health reform, the reorientation
of the social safety net to protect children and the non-pensioned elderly, a strengthened
education system and improved productivity in the productive sectors.
4.
The Coordination Board for Economic Transition and EU Association, charged with
overseeing the preparation of the PRSP - following finalization of the second draft of the
PRSP in June 2003 – in July 2003 adopted an action plan of priority actions in the areas of
fiscal reform, public debt management, business environment, financial sector, labor market,
public administration reform, statistics and EU integration. This action plan complements
that of a plan adopted in 2002, mainly focused on improving the business environment.

- 49 -

APPENDIX III

5.
Mindful that perceptions of widespread corruption not only discourage sound
investment but constitute a serious problem for the most vulnerable in society, the
Coordination Board earlier also adopted in 2002 a comprehensive anti-corruption action plan.
The plan covers: (i) legislative improvements; (ii) institutional strengthening activities; and,
(iii) educative activities. The plan is under implementation with notable achievements having
been made in improved tax and customs collections.
6.
Some steps have also been taken recently to further strengthen key BiH State
institutions and activities. This in large part has been undertaken in the context of the SAP
with the European Union. A State Border Service has been operational for some time as has a
Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA). Legislation has also been passed which
provides for a State deposit insurance agency and a State body to regulate energy
transmission. In addition, the State has played an aggressive role to liberalize external trade
and open up regional markets. Trade agreements have been signed with Slovenia, Croatia,
FYR Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and Turkey and are under negotiation with Albania,
Bulgaria and Romania, while WTO membership is being actively pursued.
7.
The second draft of the PRSP also stresses the importance of comprehensive public
administration reform to reduce the size of government in the face of declining external
assistance, the sustainability of the social protection system and the need to strengthen human
capital by reinforcing family and community life and improving education and health
services. Government has been advised that follow-through is necessary, however, to
successfully deepen policy reform in these areas, particularly as concerns the determination
of the best administrative structure for BiH consistent with both the Dayton Peace
Agreements and a country aspiring to become a member of the EU.
8.
The Bank and the IMF concluded in their joint letter to Government that BiH’s
I-PRSP provided a satisfactory initial framework to help spearhead the country’s transition to
a self-sustaining economy, and to fight poverty. However, Government was urged to provide
greater clarity on strategic priorities and modalities for the implementation of policy reforms
against a hard budget constraint. In this regard, the authorities are paying special attention to
integrating the policies and priorities being developed under the PRSP into medium term
expenditure frameworks of State and Entity governments.
9.
Preparation of the full PRSP started in early 2002. After extensive consultation across
both Entities the authorities completed the first draft of their full PRSP in November 2002,
presenting it to stakeholders for review. This draft document formed the basis of a further
round of consultations under the auspices of the newly formed governments following the
October 2002 elections and the second draft was completed in June, 2003. The PRSP is now
expected to be finalized in January of 2004. This represents a delay to their original schedule
as Government wished to incorporate some of the elements of the European Commission’s
Feasibility Study in the stabilization and association process, into the finalized PRSP. The
Feasibility Study was completed in the last quarter of 2003.

- 50 -

APPENDIX III

10.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting BiH in maintaining macroeconomic stability
and ensuring fiscal sustainability. A new one year Stand-by-Arrangement (SBA) was
approved by the IMF’s Board of Directors in August 2002 and is scheduled to expire in
November 2003. The SBA appeared to be on track to successful completion until the RS
Prime Minister in November 2003 announced wage increases that could have resulted in a
17% increase in the wage bill. Fund discussions with the BiH and RS authorities are ongoing
which could result in this increase being revisited, while a once-off payment is made to settle
wage arrears. The SBA was extended a second time from end of December 2003 through
February 2004 to allow for completion of the fourth and final review. As a matter of priority,
structural conditionality has focused on issues related to short term fiscal consolidation.
11.
The World Bank has taken the lead in policy dialogue on structural and institutional
reforms in several select sectors. Bank assistance focuses on assisting the authorities: (i)
reach agreement on a medium-term strategy for further public finance reform, which reduces
the size of the public sector, ensures minimum capacities and competencies are developed at
the State level for effective policy formulation and execution, and promotes the efficient
delivery of services at the local level; (ii) follow through on their ongoing efforts to create an
investor-friendly economy that promotes SME development; (iii) complete long delayed
reforms to the social safety net, to ensure that scarce public resources are used efficiently to
protect the most vulnerable in society. Specific assistance has been designed to support BiH
in the finalization of its PRSP.
12.
Progress is being made especially in areas (i) and (ii) above. A US $44 million
Business Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC) was approved by the World Bank in May
2002. The third and final tranche of the Second Public Finance Adjustment Credit (PFSAC
II) was disbursed in November 2002. A Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR)
was completed in May 2002. These instruments were key elements of the Bank’s program as
outlined in the full, June 2000, Country Assistance Strategy.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
13.
The IMF and the World Bank maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government’s structural reforms. The IMF focuses on fiscal sustainability,
monetary policy and bank supervision, while the Bank Group focuses increasingly on
structural issues related to private sector development, strengthening governance and
institution building. Effective collaboration between the Bretton Woods organizations will
continue to be important in assisting BiH implement the PRSP.
Strengthening Institutions and Governance
14.
Fiscal stabilization efforts over the past two years led to a dramatic reduction in the
budgetary gap, which was reduced from over 9 percent of GDP in 1999 to less than 2 and a
half percent at the end of 2003, and net arrears accumulation slowed dramatically largely as a

- 51 -

APPENDIX III

result of initial reforms in the pension system. Nevertheless, with public spending at
55 percent of GDP, the size of government is not sustainable in the context of BiH’s future
resource availability. Further fiscal consolidation of GDP is expected through a combination
of measures supported in the near term by the ongoing SBA. Medium term fiscal
consolidation will be taken up in new Bank operations targeted at: (i) rationalizing and
improving the efficiency of public expenditure in the current multi-layered and fragmented
governance structure; (ii) reducing the proportion of public expenditure spent on wages and
salaries–by restricting overall recruitment and compensation in the context of a broader
public administration reform agenda; (iii) limiting extensive and generous veterans’
entitlements; (iv) reducing expenditures in the defense and public order and safety sectors
(over and above the reductions already achieved in 2001); and (v) significantly increasing the
efficiency of expenditures in the education, health and social welfare sectors.
15.
Recent Bank sponsored reviews are now helping BiH in defining these medium term
policy directions. The PEIR (FY02) entitled From Aid Dependency to Fiscal Self Reliance
pays particular attention to: (i) fiscal policy and expenditure challenges if growth and stability
are to be assured in the medium term; (ii) inter-government relationships from municipalities
up to State government; (iii) fiscal balance between these various levels of public
administration; (iv) financial management and public procurement capabilities; and (v) social
service spending–particularly in the areas of social welfare, education and health. The PEIR
is the capstone study to the subsidiary and self standing Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) (FY02), Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) (FY03); and a
local government finance study entitled Creating a Stable Decentralized Fiscal System
(FY03).
16.
The PEIR emphasizes that: (a) while notable achievements have been made in
improving the performance of certain public institutions, fragmented governance structures
with ill-defined goals, hamper nation building and efficiency benefits from decentralization.
The costs, both economic and social are substantial because fragmentation hinders the
efficient use of public resources; and (b) in order to achieve more coherent and harmonized
policy formulation and implementation, the State’s role as an integrative force needs to be
strengthened, while rationalizing the public sector’s overall role in the economy. In
government’s efforts to rationalize public expenditures while enhancing the delivery of
services, the authorities plan to seek Bank adjustment support in an Economic Management
Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC, FY04). Preparation of the program which this Credit
supports is well advanced and has taken place in close collaboration with the IMF.
Nevertheless, the recent RS government decision to raise wages, resulting in an overall
increase in the wage bill in 2004, has significantly compromised the program supported by
EMSAC. The program is being refocused and redimensioned to take this into account.
17.
Support is ongoing to: (i) facilitate BiH’s efforts to reduce military expenditures
through a Pilot Labor Redeployment Project (FY00); (ii) strengthen local government
through a Local Development Project (FY00) and the Mostar Water Project (FY00);

- 52 -

APPENDIX III

(iii) strengthen public management of the power sector, providing for a State regulator for the
transmission of electricity under a Power III Project (FY01); and (iv) improve trade and
transport infrastructure and services through a Trade and Transport Facilitation Project
(FY01) and a Road Management and Safety Project (FY02).
Fostering Private Sector-Led Growth
18. Accelerating restructuring reforms remains the central challenge to BiH becoming a
self-sustaining economy. Current projections call for a redoubling of reform efforts in order
to achieve financial sustainability by the end of the decade. Moreover, even though
significant fiscal consolidation has recently been achieved, a substantial reduction in the
public sector is still required if BiH is to remain on the sustainable fiscal path. For its part,
the Bank has followed through with detailed discussions with Government on the
recommendations set forth in the PEIR.
19.
The World Bank closely coordinates with the IMF through discussions on issues of
private sector development. Most notably, collaborative efforts have focused on ensuring that
bankruptcy laws are modernized. With initial rounds of labor market and banking reform
completed (supported by two recently closed IDA adjustment credits), such collaboration
proved integral to the successful implementation of Bank assistance over the short term
period. During the period July 2002 to December 2004, the Bank will focus on helping the
authorities follow through on the remaining three elements of their strategy for private sector
development: (i) privatization; (ii) improving the business enabling environment; and (iii)
SME development.
20.
Given that SME and voucher privatization in non-strategic industries has largely been
completed, the Bank, along with other donors, is focusing its assistance on the privatization
of the larger strategic state-owned enterprises through a Privatization Technical Assistance
Project (FY01). While privatization of these enterprises has taken longer than expected and
needs to be accelerated, careful attention is required to ensure that: enterprises are privatized
into a competitive environment (in the case of utilities and transport, this often involves the
elaboration of a regulatory framework within the context of a well developed sector strategy);
competent strategic investors/managers are found; and, ownership and labor issues are
resolved. Sustained assistance into the medium term will, therefore, be required.
21.
The centerpiece of Bank assistance over the period to the definition of a new CAS in
2004, will be to help BiH achieve short-term results in implementation of key parts of its
action plan to improve the business environment. The objective is not only to mobilize new
investment but to initiate a critical change in investor perceptions of BiH. Attainment of
targets specified for second and final tranche release of the Business Environment Adjustment
Credit (BAC) (FY02) will be the particular focus of Bank assistance. This includes: (i) the
development of a common (inter-Entity) business registration system and attainment of
reduced business registration-time targets; (ii) introduction of a new collateral registry

- 53 -

APPENDIX III

system; (iii) the rationalization of business inspections, and, to this end, the attainment of key
outcome targets; and (iv) the adoption of new bankruptcy and liquidation legislation.
22.
SME development is critical to expanding private sector activity and job
opportunities. Increased competition in the banking sector and falling interests rates are
improving SME access to finance in the FBiH. Banking sector reforms in the RS, however,
started later than those in FBiH and are less advanced. A recently approved Private Sector
Development Project (FY02) will, therefore, provide much needed project financing to
SME’s in the RS. Several donor programs provide firm-based technical assistance for private
sector development throughout BiH, such as the IFC sponsored SEED initiative. Small-scale
operators in the agriculture and forestry sectors have less access to these programs because of
the risks associated with their operations. At the same time they are a vulnerable population
group in terms of the country’s poverty profile requiring sustained assistance. Further
lending, leveraging other donor assistance, for a Forest Development and Conservation
Project and a new Small Scale Commercial Agriculture Development Project was as a result
approved by the Bank’s Board in FY03.
23.
Labor markets. Looking to the future increased flexibility in labor markets will be
key to BiH’s competitiveness, particularly in the context of the overall privatization program.
Substantial labor market reform, associated with job placement and conditions of
employment, were enacted in 2001, under a Bank supported reform First Social Sector
Adjustment Credit (SOSAC I). Nevertheless “wage-setting” remains a major rigidity in the
labor market. In the preparation of a new piece of economic sector work, a Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), now planned for 2004, the Bank is analyzing this issue and
its impact on country competitiveness, working in close collaboration with the IMF.
24.
IFC’s strategy in BiH is multidimensional, encompassing all sectors of the economy,
but particularly inherited competitive industries such as SMEs, wood, agribusiness, and areas
of the economy identified as having potential in the aftermath of the conflict, such as banking
and infrastructure. In the financial sector, IFC’s focus has been to build and strengthen
financial intermediaries, including assisting in privatization, establishing greenfield banks
and working with local financial institutions in their efforts to develop into high quality
banks. Since FY01, 10 projects totaling US$63 million were committed to finance projects
in: pharmaceutical sector; micro finance institutions; credit lines to banks to support SMEs;
bank privatization; and post-privatization support in the manufacturing sector . IFC also
assists the SME sector through a multi-donor South East Europe Enterprise Development
(SEED) initiative, officially launched in September 2000 and operating in Albania, BiH, FYR
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro and Kosovo. SEED provides firm-level support to the
SME sector through investment advisory services and advice to address constraints in the
business environment; capacity building programs for SMEs and Business Development
Service Providers, and information and knowledge relevant to the private sector.

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

Building Social Sustainability
25.
The Bank is supporting a program of social reforms focused on four key issues:
protecting the poor, strengthening human capital, social inclusion and ensuring
environmentally sustainable development. The human cost to delayed social protection
reform is starkly highlighted in the recent findings of the Poverty Assessment and PEIR. Both
detail the failure of the social safety net to protect the poor and significant inefficiencies in
social assistance cash-transfer systems. Furthermore, the existing system is financially
unsustainable without significant restructuring. A delayed second Social Sector Adjustment
Credit (SOSACII) now planned for the first half of 2004 will support the authorities in their
commitment to: (i) transform veterans benefits to reflect fiscal realities and European practice
by targeting benefits on the most disabled veterans and dependent families of dead soldiers;
(ii) support solidarity funds for social and child assistance in both Entities, to ensure pooling
of financial resources and a reduction in regional disparities of benefits to the poorest; (iii)
implementing minimum benefit standards for disabled civilians, to ensure cash benefits are
directed to the most disabled, and public funds cover key aids; and (iv) promote participation
from NGOs and other civil society actors in the social protection system.
26.
The IMF is advising the World Bank regarding budget issues related to pensions
payments and war veterans benefits over the short to medium term. The Bank has
concentrated its efforts on identifying and promoting the structural changes in these systems
necessary for fiscal sustainability, consistent with the IMF’s own budget discussions with the
BiH authorities. The sustained public awareness and technical assistance needed to
strengthen government and NGO capacities to detail and implement these and other reforms
are being supported through an ongoing Social Sector Technical Assistance Credit (SOTAC)
(FY01).
27.
Key elements of Bank support through to the definition of a new CAS in 2004 are to:
complete the process of follow-up assistance to the LSMS and the Bank’s Poverty
Assessment; ensure that findings are effectively incorporated into the PRSP; realistic
monitorable indicators are set; and, eventually, adequate evaluation and monitoring capacities
are built up for sustainable PRSP implementation.
28.
Initial feedback from consultations under the PRSP, confirmed by the findings of the
PEIR, indicate that government capacities to implement recent pension and health reforms
need be strengthened and severe inefficiencies in the education system need to be addressed.
A Social Insurance Technical Assistance Project, aimed at modernizing health and pension
institutions, was approved in FY03.
29.
The PEIR highlights wasteful expenditures and poor services and results in the
education sector, particularly in tertiary education. Furthermore, BiH’s poverty profile–
indicating a high correlation between poverty and level of education in any given household–
underscores the need to ensure that access to an efficient and modernized education system is
greatly improved. Nevertheless, the PEIR points, to significant financing problems in the

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

sector, largely associated with fragmented delivery and funding of services. The authorities,
with the strong support of the international community, regard consolidation and
rationalization of the sector as fundamental to quality improvements. To this end, a
comprehensive education sector strategy is expected to be completed with Bank support by
the end of this calendar year, and a new Education Restructuring Project is planned for the
period up to the definition of the new CAS.
30.
BiH’s poverty profile also indicates that the poor tend to be concentrated in particular
semi-urban and rural communities which suffer from economic dislocation and social
cleavages. Often these communities have a high concentration of IDPs and refugees. Bank
assistance will continue to promote social inclusion, aimed at helping to ensure wider
participation in post-conflict growth, ethnic reconciliation and improved delivery of services
to disadvantaged groups through two projects approved by the Board over the last CAS
period.
31.
Strategic planning for the environment to safeguard sustainable development has
witnessed consistent progress with the support of a recently completed IDF grant (FY00).
Through a process involving consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, an
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) has been adopted. An initiative to deal with one of BiH’s
key environmental problems, the disposal of solid waste, resulted in the Board approval of a
Solid Waste Management Project (FY02) which helps to consolidate dump sites and
encourage private sector activity in waste collection.
32.
As part of a regional initiative in South East Europe (SEE), the Development
Learning Center in BiH is well advanced in its preparation and became fully operational in
May 2003. It is expected to be a powerful tool in the training of civil servants and public
policy makers in the context of BiH’s civil service reform program; and in conveying
critically important skills in the areas of business management and policy to aspiring
entrepreneurs and local businesses.
World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
33.
The Bank’s Board discussed the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report for BiH
on November 12, 2002. The progress report determined that, in terms of reform targets and
lending triggers established in the 2000 CAS, BiH ended the CAS period in the base case.
The remaining public finance reform and enterprise and bank privatization detailed in the
October 2001 progress report were completed, and a new program to strengthen the business
environment was successfully launched. However, restructuring of the social protection
system in 2002 did not proceed according to government’s original plan; as a result IDA
assistance was not fully committed over the CAS period. Pending completion of the full
PRSP, the second CAS Progress Report outlined the Bank assistance program up to
December 2003. The CAS Progress Report, while adhering to the assistance objectives laid

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

out in the last CAS, was designed to support BiH in the preparation and finalization of its
first PRSP.
34.
Since 1996, forty-seven IDA supported projects have been approved, in addition to
twenty IFC operations, and fourteen MIGA guarantees. Of the US$984 million in IDA
commitments, US$780 million has been disbursed as of December 31, 2003. The BiH project
portfolio continues to perform better than the average Bankwide portfolio. There are no
problem projects. All QAG project and ESW reviews to date have rated products as
satisfactory or above, bar a rating for one adjustment operation of less-than satisfactory.
Similarly all 25 closed projects have received a satisfactory or better than satisfactory rating
from OED. There are, however, fundamental differences in the current portfolio of active
projects with those of the first generation “emergency” type operations. World Bank
financing no longer covers 100 percent of eligible project costs. The active portfolio is
comprised of 20 projects, including 1 adjustment operation and 19 investment loans (see
Annex).
35.
Adjustment operations currently under preparation include the Second Social Sector
Adjustment Credit (¶25) and an Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit
(EMSAC) supporting further public administration reforms (¶16). An investment operation
currently under preparation defined in the CAS progress report is the Education IV.

APPENDIX IV

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war, implicitly gave responsibility for
statistical functions to the two Entities (The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Republika Srpska). In August 1998, the State created its own statistical institute, the Bosnia
and Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS) with a view to compiling country-wide
statistics in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies, consolidating data
produced by the Entities Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary coordinating agency
for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance was provided in
recent years, mainly by the European Union and essentially in the form of training seminars
and study visits. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) in May 1999, to provide technical assistance in the
development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics on the basis of the comprehensive
review conducted in early 1998 by the Fund’s Multisector Statistics mission and the
recommendations of Fund missions in the areas of monetary and balance of payments
statistics. A country page for Bosnia and Herzegovina in International Finance Statistics
(IFS) was introduced in July 2001.
A. Real Sector
2.
In recent years, efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector
statistics, but results have been mixed. The Federation and RS both have published nominal
GDP estimates using the production approach based on international standards
recommended by the 1993 SNA, since 1998 and 1999, respectively. However, in both cases,
production estimates at constant prices and GDP by expenditure are still unavailable and
informal sector activities are under-recorded. The preparation of a household budget survey,
to serve as the basis for revising price indices and to facilitate the compilation of GDP by the
expenditure approach, has begun. There are still no meaningful short-term business and
consumer surveys. Both statistical offices compile prices and production indices using
outdated methodologies, and consistent time series are not available. Industrial production
indices are prepared in each Entity, but there is no index at the country level. Labor statistics
are the weakest area for both Institutes, and data on employment, unemployment, and wage
rates are based on deficient methodologies.
B. Balance of Payments
3.
Trade data are published by Entities’ Statistical Institutes and balance of payments
statistics by the CBBH’s Research Department. The quality of the data is generally poor.
Merchandise trade data are not based on international standards and suffer from serious
undercoverage due to smuggling and undervaluation. The coverage of foreign aid data,
foreign investment, and workers remittances is inadequate. However, there are signs of
progress. The ASYCUDA customs information system has been introduced in both entities.
All customs posts were covered by the system by the end of 2002. Efforts to enhance the

- 60 -

APPENDIX IV

system, including by improving communication and system security are ongoing, with
assistance from the EU and UNCTAD. Continued technical assistance will be provided
through the Fund’s Resident Statistical Advisor. The staff has recently adopted estimates of
private transfers provided by the CBBH.
C. Government Finance
4.
The CBBH has recently agreed, in accord with the finance ministers of the State and
two entity governments, to take the lead in compiling Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
on a countrywide basis, and recently assigned a team of three staff to work on the GFS. At its
request, STA fielded a GFS technical assistance mission in September 2003. The mission
examined the structure of the relations between BiH governments and advised on sector
classification for international comparison purposes. It developed a system to allow budget
data to be classified, aggregated, and consolidated into summary GFS aggregates for all BiH
governments, except for municipalities. This exercise also demonstrated that currently
available data do not provide a satisfactory basis for compilation of GFS. The mission
suggested enlisting the help of USAID to develop reporting systems that can electronically
link GFS codes with ORACLE accounting systems used in the Treasuries. Reporting systems
are still being developed.
5.
The mission developed a medium term development plan for fiscal statistics in BiH,
taking account of the problems posed by the complexity of the BiH government structure and
the difficulties faced by the CBBH in collecting and processing data. The mission
recommended a conservative approach, with the essential first step utilizing simple systems
and processes which allow summary GFS reports to be produced on a timely and regular
basis. Progress requires commitments by all parties to cooperate, as well as additional
computer resources and, in the long run, more staff, at the CBBH.
D. Monetary Accounts
6.
The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on both a countrywide and Entity
basis. Over the period 1996–2001, several Fund technical assistance missions have assisted
the authorities in establishing an integrated system for compiling countrywide monetary
statistics meeting Fund standards. The latest mission in December 2001, reviewed in
particular the recent institutional changes and accounting developments that have important
implications for monetary statistics and assisted in revising and updating the current
monetary data compilation procedures. The mission recommended improvements in, among
other areas, the presentation of IMF-related accounts in monetary statistics and compilation
of weighted average interest rates. The CBBH began, in early 2003, reporting weighted
average rates for bank deposits and loans for January 2002 onward for publication in IFS.
A follow-up monetary statistics mission has been scheduled for FY2004 to assist CBBH in
resolving data issues arising from recent developments in the financial sector, including

- 61 -

designation at end-2002 of the CBBH as the fiscal agent responsible for BiH’s financial
transactions with the IMF, and progress in privatization of banks in BiH.

APPENDIX V

Sarajevo and Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina
February 10, 2004
Mr. Horst Köhler
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Köhler:
The new governments that were formed at the State and Entity levels following the
October 5 elections began their work in earnest in the Spring of 2003. The policies
implemented since then testify of our commitment to promote sustained economic growth
and improved living standards through continued macroeconomic stability and further
structural reforms necessary to create a fully-functioning market economy. Policy measures
taken during the past few months also underscore our strong backing for the maintenance of
the currency board arrangement, further fiscal consolidation, and continued structural
reforms. In support of this program, we are requesting completion of the fourth review under
the Stand-By arrangement (SBA).
Based on discussions with Fund staff for the fourth review, the attached
Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies assesses economic
developments and policy implementation under the arrangement. It also lays out the concrete
policy measures to be taken during the remainder of the year.
As noted in the attached memorandum, overall policy implementation through June
2003 has been strong, but some policy objectives were not realized. While we regret that one
structural performance criterion and a structural benchmark for end-June 2003 was not
observed, we are pleased to note that corrective action has been taken. The amendment to the
regulations on banks’ foreign exchange exposures (structural performance criterion) was
issued on July 29, 2003. In addition, the structural benchmark on the collection period for
pensions in the RS was not observed in November, but this issue was corrected in December.
In light of this, we request the Executive Board of the IMF to approve a waiver in respect of
the non-observance of the structural performance criterion for end-June 2003. Although the
early payment of wage arrears in the RS in November breached a structural benchmark, we
are pleased to inform you that we have since adopted a comprehensive strategy to make
appropriate arrangements for all domestic claims on government, thereby fulfilling a prior
action for the review.
We are well aware that there is a substantial medium-term reform agenda ahead of us.
Our governments are increasingly focusing on translating this agenda into concrete measures
which we intend to implement during the remainder of the program and in the framework of
a possible successor extended arrangement to the SBA.

- 64 -

APPENDIX V

The Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that the policies set forth in the
attached SMEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of their program, but they will take
any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. Bosnia and Herzegovina
will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to
the policies contained in the SMEFP, in accordance with the Fund's policies on such
consultation..
We are committed to transparency in our economic policies, and we authorize the
Fund to publish this letter and the SMEFP following Executive Board consideration of the
fourth program review.
Sincerely yours,

APPENDIX V

SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
FOR BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
1.
We have begun our work in Bosnia and Herzegovina in earnest. Since we took office
following elections in the fall of 2002, we have:
•

Secured a smooth transition to a new CBBH board, provided for the succession to a
new governor at end-2004, rationalized reserve requirements, and firmly restated our
commitment to the currency board arrangement;

•

Strengthened banking regulations in regard to foreign exchange exposures and core
capital requirements;

•

Committed to implementation of wide ranging reforms under our six-month Action
plan;

•

Agreed a fundamental reform of indirect taxation which will underpin customs
unification and preparations for a VAT;

•

Prepared a reorganization of defense operations, anticipating rationalization,
demobilization, and major cost savings;

•

Maintained strong budget execution and published a plan for a comprehensive
settlement of outstanding domestic claims on government (Table 1–3).

Though formulated in consultation with the international community, these are our policies,
we will see that they are fully implemented, and they will form the basis for what follows.
2.
The recent increases in international reserves of the Central Bank (CBBH) signal
continued confidence in our policies and our commitments to reform and to the currency
board. To ensure that confidence remains and deepens, our immediate focus is on two
macroeconomic concerns: the continued rapid expansion of bank credit; and, looking further
ahead, the need for sustained economic growth to raise living standards, combat
unemployment, and respond to further declines in external reconstruction aid inflows.
3.
The credit boom has been a mixed blessing. Funded largely by surging deposits in the
banking system, it has facilitated long-overdue refurbishment of the housing stock and
boosted activity—with real GDP growth in 2002 estimated at some 5½ percent, though it has
since fallen back somewhat reflecting drought. But the pace of credit expansion raises
concerns about its quality. And the lending has further enlarged the open foreign exchange
position of banks, has caused bank liquidity in some banks to drop well below prescribed
limits, and has boosted imports and the already-high external current account deficit—which
rose to 18½ percent of GDP in 2002 and now shows only the most tentative signs of
stabilizing.

- 66 -

APPENDIX V

4.
Our actions to rationalize and tighten reserve requirements in June and strengthen
regulations on bank forex exposures and core capital in July in the context of a strong budget
stance were our first steps to address these problems. With credit growth and bank forex
exposures remaining strong through September, these steps will be implemented firmly:
•

Banks not yet observing the forex and capital regulations were required to prepare
plans with the banking agencies indicating how compliance would be secured. We
propose that as prior actions for completion of this review (Table 3):
i. Plans for those banks which exceeded their end-September ceilings
would be finalized indicating how full compliance would be secured by
end-December, and
ii. finalization of corrective plans for those banks which in September did
not yet observe the end-December 2003 core capital requirements.

•

In addition, liquidity regulations on banks will be reviewed and applied firmly. We
will agree these regulations with IMF staff along with a phase-in period with monthly
ceilings until full observance is achieved. This will be accompanied by a regime of
escalating penalties for noncompliance. Preparation of plans for all non-compliant
banks as at end-September indicating how compliance will be achieved throughout
the phase in period will constitute a prior action for completion of the review.

•

In the context of the application of the forex and liquidity regulations, the CBBH
Board has reduced the rate of remuneration of excess reserves with the possibility of
subsequent reductions.

In this context, the CBBH will maintain the present reserve requirements rate under close
review with IMF staff and will adjust that rate as necessary in consultation with them.
5.
Our fiscal stance in 2003 has been strongly supportive of these efforts to address the
adverse effects of rapid credit growth on the external balance. With tax revenue broadly on
track with program projections but somewhat below the original budget projections, we have
observed our aggregate quarterly spending ceilings to September this year and all the sub
ceilings under the performance criterion on borrowing from domestic banks. This has
allowed us to reconstitute KM 18.3 million (0.2 percent of GDP) in succession monies used
during 2002 to finance demobilization. Cantonal budgets have benefited in 2003 from a
strong increase in sales tax collection, reflecting improved tax administration, and are on
track to remain balanced this year without incurring new arrears, and the State budget has
also performed strongly due to better than projected own revenue.
6.
During the last quarter of 2003, we targeted to maintain spending below KM 268
million and KM 350 million in the RS and Federation central governments respectively. As
disbursements of credits from the World Bank and the EU were delayed into 2004, we
delayed completion of the reconstitution of succession monies until those disbursements

- 67 -

APPENDIX V

occur. In addition, neither entity will take unilateral action regarding the Human Rights
Chamber (HRC) decision that pensions should be paid from the entity in which they were
earned. But we will hasten efforts to ensure rapid implementation of that decision in
accordance with our “Action Plan.” And following slippages in November, no repetition of
the extension of the collection period for pension contributions in the RS will occur. On the
basis of strong own revenues, the State rebalanced its 2003 budget at slightly higher spending
levels than the original budget, without additional administrative transfers from the Entities,
and with borrowing limited to the CIPS project. Accordingly, we estimate that we secured an
overall fiscal consolidation of 2¾ percentage points of GDP from a deficit of 2.2 percent of
GDP in 2002 to a small surplus in 2003.
7.
By securing continued fiscal consolidation, this will maintain the necessary
counterbalance to the effect of credit growth on imports, giving the monetary and regulatory
steps outlined above time to moderate that credit expansion. And this consolidation will
allow us to continue appropriate abstention from new borrowing from domestic banks and to
place privatization receipts in escrow.
8.
Alongside these steps, significant fiscal structural reforms will be taken forward. The
Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) framework has been approved by the legislative authorities and
its head has been nominated. The unified customs administration is expected to begin
operations, funded from the State budget, in early 2004. The introduction of treasuries in the
Federation cantons has broadly progressed as envisaged, and all Cantons are expected to have
fully operational treasuries by February 2004. From October 2003 onward, the Federation
Central Government and Cantonal Finance Ministers have met each month to discuss fiscal
policy issues in the Federation. In the RS, we aim to implement treasuries in 5 pilot
municipalities by early-2004. We are also committed to improve the transparency and
financial management of RS Elekroprivreda, as agreed with the World Bank, and will review
the quasi-fiscal subsidy program it provides with a view to abolishing this program.
9.
We have also been concerned at reported double-digit wage growth in the non budget
sector in the Federation and by recent demands for unsustainable 30 percent increases in
budgetary wages in the Republika Srpska and large increases in other sectors. Pending a more
thorough review of wage determination arrangements and the quality of the wage statistics,
the Federation government will issue instructions through parent ministries to all state-owned
enterprises to moderate wage awards, while the Republika Srpska will accommodate
moderate budget wage increases largely funded from a mid-2004 restructuring of the salary
structure and downsizing the civil service and the army.
10.

To secure a sustained strong fiscal stance in 2003–04:
•

The RS will maintain civil service wage rates unchanged until after a civil service
reform including employment reductions, revision of wage scales, and reductions in
nonwage benefits for civil servants is fully implemented in April 2004. Any savings
generated by this reform can be used to increase wage rates, subject to ceilings on the

- 68 -

APPENDIX V

wage plus benefits bill (excluding severance pay) of KM 373 million (a 3 percent
increase over the 2003 outturn) in the 2004 budget, and subject to dismissals not
exceeding 4,000 people during 2004. To the extent that dismissals exceed 4,000, the
savings will be allocated to non-remuneration items. These figures imply that the
increase in average remuneration (wage and non-wage benefits excluding severance
pay) once the reform is implemented will not exceed 9 percent with respect to prereform remuneration.
•

The RS National Assembly passed a 2004 budget which anticipates excess spending.
In executing the 2004 budget, we will target a deficit on a commitment basis
excluding payments under the domestic debt settlement smaller than KM 26 million
(less than 0.7 percent of RS GDP). This will be achieved by delaying spending
authorization for some 0.7 percent of RS GDP until a mid-year review of revenue
performance (See Annex I). Delayed spending commitments will only be authorized
after that time to the extent that revenue excluding financing is on track to
overperform the budget estimates.

And we propose as prior actions:
•

The collection period for the November RS pension will not be extended beyond the
10th of December, a requirement we have observed.

•

An agreement will be reached between the RS, Federation, and State on entity
transfers to the State for 2004, to be incorporated in all three budgets.

11.
With monetary, regulatory, budget and wage policies thus calibrated to provide strong
support to the currency board, we intend to resolve a remaining public finance challenge to
it—namely the overhang of domestic claims on the government. Our commitment to prepare
a plan for this by end-June was frustrated by the complexity of the issue—pertaining to war
damages, various spending arrears, and frozen foreign currency deposits. Accordingly, and to
respond to the flow of lawsuits for settlement and the broader impediment the overhang
constitutes to our economic prospects, we have adopted—by publishing in our official
gazettes—a plan to achieve this goal. It specifies how court awards and pending cases will be
treated, commits to pay no more than 10 percent of GDP (KM 1.2 billion) of all claims in
order to secure fiscal sustainability—settling these with long bonds and cash from escrow—
and to write off the remainder, and anticipates adoption of the necessary legislative
framework by mid-2004 and to complete implementation of the plan thereafter. It has been
designed in accordance with the Conventions of the Strasbourg Court and the arrangements
under the plan reflect the priorities of the Entity governments. Execution of the plan has
begun in respect of budget wage arrears in the RS and pension and war invalid benefit arrears
in the Federation. The payment of cash for the admitted claims will be up to 1 percent of
GDP in 2004. The phasing of the cash payments in 2004 and thereafter will be determined in
consultation with staff in light of financing availability and macroeconomic considerations.

- 69 -

APPENDIX V

12.
We intend that 2004 will mark a decisive turning point in Bosnia’s economic
development. With the reconstruction phase coming to an end, stable governments with long
mandates, and the currency board secured by policies described above, it is time within that
framework to confront the key impediments to stability, growth, and employment. Doing so
will, we hope, set us securely on the path for eventual accession to the European Union.
13.
Our immediate reform agenda in this regard is reflected in our six-month “Action
Plan” to be completed by March 2004. Accordingly, we have focused our efforts on:
•

Passing the framework legislation for the ITA;

•

Accelerating privatization towards goals of issuing tenders for at least 5 strategic
enterprises in each Entity by the end of 2003;

•

Passing draft amendments of our bankruptcy laws to limit the priority given to labor
claims. We will accelerate efforts to complete the restructuring of the judiciary,
including the establishment of 16 commercial departments in the courts. Training
modules for judges, trustees and other managers of the bankruptcy courts are being
developed and we anticipate that intensive training will start in early 2004;

•

Appointing a Director and a Statistical Council for the State Agency for Statistics, and
pressing on with efforts to reduce red tape on business under the Bulldozer II
initiative;

•

Removing impediments to agricultural exports by strengthening the Veterinary Office
and Institute for Standardization.

These initiatives are only the first steps of a much more ambitious reform agenda that lies
ahead and which we are preparing.
14.
But these immediate structural reforms will take time to finalize and take effect. In the
meantime, our preparations for financial policies in 2004 reflect current structural constraints
on economic growth and the risk that some of these reform actions to slow credit growth
could be activity-impairing in the short-run. In this context, the key upside influences will be
the prospective recovery of agriculture from the 2003 drought and a strengthening in the
international economy. Accordingly, we project GDP growth in 2004 to strengthen from
3½ percent in 2003 to 5 percent, inflation to remain low at one percent and the external
current account deficit to decline by 2 percentage points of GDP, a first step towards an
ongoing correction anticipating declining aid inflows.
15.
With the monetary, regulatory, wage and structural initiatives getting to grips with the
external imbalance, our strong consolidated fiscal stance will be maintained in 2004. In
particular, the Republika Srpska and the Federation will execute budgets which reflect total
revenue, spending and balances on a commitment basis (excluding payments under the
domestic debt settlement) at or below those agreed with the staff, which cover our policy

- 70 -

APPENDIX V

commitments in the assessment of IMF staff. Thus, excluding one-off items, we anticipate a
small consolidated fiscal deficit in 2004, with this target being assured, in part, by
maintenance of the prohibition on new bank borrowing by cantons. With domestic financing
providing a bridge to foreign financing, reconstitution of succession monies used in 2002 will
be completed, and privatization and succession receipts will continue to be placed and held in
escrow in anticipation of the settlement of domestic claims.
16.

Alongside, we plan significant expenditure reforms.

•

Defense and other reforms will yield, at a minimum, 1 percentage point of GDP in
structural fiscal savings with severance packages funded from escrow. Severance
packages for the police and military will be at most an average of KM 6,000.

•

Customs administration and intelligence and key parts of defense operations will shift
to the state. Accordingly, the Entities and Brcko will transfer at least KM 94.3 million
to the State for its administrative functions during 2004, executed from the ITA once
the single revenue account is established. Additional administrative transfers may be
agreed as arrangements to transfer spending functions to the state are finalized
Spending at Entity level on these shifted functions will be terminated—ensuring that
consolidated spending does not rise as the functions shift. But savings from
rationalization of those functions will be returned to the Entities and Brcko in
proportion with their contributions. The State will freeze all new hiring for SIPA until
full agreement is reached between the Entities, Brcko, and the State on the transfer of
staff and funds.

•

In line with our resolve to curb wage growth and maintain a strong fiscal stance,
average budgetary wage rises in 2004 will not exceed 2 percent in the Federation, and
will be determined as discussed in paragraph 10 for the RS.

•

In the RS, we will review the funding arrangements for the health sector by mid 2004.
In the Federation, we will ensure fully transparent use of funds in the Road
Directorate, including the Cantonal directorates.

17.
Building on progress under the Stand-By since its initiation, a sea change in the
economic affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina has begun. The challenges immediately ahead
nevertheless remain daunting. We have signaled by our actions in office our intent to address
them. In taking those efforts further forward, we anticipate a continued close relationship
with the IMF.

ANNEX I

Pursuant to Chapter II, Article 7, Point 1 of the Law on Foreign Debt and Article 14, Point b of the
Treasury Law, and in the context of the fourth review of the program supported by a Stand-By
Arrangement from the IMF, the entity Ministers of Finance and the Minister of the Treasury of the
BiH Institutions have reached the following
AGREEMENT ON THE TIME SCHEDULE FOR THE PAYMENT OF RESPECTIVE
AMOUNTS FOR FOREIGN DEBT SERVICING AND ENTITY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR
THE FINANCING OF THE 2004 BUDGET OF THE BiH INSTITUTIONS
I

In order to ensure timely payment of foreign liabilities and 2004 liability projections arising from
foreign debt, in a total amount of KM 268.6 million, out of which KM166.6 milion is the Federation
liability and KM 102 million is the Republika Srpska liability, the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska shall pay the required amounts against each due liability,
5 days ahead of the respective maturity date.
II

Total transfers in 2004 for the administrative segment of the budget of the BiH institutions amount to
KM 90.48 million out of which KM 60.32 million is to be paid by the Federation and KM 30.16
million is to be paid by the Republika Srpska. Brcko District will transfer KM 4.056 million to the
State in 2004.
The transfer to the budget of the BiH institutions shall be paid on a monthly basis, ensuring that 1/12
(one-twelfth) of the total transfer shall be remitted for every current month. Payments will be made at
the latest by the 15th of each month for the liability of the previous month. Any delay in payments
shall be treated as violation of the conditions under the Stand-by arrangement.
III

By the 20th day of each month, the Minister of Finance and Treasury of the BiH Institutions will
provide a written report to the IMF indicating developments in transfers from the Entities to the State
for administrative and debt service purposes during the previous month, noting their consistency with
the commitments made in this agreement.
IV

Both Entity governments and the State government agree that the expenditure functions for customs
administration and intelligence service will be transferred fully to the State government together with
Entity budget allocations for these functions during 2004. The Federation government agrees to
transfer amounts budgeted for 2004 for customs and intelligence, respectively to the State pro-rated
on a monthly basis starting with the month the transfer of expenditure functions becomes effective.
The RS government agrees to transfer amounts budgeted for 2004 for customs and intelligence,
respectively to the State pro-rated on a monthly basis starting with the month the transfer of
expenditures functions becomes effective. Both Entity governments and the State government agree
that the central command structure of the military will be established at State-government level and
that the Federation and the RS will provide transfer to finance State-level central command.

- 75 -

ANNEX I

Transfers from the entities related to the establishment of State-level central command will be
executed in respect of the limits of the total expenditure envelope envisaged in each entity budget for
2004.
Brcko District agrees to transfer amounts budgeted for 2004 for customs to the State pro-rated on a
monthly basis starting with the month the transfer of expenditure functions becomes effective.
Before the transfer of the expenditure function for customs and intelligence services as well as the
military central command becomes effective, the Entities and the State government will sign a
separate protocol which will determine the modalities of staff transfers, including remuneration,
employment status, and other issues that the signatories deem relevant.
Republika Srpska government and the Brcko District agree to maintain the current arrangement on
provision of customs service, based on the signed Agreement between Republika Srpska and Brcko
District (No.01-483-1316/01, dated August 13, 2001) until the adoption of the Indirect Taxation
Administration (ITA) budget. The final solution for the financing of customs service will be
established in the context of the adoption of the ITA budget, and a protocol terminating the
Agreement between Republika Srpska and Brcko District will be signed in that occasion.
The State will freeze any new employment for SIPA until the State, Entities and Brcko District reach
an agreement on transfer of staff and funds for this institution.
Other Technical aspects of the realization of earmarked transfers to the institutions mentioned in the
previous paragraphs will be agreed among the BiH Minister of Finance and Treasury, Entity
ministers of finance, and the Brcko District.
V

BiH Council of Ministers, Federation BiH and the RS government will include explicit statements in
their 2004 budget documents that will reflect the substance of the agreements mentioned in Article
IV of this agreement. The appropriate allocation of expenditure on transfer of responsibilities and
functions from the entities to the state will be recorded through a rebalancing of the 2004 budgets.
The State government will seek a written agreement with Brcko District on the transfer for customs
services and its budget to the State.

ANNEX II

Delayed Spending List in the RS, 2004
The total of spending in the following treasury codes will be restricted KM 26 million below
the annual totals authorized by the RSNA during 2004. This will be subject to a mid-year
review. If domestic revenue, excluding financing items, is clearly on track to exceed the
budget estimate of KM 1,004 million, then these delayed spending items may be authorized
up to the extent that this domestic revenue exceeds the budget estimate––thereby preserving
the targeted budget balance.

Fourth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement and Request for Waiver of
Nonobservance of Structural Performance Criterion
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European and Policy Development and Review Departments
(In consultation with the Legal Department)
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and G. Russell Kincaid
February 20, 2004

1.
This statement reports information made available since the staff reports for the
Fourth Review of the Stand-By Arrangement and Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of
Structural Performance Criterion and the Article IV consultation were issued. This new
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
A. Observance of Understandings under the Stand-By Arrangement
2.
All indicative credit limits for end-December 2003, all continuous structural
benchmarks through mid-February, and—with agreement on the protocol on administrative
transfers to the state reached—all prior actions have been met (see attached updated Tables 1
and 2 of the SMEFP).
3.
At end-December 2003, most banks observed the corrective plans agreed with the
banking agencies in regard to foreign exposures, liquidity, and core capital, and fines were
levied on those which did not. Excluding banks under provisional administration, all but two
of 26 Federation banks and all Republika Srpska (RS) banks met the minimum capital
requirement of KM 15 million applicable at end-2003. Audits will be conducted by endMarch 2004 for those that did not observe the capital requirement.
4.
The RS authorities have proposed some minor changes to the list of “delayed
spending” for 2004.
B. Economic Developments and Policy Outlook
5.
Newly available data from partner countries on the merchandise trade balance in 2003
suggest that the external current account may have strengthened by a few percentage points
of GDP more than was indicated in the staff reports. Though customs data suggest a similar

-2-

adjustment, trends in exports and imports reported by the two data sets are very different.
Until these discrepancies in the composition of the trade balance are resolved, it is unclear
how reliable the reported improvements in the trade balance are.
6.
International reserves at the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH)
remained stable in January 2004, declining moderately in February.
7.
The Federation parliament has completed the first reading of the 2004 budget.
Amendments to the composition of expenditure are likely in the second reading, though these
are expected to respect understandings with staff on total spending. In addition, the 2004
spending ceilings will incorporate spending of some KM 12 million, (0.1 percent of BiH
GDP) for items which overran authorizations during 2003. The authorities target final
approval of the budget in early March. The 2004 budget for the State is expected to be
adopted by the State council of Ministers shortly, with approval by parliament slated for endMarch. Until then, both budgets are operating under standard “temporary financing”
provisions, whereby monthly spending is capped at 1/12 of the 2003 budgets.
8.
The RS preparations for their anticipated April 2004 wage reform have made
progress, albeit somewhat behind schedule. Necessary detailed wage data have been
collected for the bulk of government staff, excluding teachers, and broad options for a new
wage grid are under consideration. Preparations continue to identify individual staff to be
laid off, but progress in this area lags. If dismissals fall short of the anticipated 9 percent of
the workforce, the wage increases for the remaining workforce will be correspondingly
reduced.
9.
Decisions on detailed revenue allocation mechanisms for indirect taxes under the
Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) are expected in mid-March. In anticipation of that, the ITA
director is now assembling the necessary data on collections during 2003 as a basis for those
decisions.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina
On February 25, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.1

Background
Economic activity weakened somewhat in 2003 while inflation remained low. Real GDP growth
slowed to an estimated 3.5 percent from 5.5 percent in 2002 and 4.4 percent in 2001, as
manufacturing has all but stood still and drought has cut agricultural output by one-fifth.
Profitability appears to have strengthened in the Republika Srpska while deteriorating further in
the Federation. Consumer prices, anchored by the currency board, were unchanged in
January–September 2003 compared to the same period of 2002.
Credit to households soared in 2002, fueled by a rapid increase in bank deposits following bank
privatization and reverse currency substitution as euro notes were introduced on January 1,
2002. This boosted imports and raised the current account deficit by about 2.5 percentage
points of GDP towards 19 percent. After a policy tightening in 2003––a reform of required
reserves regime, strengthened application of bank liquidity, and foreign exchange exposure
regulations––credit to the private sector has begun to decelerate and the current account to
strengthen. With slower growth in credit, the lagged impact of a real appreciation of the Serbian
dinar in 2002, and further fiscal consolidation, the external balance strengthened by at least
1 percentage point of GDP in 2003.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

Fiscal consolidation continued by about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2003, taking the balance to a
small surplus. With revenue on track, both Entity governments kept a tight lid on spending.
Spending at State, Cantonal, and extra-budgetary fund levels has also remained under control,
with the latter two on track to achieve balanced budgets. The Entities continued to reconstitute
into the escrow accounts funds spent in 2002 for severance payments under the demobilization
program.
An impressive reform agenda is underway. First, a framework law on indirect taxation was
recently adopted that will strengthen the fiscal system by providing for immediate establishment
of a single indirect tax and customs administration and for indirect tax harmonization throughout
BiH. It also establishes joint Entity and State decision-making for indirect tax policy.
This package underlies plans to replace sales tax with value-added tax in 2005–06. Second, a
plan has been announced to restructure unsustainable domestic claims on the government of
more than 200 percent of GDP. Third, major defense reforms are anticipated for 2004,
centralizing command and control structures, continuing demobilization, and facilitating
accession to North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s partnership for peace. Fourth, the judicial
system is being overhauled, including a nearly completed exercise to selectively reappoint
judges and a new system of commercial courts. Fifth, since mid-2003, bank regulators have
stepped up enforcement of key liquidity and foreign exchange exposure regulations, with full
enforcement expected by mid-2004. At the same time, the authorities’ six-month “Action Plan”
of structural reforms signals their increasing capacity to take the lead in economic policymaking.
Furthermore, a European Union feasibility study has been completed, setting the stage for EU
accession negotiations to commence.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress during 2003 in maintaining growth
despite a severe drought, as well as the maintenance of price stability, the achievement of a
sizable fiscal consolidation, a decline in the external current account deficit, and an increase in
international reserves; all of which signaled the increasing strength of the currency board. They
also noted progress in institutional and structural reform, including the installation of a new
central bank board, the development of plans to reform indirect taxes and defense spending,
and to restructure domestic claims on the government. Directors cautioned, however, that many
challenges remain in maintaining macroeconomic stability and deepening structural reforms, in
particular in strengthening governmental institutions and corporate revitalization. These
challenges are compounded by an eventual decline in aid inflows and the need to continue
absorbing refugees.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain a strong fiscal stance in 2004,
which they viewed as contributing to a sustainable fiscal position and a reduction in the external
current account deficit, and bolstering the viability of the currency board. They cautioned,
however, that further fiscal tightening might be required in view of uncertain trends in the
balance of payments and domestic savings. They regretted the political and procedural
difficulties in approving the 2004 budget that had led to a significant delay in completing the
fourth review under the Stand-By Arrangement, and pointed to the challenges associated with

-3-

improving fiscal policy coordination and containing current spending, especially on wages and
pensions.
Directors were encouraged that a rapid expansion in bank credit is being contained, but
stressed that further restraint is necessary for macroeconomic stability. In this respect, they
highlighted the importance of firm implementation of monetary policies and regulations
introduced in mid-2003 that altered reserve requirements, and tightened bank core capital
requirements and foreign exchange exposure regulations. They noted that if the central bank’s
responsibilities are extended to banking supervision, the authorities should ensure that the
quality of regulation is maintained during the transition period. They encouraged the authorities
to put in place effective AML/CFT legislation.
Directors emphasized the critical importance of progressing on a broad range of structural
reforms in the private and public sector. They endorsed steps to improve governance of state
enterprises, including by reinvigorating privatization, and to put in place commercial legislation,
including a bankruptcy code, and commercial courts. They called for the authorities to move
quickly to structure voluntary debt workouts for state enterprises involving all creditors, and to
curb regulatory, legal, and tax impediments to business development. They also saw a need
simultaneously to reform labor market institutions to induce a more efficient use of labor. In this
context, they strongly encouraged reviewing wage and severance arrangements in order to
moderate wage growth and attain a higher rate of employment growth.
Directors emphasized the importance of strengthening fiscal policy and institutions. A top
priority is to develop the Indirect Tax Authority, which would administer the planned value added
tax, and to consider extending its responsibilities to coordinate fiscal policy in general. They also
supported tax reform to reduce the burden of taxation, especially on labor, and stressed the
need for greater efficiency in current spending to make room for public investment. They
welcomed the authorities’ plans to restructure domestic claims on government and to reduce
their net burden, and stressed the importance of implementing debt restructuring without delay,
thus paving the way for accession to Article VIII status.
Directors observed that deficiencies in statistics hindered macroeconomic policy making and
analysis, including in running the currency board, and the analysis of broader economic
developments. They highlighted the need for diligent attention to strengthening data collection.
Directors regretted the unilateral decision to delay, even briefly, full implementation of the
regional Free Trade Agreements, and underscored that this might impede the country’s
accession to the World Trade Organization. A few Directors also noted the importance and
possible revenue consequences of reducing tariffs.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

IMF Completes Final Review Under Stand-By Arrangement for Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Approves US$18 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth and
final review of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economic performance under its Stand-By
Arrangement with the IMF (see Press Release No. 02/35). With this decision, the Executive
Board approved the disbursement of SDR 12 million (about US$18 million). It also granted
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s request to waive non-observance of the end-June structural
performance criterion on amending bank regulations on foreign currency exposures, which were
subsequently issued in July.
The Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on August 2, 2002 totals SDR 67.6 million
(about US$101 million). So far, Bosnia and Herzegovina has drawn SDR 55.6 million (about
US$83 million). Following consecutive two-month extensions approved on October 7, 2003
(see Press Release No. 03/164) and December 31, 2003 (see Press Release No. 03/231),
the Arrangement will expire on February 29, 2004.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Anne Krueger, First Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to make significant progress in economic reform in 2003, by
sustaining economic growth, despite a severe drought, and bringing inflation down to industrial
country levels. A firm fiscal stance and a reduction in credit expansion led to a strengthening of
the external current account, supporting the currency board arrangement, which serves the
country well. An impressive structural reform agenda is underway and will support efforts at
macroeconomic control.
“The authorities’ commitment to maintain a strong fiscal stance in 2004 is critical as it will
contribute to a sustainable fiscal position and a reduction in the external current account deficit.
Further fiscal tightening might be required in view of uncertain trends in the balance of payments
and domestic savings. Difficulties in approving the 2004 budget point to the challenges in
improving fiscal policy coordination and containing current spending, especially on wages and
pensions. The April 2004 civil service employment and remuneration reforms in the Republika
Srpska need to be implemented with particular care.

-2-

“A rapid expansion in bank credit is being contained, but further restraint is called for.
The authorities need to firmly apply monetary policies and regulations introduced in mid-2003
that alter reserve requirements, and tighten bank core capital requirements and foreign exchange
exposure regulations.
“The recently adopted law on indirect taxation will provide for establishment of a single indirect
tax and customs administration, harmonization of indirect taxes, and a means to replace the sales
tax with a value-added tax in the next few years. In addition, the authorities have developed a
plan to restructure unsustainable domestic claims on government, and expect to achieve major
defense spending reforms in 2004. The installation of the central bank board in August 2003 and
improved banking regulation should contribute to a strengthened financial system.
“Although the authorities have already taken steps to invigorate corporate restructuring and
privatization of state enterprises, core tasks remain. The authorities need to resolve state
enterprise debt issues and take specific steps to remove regulatory, legal, and tax impediments to
business development. They also need to induce more efficient labor markets and strengthen
macroeconomic statistics,” Ms. Krueger said.
