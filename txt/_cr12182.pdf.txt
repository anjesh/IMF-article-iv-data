THE EUROZONE CRISIS AND THE SOVEREIGN-BANK NEXUS: THE CASE FOR A
EUROZONE BANKING UNION1

This paper argues that the creation of a common Eurozone financial stability architecture is
an immediate priority to restore the viability of the Economic and Monetary Union. A
Banking Union will prevent further financial fragmentation of the euro area, and will help
end the adverse downward spirals between sovereigns, banks and the real economy at play
in periphery countries. The Banking Union should have three main elements: a eurozone
deposit guarantee scheme, a eurozone resolution authority and a eurozone supervisory
authority. Many European authorities have called for the establishment of a “Banking
Union” to help restore financial stability and restart growth in the eurozone. The June 29
agreement of the EU Summit to present proposals for a single supervisory mechanism and,
contingent on its implementation, allow direct recapitalization of banks by the ESM
represents an important step forward towards a Banking Union.
A.

Introduction

1.
The euro area crisis has revealed the weaknesses of a framework where
responsibility for financial stability remains national. Faced by two related shocks after
the Summer of 2011 (a funding shock affecting large euro area banks; and stress affecting
weak sovereigns), the eurozone financial system has fragmented away from being area-wide
to being re-focused on national markets. The intra-euro area capital flight has created deintegrating forces in sovereign bond markets, interbank markets and lending and deposit
markets, thereby reversing the long-standing process of European financial integration that
was stimulated by the creation of the euro. This reversal has contributed to impair the
transmission of monetary policy in the eurozone. Meanwhile, downward spirals between
sovereigns, banks and the real economy are stronger than ever in the periphery. As a result,
national-based policies are increasingly precluded and collective solutions are becoming
necessary.
2.
The creation of a “Banking Union” is critical for the viability of the Economic
and Monetary Union. It will help break the adverse feed-back loops between sovereigns,
banks and the real economy by creating an institutional framework that provides common
backstops to restructure failed banks and enhance confidence in safety nets. Taking steps
towards a Banking Union will contribute in ending the ongoing financial fragmentation of
the euro area by reducing incentives to cut cross-border exposures. In the medium-term, it
will help minimize the probability of bank failures and the cost of resolution borne by taxpayers.

3.
The IMF has long argued that the EU needs a centralized financial stability
architecture. It was predicated on the need to keep pace with the rapid increase in the size of
European banks and with the integration of financial markets in Europe where cross-border
contagion can be substantial.2 It was also seen as a way to effectively address the
coordination and burden sharing issues arising when dealing with cross-border banks. This
centralized framework was envisaged to encompass a common resolution authority with a
common backstop, a common deposit guarantee scheme and a common supervisory
authority. Establishing such an architecture is even more important for the euro area where
(i) economic and financial integration is deeper than in the broader EU; (ii) downward spirals
between sovereigns and banks are stronger than elsewhere; and where (iii) monetary policy
is impaired by financial fragmentation.
4.
After the 2008 crisis, the EU took significant steps towards developing a supranational supervisory structure, but ultimate responsibility remained at the national
level. Following the recommendations of the de Larosiere Report, the EU introduced
elements of an EU supervisory structure by establishing the European Supervisory
Authorities – the European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets
Authority, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority –, and the
European Systemic Risk Board as the EU macroprudential oversight body.3 However, the
new agencies have limited powers and resources, which implies that ultimate competence
remains at the national level. The recent roadmap outlined by the European Council
addresses these shortcomings by calling for the establishment of a full EU Banking Union.
The outcome of the June 29 EU Summit is an important step forward by announcing an
agreement on proposals for the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism and, when
this mechanism is in place, on allowing the ESM to directly recapitalize banks.4
5.
The paper is organized as follows. Section B presents a narrative of the various
stages of the banking and sovereign crisis since the Summer of 2011. Section C characterizes
the downward spirals at play in periphery euro area countries. Section D describes the
process of financial de-integration within the euro area. Section E outlines the main elements
of a Banking Union that would help break the adverse sovereign-bank feed-back loops and
would end the financial de-integration of the eurozone. Section F concludes.

The Eurozone Crisis (July 2011–June 2012)

Stages of the crisis
6.
Initial shock: the eurozone crisis escalated in the Summer of 2011 when
wholesale funding markets for European banks began to freeze, and sovereign
borrowing costs of Italy and Spain began to rise significantly. The Euribor-OIS spread an
indicator of counterparty risk in unsecured interbank markets, rose sharply in August and
remained at high levels, reaching about half the

Contagion across markets: good collateral became scarce as funding demand
focused on secured markets. Large European banks highly dependent on wholesale funding
substituted short-term secured borrowing (repos) for unsecured borrowing, raising the
demand for good quality collateral. At the same

Deleveraging: European banks reassessed
their exposures to the Italian and Spanish
sovereigns. According to EBA data, large European
banks sold off more than €80 billion of bonds of
periphery sovereigns during January-September
2011.5 In the EBA sample, core euro area banks
were the largest sellers of Italian and Spanish
sovereign bonds while Italian and Spanish banks
were the largest sellers of sovereign bonds of the
program countries.

Impact of ECB interventions: determinants of banking stress before and after the LTROs
11.
Before the first LTRO, bank-specific stress was mainly explained by: (i)
sovereign exposures to Italy or Spain, or (ii) dependence on wholesale funding and large
activities in derivatives markets. Empirical analysis shows that, before the first LTRO,
banking stress –measured either by stock price returns or CDS spreads adjusted for market
movements—moved positively with stress affecting the Italian and Spanish sovereigns in
proportion to exposures to each sovereign. This co-movement was economically significant
for the very exposed banks, which were mostly domestic banks. When market uncertainty
and volatility increased, banking stress was also high for banks that are very active in

Reliance on wholesale funding or activities

significant causes of banking stress. This
suggests that the provision of long-term
liquidity by the ECB and significant purchases
of sovereign bonds by domestic banks has only
moderately reduced the link between sovereign
and bank performance in Spain and Italy, and
that concerns about banks in these two
countries has not abated.6

Because many European banks are large but remain
the responsibility of the home authority, this contingent
liability can jeopardize the sovereign balance sheet.7 The
Irish and Spanish crises are examples of bank bailouts that
turned out to be “Pyrrhic victories” for their sovereigns. These
two countries extended large financial support and the impact
on public debt has so far amounted to more than 40 percent and
about 20 percent of GDP respectively since 2008. In addition to
the direct impact of financial support on public debt, banking
crisis also substantially raise the borrowing costs of the
sovereign. Acharya et al. (2012) show that higher bank CDS
spreads before a bailout resulted in higher government CDS

spreads after the announcement of the bailouts.8 An event study of the Bankia bailout
suggests that such dynamics are currently at play in Spain: announcements related to the
take-over and recapitalization of Bankia by the Spanish government suggest a likely link
with the increase in the borrowing costs of the sovereign around each event (Box 2).
14.
Weak sovereigns also damage the balance sheet of domestic banks. Three main
channels are at play. First, as a result of home bias in portfolio decisions, domestic banks
usually have large exposures to domestic sovereign debt. Hence, sovereign risks directly
impact the market value of bank assets.9 Second, weak sovereigns can lose their ability to
honor their financial safety net obligations. This can adversely impact domestic banks
through: (i) the loss of the implicit (or explicit) sovereign guarantee;10 (ii) reduced deposit
confidence as domestic guarantee schemes (which are usually not pre-funded)) become less
credible. Third, the decline in the collateral value of sovereign bonds (as yields increase or as
higher margin requirements are applied after ratings downgrades) reduces the ability of
domestic banks to access secured funding or euro-system liquidity.11
15.
Banking stress adversely
damages the real economy by
raising the cost of credit. Banks
under stress may curtail credit supply
and raise lending rates to strengthen
capital buffers and increase internally
generated funds. Similarly, weak
economic performance and fragile
balance sheets of non-bank sectors of
the economy also affect bank
profitability as demand for new loans
falls, non-performing loans rise, and
deposit growth slows-down. To

The impact on the balance sheet may exceed the decline in the market value of government bonds, as restoring
market confidence may require banks to build higher buffers against total exposures. For this reason, the EBA
recapitalization exercise requested that European banks hold buffers against marked-to-market, available for
sale and held to maturity exposures to weak sovereigns.
10
For instance, the May 18th 2012 downgrade of 16 Spanish banks (including the 3 largest banks) by Moody’s
cited the deteriorating Spanish economy and the reduced creditworthiness of the government as motivation for
the downgrade.
11
Acharya and al. (2012) also show that higher government CDS was associated with higher bank CDS for
given bank ratings, and cite the example of Santander which experienced higher borrowing costs as the value of
the sovereign implicit guarantee deteriorated in 2010.

10
these factors, we run a panel regression of monthly lending rates in the four largest euro area
countries on average monthly bank CDS spreads (averaged by country), consensus forecasts
of real GDP growth (to account for general macroeconomic factors) and country fixed
effects, covering the period between 2010 and March 2012.12 The estimate suggests that a
150 bps increase in bank CDS spreads is associated with an increase in lending rates of 0.6
percentage points and 0.4 percentage points respectively for loans to non-financial
corporations and mortgage loans.13 This econometric association suggests that bank funding
stress can have substantial effects on loan pricing and credit supply.
16.
Weak sovereigns and a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook tend to reinforce
each other. In absence of fiscal risk sharing, a weak sovereign cannot implement
countercyclical fiscal policies when the economy is slowing down and may have to
consolidate in a downturn to restore confidence and lower debt levels. 14 In the process,
economic growth may be further weakened by the resulting compression of domestic
demand. Ambiguity of financial investors’ beliefs about the link between growth and fiscal
consolidation could make adjustment even more arduous.15

Financial Fragmentation of the EMU

19.
Before the crisis, sovereign risks of
periphery country were de facto shared between
core euro area and domestic investors. In
peripheral euro area countries, other euro area
residents were the main holders of public debt
together with domestic residents, thus creating de
facto some risk sharing of sovereign risk within the
EMU. For example, at the end of 2010, more than 75
percent of the foreign-held Spanish sovereign debt
was still held by euro area residents.
20.
During the crisis, sovereign bond markets
were the most deeply affected by the withdrawals
of intra-euro area cross-border capital flows. As a
result sovereign cross- border risk sharing diminished
while the divergence of sovereign yields impeded the
interest rate channel of monetary policy. In 2011 and
in Q1 of 2012, bond markets experienced a
withdrawal of intra-euro area cross-border capital of
€240 billion, a 24 percent reduction since end 2010),
closely followed by intra-euro area interbank markets
(where a sharp reduction of cross-border claims of
€190 billion occurred in Q4 of 2011 and Q1 of 2012).
The historical rise of non-residents holdings of euro
area sovereign debt was, therefore,

countries under stress. While the lowest lending
rates responded to changes in the policy rate, the highest lending rates moved in opposite
direction while tracking banking stress relatively well (as documented in section C).
22.
The de-integration of interbank markets is further disrupting monetary policy.
Overnight EONIA volumes have steadily declined since the start of the euro area crisis at the
time of the first Greece bailout in May 2010. EONIA average daily volumes are down to €20
billion at the end of May 2012 from €40 billion at the end of 2010 indicating continued
strains in unsecured markets. In the meantime, overnight bank deposits at the ECB have risen

13
to about €750 billion from less than €200 billion in
June 2011. Interbank markets have become
increasingly segmented along national borders and
the ECB is intermediating capital across national
borders. While net borrowing from the eurosystem
has remained high for the 3 program countries and
has sharply increased for Italian and Spanish banks,
Dutch and German banks continued to accumulate
large net claims on the eurosystem. Hence, private
markets have been replaced by fixed rate full
allotment of liquidity by the ECB.
23.
Insured deposits are declining in several
periphery countries, which adds to instability
concerns. Since end-2009, the cumulative decline in
the stock of insured deposits has reached €86 billion
in the three program countries. In Spain, Between
July 2011 and April 2012, insured deposits
(households and non-financial corporations) declined

Main Elements of a Eurozone Banking Union

24.
Establishing a banking union will strengthen the viability of the EMU by
delinking financial intermediation from the strength of the sovereign and by ending
financial fragmentation. It will help ensure financial stability by severing the feed-back
loops at play between sovereigns and their domestic banks. A banking union will also create
strong incentives to restore financial integration within the monetary union. Solid crossborder banking activities would help re-start growth by ensuring that healthy eurozone firms
can obtain credit from financial institutions, regardless of the strength of their sovereign. Last
but not least, a banking union, by stabilizing financial systems, will help ensure a smoother
transmission of monetary policy in weak countries.
25.
A common deposit insurance scheme with collective and credible backing by all
member countries should be established. Deposits are flowing out of Greece, but there are
concerns that deposit outflows could occur in other peripheral countries. The purpose is to
help delink banks and sovereigns where the latter cannot honor their safety net obligations.

14
Since national DGS are not pre-funded, weak sovereigns cannot credibly insure non-bank
private deposits. Moreover, national DGS, even if they were pre-funded, cannot reassure
agents that their savings are protected in euros.
26.
The European DGS could work as follows. The announcement should include a
clear timetable for the establishment of the DGS. The deposit insurance should apply to all
financial institutions, as restricting membership to only a subset of banks could risk
accelerating deposit withdrawals or shifts of deposits across banks. Ultimately, the scheme
should be partially pre-funded by a levy on the industry. But to be effective immediately, it
should have access to additional funding such as a credit line from the euro-system (similar
to the lines of credit of the FDIC with the Federal Reserve), or be backstopped by a common
pool of government resources – such as the ESM/EFSF or the possibility to issue a limited
amount of joint and several guaranty bills. The deposit insurance scheme should be
consistent with the best practices laid out in the 2010 EU Commission proposal to harmonize
national deposit guarantee schemes in the EU, including in term of coverage ratio, payout
speed, financing and cooperation and cross-lending with other EU deposit insurance, and
with the recently released Directive for an EU framework for the recovery and resolution of
credit institutions.18
27.
A centralized bank resolution agency with common financing would urgently
help achieve more efficient bank restructuring without threatening the sovereign
balance sheet. As observed in Ireland and Spain, weak sovereigns may not have the ability
to backstop their financial system on their own, which may affect ability to achieve costeffective wind-down of banks. Such detrimental feed-back loops must be broken. When
common resources are relied-upon, a central authority should be in charge of the
restructuring. A centralized solution would also help achieve efficient cross-border
cooperation when cross-border banks fail, by encouraging ex ante rather than ex post burden
sharing arrangements. As with the deposit insurance scheme, the resolution authority should
be backed by a common fund financed by an industry levy, and should have recourse to a
common pool of government-provided resources or a liquidity backstop from the ECB. In
this regard, to delink sovereign debt from bank restructuring costs, the EFSF/ESM facilities
should urgently be empowered with sufficient flexibility to directly recapitalize banks of
member states. To facilitate orderly wind-down of failing institutions, the powers of the
resolution authority should be consistent with the EC framework establishing strong and
harmonized resolution regime for credit institutions in the EU, including powers to bail-in
unsecured creditors to achieve burden sharing and powers emphasizing preparedness and
prevention.

Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the
recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (June 6th, 2012).

15
28.
A supra-national supervisory regime for large banks should support the
establishment of common backstops. A general principle for institutional design is that
financing and monitoring responsibilities should be aligned. 19 Having a common supervisor
would help align incentives with the common good rather than with the objectives of
“national champions”. Because of concerns about ring-fencing, different national priorities,
or a desire to protect home champions, national authorities have had incentives to refrain
from sharing information and cooperate in time of crisis. A supra-national approach would
help solve these coordination problems within the monetary union and the broader EU. This
would foster financial stability and help forestall further financial fragmentation. The
European Commission will present proposals for a single supervisory mechanism later in the
year. Several models can be envisaged.20 The ECB could play the role of eurozone
supervisory authority for all banks, balancing concerns related to its LOLR role and the need
to maintain monetary policy independence, and with some delegation of tasks to national
entities. An alternative model is a two-tier system in which the ECB or another body would
supervise large or systemic European banks while smaller, local banks would remain under
the oversight of national authorities.
29.
While other EU countries should be able to join, the banking union is urgent for
the euro area. Capital flight has dramatic consequences in a monetary union. Deposits move
easily with a currency area, and a Deposit Guarantee Scheme covering all euro area
depository institutions would help reassure retail depositors that their savings are safe across
the EMU. Along similar lines, a euro area bank resolution authority would help prevent the
strong bank-sovereign feedback loops to take hold within the currency union. The ECB could
play the role of common supervisor, and could be given explicit responsibility for financial
stability and full lender of last resort functions, thereby aligning these roles and eliminating
bank-sovereign linkages also present in the ECB’s current Emergency Liquidity Assistance
(ELA) scheme. The framework of the Banking Union should allow other EU countries to
opt-in and be consistent with the elements of a financial stability framework and regulations
established at the EU level.
F.

Conclusions

The eurozone architecture must be completed by creating a Banking Union. A
Banking Union would help delink sovereigns from their banks and would provide incentives
to various players to end the financial fragmentation of the eurozone. The Banking Union has
three main elements: a deposit guarantee scheme backstopped by common resources, a
resolution authority with access to a common fund and a supervisory authority. While a

Union?”, June 2012, Bruegel Institute.

16
Banking Union could operate without fiscal union, it will perform more effectively when
elements of a fiscal union providing a clearer framework for fiscal transfers are also in place.
The banking union is first and foremost a necessity for the euro area, but should be opened to
other EU countries.
31.
On June 29, the European authorities took important steps forward by agreeing
to pursue a key element of a Banking Union and changes in the use of the EFSF/ESM
resources. The European Commission will present proposals for the establishment of a
single supervisory mechanism that would involve the ECB, and, contingent on the the single
supervisor being in place, allowing the ESM to directly recapitalize banks. However, as the
EU Council is asked only to consider the proposals of the EU Commission by the end of
2012, the timing and speed of implementation of these proposals are yet to be clarified.
32.
Although the main elements the Banking Union are well identified, many key
details and the path towards the new architecture remain to be clarified. First, the pros
and cons of various possible models of a Banking Union must be weighted carefully to
ensure convergence on the most effective financial stability architecture. Second, a clear
roadmap towards the full institutional set-up must be prepared, with a clear understanding of
transitional and sequencing issues. In this respect, a fast implementation of EU Directives
and regulations (such as the bank resolution Directive and the CRDIV/CRR) would provide
the initial building block of the new framework, while the ESM/EFSF should urgently be
made flexible enough to allow direct equity injections into banks. Third, the path towards the
Banking Union cannot be dissociated from the current crisis response; choices in term of
banking stability are not independent from other dimensions, including those related to a
fiscal union. Fourth, it is essential to identify the aspects of the reform process that will have
the largest impact on market sentiment in the short-term. Fifth, the EU dimension remains
critical and any steps at the euro area level must be consistent with EU directives and
regulations and will require interacting with or reinforcing existing EU institutions (the
ESAs, the ESRB). Sixth, while the Banking Union will centralize powers and financing
responsibility, the subsidiarity principle will apply to determine the future role of national
authorities and their interaction with the supra-national institutions.

Box 1. Sources of Banking Stress July 2011 –June 2012
A panel regression analysis sheds light on the co-movements between bank and sovereign stress since July
2011. The sample contains weekly stock prices and CDS spreads of 58 banks between July 2011 and June 8th
2012, and is split in pre and post-LTRO. The sample of banks contains listed European banks which participated
in the 2011 EBA stress tests, while exposures are from the EBA recapitalization exercise. The main econometric

Before the LTRO, CDS spreads and equity returns of European banks co-moved positively with the stress
experienced by the Italian and Spanish sovereigns, in proportion of their exposures. Banks more exposed
to the Italian and Spanish sovereigns experienced

exposures to the Spanish sovereign.
Before the LTRO, banking stress also appeared higher for core EA banks very active in derivative
markets. Banks with higher derivative assets and liabilities experienced significantly higher stress in equity
markets when volatility soared between July and the end of 2011. The top 10 percent banks with the largest
activities in derivative markets experienced, at the mean change in the VIX, higher declines in weekly stock
price of about 2 percent on average before the LTRO. After the LTRO, as funding and derivative market
stabilized, these dimensions had insignificant impact on banking stress.
After the first LTRO, large exposures to the Italian and Spanish sovereign became indicators of bank
stress, irrespective of yields of CDS spreads movements for their sovereigns. Banks with the top 10 percent
largest exposures to the Italian and Spanish sovereigns (e.g. domestic banks) underperformed their peers in
equity markets by 3-4 percentage points weekly. Portuguese bank equity prices also started to commove with
domestic government bond yields. Surprisingly, equity market stress of banks with larger exposures to the
Spanish (or Greek) sovereign started to commove negatively with stress in government bond markets, perhaps
because higher initial exposures reflected higher losses through the PSI (Greece) or increased purchased of
Spanish government bonds by domestic banks already highly exposed. Higher activity in derivative markets or
higher reliance on wholesale funding was no longer a source of stress.

18
Box 2. Event Study: Bankia and Spanish Sovereign Borrowing Costs
The take-over of Bankia by the Spanish government provides a unique opportunity to assess the link from
bank to sovereign balance sheet. Bankia was established in December 2010 by the merger of seven savings
banks, and was initially owned by the holding company Banco Financiero y de Ahorros (BFA). In July 2011,
Bankia went public through an IPO of about €4 billion of shares. As of end 2011, BFA-Bankia was the fourth
largest banks in Spain with total assets of about 30 percent of GDP and the largest holder of real estate assets.
On May 7th 2012, Bankia Chairman Rodrigo de Rato stepped down while the government announced the takeover of Bankia. On May 10th, the government converted its €4.5 billion of preferred shares in Bankia’s parent
BFA into voting shares, thus obtaining a controlling stake in Bankia. On May 25th, it was reported that Bankia
had negotiated a further €19 billion injection. Spain had become the new focal point of the euro area banking21
sovereign crisis. Following the publication of the FSAP of the Spanish financial system, the Eurogroup
announced on June 9th its willingness to commit financial support to the Spanish government through an
EFSF/ESM loan of up to €100 billion for the
recapitalization of financial institutions.
113
113
The event study suggests that the Bankia episode
had a clear negative impact on the Spanish sovereign
borrowing costs. Focusing on windows of ±4 days
before and after each of the four events abovementioned, we find that sovereign borrowing costs (on
10 year government bonds) rose on average by 40 bps,
while spreads on 5 year sovereign CDS contracts rose
22
by 37 bps on average. This evidence suggests that
concerns about the fiscal cost of bailing-out a large
financial institution adversely affected the borrowing
costs of the Spanish government, possibly because of
the anticipated impact on the debt dynamics.

An alternative hypothesis for the increase in the
23
sovereign borrowing costs during these events does not appear to be supported by the data. A
deteriorating macroeconomic outlook could explain the increase in sovereign borrowing costs. Such a slower
moving concern could affect the sovereign directly (through the primary fiscal balance) and indirectly through
banks’ health. Two pieces of evidence provide limited support that the outlook explained the increase in yields
or CDS spreads during these events. First, during the month of April before the need to support Bankia became
headlines, the average increase of the sovereign yields (respectively CDS spreads) during similar windows of 9
days was “only” of 10 bps (respectively 15 bps). Second, on May 18th, Moody’s announced the downgrade of
the 3 largest Spanish banks (Santander, BBVA and La Caixa) by three-notches, and argued it was justified by
the deteriorating Spanish economy and the reduced creditworthiness of the government. The downgrade had no
visible impact on sovereign yields or on sovereign CDS spreads within 4 days of the announcement.

21

See for instance Christopher Bjork (25 May 2012). "Spain to Inject €19 Billion into Bankia, Troubled Lender
Says". The Wall Street Journal.
22
There was however no increase in CDS spreads following the announcement of the Eurogroup loan. This
could be expected since the loan by itself does not worsen the debt dynamics.
23
Other events during the period considered included various press reports of deposit flights, rumors of the
audits of Bankia, sovereign downgrades in April and June, and financial sector reforms announced on May 11.
The study does not control for concerns about elections in Greece.

II.

FISCAL INTEGRATION IN THE EURO AREA1

More fiscal integration with stronger governance and more risk sharing can reduce the
threat that economic shocks in one country endanger the euro area as a whole. The example
of other currency areas suggests that transfers, centralized provision of public goods, or
common financial stability backstops can be effective tools to mitigate regional shocks. But
risk sharing needs to be anchored in a powerful governance framework that provides for
better coordination of fiscal policies and limits moral hazard. The starting point of the euro
area is unique, but a clear roadmap towards a fuller fiscal and financial union could anchor
expectations. A limited and scalable introduction of common debt with appropriate
governance safeguards could support the creation of a banking union and signal a strong
intermediate commitment to a fuller fiscal union.
A.

The Case for Fiscal Integration in the Euro Area

Adjustment under a common currency
1.
In a common currency area, the burden of adjustment to idiosyncratic shocks
falls on factor mobility, price flexibility, and supporting financial and fiscal policies.
The literature (e.g., Mundell 1961, Kenen 1969) identifies labor and capital mobility, as well
as price and wage flexibility as key characteristics for an optimal currency area. Absent
exchange rate adjustments, internal flexibility is necessary to absorb economic shocks.
2.
Sharing fiscal risks and protecting against negative fiscal externalities are
valuable where economic adjustment to country-specific shocks is less than perfect.
Where labor mobility is low, intra-area capital flows are volatile, and structural rigidities are
impeding price adjustment and reallocation of resources, fiscal and financial policies will
have to take on some of the adjustment burden. Risk sharing2 tools can limit the impact of
regional shocks and help prevent contagion, and, if accompanied with appropriate
governance arrangements, can also safeguard against excessive debt taking of regions.
Where does the euro area stand?
3.
Limited labor mobility in the euro area impedes adjustment to idiosyncratic
shocks. If workers move in response to differences in wages and job opportunities, they
reduce disparities in unemployment rates and real wages across regions (see, e.g., World
Bank 2010; Sharpe et al., 2007). However, while there is some evidence that labor mobility
in the euro area has increased in response to the crisis, it remains fairly limited. Only about 1

In this context, risk sharing broadly includes those risks stemming from short term idiosyncratic real and
financial shocks as well as those associated with financial instability and slow structural adjustment.

percent of the working age population changes residence within their country in a given year,
and even less move between euro area countries. This compares to about 3 percent in the US,
2 percent in Australia, and slightly less than 2 percent in Canada (Figure 1). Obstacles to
labor mobility within the euro area include cultural and language barriers, distortions in
housing markets, limits to the portability of pensions, and, more generally, the absence of a
cross country social safety net.

Capital moves freely across the euro area, but is susceptible to sudden swings
that challenge financial stability. Free flowing capital can facilitate real convergence in a
common monetary area, and promotes the deepening of financial markets. At the inception of
the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the perceived absence of sovereign risk
contributed to rapid financial integration. Cross border credit increased rapidly with capital
flowing mainly from the core to the periphery. It was widely considered that the common
currency increased integration of financial markets, which would help smooth asymmetrical
shocks. But the vulnerabilities that rapid financial integration could harbor were overlooked,
as hopes of a “stronger and fitter” banking sector (ECB, 1999) did not materialize. By 2008,
however, financial integration reversed its course. Cross border investment positions
unwound quickly, core countries became recipients of net private capital flows (Figure 2),
and the cross border interbank market became impaired, posing challenges for financial
stability.

The lack of a common backstop for financial system stability generates adverse
feedback loops between the financial sector and sovereigns and fuels contagion.3 Absent
strong common regulation, supervision, resolution powers, and deposit insurance, all
supported by sufficient supra-national backstops, the integrated financial market makes
banking problems hard to prevent and contain. Given the size of national banking systems,
the resulting problems can overwhelm the fiscal capacity of individual sovereigns. At the
same time, banks have significant exposures to their sovereigns. Consequently, the sharp rise
in some sovereign risk premia, often coming on top of rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic
conditions, further fuels contagion.
6.
Wage and price flexibility in the euro area is limited, slowing the correction of
macroeconomic imbalances. Such flexibility is important to guide the reallocation of
resources in the event of idiosyncratic shocks. The euro area saw rapid convergence in
nominal interest rates since the mid-1990s, but price levels in the periphery picked up more
rapidly than in the core. This kept real interest rates at very low levels and fuelled demand in
periphery countries. Meanwhile, real convergence lagged behind as wage increases outpaced
productivity gains, contributing to large competitiveness gaps and growing current account
imbalances (see, among others, Mongelli and Wyplosz, 2009). Even after the crisis began,
with few exceptions (e.g., Ireland), prices and wages have not responded strongly to
deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, often because of prevalent labor market rigidities
(Jaumotte and Morsy, 2012 and Lebrun and Perez, 2011), contributing to a lengthy and
costly adjustment process.

22
Insufficient risk sharing and governance
7.
With market adjustment slow or incomplete, weak fiscal governance and lack of
fiscal risk sharing are particularly costly. The EU budget is small and was not designed as
a risk sharing tool. As a consequence, it provided little help to crisis-hit countries.4 At the
same time, the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) failed to encourage the creation of sufficient
fiscal space.5 Estimates suggest that strict adherence to structural targets during 2000-07
would have reduced debt by about 7 percent of GDP by 2007, all other things being equal
(Figure 3). As a result, with neither sufficient national buffers nor common backstops
available, shocks hitting any one member country could grow into a problem affecting all of
the area.

8.
In sum, the euro area can be characterized as an area with incomplete internal
adjustment mechanisms and insufficient policy coordination. In particular, the absence of
common fiscal and financial policy tools could not compensate for low factor mobility, high
nominal rigidity and poor fiscal coordination. And while the crisis brought the introduction of
ex-post risk sharing facilities, resort to EFSM/EFSF/ESM is an economically and politically
costly way of mutualizing risks after their realization that so far has failed to deliver lasting
improvements in confidence and financial conditions.

4

The EU budget collects contributions from and allocates funds to member states according to rules, for
example, the EU common agriculture and cohesion policies (from the expenditure side) and the current system
of contributions based on the VAT and GNI resources (on the revenue side). The allocation principles in the
common EU budget reflect primarily regional and redistribute concerns, not necessarily fiscal risk sharing.
5
Much of this was recognized early on. See Bornhorst and others (2012) for a review of the early literature on
the euro area. For example, Bordo and Jonung (1999) review the formation of currency areas and conclude that,
more often than not, political considerations explain the introduction of common currencies before the economic
criteria for an optimal currency area fulfilled.

23
B.

What Makes Currency Areas Viable?

9.
Among all the preconditions for a viable currency union, which ones have
proved most critical elsewhere? Existing currency areas feature a high degree of fiscal and
financial integration, often with strong governance requirements and formalized mechanisms
of ex-ante insurance against fiscal and financial risks that prevent contagion. The question is
which are essential institutional features that would be worth examining from an euro area
perspective.6
Fiscal risk sharing
10.
Common backstops for the financial system enhance financial stability. Such
frameworks usually include area-wide supervision as well as deposit insurance and
resolution frameworks with a common backstop. Besides multiplying the strength of regional
backstops, centralized backstops also prevent the emergence of (negative) links between
banks and sovereigns. In the U.S., for example, the banking sector is distributed
heterogeneously across states, but the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures
deposits regardless of the state of registration, and acts to resolve banks countrywide
(Figure 4).

Risk sharing mechanisms help smooth the impact of macroeconomic shocks.
These mechanisms typically include tax sharing arrangements and transfers from the central
to regional government, and feature in unitary as well as federal states.


6

While the institutional arrangements can differ, these transfers typically respond to
cyclical developments at the regional level, providing insurance against idiosyncratic
shocks as well as to income differences across regions (Figure 5).

For related discussions see, among others, Bordo et al. (2011) and Henning and Kessler (2012).

24


Staff analysis finds that, on average, a 1 percent increase in a region’s output gap can
lead to an increase in central government transfers offsetting between 5 and 20
percent of the income shock (Box 1). This is consistent with past findings that risk
sharing could smooth about 10 to 20 percent of regional income shocks (Melitz and
Zumer, 2002; von Hagen, 2007).



Such risk sharing can occur at different frequencies. Indeed, transfer for risk sharing
purposes might be difficult to disentangle from “redistributive” transfers aimed at
mitigating income differentials: what may look like an attempt to equalize incomes
across regions could be the sharing of fiscal risks resulting from slow-moving
technological and structural change or gradual shifts in the global environment.7

12.
In many currency areas, centrally provided goods and services act as an
additional insurance against risks. In addition to potential economies of scale, the central
provision and financing of public goods and services also entails an element of fiscal risk
sharing. This is because during a downturn a region’s relative tax contribution to finance a
centrally provided public good or service will fall, while the benefits from these goods and
services remain unchanged. Even though the degree of centralization varies reflecting
differences in preferences or historical and political developments (Figure 5), central
government spending is a significant share of general government in a number of countries.

Box 1. Risk Sharing and Redistribution
To assess the potential importance of fiscal risk-sharing through transfers within existing currency areas, this
analysis examines the extent to which central government transfers in large federations act as a regional
stabilization mechanism. The approach adopts the empirical framework by Rodden and Wibbels (2010) and
focuses on gross transfers from the central government. It excludes tax sharing arrangements or other tools of risk
sharing such as the central provision of public goods or services.
A panel regression is estimated for a sample of six federations, namely Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico
and the United States. The dependent variable is transfers from the central government to sub-national or regional
budgets, expressed as a ratio of state GDP. Two explanatory variables are considered:

 CGtransfers 

  1 * GDPpcit   2 * GDPgapit   i   it
GDP  it

where i and t indices denote regions and time, respectively, GDPpc is real per capita GDP, GDPgap is the output
gap, α are regional fixed effects, and  is an error term. Negative and significant coefficients for 1 and 2
quantify the relative weight of each of the factors driving fiscal policy decisions.
In all countries, transfers respond significantly to a variation in the regional output gap, offsetting between 5 and
20 percent of cyclical fluctuations. The hypothesis that gross transfers respond to the level of per capita income in
regions is, however, only supported in a couple of federations.

Strong governance
13.
Strong governance helps other currency areas overcome moral hazard. Risk
pooling naturally involves moral hazard and many currency areas complement fiscal risk
sharing with governance frameworks that limit regional fiscal sovereignty and encourage
fiscal behavior in accordance with commonly agreed standards.

26


A common element of fiscal integration is a center with area-wide tax authority. For
example, where public goods are provided centrally, the center usually has some
national tax authority over all regions.



Where transfers are a significant part of regional income, the center often has the
right to intervene more directly in the regions’ public finances.



Many federations use legally enforceable fiscal rules to ensure that regional fiscal
positions are sustainable (e.g., balanced budget rules for states in U.S., the debt brake
rule for Germany’s Länder).

14.
Risk sharing does not presume no-bailout. Bailout arrangements for subnational or
regional entities differ widely across currency areas: they can be formalized, occur ad-hoc, or
be explicitly banned (e.g., no-bailout clauses). Where bailout arrangements exist, their
deployment combines a loss of regional fiscal sovereignty in return for resources from the
center. In other settings, bailout mechanisms are absent. But where no-bailout clauses exist,
they are enforced against a background of effective risk sharing that ensures regional risks
are mitigated (e.g., through transfers and a common financial sector backstop) and a
minimum provision of (centrally provided) public goods and services.
15.
In sum, fiscal integration in other currency areas tends to combine risk sharing
and governance. Federal and unitary states take different positions along these two
dimensions. In unitary states (e.g., France, U.K.) revenue and expenditure policies are
determined mostly centrally for the entire territory and, as a consequence, a high degree of
fiscal risk is shared. Thus, for regions, external governance is high (or fiscal sovereignty is
low). By contrast, federation states (e.g., Germany, Switzerland, and the U.S.) are
characterized by a somewhat lower degree of both risk sharing and delegation to the central
government. Even lower degrees of risk sharing and external governance exist among
confederations where the currency is not common, such as European Union or the
Commonwealth of Independent States (see Figure 6 for a stylized illustration).
Figure 6. Dimensions of Fiscal Integration

What Are the Options for the Euro Area?

General considerations
16.
There are various approaches to designing fiscal integration. One approach would
follow the subsidiary principle and allocate all fiscal functions to the central level for which
the benefits in terms of economies of scale and positive externalities outweigh the costs. This
would have to be matched by adequate financing and democratic accountability.


Functions: A key central function would involve preserving economic stability
following idiosyncratic shocks, primarily by insuring regions against fiscal risks, and
providing a common backstop of the financial system.



Financing: A sufficiently sized central budget could match specific expenditure
programs with centrally controlled sources of taxation or other revenue. Extrabudgetary solutions could be used to finance specific central functions, for example
in the financial sector. Common borrowing could be used to support any of these
functions but could also offer ways of horizontal risk sharing between regions.



Accountability and governance: With fiscal devolution to the center, democratic
accountability would ensure that taxpayers have leverage on policy decisions. At the
same time, with moral hazard being part of any insurance or risk-sharing mechanism,
strong governance safeguards are needed at the regional level.

17.
Making EMU a more viable currency will require more integration, even if
convergence towards long term solutions can only happen with time. The starting point
of the euro area is unique. The crisis has revealed powerful diverging forces, and while
policymakers have responded with bold measures, the viability of the euro area is still being
tested. While no readymade blueprint exists, a credible roadmap toward a robust monetary
union will have to include intermediate progress toward risk sharing and a substantial
reorientation of sovereignty.
Intermediate steps toward risk sharing
18.
An effective immediate step towards greater risk sharing would be to provide a
common fiscal backstop for a banking union.8 Such a backstop, which could take the form
of common debt (see below), would resolve many of the exacerbating factors of the crisis:
among other things, it would help break the adverse feedback loops between banks and
sovereigns and prevent further financial market fragmentation. To align incentives,
delegation of responsibilities (e.g., for deposit insurance or bank resolution) would have to

Banking Union, Euro Area 2012 Article IV Consultation: Selected Issues Paper.

28
go hand in hand with delegation of oversight (e.g., supervision and resolution) to designated
common institutions.
19.
Common borrowing could provide such a backstop, ensure market access for
sovereigns under stress, and create safe assets for the banking sector. One option would
be the introduction of limited and scalable Eurobonds. Among the many proposals discussed
(see Table 1 in the Appendix) two are worth particular attention. One temporary approach is
to make countries responsible for their own future fiscal policies, using common borrowing
only to cover a certain amount of legacy debt, and reestablishing market discipline in the
longer term (e.g., the mutualization of debt in excess of 60 percent of GDP as in the
European Redemption Fund proposal). Another approach is to start with limited common
borrowing (e.g., Eurobills) that could be scaled up in the future. Alternatively, extrabudgetary approaches, for example borrowing for specific purposes, either through
established institutions (e.g., the European Investment Bank) or new projects (“project
bonds”) could also be considered. However, their benefits are limited because of the small
size and low degree of risk sharing they offer.
20.
Eurobills and the Debt Redemption Fund go some way in overcoming
implementation hurdles associated with changes in national and European law.
Common debt issuance can be designed in different ways (see e.g., IMF, 2012), but typically
involves far-reaching changes to the current political and legal arrangements in the euro area.
Against this background, proposals such as those of Hellwig and Philippon (2011) and the
German Council of Economic Experts (2011) can be implemented more expeditiously, and
could be a powerful vehicle to build trust:


Eurobills would be joint and several liability instruments with maturity of less than
one year, covering up to 10 percent of each country’s own GDP. Participating
countries would be unconstrained for long maturities, making Eurobills politically
palatable for strong creditors. Participation could be made conditional on meeting
fiscal targets. Based on mutual trust, Eurobills could be scaled up and/or their
maturity lengthened.



The Debt Redemption Fund implies the gradual transfer of debt exceeding 60 percent
of GDP into a fund for which EMU members would be jointly and severally liable.
Participating countries would repay its transferred debts within a total of 25 years.
The participation in the fund would be conditional on a debt reduction plan and the
adoption of structural reforms. To ensure creditworthiness countries would be
required to deposit collateral and earmark part of the tax revenues for fulfilling
payment obligations.

29
The need for more governance
21.
Regardless of the specific options chosen, the roadmap towards more fiscal
integration would also need to spell out the governance requirements. Partial schemes of
common borrowing are one safeguard against moral hazard. Other possibilities are collateral
mechanisms and stronger centralized governance.


Partial Eurobonds: Tranching under partial Eurobond schemes could mean that
countries enjoy lower average borrowing costs, while incurring higher marginal
borrowing costs when issuing beyond the common debt framework. This feature of
Eurobonds would make it easier to service outstanding debt and at the same time
create incentives to reduce debt, and mitigate moral hazard.9 Restricting common
debt issuances to short maturities and making participation conditional on fiscal
behavior would strengthen incentives not to deviate from agreed consolidation plans
debt because debt would have to be rolled over frequently.



Collateral mechanisms: Common borrowing in existing federations is often backed
by a federal government with capacity to levy taxes, reassuring investors that debt
will be paid back. By contrast, Eurobonds, along the lines discussed above, would
have no single treasury to back them—at least in the near future. To overcome the
lack of joint fiscal support, participants should commit collateral to guarantee future
payments. Present assets and/or future revenues could be used as collateral. Specific
(surcharges on) taxes or assets (e.g., currency and gold reserves) could be pledged for
that purpose.



Central governance: Recent reforms make stricter oversight of national policies
possible.10 Options to further strengthen governance include: time-bound
commitments to improve fiscal transparency; the obligation of periodically publishing
comprehensive fiscal risk assessments; time-bound commitments to improve
budgetary practices, including top-down budgeting, moving to accrual accounting
and conducting regular spending reviews; and the consent to annual auditing of
public accounts conducted by independent parties.

9

It has been argued that Eurobonds are one application of the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which says that the
value of a firm is not affected by the way its liabilities are structured, limiting the gains to be realized by
common debt. However, if joint and several guarantees succeed in shielding countries from being pushed into a
bad equilibrium, the underlying risk of participants would decline.
10
Fiscal governance is being upgraded since 2011 around the “six pack”, the Fiscal Compact, and the “two
pack” (see Fiscal Consolidation under the SGP: Some Illustrative Simulations, Euro Area 2012 Article IV
Consultation: Selected Issues).

30
D.

Conclusions

22.
A more viable EMU involves more fiscal and financial integration. In view of low
labor mobility and volatile capital flows, the euro area needs to embrace fiscal and financial
policies that entail a higher level of risk sharing to respond more effectively to idiosyncratic
regional shocks. Greater fiscal integration would help centralize macroeconomic and
financial stabilization, provide ex ante insurance against risks, and this would also signal
strong commitment to making EMU a closer union.
23.
Although getting to the endpoint of fiscal integration will take time, intermediate
steps should be considered. The limited but scalable introduction of common debt, with
appropriate governance safeguards would help break the adverse feedback loop between
banks and sovereigns, support the development of a banking union, and be a step towards a
closer fiscal union.

FISCAL CONSOLIDATION UNDER THE SGP: SOME ILLUSTRATIVE SIMULATIONS1
A.

Introduction

1.
The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) continues to be at the core of European
Union (EU) fiscal governance (Figure 1). The SGP was put in place in Maastricht to avoid
excessive deficits and debt levels. However, fiscal slippages during the first decade of the
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) led to high vulnerabilities during the crisis (Perez,
2011). To remedy past flaws, EU fiscal governance is being upgraded around a number of
reforms focusing on intertwined objectives. These include tighter national enforcement of
EU fiscal rules (implementation of the Directive on national fiscal frameworks under the
“six-pack” and automatic correction mechanisms under the “Fiscal Compact”); expanded
surveillance over internal and external imbalances (through the Excessive Imbalances
Procedure introduced under the “six-pack”); and enhanced EU oversight of national
budgetary processes (“two-pack”). Underpinned by these complementary processes, the SGP
occupies a central role in the EU fiscal framework.
2.
Both the scale and speed of consolidation in EMU countries are influenced by
SGP rules. Bringing debt ratios down to safer levels will require a sustained period of
adjustment. The key question is whether the pace of consolidation driven by the SGP is
appropriate in the face of a weak outlook.
3.
This paper quantifies the output effects from fiscal consolidation implied by the
SGP. To this aim, we propose a conceptual framework in three steps. First, we take the April
2012 WEO as our baseline for fiscal consolidation.2 Second, we quantify the gap between
fiscal plans under this baseline and the SGP targets (in structural terms) keeping GDP at
WEO levels (i.e. no multiplier effects are at play). Third, using the IMF’s dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium model—the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF)—we
simulate the output effects of that fiscal shock. In short:
Step 1: We choose as baseline scenario the April 2012 WEO.
Step 2: We quantify the fiscal shock as

2012.

The shock and simulation results presented in this paper take into account the fiscal plans adopted or specified in sufficient
detail at the time of the elaboration of the April 2012 WEO forecasts. Since then, some countries have announced additional
measures.

fiscal consolidation path projected in the WEO, for a given GDP (at WEO values).

4.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Building on EU legislation and
discussions with the European Commission (EC) during the 2012 Article IV Consultation,
Section B outlines the order of prevalence between the various SGP benchmarks and
quantifies fiscal consolidation needs relative to the April 2012 WEO. Section C subsequently
presents the associated output loss under different sets of assumptions. From the different
scenarios, it is evident that the effects of fiscal consolidation depend largely on the
composition and credibility of fiscal packages, as well as the ability of monetary policy to
cushion the fiscal tightening. We therefore conclude with a number of policy
recommendations (Section D).

A Characterization of SGP Regimes

5.
Since its introduction in Maastricht, the SGP system has become increasingly
complex (Table 1). Countries are: required to converge to the 60 percent of GDP debt
benchmark; prohibited from breaching the 3 percent of GDP deficit threshold; and mandated
to improve the structural deficit to GDP ratio at an average rate of 0.5 percent per year. In
addition, government spending is constrained to grow in line with trend GDP. This raises the
question of the order of prevalence between the existing rules, complicating the task of
quantifying the fiscal shock implied by the SGP.
6.
To disentangle the order of prevalence between rules, we assume the strictest
criteria apply. EU regulations and discussions with the EC suggest that where there is an
overlap between rules, countries would be subject to the strictest benchmark. This rules out
the possibility of over-determination and makes it possible to calculate SGP consolidation
paths in an unambiguous manner.

Over the WEO horizon, we assume compliance with the rules follows a threestage process. All fiscal commitments, independently of their nature, are translated into
deviations from the WEO in terms of the structural deficit to GDP ratio.3 Two regime
switches operate during the WEO projection period, from the overall to the structural deficit
benchmark; and from the latter to the debt reduction criterion. The relevant fiscal regimes
can be summarized as follows:


EDP phase. Countries currently under Excessive Deficit Procedures (EDP) are
expected to deliver structural adjustments needed to

objectives (MTOs).4



1/20th debt benchmark. Three years after exiting the EDP, structural balances will
improve by 0.5 percent of GDP per year or more, if so required by the 1/20th debt
benchmark. This benchmark ensures an annual pace of debt reduction no less than 5
percent of the gap between the observed debt level and the 60 percent of GDP target.
EU authorities will first verify compliance with the debt rule in a backward-looking
manner and then in a forward-looking manner for countries breaching the first
criterion (Figure 2).

8.
Overall, planned fiscal efforts in the EA fall significantly short of SGP
requirements. For the euro area as a whole, the additional consolidation amounts to 1
percent of GDP over 2012-17, nearly half of which would be frontloaded over 2012-13
(Figure 2). For the analysis here, we split euro area countries into two blocs: those countries
with acute fiscal sustainability issues (high-debt5 or HD), comprising Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain and Belgium, and those countries with less acute fiscal sustainability issues
(low-debt or LD), comprising the rest of the euro area. Additional consolidation needs in the
HD bloc (at around 2.2 percent of GDP over the WEO horizon) are five times as large as in
the LD bloc (at 0.4 percent of GDP over 2012-17). Across countries, the additional fiscal
effort is the highest in Spain, mainly as a result of requirements under the EDP. In contrast,
Germany, Cyprus and Estonia have no additional adjustment as the WEO path is consistently
more demanding than requirements under the SGP. Among the larger euro area countries,
additional consolidation is particularly frontloaded in Spain and the Netherlands.
C.

The Output Effects from Fiscal Consolidation under the SGP

Assumptions
9.
The impact of fiscal tightening on economic activity will depend on the
underlying simulation assumptions. First, the composition of the fiscal adjustment makes a
big difference, with multipliers being typically larger for spending-based consolidations.
Second, the monetary policy reaction function is an important factor as multipliers are higher
when interest rates are constrained by the zero lower bound. Finally, the credibility of fiscal
packages also affects multipliers through anticipation of the future benefits of consolidation.
This last effect may be substantial in some cases.
10.
In practice, however, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding these
assumptions. Information on the composition of the adjustment on a country basis is not
readily available and it is difficult to predict over which time horizon monetary policy in the
euro area will be constrained by the zero lower bound. Also, governments’ credibility in
delivering fiscal commitments is at stake and risk-premium effects are inherently difficult to
quantify when spreads are very volatile and an increasing number of countries face punitive
yields.
11.
Faced with these uncertainties we carry out a number of illustrative simulations.
These are intended to illustrate the possible response of the economy under three different
scenarios rather than aiming at an accurate representation of the economic reality (Table 3):


5

Scenario 1: Myopia and growth-friendly consolidation. Under this scenario, the
consolidation package is tilted towards measures that have strong effects on

For the purposes of the simulation the high-debt group includes countries with debt projected to be above 85
percent of GDP by 2017.

40
households’ current disposable income, but little negative impact on factor supply
and potential output. We further assume fiscal plans are not credible per se, but rather
that credibility needs to be established by action. In particular, agents do not perceive
the government’s commitment toward consolidation as permanent but rather expect
measures to revert back to baseline levels in each period. However, they change their
beliefs ex post, once they verify past fiscal measures remain in place. This is meant to
portray an economy where, due to a general lack of confidence in the future, agents
base their decisions on short-term considerations. With regards to monetary policy,
the zero-interest floor is assumed to bind over the 2012-17 period. To gauge the
magnitude of spillovers, we run two variants of this scenario featuring joint and
stand-alone consolidation (i.e. undertaken by the HD or LD groups separately).


Scenario 2: Credibility and growth-friendly consolidation. The assumptions mimic
scenario 1 except that agents are not myopic, i.e. changes in the structural balance are
perceived as permanent as of the year of implementation. As a result, agents
incorporate the long-term benefits of the consolidation already undertaken (lower real
interest rates and future debt service costs) in their expectations. However, fiscal
changes are not anticipated and do not affect behavior until they actually occur (i.e.,
absence of full Ricardian equivalence).



Scenario 3: Credibility and growth-unfriendly consolidation: A variant of scenario 2,
this is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the composition of the
fiscal consolidation, with a package biased towards high-multiplier measures. In
particular, fiscal efforts are switched (i) from consumption to corporate taxes; (ii)
from government consumption to public investment; and (iii) from general transfers
to transfers targeted to households with a high marginal propensity to consume. As
empirical evidence shows (see, e.g., OECD, 2010 and the references therein),
corporate taxes have the highest distortionary effects amongst revenue measures; on
the other hand, government investment shrinks potential output and cuts in targeted
transfers reduce the income of households whose marginal propensity to consume is
equal to one.

Simulation tools and Output Effects from Additional Fiscal Consolidation
12.
The simulations are conducted for the two euro area country groupings with the
GIMF model. 6 The analysis uses a general equilibrium framework applying a six region
version of GIMF, with the euro area split into the HD and LD blocs, the US, Japan, emerging
Asia, and a bloc encompassing the rest of the world. GIMF models both liquidity constrained
and finite-planning horizon households. This provides non-neutrality in both spending- and
revenue-based measures, which makes the model particularly appropriate to analyze the
stabilization role of fiscal policy in the short term.
39

13.
Country-specific effects are examined using the G35 model.7 The G35 model is an
estimated structural macroeconometric model of the world economy, disaggregated into 35
national economies, including 11 euro area countries.8 Within this framework, each economy
is represented by interconnected real, external, monetary, fiscal, and financial sectors.
Spillovers are transmitted across economies via trade, financial, and commodity price
linkages.
40

41

14.
Even with a growth-friendly consolidation package, the output effects are sizable
(Figure 3). Under scenario 1, output in the euro area is 1 percent lower than baseline by
2017. This implies a cumulative output loss of 3½ percent throughout 2012-17. The fairly
large multiplier stems from negative spillovers (around 40 percent of the loss) and the
inability of monetary authorities to ease the policy rate (20 percent of the loss). As expected,
the HD bloc experiences the largest losses—1.4 percent of GDP by 2017 (cumulatively 5
percent over 2012-17)—mainly reflecting the scale of the additional fiscal adjustment
required. On the other hand, losses among the LD bloc of 0.8 percent by 2017 (cumulatively
3 percent over 2012-17) are largely caused by spillovers from the HD bloc (given their
relatively high propensity to import from the LD countries).
15.
The aggregate results conceal considerable cross-country heterogeneity. Due to
contractions in domestic demand, cumulative output losses are highest in Spain (at around 10
percent), closely followed by Portugal (at almost 8 percent), largely caused by substantial
spillovers from fiscal tightening in its neighboring country. Negative spillovers are also
sizable in small open economies like Belgium, Finland and Ireland. Somewhat surprisingly,
Greece experiences positive spillovers from fiscal adjustment in other euro area countries.
This is because a joint consolidation in the euro area reduces the world demand for
commodities and improves Greece’s terms of trade. As Greece is a relatively closed

economy, this improvement in the terms of trade outweighs the reduction in its external

Multiplier effects dramatically change with credibility and fiscal composition
assumptions (Figure 4). With myopia (scenario 1), private households and firms are so
concerned with the short-term impact of fiscal retrenchment that they neglect the positive
income effects arising from future lower tax liabilities when making their consumption,
employment and investment choices. For a given composition of adjustment and the zero
lower bound constraint, the 2017 GDP loss in the euro area is considerably reduced if fiscal
plans are credible (scenario 2), falling from 1 percent to 0.3 percent of GDP. On the other
hand, the multiplier effect is more than doubled when consolidation remains credible but
becomes growth-unfriendly (scenario 3). In this case, the 2017 GDP loss in the euro area
relative to the WEO amounts to 0.8 percent, against 0.3 under credible but growth-friendly
consolidation. Cumulative losses in the euro area throughout 2012-17 amount to -1.5 percent
under scenario 2 and -3.1percent under scenario 3.
17.
The output decline might be higher than implied by our simulations because of
the current state of the economy. Recent empirical work suggests that fiscal multipliers are
larger when there is excess capacity (see, for example, Batini et al, 2012; and Baum et al,
2012). This could arise from tighter credit constraints, the need to repair balance sheets, and
higher precautionary savings.

Policy Perspectives: How Can the Output Loss from Additional Fiscal
Consolidation Be Mitigated?

18.
The SGP rules should be applied flexibly to accommodate unexpected events.
The appropriate pace of consolidation should depend on the state of public finances and
growth, and the monetary policy stance. Given uncertainties surrounding these
developments, consolidation strategies that adjust for new information can be welfare
improving. In this context, the recent shift of focus towards structural targets under the SGP
is very appropriate.
19.
Where financing conditions permit, the pace of fiscal consolidation should take
into account the current adverse conditions. With limited scope for monetary policy to
mitigate output losses from fiscal tightening, negative output gaps, and joint consolidation
efforts, multipliers are likely to be larger than normal. Furthermore, multipliers might
increase with the size of consolidation.9 Hence, in the current context, to the extent that
market financing remains available at reasonable rates, adjustment should occur at a steady
pace defined in cyclically-adjusted terms and should avoid heavy front-loading.
42

20.
The composition of fiscal adjustment should be tilted towards growth-friendly
measures. Where adjustment needs are very large, countries will have to act both on the
revenue and spending side. However, given the high spending levels prevailing in many
European countries, consolidation should focus on the spending side, targeting in particular
those areas where multipliers are low or where spending is most inefficient.
21.
Reforms that underpin credibility are essential to limit output losses from fiscal
tightening. Our findings suggest that, by raising agents’ expectations about the positive
(future) income effects of consolidation, credible policies can reduce multipliers in the short
term and act as a substitute for heavy frontloading. Anchoring adjustment in well-specified
medium-term plans is key. A responsible implementation of automatic correction
mechanisms under the Fiscal Compact will be important to safeguard durable fiscal efforts.
22.
Finally, monetary policy should accommodate the consolidation. The simulations
suggest significant output losses if monetary policy does not provide support. When the zero
bound is binding or if conventional interest rate cuts are less effective than normal, this
implies unconventional monetary policy stimulus may be needed.

POSSIBLE SUBORDINATION EFFECTS OF EUROSYSTEM BOND PURCHASES1
A.

Introduction

1.
The debt restructuring in Greece in February-March 2012 effectively extended
senior creditor status to Eurosystem bond purchases. By mid-February 2012, the ECB
and Eurosystem central banks (henceforth ECB) swapped their Greek bonds acquired under
the Securities Market Program (SMP) for new bonds of identical structure and nominal
value, with different serial numbers. This provided the ECB an exemption from the
subsequent private sector debt swap under so-called private sector involvement (PSI),
effected through retroactive collective action clauses.2 By swapping its debt purchases in
advance of the PSI announcement, the ECB effectively received preferential (i.e., senior)
creditor status on its Greek bond holdings.3
2.
According to the ECB, this exemption from PSI was “special” because its bond
market interventions were undertaken solely for monetary policy purposes. Treating Greece
as a special case may imply that the subordination of private debt holders will not be
repeated in other contexts. At the same time, the ECB has cautioned against incurring losses
on the SMP, which could –in an extreme case– require recapitalization of the central bank
and result in reduced financial independence.
3.
Currently, a key question is whether the SMP has become less effective after the
Greek PSI exemption–or even earlier–due to subordination risk. This treatment of the
ECB may effectively have reshaped the seniority structure of all official holdings of
sovereign bonds. From a market risk-return perspective, this implied a possible mispricing
of many euro area bond markets leaving future SMP beneficiaries subject to rating
downgrades as ECB interventions reduce the private investor base and increase losses in the
event of restructuring. Anecdotal market evidence indeed confirms that the impact of SMP
purchases has become controversial, although this may already have been priced in prior to
the Greek debt exchange in February 2012. Indeed, after the euro area summit of heads of
state and government on July 21, 2011, when PSI for Greece was first announced,

The PSI invited Greek debt holders to exchange their existing holdings for new debt at a face amount of 31.5
percent and cash-equivalent EFSF notes with a 2-year maturity at 15 percent of the face amount. In contrast, the
ECB received the full face (par) value of the Greek bonds which it had purchased in the markets at a discount on
the face value (about €40bn versus €55bn face value) and would also benefit from future coupon payments on
these new bonds.
3
In addition, also Greek bonds purchased by Eurosystem central banks for investment purposes and European
Investment Bank holdings were exempt from PSI.

48
subordination effects were already under consideration.4
4.
At the same time, while the SMP helped to temporarily reduce stress in
government bond markets, due to the limited scale/time horizon of its effective use, it
did not appear fully effective (see Figure 1).

ECB President Trichet stated in an interview in the Süddeutsche Zeitung on July 22, 2011 on PSI: “It goes
without saying that the governments will have to redeem their bonds that are on the balance sheet of the
Eurosystem without any change. Of course, being part of the official sector, we will not be participating in the
voluntary private sector involvement mentioned on Thursday as regards Greece.”

prices and CDSs. Finally, the paper offers some tentative policy conclusions. The main
finding is that the impact of ECB seniority is primarily related to perceived probability of
default and the proportion of outstanding debt already in the hands of the central bank.
Moreover, credibility of SMP interventions matters.
B.

Empirical Evidence on ECB Subordination Risk

6.
Insufficient data make it difficult to quantify the subordination risk from ECB
debt purchases directly. ECB debt purchases under the SMP were largely put on hold after
the PSI exemption. Only one SMP intervention took place afterwards, in the week of March
5-9, 2012 for an amount of €27 million, the fifth-smallest intervention since the start of SMP
purchases in May 2010, based on weekly Eurosystem financial statements. Hence, there is
insufficient quantitative evidence to establish empirically the relation between subordination
risk from ECB debt purchases and sovereign yields.
7.
However, an event study analysis of ECB news on its senior status can provide
some gauge of subordination risk.5 In this context, innovations in bond yields and CDS
premia in the days surrounding the July 22, 2011 ECB statement (see footnote 4) and the
ECB debt swap on February 16, 2012 are examined. Following MacKinlay (1997),
standardized cumulative abnormal yields and CDS spreads are estimated (in first
differences). The underlying model is ΔYi = ai+bi ΔYLCH + ciΔSovX and ΔCDS = di+eiΔSovX,
where Yi denotes the government bond yield in country i, CDS is the sovereign credit default
swap spread, YLCH is the LCH Clearnet benchmark 10-year yield on AAA countries and
SovX is the SovX Western Europe CDS index. Standardization makes it easier to compare
cumulative abnormal yields/spreads. The models are estimated using 70 daily observations
with data up until one month ahead of the event, in order to avoid coefficient bias due to the
events.
8.
The results show little impact of the ECB debt swap on periphery yields, but the
initial PSI announcement and the ECB’s non-participation did have substantial shortterm negative effects. The market effect of the ECB, as a large creditor, shifting to a
preferred debtor status, did not seem significant when evaluated around the time of the debt
swap announcement (Figure 2). However, this appears to reflect the fact that this may have
been anticipated and priced in by the market already. Indeed, longer-dated periphery bond
yields and CDS default risk premia seem to have risen unexpectedly following President
5

In addition, one could analyze the spread between subordinated and senior bank debt CDS premia, given the
close co-movement between bank CDSs and sovereign CDSs, as a proxy for sovereign subordination risk. This
would shows that the introduction of PSI under the draft ESM Treaty in November 2010 and its effective use in
Greece as agreed in July 2011 and reaffirmed in October 2011 raised subordination substantially, more so than
the actual ECB debt swap in February 2012. However, this spread may be confounded by bank-specific
conditions (e.g., shares of subordinated debt) and country-specific legal considerations (related to bail-in and
resolution regimes; currently under discussion by the European Commission (EC, 2011 and 2012).

50
Trichet’s public statement that the ECB would not be participating in the voluntary Greek
PSI on July 22, 2011 – one day after an important euro area summit had agreed on modalities
of additional support for Greece (including PSI) and on greater flexibility of EFSF loans to
the other program countries. In the days ahead of the summit, bond yields and CDS default
risk premia had come down substantially, but this was reversed after the ECB’s statement –
although it cannot be excluded that markets may have been disappointed by some other
summit-related news (for instance, the realization that size of the EFSF was not increased
and large implementation risks).

Theoretical Approaches to Quantifying Subordination Risks

9.
It is possible to incorporate the subordination effect in a closed-form bond price
model or in a reduced form CDS model. In both models, the subordination effect depends
on three factors: probability of default, loss given default (one minus recovery rate), and the
share of ECB bond holdings.
Sovereign bonds–closed form model
Figure 3. Two Cases for Original Price q=60 (ECB Share=50%)

10.
ECB seniority matters when the
recovery rate is not close to zero or to
100 percent. For example, suppose a
country’s debt trades at 60 cents to par
before establishment of the ECB’s senior
creditor status (Figure 3). This could
reflect market estimates of 40 percent
default probability with 100 percent loss
given default (i.e., zero recovery value)
and 60 percent (non-default) probability

51
of full repayment. In this case (case I), seniority does not matter because upon default, no
single bond holder is repaid. However, a pre-announcement price of 60 cents is also
consistent with another case: 80 percent default probability with 50 percent recovery (case
II). In this case, seniority matters. For example, if the ECB’s share is 50 percent, the ECB
can recover all its claims at face value because the country will repay first 50 percent of the
total debt to senior creditors. For the ECB, the ex post (shadow) price of the bond becomes
the full value. For private bond holders, the defaulted

The net impact of subordination thus
depends on three major factors:





6

Probability of default (PD). This increases
linearly with the subordination effect, i.e., the
difference between the original price and ex
post price (after subordination). Figure 4 (top
panel) plots this effect over various default
probabilities for a range of ECB debt market
shares. Evidently, the larger the ECB market
share, b, the lower the market price ex post for
any given PD.
Loss given default (LGD). If large, then
having the senior status does not translate into
a large advantage. Also, for a small loss given
default, senior status is not valued much since
even junior creditors could recover a large
portion of the face value. The overall effect—
the difference between the original price and
ex post price—is thus not monotonic. Figure 4
(middle panel) illustrates this effect for an 80
percent default probability and various ECB
market shares over various LGD values.

Note that this is not an independent third factor-but rather an attribute of loss given default: the higher the ECB
share, the lower the recovery rate (or higher LGD) for private bond holders.

52
is small relative to the original recovery rate, even with the ECB expecting full
repayment, the loss on private sector holdings will be limited. Therefore, the
difference between the original price and the ex post price will be small. In contrast,
when the ECB holds a large share relative to the recovery rate, the ECB’s senior
status will lower the ex post recovery rate for the private sector dramatically. Figure 4
(lower panel) shows that this effect is monotonic but not linear. In particular, when
the ECB’s share is larger than the original recovery rate, there is a kink, above which
private bond holders will not receive anything ex post in bad states of nature. Note
that what is important in pricing the bonds is the expectation of the ECB’s share
including future SMP. Increases in the expected ECB share (or related uncertainty)
can create further negative effects.
12.

SMP purchases thus have two main effects on bond prices and yields:



Raising subordination risk. The rise in yields for distressed sovereigns at the time of
announcement of a debt swap (in favor of the ECB) reflects a net expected transfer of
value from private bond holders to the ECB. This subordination will also undermine
the effects of any future SMP purchases because sovereigns will face higher issuance
cost on any bonds not purchased by the ECB.



Improving liquidity. To the extent that the SMP improves liquidity conditions, it
would reduce the probability of default and hence increase the value of residual
bonds. This happens when the ECB provides vital liquidity to the market, and
ultimately to peripheral governments. Investors would be reassured that the ECB is
willing to smooth out temporary liquidity shocks. Also, a lower interest rate could
decrease the default probability by improving debt sustainability. This beneficial
effect would be enhanced by a credible and clearly communicated SMP intervention
strategy.

Therefore, the net impact of the subordination versus the liquidity support effect on bond
prices is ex ante ambiguous.
CDS–reduced form model
13.
Along the same lines, CDS pricing implicitly reflects liquidity and seniority
effects. CDS and bonds should be perfectly cointegrated, as they are assets with exactly the
same cash flow and thus the same price.7 At the same time, the CDS model allows
illustrating the role of SMP interventions somewhat differently and illustrates the role of
credibility in SMP interventions (although this is also implicit in bond prices). More
specifically:
7

Note, however, that the CDS-bond basis may widen due to credit tightness or relative margin requirements
(see, e.g., Garleanu and Pedersen (2011)).

53


Liquidity effect. Starting from a standard CDS pricing formula, SMP interventions –
by lowering sovereign yields, assuming the intervention is credible and sustained (see
below) – reduce the cumulative probability of default (PD), which has a non-linear
(but less than proportional) impact on CDS spreads:
CDS = LGD x (1 – (1- PD)1/n)
where n denotes the number of periods



Subordination risk. Due to perceived
senior creditor status, SMP purchases may
increase private sector loss given default
(LGD) and possibly offset the lower
probability of default.

14.
LGD for private bondholders increases
with debt restructuring needs and the size of
ECB holdings. Intuitively, in case of a debt
restructuring, the LGD will depend on how much
debt/GDP reduction is needed (ΔD/GDP) and on
the participation rate. Using this fact, official
sector holdings have a non-linear impact on
expected private sector loss given default/haircut.9
If the ECB is expected to be exempt from PSI, as
in Greece, a higher ECB share of debt holdings, b,
will increase the private sector haircut or LGD.

Combining these elements gives:

LGD = (ΔD/GDP)/(1- b)
This makes it clear that the negative effect of SMP purchases rises progressively with an
increase in debt as it entails larger haircuts (see top panel of Figure 5).
Substitution in the previous equation yields
CDS = (ΔD/GDP)/(1- b) x (1 – (1- PD)1/n)
This shows that an increase in the share of SMP purchases b increases CDS spreads but more
strongly so when CDS prices are already high (i.e, when PD is more elevated) and to a

Note that the use of PDs abstract from the debate on real world versus risk neutral probabilities. As shown in
Bilal and Singh (2012), there may be substantial differences between the two.

limited extent when CDS premia are low, i.e., only when default or restructuring fears come
into play (see lower panel of Figure 5). When putting this in a dynamic context (although not
explicitly done in this model), the beneficial effect of SMP interventions can be shown to
hinge on the ECB’s credibility of its SMP intervention strategy: subordination may lead to
self-fulfilling default dynamics (upward shift of the PD line), if, similar to models of
currency crises, the central bank’s purchases are not able to offset the increased private
sector loss given default owing to the ECB subordination effect. This may occur when the
ECB is not able to lower spreads (or yields) which would otherwise help improve debt
sustainability and contribute to lowering the PD (or at least keep the PD unchanged).

Conclusions

15.
This SIP illustrates that the SMP may have a subordination effect, but this effect
will be important only at the margin-as was the case in Greece- and depends on the
program’s credibility. The rise in yields for the most distressed sovereigns at the time of
announcement of the ECB’s exemption from the Greek PSI reflected a net expected transfer
of value from private sovereign bond holders to the ECB. This de facto subordination may
undermine future SMP interventions because sovereigns may face higher issuance cost on
any bonds not purchased by the ECB. As shown theoretically, this subordination effect
depends on three factors: probability of default, loss given default and the share of ECB bond
holdings. At low default probability levels, when LGD is relatively low and the debt market
share of SMP is not too high, subordination risk plays a limited role. This is also borne out
by the analysis in a CDS model, where further SMP interventions have a negative effect only
when adjustment needs are very high or CDS spreads are already extremely high. The latter
also helps to illustrate the importance of the ECB’s credibility on the SMP: if it is low, SMP
interventions may be unable to stop self-fulfilling debt default dynamics. This may occur
when the ECB is not able to reduce sovereign spreads or yields, which would otherwise
support debt sustainability and be conducive to lowering the PD.
16.
Should anything be done to accommodate market fears about subordination by
SMP purchases? SMP subordination currently does not seem to play a large role in pricing
and markets. However, in principle it is possible to attenuate market fears about SMP
subordination (beyond what is captured in our stylized models) by transferring some of the
benefits for the ECB back to private sector bond holders.

Annex. Valuation of Sovereign Bonds with ECB Senior Creditor Status
Ex ante: ECB pari passu with private bond holders
Suppose a country’s debt is trading at 60 cents on the euro (q0). This, for instance, could
reflect market estimates of 80 percent default probability (PD) with 50 percent loss given
default (LGD, i.e., upon default, the country can repay half of the total face value of bonds).
The overall discount is 40 percent, beyond the risk-free discount, which is assumed to be
zero. This means that, if the total face value F is 100 million euro, then the total market value
V0 is 60 million euro. These relationships can be captured by the following simple valuation
equation:
V0 = (1 – PD*LGD)*F,
and the price that trades at is q0 = V0 / F.
Assume that the ECB’s share is b percent of the total outstanding. Then, b percent of the
market value is held by the ECB and the rest is by the private sector. The values of ECB’s
holding VE0 and the private sector’s VP0 are
VE0 = b*V0,
VP0 = V0 – VE0,

and
respectively.

For example, if the ECB holds 20 percent, the value of ECB’s holding is just 20 percent of
the original market valuation V0. The price (q0) is unchanged to any level of b.

Ex-post: ECB as senior creditor
What if the ECB becomes a senior creditor? As shown below, the effect on existing debt
depends on the share (b) of the ECB. Note, however, that what is important is the expectation
of b from the future SMP. And, uncertainty about b can create further distress.
When the ECB was shielded from the Greek bond exchange, private sector’s claims suddenly
became subordinated. This lowered the value of bonds left in the hands of the private sector.
Amid expectations that the senior status would be granted to the ECB regarding other Euroarea government bonds, their prices should also fall (i.e., yields went up). The degree of price
decline varies with three factors: the probability of default PD, the loss given default LGD,
and the ECB’s holding share of the outstanding bonds b.
The reason why ECB’s claim depends on its holding share is that its b percent holdings of
bonds are now repaid before the private sector’s claim. The private sector’s claim is only the
residual:
VP1 = V0 – VE1.
If its face value claim is less than what the country can repay, the ECB’s claim would be
fully guaranteed; that is, its’ loss given default (LGDE1) would be zero. Otherwise, the ECB
would take all the repayments although it only owns b percent of total outstanding.

LGDE1 = 0 ,
= 1 – (1 – LGD)/ b,

if b (1 – LGD).
otherwise.

The ECB’s holding is theoretically valued at VE1 by using the loss given default that the ECB
faces:
VE1 = (1 – PD*LGDE1)*b*F.
And, the (shadow) price that the ECB faces is
qE1 = 1 – PD*LGDE1.
The price that the private sector pays is now changed to the ratio of their valuation to the face
value of the bonds that they possess,
qP1 = VP1 / (1 – b)F.
