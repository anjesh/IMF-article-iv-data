Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Guinea

x

The discussions on the 2004 Article IV consultation were conducted in Conakry during May 11-23, 2004,
in parallel with World Bank and African Development Bank missions. The staff team consisted of Mr. van den
Boogaerde (head), Ms. Nkusu, Mr. Blavy, Ms. Babihuga (all AFR), Mr. Verreydt (WHD) and Ms. HotobahDuring (Staff Assistant-AFR). It was assisted by Mr. Jones, the resident representative in Guinea, and
Mr. Barry, the resident economist.

x

The Guinean representatives included Mr. Madikaba Camara, Minister of Economy and Finance;
Mr. Mohamed Daffé, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea; Mr. Eugène Camara, Minister
of Planning; and several other Ministers and senior officials. The mission met also with the Minister SecretaryGeneral at the Presidency, members of the National Assembly, the financial and business community,
representatives of NGOs, the donor community, and the press.

x

Guinea has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Nonetheless, over the past year, the authorities have intensified multiple currency practices.

x

In December 2000, Guinea reached the decision point and was eligible for debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative, and started to receive interim assistance. However, owing to poor performance under the
PRGF-supported program, interim assistance from Paris Club members, the Fund, and the African
Development Bank was suspended in 2003.

x

At the conclusion of the previous Article IV consultation on July 16, 2003, Directors expressed concern that
expansionary fiscal, accommodative monetary policies, and an inflexible exchange rate policy aggravated
macroeconomic imbalances, raised inflation, and lowered international reserves. They urged the restoration of
fiscal and monetary discipline and a deepening of structural reforms to foster economic growth and reduce
poverty.

x

Guinea’s political and security situation remains uncertain and fragile. President Conté was reelected in
December 2003 for a new seven-year term, in elections boycotted by the opposition and criticized by most
observers. A new government team was formed in March 2004, but the new Prime Minister resigned on
April 30, citing difficulties in implementing reforms. On the security front, concerns remain over the instability
in the region, especially in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire, and the continued presence in Guinea of armed Liberian
ex-rebel fighters.

x

Guinea’s relations with the IMF and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II and
statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III. Statistics are weak in Guinea, with major deficiencies in
balance of payments, national accounts, price, and external debt data. Progress has been made in recent years,
including with technical assistance from the Fund and AFRITAC-West, but further improvements are needed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Guinea’s economic situation worsened in 2003 as GDP growth slowed down, reflecting
exogenous shocks, inconsistent macroeconomic policies, and a significant decline in
investment. Lax fiscal and accommodating monetary policies led to accelerating inflation. A
continued de facto fixing of the official exchange rate resulted in a widening spread between
the official and the parallel exchange rates and a loss in reserves. Progress on structural
reforms also slowed down. Macroeconomic instability impaired poverty reduction efforts.
Important downside risks cast a shadow on the outlook for 2004 and the emergency
program adopted in March 2004 will be insufficient to ease inflationary pressures.
Growth is expected to remain relatively weak, at around 2.6 percent. In addition to rigorous
fiscal policy and a tighter monetary policy, liberalizing the exchange rate and advancing
structural measures are key to restoring a sound macroeconomic environment.
The medium-term framework should include sustained reform efforts to secure strong
growth and poverty reduction, as the ex-post assessment report highlights. The report
stresses the need for: (i) commitment at the highest level of government to a long-term
development strategy, (ii) early and decisive progress in implementing structural reforms,
(iii) improving governance, and (iv) setting realistic macroeconomic objectives.
With sound policies, the staff and the authorities agreed that the economy could return
to a growth path of 5 percent by 2006, in line with the objectives of the poverty
reduction strategy (PRS). Fiscal policies would increase revenue collection, gear
expenditures toward social outlays, and strengthen public expenditure management, while
monetary policy would strive to control inflation. The exchange rate would remain marketdetermined. An acceleration of structural reforms—including improving basic infrastructure,
addressing governance issues, enhancing financial intermediation, and advancing
privatization and trade liberalization—would promote private sector-led growth
The authorities finalized their first PRS progress report following a participatory
process involving civil society. While Guinea remained committed to its PRS and progress
was noted in social sectors, in particular education and health, sustained strong growth will
be needed to achieve the goals of the strategy. The more realistic revised macroeconomic
framework is a welcome step in that direction.
The absence of a mechanism to prevent the rates in the official and parallel exchange
markets from diverging by more than 2 percent and the recent administrative
allocation of foreign exchange have given rise to a new multiple currency practice
(MCP). The staff do not recommend Board approval of Guinea’s MCP.

These unsatisfactory developments moved Guinea to the bottom of regional
economic performance (Box 1).1 On average between 1998 and 2002, Guinea outperformed
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and West African Monetary
Zone (WAMZ) member countries. However, in 2003, Guinea became the worst performer in
the regional context, except for higher average inflation in WAMZ countries due to the rapid
price increases in Ghana.
3.
Economic performance is expected to remain weak in 2004. Real GDP growth is
projected at around 2.6 percent, in light of the poor economic performance during the first
quarter of the year and the lags for the more rigorous policy to translate into an economic
recovery. In May 2004, inflationary pressures eased somewhat, to 9.4 percent year-on-year,
owing to temporary factors, including an unsustainable freeze on domestic petroleum product
prices.

Monetary policy was highly
expansionary in 2003 and the first quarter
of 2004. With a limited use of T-bills, the
substantial government deficit was, to a large
extent, financed by central bank credit.
Moreover, the issuance of sterilization bills
was inadequate to control bank liquidity and,
accordingly, reserve and broad money increased

4.
Fiscal policy slippages persisted
in 2003 and little progress was made in the
first quarter of 2004. A one percent of GDP
revenue shortfall, coupled with a 1½ percent of
GDP overrun in current spending,2 led to a
widening of the fiscal deficit (commitment
basis, including grants) to 5.1 percent of GDP
from 4.4 percent in 2002 (Table 4). In the
absence of external budgetary assistance, this
deficit was financed by an accumulation of
arrears and by increased borrowing from the
banking system. The 2004 budget envisaged a
tightening of fiscal policy (a primary surplus of
2.1 percent of GDP) and reduced borrowing
from the banking sector. However, budget
implementation in the first quarter of 2004 was
poor. Revenue registered a 0.6 percent of annual
GDP shortfall due to poor collection efforts and
use of an overvalued exchange rate to value
imports. The shortfall was accommodated by
expenditure curtailment covering domesticallyfinanced investment and nonwage spending in
the social sectors.

Defense accounted for about 50 percent of the overruns, which the authorities attributed to
the need to reinforce border security to prevent rebel incursions from unstable neighboring
countries. The balance included spending associated with the run-up to the December 2003
presidential elections. There was an almost 0.5 percent of GDP shortfall in nonwage current
spending in social sectors.

significantly, reaching 27.4 percent and 35.3 percent,
respectively, at end 2003 (Table 5). In the absence of
external budgetary assistance, the net foreign assets
of the central bank declined and were negative at
end-December 2003, at US$ -10.4 million. Real
interest rates were negative for most of the year,
reflecting a wait-and-see attitude from commercial
bank managers, who believed that the recent rapid
pick-up in inflation would be reversed soon and
were wary of the impact of higher (deposit and
lending) rates on their profit margins. In the first
quarter of 2004, there was a further loss in net
official reserves and rapid increase in credit to
the government. Reserve money increased by
25 percent on a twelve-month basis to
March 2004.

in the judicial system. Because of reinforced
supervision, provisioning of nonperforming
loans improved from 83.7 percent in
December 2003 to 86.6 percent in March 2004. The foreign exchange exposure of domestic
banks is low, limiting the direct risk of the financial sector being destabilized by exchange
rate variations.

The authorities continued to de facto peg the official exchange rate of the
Guinean franc against the US dollar. The official rate depreciated only marginally
until July 2004. The spread between the official and parallel exchange rates remained
above 20 percent during the second half of 2003 and widened further to around 25 percent
by mid-2004. Notwithstanding the stickiness of the official rate, during the 12-month period
ended April 2004, the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated on average by
11.8 percent, largely because of the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro.3 The real
effective exchange rate depreciated by only 0.4 percent reflecting the acceleration in inflation.
8.
The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) narrowed to
4 percent of GDP in 2003, from 5.6 percent in 2002 (Figure 1, Table 7). This narrowing is
mainly due to a decline in imports of intermediate and capital goods associated with the sharp
fall in investment. This more than offset a fall in exports, reflecting the continued downward
trend of bauxite shipments, notwithstanding increased shipments of alumina and diamonds.4
Foreign direct investments fell to very low levels because mining and other investments were
deterred by corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency. There was a near absence of official
budgetary support because of donor discontent with policy implementation and governance
issues. Reflecting the above-mentioned factors, as well as an overvaluation of the official
exchange rate, gross international reserves of the central bank5 dropped to US$138 million
(1.5 months of imports) at end-2003 compared with US$170 million at end-2002. External
arrears at end-2003 amounted to US$18 million and increased further in early 2004.6
9.
Progress in the structural reform area slowed down. On the fiscal front, the
authorities prepared the draft legislation for the adoption of WAEMU’s common external
tariff (CET). They continued their efforts to better monitor government cash-flow by closing
most of the extra budgetary accounts and transferring all non-project accounts from deposit
money banks to the central bank. In the monetary area, the banking and microfinance laws
have not yet been adopted, and the computerization of the banks’ accounting plan was not

Countries in the euro area and the West African Monetary Union account for over

The large rise in diamonds exports is believed to reflect a better recording of these exports
since the introduction in 2003 of national export certificates in line with the 2002 UN
Resolution on Conflict Diamonds.
5

There is a question mark over the degree of liquidity of official reserves, given the
difficulties Guinea has had recently in meeting its debt service obligations. This matter would
be clarified by implementing the safeguards assessment mission’s recommendations.

Guinea has a record of being in short-term arrears to the Fund, which has worsened
recently, with 11 occurrences since the beginning of 2004.

completed, although most of the background actions were implemented. The recapitalization
of the only bank in difficulty is still pending. While progress has been made toward adoption
of international accounting standards, there were further delays in the implementation of the
main recommendations of the safeguards assessment mission (special audit of the central
bank’s reserves, set up of an audit committee, and financial audit of the central bank).
10.
The authorities finalized their first PRSP progress report in April 2004,
following a participatory process involving civil society. They provided an update of the
medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the strategy in June 2004. The report
notes that while Guinea was able to make progress in the social sectors, the deterioration in
the macroeconomic environment has significantly impaired the achievement of the PRS
targets.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. The Ex-Post Assessment Report7
11.
The main conclusion of the Ex-Post Assessment (EPA) report is that Guinea has not
yet been able to sustain consistent implementation of a long-term development strategy. The
main lessons are the need for: (i) ensuring ownership and commitment at the highest level of
government at the onset of any program; (ii) encouraging early and decisive progress in
raising fiscal revenue and implementing structural reforms; (iii) paying more attention to poor
governance; and (iv) setting realistic macroeconomic objectives and incorporating ex ante
contingency plans as a precautionary cushion should new risks materialize. These lessons
guided the policy discussions with the authorities on the way forward. The authorities were in
agreement with the main thrust and conclusions of the EPA, except for small reservations.8
They recognized that Guinea must change its behavior and persevere in its adjustment efforts.
B. Immediate Policy Challenges and Outlook for 2004
12.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the continued pursuit of past policies
would result in a worsening of the economic situation. The authorities indicated that their
immediate challenge was to strengthen policy implementation to slow down inflation and
7

See Ex-Post Assessment Report of July 7, 2004 (www.imf.org).

They indicated that increases in fiscal revenue would come only gradually given the
large role of the informal sector in economic activity, and that the slow pace of structural
reforms under the second PRGF (2001-04) was partly due to limited progress in terms of
increased production and employment generation from the first wave of reforms. Also, they
suggested that in assessing performance, the Fund pay greater attention to country-specific
considerations, notably the hostile regional environment that Guinea had faced.

- 12 -

normalize relations with donors to facilitate access to the much needed external finance that
would help advance the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy.
13.
Cognizant of the urgent need to take corrective measures and reflecting their
desire to reengage more meaningfully with the Fund, the authorities adopted an
emergency recovery program in March 2004. Key elements of the package are: cuts in
expenditure;9 respecting rigorously the expenditure commitment procedures; improving
revenue collection by curtailing exemptions and strengthening fiscal administration; and
tightening monetary policy. The authorities emphasized that it would be very difficult to
make up for the revenue shortfall of the first quarter. Under the circumstances, the
original 2004 budget was revised to extend the revenue shortfall and the spending curtailment
to the year as a whole, albeit with defense spending exceeding earlier projections. The
authorities indicated that the fiscal adjustment underpinning the revised budget represented
the maximum they could accommodate in the short run without hampering the government’s
ability to provide minimal public services. The overall deficit (commitment basis, including
grants) would be limited to 2.6 percent of GDP.
14.
The mission acknowledged the difficulty of realizing short-term adjustments
beyond what is currently envisaged and encouraged the authorities to persevere in
implementing their emergency program. It indicated that, while the implementation of
such a program will be a step in the right direction, it would not be sufficient to ease
inflationary pressures as initially envisaged.10 The mission urged the authorities to pursue the
strict expenditure control implemented since April and to ensure that unprogrammed
resources that may become available be used to reduce government indebtedness to the
banking sector.11 Also, the mission and the authorities agreed that monetary policy should be
significantly tightened by active open market operations and ensuring that the budget deficit
is financed through issuance of treasury bills, as this would avoid the direct expansion of base
money by way of central bank advances to the government.

9

Including a curtailment of nonwage spending on social sectors.

10

The mission and the authorities estimated that to get inflation on a clear downward path
in 2004, base money growth should not exceed 10 percent, implying a bank financing of the
budget deficit limited to 1.2 percent of GDP. Considering the currently projected deficit and
the need to reduce external payment arrears to normalize relations with donors, this would
entail financing more than half the deficit by the nonbank sector or reducing the deficit itself
by more than one half. The former is very unlikely and the latter is not realistic.
11

Such resources could come from a better-than-envisaged revenue performance or from
privatization receipts.

- 13 -

15.
In light of the problems highlighted above, economic performance in 2004 is
projected to be weaker than envisaged at the time of the 2003 Article IV consultation.12
Real GDP growth at 2.6 percent is only half the rate projected earlier. The envisaged fiscal
consolidation is reflected in a slower growth in broad money.13 However, end-2004 inflation
is expected to rise somewhat reflecting the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation
(including through the upward adjustment of administered prices). The external current
account excluding grants is projected to narrow further to 3.7 percent of GDP as a low
investment rate continues to subdue imports. Owing to the lack of external budgetary
assistance and the low private capital flows, official reserves would decline further to
1.2 months of imports, from 1.5 months in 2003.
C. Exchange Rate Policy
16.
The staff indicated that the rationing of foreign exchange with regard to imports
and the use of multiple exchange rates constitute a new exchange restriction and a new
MCP, and that it would not recommend Board approval of such practices.14 The lack of
a mechanism to prevent the rates in the official and the parallel markets from diverging by
more than 2 percent constitutes an MCP subject to IMF jurisdiction under Article VIII. Since
mid-2003, the government actions—(i) limiting the availability of foreign exchange in the
official market to particular categories of importers and (ii) with respect to other importers,
tolerating commercial banks to finance those imports at negotiated exchange rates which
diverged by more than 2 percent from the official exchange rate—have given rise to new
exchange restrictions and a new MCP subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.

There was agreement between the staff and
the authorities that the de facto fixed exchange
rate was inappropriate as it resulted in a large
parallel market premium and an overvaluation of
the official rate. The parallel foreign exchange
market has existed in Guinea for a long time, albeit as
an illegal market up to 1995. Changes that followed
the legalization of foreign currency trading outside the

products imports, and allowed banks to finance other priority imports at negotiated exchange

organized banking sector include the introduction of the foreign exchange auction system
in 1999. During 1999–2002, in the absence of government interference with a free determination
of the official rate at auctions, the official rate generally tracked the parallel market.15
Since 2003, while market forces have led to a gradual depreciation of the parallel market rate in
light of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment, the government de facto fixed the official
rate and, in early 2004, introduced a rationing of foreign exchange with regard to imports.
Accordingly, excess demand in the official market spilled over into the parallel one, and the
spread between the parallel and official rates widened markedly by mid-2004. Under the
circumstances, the staff is of the view that the observed parallel market premium—of almost
25 percent by mid-2004— is broadly indicative of the overvaluation of the official rate.
18.
The staff urged the authorities to adopt a more flexible exchange rate and to
abandon the administrative allocation of foreign exchange with regard to imports. It
indicated that such a system provides a cushion against Guinea’s vulnerability to exogenous
shocks—terms of trade and other real shocks. In a similar vein, the staff indicated that an
administrative allocation of foreign exchange distorts resource allocation. In sum, the staff
stressed that a more liberalized and flexible exchange rate system would serve Guinea better.

The authorities agreed that a more
flexible exchange rate system was necessary.16
However, they feared that liberalization could
lead to a speculative rapid depreciation of the
Guinean franc. The staff argued that the best
guarantee of market participants’ confidence in
the currency is the credibility of public policies.
It also indicated that an overvalued exchange rate
would hurt competitiveness, which is already
adversely affected by structural and institutional

With an estimate of at least 70 percent of foreign exchange transactions channeled into the
parallel market owing to the limited use of formal mechanisms in Guinea, this market, which
functions free of government intervention, largely reflects market conditions. Except for a
few spikes, the divergence between the parallel and the official exchange rates was generally
2 percent, indicating that structural factors did not affect the parallel market premium
significantly.

weaknesses. The staff argued forcefully, in line with MFD technical assistance
recommendations, that the authorities move to a more flexible exchange rate system.17
D. Way Forward
20.
The authorities stressed that normalizing Guinea’s relations with the Fund and
other donors was important to the implementation of their development strategy. They
expressed their determination to take all the actions called for to enter into a track-record
SMP as soon as possible. There was agreement between the authorities and the staff that
entering into an SMP would imply going beyond short-term fiscal tightening and notably
include:
x

Disciplined implementation of the fiscal and monetary tightening;

x

Adoption of a floating exchange rate system, with the rate determined through
interbank trading and the central bank disseminating indicative rates;

x

Immediate implementation of the long overdue three critical measures recommended
by the 2002 safeguard assessment mission to limit the vulnerabilities in the central
bank’s financial reporting and internal control system;18 and

x

Strong commitment to structural reforms in key areas, notably to prepare the adoption
of the WAEMU’s CET and restructure the public utility enterprises to alleviate the
shortages in electricity and water supply.
E. Medium-Term Prospects and Challenges

21.
The medium-term challenge facing the authorities is to set the country on a path
of sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The staff and the authorities agreed that the
pursuit of past policies would lead to a further drop in investment and per capita real GDP
growth, exacerbating the vulnerabilities of the Guinean economy (Box 2). In the absence of
external assistance, bank financing of the fiscal deficit would lead to continued significant
monetary expansion and higher inflation. In this context, the discussions focused on policies
and reforms needed to promote macroeconomic stability, enhance policy credibility, and

17

The May 2004 MFD technical assistance mission proposed the abandonment of the present
auction system (MED), which is unable to provide an indicator of the true value of the
Guinean franc, because it attracts only small amounts and increases the scarcity of foreign
currencies in the banking system and the holding of export receipts in offshore accounts.
18

The mission expressed concern to the authorities about the rapid increase in the “other
items (net)” item in the central bank balance sheet, for which the authorities were not able to
provide a full explanation.

- 16 -

create conditions for increased private investment, broad-based economic growth, and
poverty reduction.
22.
The staff and the authorities concurred that improved macroeconomic
management and an acceleration of reforms would generate faster growth, though still
insufficient to meet the Millennium Development Goals (Table 8). The adoption of sound
policies—assuming improved security in the region and larger donor support—could allow
the economy, after a transition period (2004-05), to return to a growth path of 5 percent
beginning in 2006, with inflation falling back to single digits from 2006 onward (Figure 2).
Decisive progress in implementing reforms could improve the private savings rate from about
7.7 percent of GDP in 2003 to above 10 percent in 2007. With renewed confidence and a
rekindling of foreign direct investment, particularly in the mining sector, gross domestic
investment could rise from 10 percent of GDP in 2003 to 15½ percent in 2007, driven by the
private sector. However, the staff and the authorities agreed that achieving the MDGs would
require a more ambitious macroeconomic performance and more financial resources than
envisaged in the current medium-term framework.
Box 2. Guinea: Risks and Vulnerabilities
Four main vulnerabilities are key concerns for the short- and the medium-term:
x

Political vulnerabilities and private investment variations: political instability and/or regional
insecurity could hinder a rebound in economic activity. Fear of social unrest may delay necessary
reforms, notably in the area of exchange rate and price policies, while the fight against corruption
may encounter resistance from vested interests. In this context, investors may adopt a wait-and-see
attitude.

x

Lack of diversification: the large share of agriculture in GDP makes growth highly dependent on
climatic conditions; the economy’s dependence on the mining sector makes it highly vulnerable to
downturns in the world market for minerals; and the economy is also vulnerable to fluctuations in
oil prices as it imports all of its petroleum products.

x

Possible shortfalls in donors’ support: with Guinea’s deteriorating economic performance and in
the absence of a program with the Fund, budgetary and HIPC support will remain limited. Also, if
it continues to experience difficulties to make timely debt service payments, a number of donors
will continue to suspend their project assistance.

x

Balance sheet vulnerabilities: the domestic debt of the government has increased sharply, from
4.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to 12.2 percent at end-2003. Though still low by regional standards,
there is a risk of crowding out other expenditure, and that the central bank may refrain from
issuing the needed volume of T-bills in the fear of an upward adjustments in interest rates that
would increase debt service further.

- 17 -

Fiscal policy
23.
The authorities agreed that implementation of a sound fiscal policy stance
reflecting the priorities of the poverty reduction strategy was crucial to their mediumterm strategy. The staff emphasized that a key aspect of such a stance was to entrench
discipline in public finances and break with the unsteady policy implementation of the past
several years and the authorities concurred. Assuming greater government efforts on both the
revenue and the expenditure fronts, the staff and the authorities projected a 0.8 percentage
point of GDP decline in the overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis, excluding grants)
during 2004–07, predicated on an increase in revenue that outweighs the increase in
spending.
24.
Revenue is projected to increase by 1.2 percent of GDP over 2004–07, driven by
collections from the nonmining sector. Increasing revenue collection would hinge on a
strengthening of tax administration, progress in the fight against corruption, and the
implementation of the WAEMU’s CET. The latter would, while encouraging regional trade,
simplify the taxation of trade so as to reduce discretionary and rent-seeking actions.19 The
mission also urged the authorities to fully implement the specific revenue enhancement
measures recommended by the 2003 public expenditure review (PER) and the May 2004
FAD technical assistance mission.
25.
Expenditure policy is geared toward raising development and social outlays
while curtailing other expenditures. In that regard, the medium-term budget framework
envisages that a greater share of spending would be allocated to social sectors. In particular,
current nonwage primary spending on social sectors is projected to increase by almost
0.6 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2007, while total primary current spending would
increase by only 0.3 percent of GDP over the same period. Overall, the primary balance is
projected to increase only marginally as part of the revenue increase would be absorbed by
higher domestically-financed development spending.20

19

The 2002 FAD technical assistance mission indicated that the main benefit of the adoption
of the WAEMU’s CET would be the simplification of Guinea’s tariff system. It projected the
positive revenue impact to amount to 0.4 percent of GDP by 2005, mostly from the
suppression of ad hoc exemptions. In light of this, the projected revenue increase over the
medium-term is quite conservative.
20

As the primary balance path encompasses an almost 1 percentage point of GDP increase in
domestically-financed investment during 2004-07, its steadiness is not at odds with the
projected almost 1 percent of GDP increase in government savings over the same period.

26.
The staff emphasized and the authorities agreed that, to benefit the poverty
reduction agenda, the increased spending on social programs should be coupled with
an improved public expenditure management system. This should encompass greater
transparency in budget execution and a better tracking of spending, including at the
decentralized levels where most poverty reduction expenditures are executed. In particular,
the staff encouraged the authorities to improve the management of the externally-funded part
of the development budget to ensure that it reflects the priorities of the poverty reduction
strategy. The authorities indicated that some donors do not facilitate the planning and
tracking of development expenditure as they make direct transfers to decentralized services or
pay suppliers abroad, forcing the government to record commitments ex-post.21 The mission
and the authorities also concurred that implementation of the measures recommended by the
PER would be key to improving expenditure management to benefit the social sectors. Such
measures include a tighter control of the budget share of wages through the reduction of staff
in the central services, an inclusion in the medium-term expenditure framework of budget
ceilings for defense spending and the introduction of a more transparent review process for
such spending, and the introduction of more robust procedures for the transfer of funds to the
local levels and for improved controls by the General Finance Inspectorate.
Monetary and financial policies
27.
The staff and the authorities concurred that keeping inflation under control
should be the primary focus of monetary policy over the medium term. The authorities
indicated that the central bank would stop accommodating the Treasury and would pursue an
active liquidity management, based on the recommendations made by MFD technical
assistance missions. The staff pointed out that the capacity of the central bank to absorb
liquidity through its auctions—to which only commercial banks subscribe—is limited
because of the composition of reserve money.22 The staff therefore encouraged the central
bank to foster better bank intermediation and to promote the sale of treasury bills to the
nonbank sector, which would also help to absorb liquidity outside the banking sector.
28.
While Guinea’s banking sector appears relatively sound, the staff stressed the
need for continuous efforts to enforce supervisory rules. The authorities replied that
prompt action will be taken for the rapid adoption of the new banking law and the law on

combating corruption and streamlining bureaucracy. Liberalization efforts would also
facilitate the introduction of the reciprocal trade opening under the EU’s Economic

(AGOA).26

Guinea’s external debt burden is projected to remain heavy, unless the country
can benefit from full HIPC debt relief. Since Guinea reached the decision point in 2000, its
23

In the area of microfinance, the four major institutions that currently operate in the sector
have been accredited by the central bank, and on-site audits are undertaken since 2003. A
strengthening of the central bank supervisory capacity is still needed to ensure adequate
surveillance of the sector.
24

The World Bank is helping to foster trade through its support under the Integrated Trade
Framework.
25

An impact study prepared by the EU in April 2004 convincingly highlights the large
adjustment that the Guinean economy may face because of the Economic Partnership
Agreement, including an important revenue loss from tariff collections on Guinean imports
form the EU in the absence of rebalancing tax and tariff revenues.
26

So far, Guinea has not yet taken advantage of AGOA. However, interest among the
government and the local community remains high. The AGOA action committee has
identified several products that would be AGOA-export worthy, including shea butter, fresh
fruit, artisanal goods, and textiles. The staff encourages progress in this area, noting the role
FDI has played in countries that have benefited more from AGOA than Guinea.

- 21 -

external debt indicators have deteriorated owing mainly to lower-than-projected exports. The
staff and the authorities concurred that in light of Guinea’s limited foreign exchange reserves
and the suspension of interim debt relief under the HIPC Initiative by some creditors, the
difficulties the country has been experiencing in servicing external debt would continue,
unless the country gains access to more of the HIPC relief it qualified for at the decision
point.27 Against this background, the authorities reasserted their determination to improve
policy implementation and deepen reforms to facilitate resumption of external assistance
and the attainment of completion point under the HIPC. While encouraging the authorities
in their endeavor, the staff indicated that the completion point could be reached at best
in late 2005/early 2006 after meeting all the completion point triggers,28 the rigorous policy
implementation under an SMP, and a satisfactory track record in the form of completion of
one review under a new PRGF-supported program covering a period of policy
implementation of at least six months. The authorities indicated that the envisaged timing of
the completion point would be costly to the implementation of their poverty reduction
strategy and emphasized their need to enter into an SMP as soon as possible.
31.
The authorities indicated that they will pursue efforts toward regional
integration. They reaffirmed their commitment to adopt the WAEMU’s CET in
January 2005 and to adhere to the WAMZ monetary union when it will be launched on
July 1, 2005, despite the deterioration of Guinea’s performance with regard to the
convergence criteria of the WAMZ (Box 3). The staff encouraged the authorities on their
planned adoption of the CET, which would result in reducing Guinea’s trade restrictiveness
index from 3 to 2. However, the staff expressed skepticism about the benefit of joining the
monetary union, in light of the lack of progress toward economic convergence with other
WAMZ member countries, and the difficulties Guinea might encounter to adjust to
asymmetric exogenous shocks in the envisaged monetary union.
Governance
The mission emphasized the need for the authorities to make significant progress in
the fight against corruption. There was progress on two HIPC Initiative completion
point triggers on governance, with the publication of the 2002 progress report of the AntiCorruption Committee (CNLC) and the launching of the bids for the auditing of the
government procurement contracts.29 Nevertheless, the mission expressed concerns that the
change in the status of the CNLC from being an independent structure under the Presidency
27

The DSA presented in Appendix IV indicates that the debt relief Guinea qualified for at the
decision point would reduce the country’s stock of debt to sustainable levels.

to being part of a new Ministry, may impair its independence and effectiveness in the fight
against corruption. The authorities assured the mission that the change in the reporting
channels was intended to reinforce the power of the CNLC by giving it a say within the
government.

The authorities attributed the delays in the adoption of the reforms pertaining
to the judicial system to the electoral agenda in 2003. They indicated that the regulation
governing the special statute of magistrates was adopted by the Council of Ministers, and the

- 23 -

effective implementation of legislation pertaining to the reorganization of the judiciary will
be undertaken this year.
III. STATISTICAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ISSUES
33.
Notwithstanding the efforts made in recent years to improve statistics, problems
remain in the areas of public finances, the real sector, balance of payments, and
external debt (Appendix III). Some of the weaknesses in the fiscal area should be alleviated
by the closure of most non-project extra budgetary accounts, the use of a computer-based
budget monitoring system, and the consolidation of all government cash flows under a
unified accounting framework. Weaknesses in real sector statistics relate to the data quality,
as well as coverage. The launch of a new consumer price index in March 2004 should
improve price statistics, and the authorities indicated that they will continue to use the
improved methodology for GDP accounting. Notwithstanding some progress after two
technical assistance missions from Debt Relief International, debt statistics remain weak
because of lax recordkeeping, insufficient coordination among government entities, and
inadequately trained personnel.
34.
The authorities identified capacity-building needs in the areas of real sector
statistics, monetary policy formulation, and public debt management. The World Bank
will continue to provide assistance under the Capacity Building for Service Delivery project.
The staff encouraged the authorities to continue implementing the recommendations of
previous technical assistance missions and to work closely with the West Africa Regional
Technical Assistance Center (West AFRITAC) to address capacity-building needs.
IV. THE PRSP PROGRESS REPORT
35.
The mission discussed the PRSP progress report, including the revised medium-term
macroeconomic framework underlying the strategy, and the content of the Joint Staff
Assessment (JSA).30 The JSA indicates that the progress report could have benefited from
(i) a better analysis of the sources of growth; (ii) taking account of up to date poverty
indicators; and (iii) a list of measures to correct the strategy in areas where objectives were
missed. The authorities concurred with these observations and indicated that they will be
taken into account in next year’s progress report.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Policy implementation was very weak in 2003. The government’s expansionary
fiscal stance, its continued de facto control of the official exchange rate, and the absence of
progress in the structural reform area, weakened economic performance. Economic growth
was very low and savings and investment declined sharply. In the absence of external
30

PRSP Progress Report and Joint Staff Assessment report; 7/15/04 (www.imf.org)

- 24 -

budgetary assistance, the increasing fiscal deficit was financed by an accumulation of arrears
and an increased recourse to bank financing. The resulting monetary overhang has been
associated with accelerating inflation, harmful to the poor.
37.
Multiple currency practices were intensified in 2003 and the first half of 2004.
As indicated in the last Article IV consultation report (Country Report No. 03/250, 8/14/03),
the lack of a mechanism to prevent the rates in the official and the parallel markets from
diverging by more than 2 percent constitutes an MCP. The measures introduced in 2003
consisting in an administrative allocation of foreign exchange have given rise to new exchange
restrictions and a new MCP subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. Since the authorities
have not yet set a clear timetable for eliminating these practices, the staff does not recommend
the approval of these MCPs. The staff welcomes the depreciation of the official rate that took
place in July 2004, which brings it more in line with market levels, but recommends
abandoning the present auction system and moving toward a floating exchange rate
determined through interbank trading.
38.
The government’s emergency recovery program adopted in March 2004 is a step
in the right direction but is not sufficient to put the economy back onto a solid growth
trajectory. The program proposes a substantial tightening of policies, albeit not sufficient to
bring about a desired rapid decline in inflation. Cognizant of the difficulty in realizing shortterm fiscal adjustments beyond what is currently envisaged, initiating a track-record SMP
would require that the emergency program has started to bear fruit, is vigorously pursued, and
augmented with decisive action on adopting a floating exchange rate system and
implementing the long delayed recommendations of the 2002 safeguards assessment mission,
and initiating urgently needed structural reforms.
39.
The medium-term prospects will depend on continued political will to adopt and
steadily pursue sound, pro-growth, and poverty reducing policies. The staff welcomes
the cautious growth assumptions underlying the revised macroeconomic framework of the
PRSP, but achieving these targets will require strong commitment to implement the structural
reform agenda so as to elicit the appropriate supply response. It encourages the government to
consider an even more ambitious reform agenda to accelerate growth further and help achieve
the Millennium Development Goals. In particular, the staff urges the authorities to rapidly
restructure the public utility enterprises to alleviate the shortages in electricity and water
supply, to tackle the operational difficulties in the mining sector, and to promote export
diversification. Also, the staff urges the authorities to rapidly and forcefully step up the fight
against corruption and show determined progress in reforming the judicial system.
40.
The risks to successful policy reform are significant. They include political and
security tensions, lack of diversification of the economy, shortfalls in donors’ support, and
balance sheet vulnerabilities linked to the growing domestic debt. The staff urges the
government to demonstrate unwavering commitment to sound policies, resist pressures from
entrenched interests, and improve institutions to resolutely move the reform agenda forward.

- 25 -

41.
The cornerstone to improving macroeconomic performance and reducing
domestic debt is the implementation of much tighter fiscal policies. This will require
continuation and reinforcement of the fiscal tightening undertaken since April. For the
medium-term, achieving a sound fiscal policy will depend critically on improving revenue
performance, containing defense spending, and on keeping nonproductive outlays to a strict
minimum to free up resources to bolster domestically financed investment and social outlays.
The staff calls on the government to fully implement the WAEMU’s CET in 2005, to adopt
the measures proposed by the recent FAD technical assistance mission on fiscal
administration, and to continue strengthening the customs administration to enhance revenue.
It also encourages the government to implement the recommendations of the 2003 public
expenditure review to increase the efficiency of spending.
42.
The staff encourages the central bank to focus monetary policy on its primary
objective of containing inflation. Given the monetary overhang, liquidity management
needs to become much more proactive, based on the recommendations of MFD technical
assistance missions. The central bank should stop accommodating the Treasury and finance
the government through the issuance of treasury bills. The central bank should also continue
to strengthen bank supervision and push for the adoption of the revised banking and
microfinance laws by Parliament.
43.
Sustaining external accounts will require implementing structural reforms and
lessening interventionist policies in order to diversify the export base. Regarding external
debt, it will be important for the government to pursue its reforms efforts so as to eventually
regain access to more of the HIPC Initiative relief it qualified for at the decision point,
without which debt will remain unsustainable. In this regard, the authorities should endeavor
to eliminate external debt arrears to normalize relations with donors.
44.
Guinea’s statistical data remain weak and needs to be improved to strengthen
surveillance. The staff calls on the authorities to pursue the improvements already underway,
notably by drawing on the technical assistance from STA, West AFRITAC, and donor
agencies.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
An on-site safeguards assessment of the BCRG was completed on July 11, 2002; it
concluded that substantial risks existed in the central bank’s external audit mechanism,
financial reporting framework, and system of internal controls. The authorities have yet to
implement all the corrective actions recommended.
IX.

Exchange Arrangements:

Guinea has a de jure managed floating exchange rate with no preannounced path, which
has been reclassified as a de facto peg because of the central bank’s de facto fixing of the
exchange rate. The official exchange rate of the Guinean franc is determined monthly in
the auction market for foreign exchange at the central bank. However, due to a lack of
liquid foreign exchange, no auctions were held between late 2003 and July 2004, and the
official rate of the Guinean franc remained at GF 2,000 per U.S. dollar. An auction was
held on July 14, 2004, with the rate depreciating to GF 2,500 per U.S. dollar; at the
auction held on July 21, 2004, the official rate remained unchanged. Commercial banks
are, in principle, free to buy and sell foreign exchange at any rate. The lack of a
mechanism to prevent the rates in the official and parallel markets from diverging by
more than 2 percent and the administrative allocation of foreign exchange to finance
specific imports give rise to multiple currency practice.
X.

Article IV Consultation:

Guinea is on the 12-month cycle. The last consultation was concluded by the Executive
Board on July 16, 2003.

2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but
not disbursed during the interim period.

APPENDIX II

Guinea: Relations with the World Bank Group
Partnership in Guinea’s Development Strategy
1.
Guinea’s development strategy is laid out in the government’s poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP), which was endorsed by the Executive Board of the Bank on
July 25, 2002. The PRSP rests on three main pillars: first, to sustain faster economic growth
and create income-earning and employment opportunities, particularly for the rural poor;
second, to increase and extend access to basic services; and third, to improve governance and
strengthen institutional and human capacity. The PRSP builds on the groundwork of
Guinea’s poverty reduction policies as formulated in the “Guinea—Vision 2010” document
of December 1996 and the interim PRSP of 2000.
2.
The World Bank is taking the lead in the policy dialogue and areas of structural
reforms, including banking sector restructuring; privatization; administrative
decentralization; capacity building; sector programs in the priority areas of health, education,
rural development, and road maintenance; and the anticorruption program. Overall,
noticeable improvement has been made in the above-mentioned areas; however, in the
judicial sector and utilities sector (telecommunications, electricity, and water), progress has
been slow.
Bank Group Strategy
3.
The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2004-06) for Guinea was approved by
the Board in June 2003. The CAS presents three scenarios. In the high-case scenario, the
Bank would increase budget support through the PRSC and provide project financing to the
power and water sectors. The PRSC would provide an adequate time frame and resources for
tackling medium- and long-term reforms in the key areas of decentralization, governance, and
divestiture. In the base case, the CAS would support those aspects of the PRSP approved
by the authorities in March 2002 and prepare the way for a new relationship with the
development partners based on a gradual phasing in of programmatic lending, leading to
more efficient allocation and utilization of external aid. Finally, the low-case scenario
assumes government is unable to make significant progress in resolving key macroeconomic,
fiscal and governance issues. Any assistance would be limited to safeguarding the progress
achieved in the priority sectors, vital to poverty reduction. There would be no budget support
nor infrastructure financing.

IDA provided a fourth Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC IV) to Guinea in 2001,
which is designed to support the country’s poverty reduction strategy in the areas of public
expenditure management, governance, and public goods delivery to the poor. The SAC IV
has had a satisfactory impact on the country’s macroeconomic performance in the medium
term. The credit was disbursed in one tranche (US$50 million) on the grounds that, despite
the lack of any external budget support for a two-year period, Guinea had kept its economy

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

broadly on track and had demonstrated commitment to the program reforms with regard to
public expenditure management, governance, and the decentralization of basic service
delivery. The adjustment program supported by SAC IV paved the way for programmatic
lending to support the government’s poverty strategy and, to a large extent, prepared the
ground for preparation of a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), originally scheduled
for FY04, on the assumption of continuing sound macroeconomic performance and
implementation of the reform program. However, macroeconomic management began to
deteriorate seriously in mid-2002 and the Fund’s PRGF program went off track in
December 2002. Key contributing factors were: overspending related to security outlays, a
highly expansionary fiscal stance, a lax monetary policy and fixing of the exchange rate
leading to rising inflation and a serious decline in gross reserves. A wavering commitment to
sound macroeconomic policies, slow progress in governance and risks to political stability,
combined with exogenous risks – lower prices for bauxite and other commodities against a
backdrop of regional instability – suggest that GDP growth in 2003 will only reach
2.1 percent. Given this continuing poor macroeconomic performance, Guinea may be
considered as currently reflecting the CAS’ low-case scenario. Consequently, the Bank’s
support will be limited to protecting the sectors vital to poverty reduction.
5.
As of June 29, 2004, the IDA has approved 62 credits for Guinea, of which
four were in the transport and infrastructure sector; eight in the energy, water, and
telecommunications sector; five in strengthening the country’s management capability
[Technical Assistance / Economic Management], six in financing rural sector development;
four in the urban sector; three in the health sector; four in the education sector; three in
mining sector development; four in structural adjustment; four in the financial sector; and
one in private sector development. The total value of these projects amounts to about
US$1,420 million equivalent, of which US$1,287 million has been disbursed. During the
period FY98-04, the Board approved two adjustment operations (Public Expenditure
Management Adjustment Credit and the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit) and six
investment operations: the Village Community Support Program, the Capacity Building
for Service Delivery Program, the Microfinance LIL, the Pre-Service Teacher Education LIL,
the Urban Project, and the Population and Reproductive Health Project. In July 2001, the
Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit (US$50 million), the Education-for-All Project
(US$70 million), and the Rural Electrification LIL (US$5 million) were approved. The
Bank’s current portfolio in Guinea reflects the priorities of the PRSP. It comprises eight
projects totaling US$204.3 million, of which US$20.3 million is in the form of a grant, and
US$132.2 million remains undisbursed. The Education for All Program, the Multisectoral
HIV/AIDS Program and the Decentralized Rural Electrification Project will be implemented
throughout the CAS period. The non lending program includes fiduciary assessment; a public
expenditure review (PER); analysis of public finance management and audit systems; a crosscutting assessment of Guinea’s social, structural, and sector development under the PRSP;
and Bank/Fund collaborative work on social impact analysis.
6.
Under the current low-case CAS scenario, the proposed World Bank lending program
for FY04-06 will support a second Health Sector Project (US$15 million) in FY04, a second

- 44 -

Village Community Support Program (US$35 million) in FY05, and a second Capacity
Building for Service Delivery Program (US$10 million) in FY 06.
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
7.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting
the government’s structural reforms. As part of its overall assistance to Guinea through
lending, country analytic work, and technical assistance, the Bank supports policy reforms in
the following areas in collaboration with the Fund.
Public Expenditure Management
8.
Improvements in public expenditure management have been one of the top priorities
of the Guinean government since 1996. The Bank, the Fund, and other donors have worked
closely together to provide the government the needed support for institutional and policy
reforms. While the Fund is leading the dialogue on tax policy, the Bank is focusing on
strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency of public expenditures. To enhance
strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency, the Bank has assisted the government
in the preparation of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and is supporting the
strengthening and opening up of the budget process as well as the allocation of resources to
pro-poor priority areas at the decentralized level. A Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR) was undertaken in 2002 while in 2003 a Public Expenditure Review (PER),
managed by the Bank, was conducted with strong government ownership, extensive
consultation of beneficiaries and development partners and in close collaboration with the
Fund and the AfDB. The PER was complemented by a full CFAA which gave close attention
to public expenditure management systems, to the auditing of public finances and to related
governance issues
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
9.
The Bank and Fund’s respective Guinea country teams are currently discussing the
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis. It is envisaged that a few selected areas may be analyzed
over the coming years. These might cover: an analysis of the impact on social output
indicators of government spending in health and education, an assessment of the impact of
the adoption of the Common External Tariff of the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) on the taxation of basic consumer goods, an assessment of the impact of
exchange rate flexibility on consumer prices, a social impact analysis of trade reforms, and an
analysis of the impact of taxation on growth and income distribution. The selection of the few
reforms to analyze will be based on the importance of the expected poverty and social
impacts of each reform, the prominence of the issue in the government’s agenda, the timing
and urgency of the reform, and the level of national debate surrounding the reform. The 2003
household survey should be completed as soon as possible so that the key determinants of
poverty and their interdependency be identified, making it possible to track poverty impact
over time.

APPENDIX II

Public Service Reform and Improved Service Delivery
10.
In recent years, the government of Guinea, with the support of the Bank and other
donors, has launched a number of major initiatives to improve performance and to foster
greater accountability, transparency, and integrity in the public sector. These include (i) the
Public Finance Management Reform Program; and (ii) the National Anti-Corruption Strategy
and Action Plans for Guinea. Among these reforms, the public service reform program plays
a central role, since its objective is to improve accountability, transparency, and resource
management for service delivery. The program is closely linked with other major reforms in
public finance and decentralization. Cooperation between the Bank and the Fund covers those
areas where public sector reform has a direct impact on fiscal stability and public sector
financial management.
Trade Reforms
11.
The Bank and the Fund also are working together closely to assist Guinea in
establishing a pro-growth trade framework. While the Fund has taken the lead in reforms in
the tariff regime, the Bank is trying to foster trade through the Integrated Trade Framework.
The Bank is also involved in a dialogue on trade reforms in the context of the WAEMU at the
regional level.

APPENDIX III

Guinea: Statistical Issues
12.
Although improvements have been made in recent years in the availability of detailed
government finance data, serious statistical problems remain, particularly in the compilation
of real sector and balance of payments statistics. Changes in the financial system in recent
years have affected the quality of data for deposit money banks. A law on statistics that
organizes the institutional setting for producing statistics at a decentralized level was
approved in 1995. However, neither the National Council of Statistics, responsible for
coordinating the production of statistics, nor a technical committee responsible for providing
recommendations on the statistical program—both created under the new law—seem to have
improved the quality of statistics.
13.
Guinea is participant to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its
metadata were first posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB) on
December 12, 2003.
14.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for program
monitoring, although problems with the internal consistency of fiscal data and their
consistency with monetary data are frequently encountered.
Real sector statistics
15.
Statistics on the real sector are weak and incomplete. Only the consumer price index
(CPI) is published on a regular basis, while other statistics are published irregularly, not
widely distributed, and are often not reliable. There is no regular survey on mining and
industrial production, nor are there statistics on employment and population.
16.
After extensive work in 1990–93 to build a solid database for the national accounts,
the authorities, with technical assistance from the World Bank, produced final national
accounts tables for 1986 to 1988 and provisional data for 1990 and 1991; an input-output
table was produced for 1990. A comprehensive household survey was prepared for 1994.
Provisional national accounts were produced for 1992–96, but they do not use fully the
results of the household survey and have serious shortcomings. The Ministry of Planning and
Cooperation prepared updates of macroeconomic data and projections on the basis of
the 1994 national accounts before it was eliminated in June 2000 and some of its functions
allocated to the Ministry of Finance. In October 2000, the authorities presented final national
accounts for 1995–96, and provisional accounts for 1997–98. All national accounts data were
significantly revised on that occasion. A program to reinforce the national accounts is being
undertaken with the technical assistance of the regional statistical office (AFRISTAT) and the
Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). The work is expected to lead to the
production of input-output matrices on an annual basis.
17.
The consumer price index for Conakry is available on a monthly basis, with a
one-month lag. Export prices are estimated on the basis of information supplied directly by

- 48 -

APPENDIX III

the mining companies, while import prices are based on a weighted average of partner
countries’ export prices. Exchange rates are reported monthly.
18.
Data on the agriculture sector have been published only sporadically in the form of
Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations Development Program surveys. No data
on employment or labor costs are available.
19.
In March 2000, a STA mission presented detailed recommendations on how to
improve real sector statistics. The mission identified the lack of a budget for the compilation
of current statistics and poor professional training as the main causes of the statistical
system’s weakness. Guinea has developed an action plan to address these weaknesses, but
financial resources for many of these measures remain to be identified.
Balance of payments statistics
20.
The authorities have implemented some of the recommendations made by a balance
of payments statistics mission in May 1995. Notably, coverage of trade in services, private
transfers, and capital flows has been expanded by surveying service providers and large
companies on an annual basis. However, the survey is not comprehensive, and there are no
sanctions for nonresponse. In view of the difficulties encountered with the compilation of
annual statistics, the mission’s recommendation to compile data on a quarterly basis has not
yet been implemented.
21.
Merchandise trade statistics are reported in the standard Harmonized System of
Customs Classification, net of imports by diplomats and transit trade. In spite of the
technically advanced method of presentation, the data are clearly inconsistent with actual
developments in the country. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to smuggling, as
exports of gold and diamonds are subject to modest export taxes and imports are subject to
import duties. However, the trade statistics also report significant exports of aluminum
products, which, according to the Ministry of Mining and Energy, are not produced in the
country. Thus, these data are substantially adjusted prior to publication.
22.
The balance of payments statistics also affect national accounts data. The national
accounts are based on trade data that include transit trade and imports by diplomats, and thus
overestimate the openness of the economy. However, the national accounts use estimates of
trade in services, which are well below those estimated on the basis of the surveys conducted
by the central bank. The authorities have requested additional technical assistance from STA
for balance of payments statistics.
23.
However, since December 2002, the authorities have not reported monthly data on
international reserves to the IMF Statistics Department.

- 49 -

APPENDIX III

Government finance statistics
24.
Comprehensive monthly central government budgetary data are compiled by the
Ministry of Finance on a cash basis for revenue and on commitment and cash bases for
expenditure. AFR receives preliminary data within 15 days and main final data within one
month. Budgetary data are often not internally consistent. Consolidated central government
operations data come from the Treasury.
25.
The budget includes the bulk of all government operations, although it excludes a
number of “satellite” accounts that are not directly incorporated in the budget. There are also
significant differences between the national definition of general government and that
provided by the Government Finance Statistics Manuals (GFSM). Moreover, autonomous
funds, such as the Road Fund, are only partly incorporated in the budget. For the Road Fund,
the largest autonomous fund, 100 percent of resources are “committed” through the budget
and transferred from the budget to the fund. Actual disbursements are made at the Road
Fund’s discretion (monitored, however, through its account at the central bank). The fuel tax
is not expressly earmarked for the Road Fund, but it is received by the general budget and
transferred to the Road Fund through the budget.
26.
The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 1999. Guinea does not report
fiscal data for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary accounts statistics
27.
Monthly data on monetary authorities, deposit money banks, and interest rates are
available. Developments and changes in the financial system during the last few years,
including the liquidation and restructuring of some banks, are not fully reflected in the
monetary statistics, owing to problems of data collection, the classification of instruments,
and the sectorization of economic activities. A monetary and financial statistics mission
visited Conakry in the second half of November 2000 to review the coverage of the monetary
statistics, as well as data collection and compilation practices. The mission summarized its
main findings and recommendations in a report and action plan left with the authorities. The
authorities have made good progress in taking the measures the report proposed. In particular,
efforts are being made to strengthen the commercial banks’ reporting practices, especially the
classification of nonperforming loans.
28.
Beginning 2001, the authorities undertook regular reporting of monetary data for
publication in IFS. However, the timeliness of monetary data reporting has been uneven
since 2003. The most recent data for the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks
that will be published in the August 2004 edition of the IFS refer to December 2003.

APPENDIX IV

Guinea: Debt Sustainability Analysis

1.
At end 2003, Guinea’s external public debt amounted to US$3.4 billion in
nominal terms, including arrears. Of this total, 62 percent is owed to multilateral creditors,
and the quasi-totality of the remainder to bilaterals. The Paris Club accounts for almost
70 percent of the debt owed to bilaterals. After full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms,
the stock of debt at end–2003 is reduced to US$2.5 billion. Nominal debt service due was
US$146 million in 2002 and US$184.2 million in 2003. After taking into account the different
Paris Club rescheduling agreements and the interim assistance under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, debt service to be paid in these two years was
US$88 million and US$103 million, respectively. In 2003, the amount actually paid was
US$85 million because of an accumulation of arrears of US$18 million.
2.
At the time Guinea reached its decision point under the HIPC Initiative in
December 2000, its stock of debt was reduced substantially. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
after full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms was estimated at 219 percent at end-1999 and
projected to decline to 166 percent by end–2003. With HIPC debt relief of US$545 million in
NPV terms, this ratio was reduced to 150 percent at end 1999 and 133 percent at end-2003, and
was expected to remain under the 150 percent threshold throughout the projection period. Since
then, there have been changes in key variables affecting the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio. These
changes are taken into account in the new projections.
3.
Projections under the baseline scenario assume the implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies to correct the imbalances of the past couple of years as described in
section II, C of the staff report. Real GDP growth is projected to average 5 percent of GDP
during 2005–09 and 7 percent afterwards as new private investment comes on board, reforms
and policies allowing.33 The scenario also critically depends on regional security, climatic
conditions, and by the evolution of bauxite, alumina, and gold prices. The overall fiscal balance is
projected to record deficits until 2015. The external current account is projected to improve
gradually and to become roughly balanced after 2015.
4.
On external debt, the baseline projections assume, as at the decision point, full
use of traditional debt relief mechanisms in the computation of the NPV of debt and
borrowing on concessional terms for all new loan disbursements. Based on the policies
and assumptions indicated above, Guinea’s external debt ratios would remain at
unsustainable levels, as defined under the debt-to-exports criteria. At end–2003, the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio would be 201.4 percent compared with 166 percent estimated for the
same year at the decision point. The increase is explained by a 2 percentage point decline in

33

In Guinea’s PRSP Report of July 3, 2002 (www.imf.org), annual real GDP growth was targeted to
reach 10 percent by 2010. The current projections take into account the setback resulting from bad
policies during 2002/03 and delays to date in the implementation of structural reforms.

- 52 -

APPENDIX IV

the discount rate—from over 7 percent to 5 percent—and by an almost 30 percent shortfall in
exports.
5.
The DSA indicates that the HIPC debt relief Guinea qualified for at the decision
point would reduce the country’s debt burden to sustainable levels, provided that the
authorities persevere with the implementation of appropriate policies to bring down domestic
debt servicing costs and that the residual financing gaps from 2005 onward be financed at
highly concessional terms. Although the NPV of debt-to-exports has deteriorated compared
with projections made at the decision point, an unchanged HIPC debt relief of
US$545 million in NPV terms would reduce Guinea’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio below
the threshold of 150 percent. In particular, the end-2003 NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would
be reduced to about 133 percent. Nonetheless, Guinea remains vulnerable to policies and
exogenous shocks that affect output and exports.
6.
The sensitivity analyses indicate that Guinea’s debt indicators would worsen if
key variables such as real GDP and export growth were to be affected by adverse
shocks. In an alternative scenario that assumes that key variables remain at their historical
averages from 2004 onward, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is higher than in the baseline
scenario from 2006 onward. The difference reaches almost 31 percentage points in 2008. As
the bound tests indicate, when the growth of exports is assumed to remain—from 2004
onward—permanently one standard deviation below their historical averages, the
deterioration in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is, not surprisingly, even more substantial.

1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Year-on year inflation has been trending down, from double digits during most of
2003, to 9.8 percent in June 2004 (Figure 1). As efforts to stabilize the economy are very
recent, the decline appears to be driven by seasonal factors.

Performance in the fiscal area was mixed (Figure 2). Reflecting commendable
efforts in the collection of nonmining revenue, overall revenue in the second quarter of 2004
was about 30 percent higher than in the first quarter. Nonetheless, for the first semester, total
revenue was slightly below target, owing essentially to lower-than-projected mining revenue.
On the expenditure side, there was a significant acceleration of social spending in the second
quarter compared with the first quarter, albeit commitments fell short of projections.
However, there were spending overruns, driven by domestically-financed investment and
transfers. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit exceeded projections by 0.4 percent of GDP, and
was financed by higher-than-projected arrears accumulation and recourse to bank financing.

Broad money grew by 37.9 percent over the 12-month period ended June 2004,
largely driven by the banking system’s credit to the government. The central bank has
stepped up the use of sterilization bills to control liquidity, but the impact has been limited
because of the large financing needs of the government. The net foreign assets of the central
bank improved slightly, though remaining negative.
5.
The authorities have taken important steps to improve exchange rate
management. In light of the staff’s recommendation that the de facto fixing of the official
exchange rate be stopped and that the exchange rate be more flexible, the central bank
resumed foreign exchange auctions in July, allowing the official rate to depreciate by 25
percent. The parallel market premium, which reached 25 percent in June, has since been
reduced to almost 10 percent.

-36.
The government has adjusted retail prices of rice and petroleum products, in
light of the rising world prices and the depreciation of the Guinean franc. The official
price of rice was increased by 51 percent and the prices of petroleum products by about 70
percent. The cost of public transportation, which remained unchanged for a long time, has
been increased proportionately to the petroleum price increase, exacerbating the hardships
faced by a significant share of the population. To offset this, the government has announced a
doubling of the transportation allowance for civil servants.
7.
The government made efforts in the second quarter of 2004 to contain the
accumulation of external arrears, despite the continued lack of external budgetary
assistance. Arrears accumulated in 2003 amounted to US$18 million, as indicated in the staff
report. On a net basis, US$11.2 million were accumulated in the first quarter of 2004, and an
additional US$8 million in the second quarter, bringing the total arrears outstanding at endJune 2004 to almost US$37 million.
8.
In the authorities’ effort to normalize relations with donors, a government
delegation met with officials of the European Union (EU) in Brussels in late July, and
presented a memorandum outlining steps envisaged by the Guinean government to address
outstanding issues that have strained Guinea’s relations with the EU since mid-2002. In
particular, the memorandum highlights steps the government envisage to promote human
rights and democracy, including by restoring the political dialogue, liberalizing the media,
and organizing free and transparent municipal elections in 2005 and legislative elections in
2007. An EU assessment mission will visit Conakry in coming months. A positive
assessment could reopen access to 8th and 9th FED resources.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Guinea
On August, 27, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Guinea.1
Background
In 2003, Guinea’s economic situation deteriorated on account of exogenous conditions, as well
as poor macroeconomic management and the lack of progress in key structural areas. Annual
real GDP growth slowed down from 4.2 percent in 2002 to an estimated 1.2 percent, owing
mostly to a reduction in manufacturing output caused by frequent outages in the supply of
electricity and water, a reduction in construction, and a poor crop season caused by
unfavorable rainfalls. With the ensuing pressures on food prices, the 12-month rate of inflation
(CPI-based) reached 14.8 percent in December 2003 (from 6.1 percent in December 2002),
owing to a combination of lax liquidity management and excessive bank financing of a
higher-than-projected government deficit. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) widened
to 7.9 percent from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2002, reflecting weaknesses in revenue mobilization
and expenditure overruns, notwithstanding a 0.5 percent of GDP shortfall in social spending.
The wider deficit coupled with the lack of external budgetary assistance led to an accumulation
of payment arrears both domestic and external. The external current account deficit (excluding
official transfers) declined by over 1½ percentage points of GDP mostly because imports of
intermediate and capital goods were subdued by an unfavorable investment climate

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the August 27, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2associated with uncertainties during the run up to the December 2003 presidential elections
and continued institutional weaknesses.
The government continued its de facto fixing of the exchange rate, keeping the Guinean
franc/US dollar exchange rate broadly stable notwithstanding rising inflation. Market pressures
were reflected in a widening of the parallel market premium to over 20 percent, from roughly
2 percent in 2002. The scarcity of foreign exchange in official channels exacerbated.
This, coupled with the lack of external budgetary assistance, led to a decline in Guinea’s gross
official reserves to 1½ months of imports, from 2.3 months of imports in 2002.
In the structural reform area, progress was mixed. On the fiscal front, the authorities took
actions that strengthened treasury management and implemented some of the preparatory
measures for the adoption of the common external tariff of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union. In the monetary area, there were further delays in the submission to
parliament of the draft banking and microfinance laws. There were further delays also in
implementing key measures meant to strengthen the central bank reporting and audit systems
and improve the transparency of its operations. In the public enterprise area, there was no
progress toward the urgently needed reform of the public utilities, whose poor operations
continue to adversely affect economic activity.
The outlook for 2004 is plagued by poor performance in the first quarter of the year and by
important downside risks, exogenous as well as policy-related. Assuming no deterioration in
exogenous conditions—terms of trade, climate, and security—economic performance will be
contingent upon the government’s resolve to implement the emergency recovery program it
adopted in March 2004. Under the assumption that this program will be implemented, real
GDP growth is projected to accelerate somewhat to 2.6 percent, owing mostly to improved
agricultural output and a slight pick up in the secondary sector. However, the annual average
rate of inflation is projected to increase further to almost 16½ percent as the government’s
reliance on the banking system to finance its cash deficit would lead to a further monetary
expansion.
As part of the Article IV consultation, an assessment of the Fund’s Longer-term program
engagement in Guinea was prepared by the staff and discussed with the authorities.2 The
assessment concludes that under the last two arrangements covering 1997–2004, Guinea
made very limited progress. It highlights that the programs’ objectives of reducing financial
imbalances and promoting higher private sector-led growth have not been attained and that
Guinea’s performance has been well below the country’s great potential. It underscores the
importance of strengthening ownership and commitment to programs’ objectives so as to
sustain a steady implementation of good macroeconomic policies and implement key structural
measures to unlock the country’s growth potential and reduce poverty.
2

Such assessments are required for members with longer-term program engagement. Guinea has
had arrangements with the Fund almost continuously since 1986, including four extended
arrangements (1987–90, 1991–96, 1997–2001, and 2001–04) and two stand-by arrangements
(1986 and 1987).

-3-

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the emergency economic recovery program adopted by the
authorities in March 2004 following the serious deterioration of Guinea’s economic situation
in 2003. However, Directors considered that this package alone would not be sufficient to put
the economy back onto a solid growth trajectory, bring about a significant reduction in inflation,
and restore foreign exchange rey stressed that initiating a staff-monitored program would
require evidence theserves. While recognizing the difficulty in realizing the needed short-term
fiscal adjustments, that the emergency program is restoring fiscal and monetary discipline, as
well as the adoption of a floating exchange rate system, the implementation of the long
delayed recommendations of the 2002 safeguards assessment mission, and the initiation of
urgently needed structural reforms.
Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation remains the cornerstone to improving
macroeconomic performance and reducing domestic debt. They indicated that achieving a
sound fiscal policy will depend critically on improving revenue performance, containing
defense spending, and keeping nonproductive outlays to a strict minimum to free up resources
to bolster domestically financed investment and social outlays.
Directors agreed that the central bank should stop accommodating the expansionary policies
of the government, and should instead focus monetary policy on its primary objective of
containing inflation. They emphasized that the sizeable monetary overhang calls for much
more proactive liquidity management, including open market operations to contain money
supply growth and limit inflationary pressures. They also advised that treasury bills should
replace central bank advances as the preferred instrument of budget financing. Directors noted
that financial indicators suggest that good progress has been achieved in improving the
soundness of the banking sector. However, they encouraged the authorities to continue
strengthening bank supervision and to push for the adoption of the revised banking and
microfinance laws.
Directors expressed concern that the de facto pegging of the Guinean franc to the US dollar
since late 2002 and the administrative allocation of foreign exchange had introduced
substantial distortions in the economy. They regretted the multiple currency practice arising
from the absence of a mechanism to prevent the rates in the official and parallel exchange
markets from diverging by more than two percent. Directors welcomed the depreciation of the
official rate that took place since July 2004, and the authorities’ objective of adopting a floating
exchange rate determined through interbank trading to eliminate the multiple currency
practice. They encouraged the authorities to make effective use of technical assistance to help
achieve this objective as soon as possible.
Directors underlined that economic reform over the medium term in Guinea faces serious risks
and challenges. Political instability and regional insecurity, lack of economic diversification,
possible shortfalls in donors’ support, and a growing domestic debt were of particular concern.
Directors emphasized that strong political will to adopt and steadily pursue a sound,

-4pro-growth, and poverty reducing reform agenda will be critical to help achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. They urged the authorities to accelerate the pace of reforms in the public
enterprise sector, including through privatization. Efforts to boost private sector opportunities
by improving the business climate and diversifying the economy were also favored.
In particular, Directors stressed the need to rapidly restructure the public utility enterprises to
alleviate shortages in electricity and water supply, and tackle operational difficulties in the
mining sector. In addition, they urged the authorities to rapidly and forcefully step up the fight
against corruption and show determination in reforming the judicial system. In this regard,
Directors stressed the importance of ensuring the independence of the Anti-Corruption
Commission.
Directors underlined the importance of trade diversification to improve the external accounts
over the medium term. In that regard, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to regional
integration and the steps taken to prepare for the introduction of the common external tariff
(CET) of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, noting that the CET would simplify
Guinea’s tariff system and enhance trade liberalization. However, Directors noted that
progress toward joining the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) is hindered by the lack of
economic convergence with other WAMZ member countries and Guinea’s vulnerability to
asymmetric shocks.
Directors expressed serious concerns over the difficulties Guinea has experienced in servicing
its external debt and over the country’s heavy external debt burden, noting the suspension of
interim debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and Guinea’s limited foreign exchange reserves.
They urged the authorities to eliminate external debt arrears and normalize relationships with
creditors, and in this regard they welcomed in particular the renewed dialogue with the EU.
Directors also stressed that decisive action is needed to reverse the recurring pattern of late
payments to the Fund. Further, they underlined the importance for the government to pursue
its reform efforts to eventually regain access to the HIPC Initiative relief it qualified for at the
decision point in 2000.
Directors commended the efforts to advance the poverty reduction agenda notwithstanding the
difficult economic environment, as discussed in Guinea’s first annual progress report of its
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-PR). However, the urgent correction of
macroeconomic imbalances is needed to achieve sustained poverty reduction and to shield
the social sector from budgetary cuts. They also called for using more recent poverty data to
update social indicators and supported the finalization of the integrated household survey.
Directors observed that, notwithstanding the efforts made in recent years to improve Guinea’s
statistical apparatus, data deficiencies remain in the areas of public finance, the real sector,
balance of payments, and external debt statistics. They encouraged close collaboration with
the international donor community, including the IMF’s West Africa Technical Assistance
Center, to strengthen the statistical database and, more broadly, to address capacity-building
needs.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Guinea’s performance under Fund-supported
programs since 1986 by means of an Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program

-5Engagement. Despite progress in stabilizing the economy during the decade through 1995,
subsequent economic performance was undermined by domestic policy weaknesses, political
uncertainty, and regional instability. Going forward, Directors noted that the ongoing
macroeconomic imbalances and structural problems in the core areas of the Fund’s expertise
warranted continued Fund engagement. However, they considered that any discussion on a
new PRGF-supported program should be preceded by successful adherence to a
staff-monitored program, building on the authorities’ emergency economic recovery program.
These reform efforts should address the current macroeconomic imbalances and advance
structural reforms in key areas in close cooperation with the World Bank. Directors stressed
the need to ensure ownership and commitment at the highest political level, to base any future
program on realistic assumptions of growth, revenue, and official finance, and to include exante contingency plans to ease adjustment should key assumptions turn out to be overly
optimistic.

(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
