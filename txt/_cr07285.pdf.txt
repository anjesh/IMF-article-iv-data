EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments. Economic trends in 2006 were encouraging. Growth picked up as
construction activities, oil output, and forestry production rebounded. Although inflation
rose, reflecting higher fuel prices, it was contained at about 5 percent. Cameroon’s overall
fiscal position and its current account balance both improved. However, in the fourth quarter
of 2006, emergency-related extrabudgetary spending, financed directly by the national oil
company, raised concerns about budget transparency.
Surveillance discussions. The first priority is to consolidate the fiscal gains of the past two
years, with the aim of preserving fiscal stability, while raising priority spending. The second
is to turn productivity growth around. To revive productivity, decisive actions are needed to
rebuild infrastructure, deepen financial intermediation, liberalize trade, complete reform of
public enterprises, and improve governance.
Program performance. The PRGF-supported program was implemented satisfactorily in
July–December 2006. Most fiscal and financial targets were met. However, because of
extrabudgetary spending in late 2006, the quantitative performance criterion on bank
financing was narrowly missed. Structural reforms monitored under the program were mostly
implemented as planned. In particular, the publication of two EITI reports covering oil sector
operations (in 2001–04 and 2005, respectively) contributed to increasing transparency and
effectiveness of public financial management.
Main elements of the PRGF-supported program. The 2007 budget centers on
consolidating the recent fiscal gains and expanding poverty-related spending. The program
includes measures to improve expenditure tracking and further mobilize revenues. Key to
improving the business environment in 2007 would be completion of the envisaged reform of
public enterprises in telecommunications, water, rural finance, and air transport sectors.

Cameroon to reach the completion

preserve fiscal sustainability; and (ii) strengthen the business climate to accelerate growth.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Assessing the sources of growth within a growth-accounting framework leads to the following
observations:
•

Productivity played a key role in boosting growth after the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994.
Besides the impulse from the devaluation, that boost likely reflected structural reforms (e.g.,
Cameroon opened its mobile telecommunications sector to competition; privatized its electricity
utility company, key agro-industry companies, and commercial and industrial port services; turned
management of the national railroad over to a private company; and reformed its banking and
insurance sectors).

•

The significant slowdown in
productivity over the past
3-4 years may reflect a weakening
of human capital in view of
deteriorating health indicators, and
the cumulative impact of an
unfavorable business climate. In
addition, delays in attracting new
investments in the
telecommunications,
transportation, and water sectors
may have compounded the
productivity decline.

Implementation/Outcome

Fiscal policy and
management

Raise nonoil revenues and contain
expenditures, and improve public
finance management.

Nonoil revenues increased—though at a
somewhat lower pace than envisaged—reflecting
reforms in tax policy, and tax and customs
administrations. Noninterest current expenditure
was contained, while the share of priority
spending was increased. Reforms were
implemented to improve expenditure tracking,
budget classification, and budget transparency.

Public enterprise
reform

Take actions to reduce government
participation in public enterprises and
improve services.

The restructuring of the airline, telephone, and
water companies has yet to be completed.

Private sector
development

Improve the business environment in
order to boost growth.

Spending on infrastructure outlays increased
somewhat. Limited progress was made toward
the removal of impediments to trade within
CEMAC. The government is taking steps to
strengthen the judiciary and fight corruption.

3.
The political environment is stable, though some social tensions linger. Debt
relief has generated expectations of immediate dividends, including increases in salaries and
improvements in public service delivery. But analysts do not expect possible strikes and
demonstrations to pose any significant political risks for the upcoming parliamentary
elections, scheduled for July 2007.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
4.
Economic growth picked
up somewhat in 2006, after
slowing in 2005, and external
sector developments were
favorable (Tables 1 and 2). Nonoil
activity strengthened in 2006
following a rebound in
construction, oil output, and
forestry production. Higher oil
prices and production, along with
an increase in nonoil export
volume, improved the external
current account.

Inflation rose in 2006, and the REER appreciated somewhat. Consumer prices
increased by 5 percent in
2006, as fuel prices were
adjusted upward. The
higher inflation rate, along
with a stronger euro—the
currency to which the
CFA franc is pegged—
contributed to the REER’s
appreciation. While the
REER is still about
20 percent lower than in
1993, nonprice factors
continue to hamper
Cameroon’s external
competitiveness (Box 3).

The overall fiscal position improved in 2005–06, though concerns about budget
execution and poverty reduction remain (Tables 3, 4). Oil revenues increased, owing to
higher world oil prices, and the government took steps to mobilize nonoil revenues (Box 4)
and control spending. Capital spending, however, fell below target owing primarily to the
sluggish pace of public

Program implementation under the PRGF-supported program was broadly
satisfactory (MEFP ¶ 4):
•

Most quantitative targets for end-December 2006—including the performance
criterion on the nonoil primary balance—were met (MEFP, Table 1). In view of the
above-noted extrabudgetary spending, the related benchmark was missed and the
quantitative performance criterion on bank financing was missed by a small margin
(0.04 percent of GDP).

•

Structural measures under the program were carried out mostly as planned (MEFP,
Table 2). The structural performance criteria for end-December 2006 related to the
submission to parliament of the 2007 budget, and adoption of a computerized system
(SYDONIA) in the country’s main customs office were met. The structural
performance criterion related to the privatization of the telephone company was
completed as scheduled (end-March 2007). And, all structural benchmarks through
end-March 2007 were met, including publication of two EITI reports, except the
preparation of a study on civil service remuneration.

10.
Progress in reforming public enterprises and implementing anticorruption
measures was uneven. The restructuring of CAMTEL and CAMPOST proceeded as

The 2006 FSAP for the CEMAC region (Country Report No. 06/321) points out, however, that a minimum
capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent may not reflect appropriately risk levels of the countries the region.
Furthermore, the limit on large exposures—that can be as high as 90 percent for “strategically important”
companies—is not in line with the Basel Committee’s recommended 25 percent.

planned. The attempt to privatize CAMAIR, however, was declared unsuccessful by the
government in April 2007 after a revised offer from the bidder (implying fewer routes and a
smaller fleet capacity) was deemed unsatisfactory. The government in mid-March appointed
members to the anticorruption commission set up a year ago. However, the target to appoint
a commission to enforce the law requiring public officials to declare their assets by the endFebruary 2007 went unmet. Despite efforts to strengthen governance, the picture is still
mixed (Box 3).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Cameroon’s medium-term challenge is to accelerate growth while maintaining
fiscal sustainability. The authorities at the highest levels have noted the important role of the
Fund in helping Cameroon reach these objectives, along with development agencies and
donors. Against this backdrop, discussions centered on two key areas:
•

First, focusing fiscal policies and reforms on preserving fiscal sustainability. This
will be achieved by enhancing nonoil revenue mobilization, while raising priority
spending in order to meet economic and social objectives in line with the PRSP
priorities.3 Higher poverty-related spending would allow Cameroon to make faster
progress toward the MDGs (Table 6). Fiscal sustainability will also require prudent
debt management.

•

Second, creating an environment conducive to private sector development. Besides
improvements to infrastructure, this objective will require policies to deepen financial
intermediation, liberalize trade, reform public enterprises, and strengthen governance.

12.
The nonoil real GDP growth projections have been raised somewhat relative to
the program baseline (text table below).4 The authorities expect better prospects for
forestry, construction, and tertiary sectors. In addition, they anticipate policies under the
PRGF-supported program to improve execution of government investment in infrastructure
and other priority areas, foster fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability, and improve
productivity.
13.
The staff and the authorities agreed that faster economic growth relative to the
past hinges on higher factor accumulation and productivity. Cameroon’s infrastructure
and overall investment rate, key predictors of growth, are weaker than in comparator
countries (Box 1).5 Although the macroeconomic scenario envisages increased public
investment, much of the factor accumulation would need to come from private sector
3

These include health, education, infrastructure, and governance institutions.

13
investment. Under the updated scenario, real GDP growth is projected at 5 percent per year
on average in 2007-15, with factor accumulation and productivity each contributing equally
to the forecast. Key to boosting productivity and attracting FDI will be infrastructure
development, completion of reforms of public enterprises and improvements in the business
climate (see below). An increase in FDI would contribute to the rise in private investment,
facilitate international knowledge transfer, and strengthen conditions for domestic
competition.
14.
The authorities are aware of the challenges entailed to raise growth rates beyond
5 percent per year. A scaling up scenario where government and private investment each is
higher by about 2 percentage points of GDP per year during 2008-15 would add another
¾-1 percentage point to real GDP growth per annum. Thus, the 7 percent per annum growth
rate envisaged in the government’s PRSP6 required to lower the poverty rate by half by 2015
is unlikely to materialize.

15.
The macroeconomic impact of lower oil prices relative to the baseline is mixed
(text table above).
•

Inflation is projected to decelerate reflecting an expected decline in fuel prices. In
addition, Cameroon’s membership to a monetary union, accompanied by an open
position on current transactions, provides a solid anchor for a low inflation
environment.

•

The overall fiscal surplus will be about 1 percentage point of GDP lower on average
in 2007-08, though the nonoil fiscal balance will remain unchanged.

•

The current account deficit will be larger by about 2 percentage points of GDP on
average.
A. Fostering Fiscal Sustainability

16.
The nonoil primary fiscal balance remains the anchor for fiscal policy. The
medium-term fiscal strategy (Country Report No. 06/231) is premised on the following:
•

conservative projected oil prices in the budget to isolate core government operations
from fluctuations in oil revenue and safeguard fiscal sustainability;

•

a gradual increase in nonoil revenue to offset losses from the expected decline in oil
reserves and the loss of tariff revenues from the EPA with the EU and trade
liberalization; and

•

expansion of capital expenditure relative to 2005–06 to boost growth, and deploying
the resources freed up by debt relief in line with the priorities of the PRSP, while
controlling current spending.

17.
Staff discussed with the authorities the appropriateness of the current fiscal
strategy. In the updated scenario, the nonoil primary deficit would be about 3 percent per

assessed using two models:
1/ Excluding foreign-financed investment.

16
•

A debt sustainability analysis shows that debt relief has opened up significant fiscal
space (Supplement). The baseline assumption of new public debt of 1-2 percent of
GDP a year to finance investment would keep debt well below the sustainability
threshold. Staff stressed that, even in the updated scenario, debt would rise to about
40 percent of exports (in NPV terms) by 2010 and to 100 percent by 2020. Staff noted
that the pace of debt accumulation should also be considered in assessing fiscal space.
The authorities agreed, but noted that some flexibility is needed to finance growthenhancing projects in view of limited scope for external borrowing by the private
sector. They expressed concerns about the dearth of concessional financing.

•

A permanent income hypothesis (PIH) model shows that a nonoil primary fiscal
deficit of about 0.5 percent of nonoil GDP could be sustained over the next
40-50 years.7 The deviation of the nonoil fiscal primary balance under the baseline
scenario from that of the PIH model reflects scaled-up priority investment to
accelerate growth. The authorities did not consider the PIH model’s results as reliable
enough to underpin fiscal strategy.

18.
Notwithstanding the additional fiscal space, scaling up of spending would
require close attention to absorptive, administrative, and institutional constraints:
•

Absorptive capacity. Staff noted that unless absorptive capacity can be expanded, a
significant scaling up of spending may result in “Dutch disease.” While the
authorities agreed in principle, they pointed out that this risk would be limited, given
the existing monetary regime and past experience on inflation. They noted that
outlays geared toward improving productive capacity would minimize this risk. In
addition, the high import content of infrastructure-related spending would help
minimize inflationary pressures.

•

Administrative and institutional capacity. The authorities attributed recent
constraints on expanding investment outlays to the cumbersome procedures under a
new procurement system. Staff urged the authorities to (i) strengthen public
expenditure tracking, (ii) improve public procurement, (iii) train personnel to perform
administrative tasks that would ensure effective utilization of the procurement
system, and (iv) improve identification, costing, and planning of projects.

19.
Consolidating the fiscal gains made in 2005 and 2006 and expanding priority
spending is at the center of the 2007 budget, as well as the medium-term fiscal scenario.
•

7

Noninterest current spending is expected to increase by 0.8 percentage point of GDP
in 2007 relative to 2006. The wage bill will be kept below 5 percent of GDP, while

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper for more details.

17
the impact of oil price increases on domestic fuel prices is split equally between fuel
price increases and transfers to SONARA. Over the medium term, priority current
spending not financed by debt-relief resources is expected to rise by 0.2-0.3
percentage point of GDP.
•

Capital spending is projected to increase by 2 percentage points of GDP in 2007,
reflecting primarily debt-relief-financed domestic investment.

•

Repayment of domestic debt and arrears will continue. While windfall in oil revenues
will be used primarily to accelerate repayment of domestic debt and arrears, priority
one-off spending, in line with PRSP priorities, will also be considered in the context
of program reviews (MEFP ¶8).

20.
The authorities expect that the nonoil revenue target could be achieved with
improvements in tax and custom administrations. They concur that it is important to
further boost Cameroon’s nonoil revenues, especially given the expected decline in oil
revenues and trade liberalization. Given that tax rates on capital income, labor, and
consumption are already high, broadening the tax base through administrative measures
would be a priority (MEFP, ¶10-11). At the same time, however, tax incentives introduced in
2007 pose a risk to this objective. Nonetheless, the authorities are convinced that tax policy
measures implemented in 2006 (Box 4) and those envisaged in 2007 should contribute to
setting nonoil revenues on an upward path. Staff urged the authorities, however, to be
vigilant on attaining the nonoil revenues objectives and to be ready to accelerate
administrative measures envisaged in 2007 and adopt tax policy measures if tax receipts fall
below expectations.
21.
The authorities will continue using prudent oil price assumptions in order to
shelter public spending from short-term oil revenue volatility. In this regard, the staff and
authorities agreed that a prudence factor of US$7 per barrel would be appropriate.8 To
prevent future expenditure adjustments if oil prices were to decline, and to support budget
operations, staff proposed that part of the oil windfall be set aside in a special BEAC account.
The authorities noted that they would give this proposal further consideration.
22.
The authorities will continue taking steps to improve the quality of public
spending. Subsidies to public enterprises burden the budget. Staff pointed out that growth
and poverty reduction objectives will be better achieved by reorienting spending toward
education, health, and infrastructure. Regarding fuel subsidies, staff called for their gradual
phasing out since they benefit primarily high-income households (Box 5). The authorities
8

Oil price projections are set below WEO prices by a constant prudence factor. The proposed prudence factor is
equivalent to about half a standard deviation of annual prices over the past 20 years and is in addition to a
US$3 per barrel quality discount. Should oil prices decline by more than the prudence factor, the staff and
authorities will review the macroeconomic framework.

18
stressed the importance of proceeding cautiously on this front in view of the need to maintain
social peace. They agreed to adopt a revised formula to adjust fuel prices, which will permit
the automatic adjustment of prices in accordance with international oil price movements
(MEFP ¶17).
23.
The authorities concurred on the need to safeguard the quality of government
spending. In this regard, they are pursuing several fiscal reforms.
•

Budget monitoring and expenditure tracking. To track budget execution better and
ensure preparation of coherent budget execution data, the authorities intend to
strengthen information technology interlinkages between the budget and the treasury,
and prepare a public financial management action plan (MEFP, ¶13). They also plan
to adopt a new organic budget law in 2007 (Box 6) aimed at modernizing the budget
framework.

•

Procurement system. The authorities, with the assistance of the World Bank, will
improve the procurement system (MEFP, ¶14). They plan to assess annually the
reliability and performance of the system and make necessary adjustments.

•

Transparency of budget management. The authorities will refrain from carrying
out extrabudgetary spending; in this regard, they have requested a strengthening of
the program condition related to cash spending by the SNH. They will continue
publishing data on budget execution and oil sector operations, as well as future EITI
reports.

•

Civil service. Actions are envisaged in the civil service area to help safeguard fiscal
sustainability. In this regard, the authorities plan to: (i) ensure that a cost analysis
precede any regularization of salaries; (ii) unify the civil service database; and
(iii) upgrade the current payroll software to better secure data.
B. Improving the Business Environment

24.
The authorities recognize the importance of further enhancing the business
environment to boost private sector activity and growth. As noted above, the key to
boosting investment and growth is higher productivity (Box 1). The latter will require
considerable improvement in the business environment through reforms in the financial
sector, trade, public enterprises, and governance.

19

Box 5. Fuel Pricing and Social Impact
The current pricing of fuel products in Cameroon is complex both in its objectives and
implementation. Besides adjusting prices to subsidize the domestic oil refinery, the pricing
formula applies a negative excise tax to kerosene (designed to help the poor, who are
relatively heavy users of the commodity).
The pricing formula has been further complicated by the recent rise in world oil prices,
which in Cameroon has been accompanied by measures to limit the pass-through to
domestic fuel prices. Customs taxes and value-added taxes (VAT) on petroleum products
since 2004 have been reduced. Ex-refinery prices have also been held below the levels
specified by the pricing formula, resulting in the need for direct budget subsidies to the
domestic refinery.
In 2006, a Fund TA mission advised the authorities to simplify the formula. It recommended
that the authorities begin by isolating the various objectives involved in pricing fuel
products and use a single instrument to achieve each of them. For example, the standard
VAT rate should be used and differential excise taxes could be introduced to achieve
desired domestic fuel prices. It also recommended that the refinery be subject to
international fuel prices to increase transparency; any resulting losses could be financed
through direct budgetary transfers.
Targeted social spending could replace tax instruments and subsidies in mitigating the
effects of higher fuel prices on the poor.
Under the current budget mechanism, more
than half the budgetary costs (i.e., in the
form of subsidies or forgone revenue) now
accrue to the top income quintile because
richer households consume more kerosene
and other fuel products than do poorer
households. Measures that instead scale up
existing transfer programs and develop
effective social protections, while achieving
the same objectives, would be more costeffective.

Box 6. New Organic Budget Law
The current budget legal framework, which is primarily based on the 1962 ordinance with
some later amendments, is complex. Governance issues associated with budget execution
partly reflect the complex expenditure chain. To address these weaknesses, the authorities have
decided to introduce a new organic budget law. The law’s main objectives are to better define
the roles of the government and parliament in the budget process and to increase
accountability. Its main innovations would be to
¾ present and execute the budget according to program rather than by administrative
divisions;
¾ make the ministries fully accountable for their budgets, which requires decentralization of
the management of the budget, including analysis and monitoring of programs, at the line
ministry level;
¾ revise the framework guiding the parliament’s role in the budget process; and
¾ improve the content and format of ex post budget audit law.
For the new organic law to become effective, coordinated action will be required to (i) ensure a
high degree of cooperation between ministries in preparing and executing their budgets; (ii)
decentralize the budget structure so that line ministries have appropriate power over all aspects
of budget execution; (iii) establish an effective and integrated management information system;
and (iv) build a strong political commitment to the reforms. In view of these requirements, the
law’s provisions will be implemented over a five-year period starting in 2008.

Financial sector
25.
Bold measures will be needed to enhance banking intermediation. Based on the
recommendations of the regional FSAP, staff called on the authorities to improve the judicial
system and land registries, and expand the information base to enable banks to price risks
better.9 In addition, limits on interest rates at the regional level would need to be reviewed to
reflect market conditions. While broadly agreeing that policy and structural factors have
impeded financial intermediation, the authorities said that market imperfections (e.g.,
oligopolistic structure of banking system, limited access to banks in rural areas, etc.) should
be given due consideration. They agreed to prepare by end-2007 an action plan aimed at
deepening financial intermediation, taking into account the recommendations of a
forthcoming FSAP mission. They also agreed to facilitate credit access through measures that

9

21
ease procedures for collecting on guarantees, create a commercial tribunal, and expand
financial information (MEFP, ¶21).
26.
To help bring banking services to remote areas, the authorities will pursue the
restructuring of CAMPOST. They see CAMPOST as an important player in the financial
sector. Staff urged the authorities to adhere to the envisaged timetable, which requires the
financial services subsidiary to be spun off and brought under the supervision of COBAC by
June 2007 (performance criterion).
27.
Efforts are needed to broaden the depth of the financial sector. The development
of domestic debt and equity markets will be important for accelerating long-term growth
(MEFP, ¶22). To foster greater capital market development, the authorities plan to transfer all
secondary market transactions on zero-coupon government debt to the bond market. These
transactions will take place under the supervision of the financial markets commission.
Trade reform
28.
Trade liberalization will contribute to lowering the cost of doing business. The
authorities are pursuing the trade reform agenda, including to lower the common external
tariffs, within the CEMAC (MEFP, ¶20). They concurred that lower import tariffs could
stimulate growth, but expressed concerns about the revenue losses that may result. The staff
shared these concerns, and discussed ways to make up for the revenue losses. On the policy
side, the staff recommended an expansion of the tax base for income taxes, and a reduction of
the reliance on tax exemptions as a tool to encourage investment and consumption. Over the
longer run, the staff suggested that a reduction in top marginal income tax rates could reduce
the incentive for tax evasion. The authorities broadly concurred and plan to prepare a
medium-term plan for improving nonoil revenue mobilization.
Public enterprise restructuring
29.
The reform of key public enterprises should be accelerated (MEFP, ¶24). Staff
urged the authorities to complete pending reforms in a timely manner in order to alleviate the
burden on the budget and improve services. In CAMAIR’s case, the authorities stressed their
commitment to relaunch the reform with a view to improving efficiency and eliminating
budgetary subsidies. Reforms are also envisaged in telecommunications (CAMTEL) and the
water sector (SNEC).
Governance
30.
The authorities noted that, by lowering uncertainty in the regulatory and
judicial environment, anticorruption efforts will also improve the business climate
(MEFP, ¶25). They will appoint members to the commission that will implement the law
requiring high public officials to declare their assets by year-end 2007. Furthermore, in the
framework of donor-coordinated efforts on governance under the OECD-DAC initiative,

22
they will prepare a comprehensive anticorruption strategy and an accompanying action plan.
Publication of corruption-related court decisions and administrative sanctions will continue.
IV. FINANCING ASSURANCES REVIEW
31.
Given Cameroon’s arrears to private external creditors, the staff discussed
issues related to financing assurances. The staff reiterated the importance of resolving
pending litigation with relevant creditors in line with Cameroon’s commitment to the Paris
Club of offering comparable treatment to nonparticipating creditors.10 Negotiations with
private creditors are ongoing. While Cameroon has offered terms that are comparable with
the enhanced HIPC Initiative, commercial creditors have yet to accept them. A few have
improved their offers by agreeing to forgo accumulated interest and penalties, but have
insisted that Cameroon repay the principal in full.
V. PROGRAM RISKS AND MONITORING
32.
The program is subject to risks, notably in the areas of growth, revenue
mobilization, and expenditure control:
•

Slow action to improve the business climate could jeopardize growth and poverty
reduction.

•

Sluggish progress in raising nonoil revenues could threaten the fiscal objectives,
especially the goal to increase priority spending on a sustained basis.

•

Parliamentary elections in 2007 could test the authorities’ ability to resist spending
pressures.

33.
The program will be monitored every six months on the basis of quantitative and
structural performance criteria, benchmarks, and indicative benchmarks (MEFP, Tables 1-4).
Reflecting the authorities’ commitment to zero extrabudgetary spending, they requested that
the structural benchmark on spending by the national oil company be changed to a
performance criterion. Furthermore, because of reduced oil revenues, reflecting the decline in
oil prices relative to earlier projections, the authorities have requested a modification of the
end-June 2007 performance criterion on the net claims of the banking system on the central
government (MEFP, Table 1). The program is fully financed through the next review.
34.
Data provision to the Fund remains adequate for surveillance purposes, though
further improvements are needed. Efforts have been made to strengthen national accounts
10

Of the 22 commercial creditors that did not participate in the 2003 debt buy-back operation, 5 have resorted
to litigation. Two of those creditors have already received favorable judgments and have seized government
assets.

23
and fiscal data. From here, the quality and timeliness of BOP statistics needs to improve. The
authorities have expressed interest in further improving and disseminating Cameroon’s
macroeconomic statistics.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Improvements in macroeconomic performance over the past decade are
encouraging. Nonoil output has increased since 1995, and inflation overall has been low.
The fiscal position has generally strengthened, and debt relief has brought the country’s debt
to a sustainable level. The authorities are to be commended for implementing the policies and
reforms needed to achieve these results.
36.
The authorities will need to consolidate these gains and ensure a steady pace of
improvement. Although the macroeconomic performance has broadly improved, the rhythm
of progress has been uneven. In particular, there have been swings in the pace of fiscal
consolidation, including progress on nonoil revenue mobilization and expenditure control. In
addition, while the declining trend in economic activity observed until 1994 has been
reversed, the growth pick up has not been strong enough to achieve a significant reduction in
poverty. Finally, the recent productivity deceleration is a cause for concern. Against this
background, key forward-looking priorities relate to: consolidating the recent fiscal gains and
preserving fiscal sustainability; and strengthening the business climate to accelerate growth.
37.
Steps should be taken to set nonoil revenues on a steady upward path, especially
in the context of declining oil reserves and the expected trade liberalization. In view of the
high tax rates, administrative measures being implemented by the authorities to expand the
tax base are essential. The authorities should nonetheless remain vigilant about meeting their
nonoil revenue objectives and be ready to accelerate tax administration measures envisaged
in 2007 and adopt policy measures if tax receipts fall below expectations.
38.
Continued attention on spending levels would be needed, while promoting
priority outlays. The staff urges the authorities to follow budgetary procedures and refrain
from undertaking extrabudgetary spending. Meanwhile, chronic capital spending shortfalls
raise concerns about progress towards achieving growth and poverty reduction objectives.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to enhance capital budget execution, including
through timely budget presentation to parliament, allocation of adequate counterpart funds to
externally-financed projects, and staff training.
39.
Expenditure quality should be enhanced. The staff urges the authorities to contain
and then eliminate over time budgetary subsidies in order to create fiscal space for more
priority spending. In addition, the tracking of budget execution will need to be further
reinforced, including by strengthening interlinkages between the budget and the treasury.
More generally, the authorities’ intention to prepare a medium-term action plan to further
improve budget management is welcome.

24
40.
Debt must be managed prudently. The authorities should continue to borrow on
concessional terms and ensure that borrowed resources are put to effective use, and to
analyze debt sustainability on a regular basis. As confirmed by a review under the Fund’s
Lending into Arrears policy, Cameroon is making good-faith efforts to reach agreements
with commercial creditors and is pursuing appropriate policies. In staff’s view, Cameroon’s
adjustment efforts are not undermined by developments in its relations with creditors.
41.
Decisive actions are needed to strengthen the business environment. In order to
boost productivity and accelerate growth, it is necessary to improve financial intermediation,
liberalize trade, reform public enterprises, and tackle corruption.
•

The strengthening of financial intermediation will be greatly facilitated by easing
procedures for collecting on guarantees and creating a commercial tribunal. The
authorities’ commitment to build on the recommendations of the upcoming national
FSAP mission and prepare an action plan to reform of the financial system is
welcome.

•

The authorities are to be commended for pursuing the trade reform agenda within the
CEMAC, including a lowering of the common external tariffs.

•

Ongoing public enterprise reforms should be accelerated. It will be critical for the
authorities to complete the reforms, begun a few years ago, in telecommunications,
water, finance, and air transport. The timely completion of these reforms will buoy
the budget and allow the authorities to direct freed-up resources to more productive
areas.

•

The staff urges the authorities to step up anticorruption efforts aimed at lowering
uncertainty in the regulatory and judicial environment in order to improve the
business climate.

42.

Staff recommends that the Board:
•

complete the financing assurances review, given that Cameroon’s current relations
with its external creditors offer sufficient financing assurances for the Fund-supported
program;

•

complete the third review under the PRGF, in view of satisfactory performance
through April 2007 and commitments made through the rest of 2007;

•

convert the quantitative benchmark on cash spending by SNH to a performance
criterion, reflecting the authorities’ commitment to refrain from extrabudgetary
spending;

25
•

grant a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion on net claims
of the banking system on the central government, given the small margin by which
the target was missed and the authorities’ commitment to uphold future targets; and

•

modify the end-June 2007 performance criterion on net claims of the banking
system on the central government, to allow for lower government deposits since oil
prices are running below the baseline projections.

43.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Cameroon take place
within 24 months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in
program countries.

May 29, 2007

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
During the second half of 2006, the government continued its efforts to consolidate
the macroeconomic framework and implement structural reforms in the context of its
economic program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The government remains convinced that the
continued implementation of the economic measures and policies it has undertaken under the
PRGF will enable it to build on the satisfactory results already obtained and combat poverty
more effectively, while improving the prospects for growth.
2.
The government’s efforts to pursue fiscal consolidation during the period of JulyDecember 2006 helped it to meet most of the program’s quantitative criteria and benchmarks
at end-December 2006. Nonetheless, a waiver is needed for the nonobservance of the
performance criterion on the increase in net claims of the banking system on the central
government owing to extrabudgetary expenditure for which payments were made directly by
the national oil company. In this regard, the government wishes to stress the exceptional
nature of those transactions, and to confirm its determination to take all necessary steps to
prevent the resurgence of extrabudgetary expenditure and to improve compliance with
budgetary procedures. The government has therefore decided to strengthen the program by
requesting to change the structural benchmark on cash payments by the national oil company
on account of the government into a performance criterion.
3.
Progress was also achieved in the implementation of structural reforms in the areas of
public finance and transparency. In particular, two reports conducted within the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative covering 2001-04 and 2005, respectively, have been
published on the website of the government. The government is aware of the importance of
improving governance and the business environment with a view to achieving greater
economic growth and reduced poverty in a sustainable way. Given the unsuccessful
negotiations for the privatization of CAMAIR, the government wants to reiterate its
commitment to eliminating budgetary subsidies to airline companies, including CAMAIR,
and improving air services. In this regard, it plans to commence end-July 2007
implementation of a strategy to recruit a private strategic partner for CAMAIR.

39
4.
The macroeconomic policies and objectives for the second year of the program and
the medium term remain consistent with the general framework underlying the government’s
three-year PRGF-supported program. The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) supplements the MEFP attached to the letter of intent of December 6, 2006.
It evaluates the implementation of the government’s economic program during the second
half of 2006, and presents the economic policies and objectives for the period spanning
January to June 2007.
5.
For purposes of the execution of its economic and financial program, the government
set ambitious medium-term objectives, consistent with the macroeconomic framework of the
three-year program. In this context, particular emphasis will continue to be placed on
enhancing fiscal management, mobilizing nonoil revenue, combating corruption, and
improving the quality of public investment.
6.
The government is convinced that the economic and financial policies described in
the attached MEFP will help to achieve the objectives of its January-June 2007 economic
program. Nevertheless, it is prepared to take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. The government will consult with the IMF Managing Director
on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in
the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. However, the
lower-than-projected oil revenue would call for a modification of the performance criterion
on the ceiling on the increase in net claims of the banking system on the central government
for end-June 2007.
7.
The government will take all necessary measures to ensure that the fourth program
review is completed by end-December 2007. This review will be based on the quantitative
and structural performance criteria at end-June 2007.
8.
Given performance so far and the commitments undertaken in the MEFP, the
government requests that the fourth disbursement under the arrangement in the amount
equivalent to SDR 2.65 million be made available upon completion of the third review.
9.
Finally, the government of Cameroon authorizes the IMF to make this letter and the
attached MEFP available to the public.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Inoni Ephraim
Prime Minister and
Head of Government

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies
Yaoundé, May 29, 2007
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In 2006, the government continued to improve its fiscal position and implement
structural reforms. Debt cancellation under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) have created a conducive
environment for Cameroon to tackle its medium-term challenges, namely, preserving longterm fiscal sustainability and accelerating economic growth, mainly through infrastructure
and a more favorable business environment. This memorandum reviews the achievements
during July-December 2006 of the three-year program supported by the IMF under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and updates the economic and financial
objectives and policies for 2007 and 2008, described in the Memorandum on Economic and
Financial Policies of December 6, 2006.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND RESULTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
2.
Nonoil economic growth was 3.5 percent in 2006, following a contraction in the agroexport sector. The erosion in the preferential treatment granted by the European Union to
Cameroon’s agricultural exports (notably bananas) made inroads into Cameroon’s nonoil
exports. At the same time, local production had to face increased competition from finished
products from lower cost producing countries. Higher oil prices and production nonetheless
improved the external balance for 2006. In December 2006, consumer prices recorded a yearon-year increase of 5.1 percent, reflecting mainly higher prices for petroleum products. There
was a marked rise in net foreign assets in 2006, attributable to higher oil revenue.
Nevertheless, money supply growth was contained through a reduction in net bank credit to
the government.
3.
The primary fiscal balance for 2006 improved by 1.3 percent of GDP compared with
2005. This result essentially stemmed from a good outturn in oil revenue. The execution of
capital expenditure was lower than expected, mainly because of bottlenecks in disbursing aid
under the debt relief initiative and in procurement procedures.
4.
The implementation of the program supported by the PRGF for the period JulyDecember 2006 was broadly satisfactory. Most of the quantitative performance criteria and
benchmarks of the PRGF-supported program for the period July-December 2006 were met
(Table 1). However, following the resurgence of extra-budgetary spending directly financed
by the SNH (0.2 percent of GDP), the criterion on net bank credit to the central government

41
could not be met. This spending was mostly related to sovereign expenditure executed at the
end of the fiscal year 2006, either to rehabilitate restituted areas under the Greentree Accord,
or to address security problems in border areas. The implementation of structural measures
was satisfactory overall (Table 2).
•

Government finance and civil service. The two performance criteria for endDecember were observed, that is, submission to Parliament of the draft 2007 Budget
Law in accordance with the program and its adoption by end-2006; and the
implementation of the customs information system in the Littoral province. The
summary tables tracking expenditure were produced on a regular basis and also
covered pro-poor spending. With the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank, the
government improved its new draft organic law on government finance, which also
included a timetable for its implementation over the period 2007-2011. The
government completed its census of civil servants on the basis of the payroll file and
payment records, and used the results to clean up the payroll. Furthermore, the
establishment of tax centers for medium-sized enterprises in Yaoundé and Douala at
end-December 2006 will enable a more efficient tax monitoring.

•

Public enterprises. Public enterprise reform is ongoing with the assistance of the
World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. In the telecommunications
sector, a public call for bids for the privatization of the national telephone company
(CAMTEL) was made in January 2007 (performance criterion). The call for bids for
the management contract of the national water company (SNEC) within the
framework of a public-private partnership was launched in February 2007
(performance criterion). Concerning the privatization of the national airline company
(CAMAIR), the government terminated negotiations with the provisional bidder in
April 2007 in view of difficulties in reaching an agreement on a satisfactory offer.

•

Financial sector. The recruitment of the management team for CAMPOST was
completed in October 2006. The team assumed responsibility for managing the
company in February 2007. To ensure the successful reconstitution of the assets of
CAMPOST, the government: (i) opened an escrow account at the BEAC to deposit
the transfers it made to CAMPOST as part of its domestic debt settlement; and
(ii) entrusted the financial supervision of CAMPOST to the unit within the Ministry
of Economy and Finance in charge of the oversight of nonbank financial institutions,
which will produce a quarterly supervision report. The first report covering the
operations of the third quarter of 2006 has been prepared.

5.
The government also continued its implementation of transparency-enhancing
measures, but delays have been experienced in meeting some of the anticorruption
commitments:

42
•

Publication. The quarterly budget-execution reports, the quarterly operating reports
of the national oil company (SNH), and the annual financial aggregates of the main
public enterprises were published. In addition, the government began publishing
statistical data and debt analysis on the CAA website (www.caa.gov.cm). Judicial
decisions and administrative penalties against government employees as part of the
anti-corruption campaign were also published on the Prime Minister’s website
(www.spm.gov.cm).

•

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Some progress was
made in implementing the EITI principles. A consortium was recruited to produce the
administrator’s report on oil revenue data covering the period 2001 to 2004. The first
report was published on the government’s website. The second report covering 2005
was published on the government’s website in March 2007.

•

Fight against corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Commission (CONAC),
established in March 2006, was made operational in March 2007, as its president and
its members got appointed. However, the Commission planned as part of the
implementation of asset disclosure by senior government officials did not begin
operations in February 2007, as the implementing regulations under the law had not
yet been adopted.
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2007 AND 2008
A. Macroeconomic Framework

6.
The economic outlook should improve in 2007, partly due to the beneficial impact of
external debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. Nonoil GDP growth is therefore
expected to be about 4.5 percent, mainly as a result of the recovery in the agro-industrial
export and service sectors and of the increase in public investment. The inflationary pressures
evident in 2006, fuelled mainly by higher oil prices, should ease in 2007. Cameroon’s
external position should weaken, however, as oil prices ease.
B. Fiscal Policy
7.
Given the fall in oil prices, the government is expecting a drop of about
CFAF 167 billion in its oil revenue compared with the 2007 program (about 1.5 percent of
GDP).11 The main fiscal objectives of the 2007 program remain unchanged. Nonoil revenue
11

The program’s approach of using conservative oil price projections is maintained; oil prices have been
estimated at a constant prudence factor of US$7 per barrel below the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO)
projections (excluding the US$3 per barrel discount on Cameroonian crude).

43
should materialize as programmed. On the expenditure side, noninterest expenditure in 2007
will increase by 3 percentage points of GDP compared with 2006, of which about two thirds
are for capital expenditure. To improve the execution of poverty reduction expenditure, the
government will seek to ease the constraints on HIPC Initiative and C2D financing by
involving donors and lenders in discussions at budget conferences. The government will also
take measures to accelerate the execution of capital expenditure. The 2007 budget
appropriations were made very early in January, thus enabling a more rapid start in the
execution of the capital budget. Starting with the 2008 budget, expenditure items that have
been committed, but for which payment has not been authorized by the end of a fiscal year,
will be entered as priority items in the budget for the following year. The government will
also prepare a road map toward executing a multiyear investment budget.
8.
The government is committed to continue to use any windfall in oil revenue
exclusively for one-off purposes, particularly to: (i) accelerate payments on domestic debt
and arrears; (ii) repurchase debt held by external commercial creditors who did not take part
in the commercial debt repurchase initiative (London Club); and (iii) after consultation with
IMF staff, finance investment projects in the sectors defined in the PRSP, including the
counterpart funds for jointly-financed projects such as infrastructure development (roads,
energy) and investment in major sectoral programs (education, health, and rural and urban
development).
C. Fiscal Reform
9.
The government reaffirms its commitment not to have recourse to extrabudgetary
expenditure, and intends to make further efforts to enhance budgetary procedures and initiate
the fiscal reforms described in the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies of
December 6, 2006. To this end, the government has requested to change the quantitative
benchmark on cash payments by the SNH on account of the government to the status of a
continuous performance criterion.
10.
The mobilization of nonoil revenue is a major challenge for Cameroon. To achieve
the revenue objectives, the government is committed to: (i) completing by November 2007
the online connection between the IT systems of the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI) and
the General Directorate of Customs (DGD); (ii) completing by end-September 2007 the
establishment of the electronic one-stop window to facilitate foreign trade by finalizing the
interfaces with the various foreign trade stakeholders, including Customs; and (iii)
eliminating by end-June 2007 the “minimum administrative values” for all imported products
(except sugar, pasta, cigarettes, palm oil, and concrete reinforcing bars, of which the minimal
administrative values will be eliminated at end-December 2007), and taxing imported goods
based on Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CAEMC) rules. To broaden
the duty base, the authorities will continue their efforts to control and reduce exemptions, and
will publish a quarterly report identifying exemptions and the related revenue losses. The
government is also committed to improving ex-post controls. It will also improve the

44
implementation and control of customs and economic regimes, in particular the transit to
Chad and the Central African Republic. Lastly, the government is committed to submitting to
Parliament at its November 2007 session a draft law on electronic commerce and electronic
bank payments.
11.
In addition, the government will take a number of measures to broaden the tax base:
(i) by end-December 2007, the number of taxpayers covered by the tax centers for mediumsized enterprises in Yaoundé and Douala will grow some 20 percent compared with the tax
roll as at January 1, 2007; (ii) streamlining of taxpayer identification, reforming the single
taxpayer identification number, and safeguarding the single taxpayer file will be completed
by end-October 2007; (iii) at end-November 2007, the implementation of a tax-related
information management software (AREN) will also have been completed. In addition, the
launching on March 23, 2007 of the framework for performing point audits pursuant to the
2007 Budget Law will contribute to increasing VAT and personal income tax receipts.
Finally, the government is committed to creating a Review Commission of Domestic Tax and
Foreign Trade Taxation, for which the terms of reference will be completed by end-May
2007. This commission, which will bring together government departments, economic
operators, and civil society, will submit a summary report on its work and recommendations
by end-December 2007. The plan for implementing the commission’s recommendations will
be examined and approved in the first half of 2008. The first round of reforms will be
proposed in the draft 2009 Budget Law.
12.
To increase forestry revenue, the government re-instituted the Program to Secure
Forestry Revenue (PSRF) as the sole point of contact for the forestry sector for tax purposes.
Protocols for collaboration will be worked out between the PSRF and all the other entities
involved in monitoring the forestry sector. The collaboration protocols will state clearly the
data required from the entities, as well as the periodicity, deadlines, and modalities for
transferring the information. It is also the intention of the government to establish by
December 2007 an online connection between the Ministry of Forests and Wildlife and the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. This is an essential step toward restoring the capacity to
monitor sectoral economic data and control the tax base.
13.
The government confirms its commitment to strengthen monitoring of public
expenditure. In this regard, it will continue to prepare consistent monthly budget execution
tables on a cash basis and on a payment order basis, as well as a monthly expenditure table
broken down by economic function to track spending in priority sectors. In addition, the
government intends by end-June 2007 to consolidate the connection between the IT systems
of the General Directorates of the Budget and the Treasury and produce summary reports on
budget execution – from commitment through payment – on a functional basis for the
January-April 2007 period. The government is also committed to engaging in discussions
aimed at presenting budget execution along the lines of the government financial operations
table (TOFE) on a commitment-basis. To this end, a diagnostic study will be prepared by
end-August 2007 on the measures and the critical path toward preparing the TOFE on a

45
payment order basis for all expenditure. On this basis, the TOFE for the execution of the
2007 budget will be produced by end-May 2008. In addition, the experts from the ministries
in priority sectors will receive further training on using budget classification by end-June
2007. The government will also continue to strengthen the overall and sectoral medium-term
expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) and their use in the budget preparation, beginning with the
preparation of the draft 2008 Budget Law. The government’s commitment also extends to the
preparation, by end-December 2007, of an action plan to improve further public expenditure
management.
14.
The government intends to pursue its public procurement reforms by periodically
assessing the public procurement system and systematically publishing the penalties imposed
on offenders. In this regard, the government completed its updating of the general conditions
of contract (Cahier des Clauses Administratives Générales - CCAG) by implementing since
February 13, 2007 the related documents. All these documents, including the new CCAG,
were published on the government’s website. In addition, the government plans to: (i)
implement the standard bid documents and procedural manuals by end-August 2007; (ii)
publish by end-September 2007 the audit report on public procurement activities in 2005;
(iii) adopt in 2007 the implementing regulations on amicable settlement under the Public
Procurement Code; and (iv) conduct annual assessments of the reliability and performance of
the national public procurement system, using a set of performance indicators defined in
collaboration with the World Bank.
D. Civil Service
15.
The government will continue its ongoing civil service reforms to establish a solid
basis for determining staffing levels and the payroll, secure and harmonize the related data,
and increase the efficiency of the civil service. Following the clean-up of the payroll file,
measures were taken to further contain the wage bill and staffing levels to maintain the
accuracy of the file, which will in turn improve the quality of the simulations of the financial
impact of wage policies. The new payroll file has already been used to: (i) calculate the
financial impact of adjusting salaries for promotions and (ii) assess wage arrears stemming
from past unpaid promotions. In this context, the government plans to give priority to
adjusting the salaries using the savings from the census and clean-up of the payroll. These
amounts will be paid only once the full cost of the adjustments is assessed to ensure that they
are commensurate with the available resources. By June 2008, the government also plans to
replace the current IT system used for the payroll with a more efficient one, particularly
regarding security and access privileges. The integrated personnel management system will
be installed in 24 administrations by end-December 2007, including the four current pilot
sites, covering 75 percent of the civil service. Its expansion to include the rest of the civil
service will be completed at end-2008.

46
E. Fuel Pricing Policy
16.
The policy of adjusting retail fuel prices, which began in 2005 as part of Cameroon’s
financial program, will be pursued in 2007. The expected decline in oil prices should reduce
actual budgetary transfers to the SONARA compared to what was appropriated in the 2007
Budget.
17.
The government is committed to adopting a system for full pass-through of fuel
prices. In this regard, in consultation with IMF and World Bank staff, a formula for adjusting
ex-refinery prices (reflecting international prices and allowing an automatic adjustment) and
a simplified price structure (reducing or eliminating the cross subsidies and tax distortions of
the current pricing regime) will be adopted at end-December 2007. To this end, a study will
be conducted by end-September 2007 to assess the possible fiscal implications of this reform.
18.
The government also intends to pursue the implementation of measures to bolster the
financial position of SONARA, as described in paragraph 38 of the Memorandum on
Economic and Financial Policies of October 13, 2005. Following the recommendations of the
audit of SONARA, the government adopted a restructuring plan for the company, and began
its implementation. Since the audit revealed the need to increase production capacities
through investments to improve SONARA’s refining system, the government intends to
conduct a feasibility study that will evaluate the cost of those investments, whether they are
economically viable, and their financing modalities. Specifically, the government is
committed to engage in no further investments unless their economic viability is proven and
their financing falls within the framework of a sustainable fiscal policy.
F. External Debt Management and Trade Liberalization
19.
The government will pursue a prudent debt policy and ensure that its debt is managed
in a sustainable way. With this in view, it will prepare a new comprehensive public debt
management strategy by May 2007. This strategy will be consistent with the medium-term
macroeconomic framework and fiscal objectives. Specifically, it will include the following
items: the contraction of loans on concessional terms, a detailed study of projects requiring
loan financing, periodic preparation of a debt-sustainability analysis (at least once a year) and
before signing any loans amounting to more than 0.5 percent of GDP. As a result of the debt
relief extended to Cameroon by the Paris Club in June 2006, the government also intends to
finalize the signing of bilateral agreements with the various member creditor countries. It will
continue to negotiate in good faith with its private creditors to clear its arrears without
overlooking the principle of comparable treatment.
20.
The government also plans to pursue reforms aimed at strengthening trade
liberalization and boost the volume of foreign trade, particularly with a view to consolidating
subregional integration. To achieve this, it intends to play an active leadership role in the
CAEMC to ensure the proper implementation of common rules by all member states, the

47
removal of barriers to intracommunity trade, and the lowering of the maximum Common
External Tariff (CET) rate. Thus, in March 2007, the government proposed to the other
CAEMC member countries that the maximum CET rate be reduced from 30 percent to
20 percent. The government is also committed to proposing to the member countries no later
than March 2008: (i) an assessment and reduction of the obstacles to the development of
intraregional trade, including the harmonization of the rules of origin with those of the World
Trade Organization; and (ii) a revision of CET exemptions. In addition, the government will
define, in collaboration with other member countries, the concept of free movement, which
would spare economic operators in the CAEMC zone from cascading taxes.
G. Financial Sector
21.
The government has requested that a joint IMF-World Bank mission undertake
a diagnostic assessment of the financial sector. Based on the mission’s recommendations, the
government will draft an action plan for strengthening financial intermediation by endDecember 2007. In the interim, the government is committed at the national level to support
initiatives to facilitate credit access by reducing the constraints related to the business
environment, notably through: (i) a significant improvement in financial reporting; (ii)
simplification of the procedures for calling in collateral; and (iii) the establishment of a
commercial court. At the regional level, the government is committed to supporting the
BEAC in finalizing the establishment of the central credit register (computerization, payment
problems, financial analysis center).
22.
To provide an alternative source of financing, the government is also committed to
developing the securities market (stocks and bonds) by issuing new securities by end-2007
and transferring the secondary market transactions on zero-coupon treasury bonds to the
financial market by end-October 2007. Transactions in government securities will take place
under the supervision of the Financial Markets Commission.
23.
At the regional level, the government plans to support the BEAC in its
implementation of the recommendations made by the regional Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP).
H. Public enterprise reform
24.
The government, in collaboration with the World Bank, will continue implementation
of its public enterprise privatization and restructuring programs. In the case of CAMTEL, the
objective is to complete the selection of a provisional successful bidder by end-June 2007. To
achieve this, the government is preparing financial information for 2006 and incorporating
investors’ suggestions for improving the transaction structure initially proposed. For the
SNEC, the government will do its utmost to ensure that the provisional successful bidder for
the management contract is selected by end-June 2007. As regards air transportation, the
government remains committed to eliminating budgetary subsidies to airline companies,
including CAMAIR, and improving air services. In this regard, it plans to commence

48
implementation of a transparent strategy by end-July 2007 to recruit a private strategic
partner. The government will implement the strategy speedily. In the interim period, the
government is committed to operating within the budgetary envelope for subsidies and
transfers agreed under the PRGF-supported program.
I. Transparency, Good Governance, and the Business Climate
25.
The government is resolute in its decision to enhance good governance and combat
corruption in an effort to improve the business environment and the quality of public
expenditure. In addition to the measures described in the Memorandum on Economic and
Financial Policies of December 6, 2006, the government will publish the administrator’s
reports on its website regularly as part of the implementation of the EITI principles within no
more than a year. The government will prepare a communication strategy aimed at broadly
disseminating the administrator’s report. It will publish by end-July 2007 its comments in
response to the observations recorded on oil revenue for 2001-2004. It will also publish on its
website a summary of the reports of the local committees monitoring the physical and
financial execution of investment projects in the central government budget. Furthermore, the
government will launch the operations of the Commission planned as part of the
implementation of the asset disclosure process for senior government officials by end 2007.
In addition, following a joint OECD-DAC donors and lenders mission in 2006, the joint
CHOC program (Changer d’Habitudes-S’Opposer à la Corruption—Change Habits-Out with
Corruption) of the government and donors was adopted in February 2007. This will be used
as a basis for the government’s preparation of an anti-corruption strategy by endDecember 2007. By March 2008 an action plan will be prepared for an assessment of
corruption among staff at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which will be completed by
end-December 2008. An assessment of corruption in the health sector should also be
available by September 2007. Also, the government will implement by end-December 2007 a
one-stop shop for business creation to reduce the time and costs involved in creating
businesses.
IV. Monitoring Program Implementation
26.
Program monitoring from December 2006 to end-June 2007 will be based on the
performance criteria and quantitative and quarterly structural benchmarks indicated in
Tables 1-4. The government will report the data necessary for program monitoring to the
IMF, in accordance with the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Technical Memorandum of Understanding
on the Definitions of the Performance Criteria and Benchmarks of the PRGFsupported Program for January–December and the Modalities of Their Adjustment
A. Introduction
1. This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Cameroonian authorities and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the performance criteria
and benchmarks of the program and the contingency mechanisms related thereto. It also
specifies the program’s exchange rates and the data to be reported to the IMF by the
authorities.
B. Definitions
Government
2.

Government is defined as central government unless otherwise noted.

External debt
3. External debt shall have the meaning set out in point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements (IMF Executive
Board Decision No. 12274–00/85, dated August 24, 2000). External debt is defined on the
basis of residency.
Accumulation of external payments arrears
4. External payments arrears are considered to be the external nonreschedulable arrears of
the government, including public enterprises whose debt is guaranteed by the government.
External nonreschedulable arrears includes the servicing of debt which is due and not paid to
all multilateral creditors and to bilateral official and commercial creditors with whom a debt
rescheduling or restructuring agreement has been concluded. The nonpayment of debt service
to bilateral official and commercial creditors with whom a rescheduling or restructuring
agreement has not yet been signed is not considered to be an arrear for the purposes of the
program, provided that Cameroon is engaged in best efforts to negotiate a rescheduling or
restructuring agreement with bilateral official and commercial creditors.
Concessionality of external debt
5. Medium- and long-term debt is considered to be debt with an initial maturity of one year
or more. Debt with a maturity of one year or more is considered to be concessional if it
includes a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more, calculated on the basis of the
commercial interest reference rate (CIRR) published by the OECD and following the
methodology set out in the IMF staff paper entitled “Limits on External Debt or Borrowing

56
in Fund Arrangement – Proposed Change in Implementation of the Revised Guidelines”
(www.imf.org), approved by the IMF Executive Board on April 15, 1996. Thus, for debt
maturing in 15 years or more, the OECD 10-year CIRR is used as the discount rate to assess
concessionality. The following margins are added to the two CIRRs for the various
repayment periods: 1 percent between 15 and 19 years; 1.15 percent between 20 and 29
years; and 1.25 percent when the repayment period is spread over 30 years or more. Debt
rescheduling and restructuring as well as the use of IMF resources are not part of the
performance criterion on the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional debt.
Debt relief
6. For the purpose of the program, the only form of debt relief that will be subject to the
contingency mechanism described below is the debt relief that leads to an effective reduction
in programmed debt service. This includes, in particular, any relief in the form of
rescheduling, forgiveness, restructuring, or a grant under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), and
bilateral initiatives (e.g., C2D). Programmed debt relief on debt that has been in drawn-out
rescheduling/restructuring negotiations with non-Paris Club creditors, including commercial
creditors is excluded from the contingency mechanism as it does not lead to an effective
reduction in programmed debt service.
Domestic debt
Structured debt
7. Structured debt is defined as debt that has been subject to a formal agreement
(convention) or securitization (titrisation). For the purposes of the PRGF program, structured
debt is limited to the stock of structured debt at end-December 2004 that was included in the
audit completed in October 2005 and that is specified in the multiyear settlement plan for
public domestic debt as recorded by the National Amortization Fund. The stock of this debt
(excluding BEAC’s advances) at end-December 2004 amounted to CFAF 956 billion.
Nonstructured debt
8. Nonstructured debt is defined as debt not subject to a formal agreement (convention) or
securitization (titrisation). For the purposes of the PRGF program, nonstructured debt is
limited to the stock of nonstructured debt at end-December 2004 that was included in the
audit completed in October 2005 and that is specified in the multiyear settlement plan for
public domestic debt as recorded by the National Amortization Fund. The stock of this debt
at end-December 2004 amounted to CFAF 496 billion.

57
Domestic debt repayments
9. For assessing the observance of the quantitative performance criteria on the reduction of
domestic debt, only those repayments of domestic debt are counted that are made to repay the
structured and nonstructured domestic debt defined above. These repayments are recorded
“below the line” in the Fund’s “Central Government Operations” table. In the case of
structured debt, they are (i) the payments on account of the securitized debt to the BEAC and
commercial banks, which are entered in the line “Domestic financing, net – Banking System
- Banking system excl. HIPC and C2D”; and (ii) other repayments of principal, which are
recorded in the line “Domestic financing, net – Amortization”. In the case of nonstructured
debt, they are the repayments of principal, which are recorded in the line “Net change in
arrears – Domestic”.
Government financial operations table (TOFE)
10. The Treasury balance (balance des comptes du Trésor) shows government revenue and
expenditure posted in Class 6 accounts (current expenditure), Class 7 accounts (current
revenue), and Class 2 accounts (investment operations). Debt-related operations are recorded
in Class 1 accounts (debt operations) and partly in Class 5 (financial operations).The
financial operations data must be consistent with the data in the Treasury account at the
BEAC. Data on provisional revenue and expenditure operations and deposits of the
correspondents of the Treasury are recorded in Class 4 accounts of the government’s chart of
accounts (plan comptable). Government operations that are not carried out through the
Treasury need to be added to the data on operations that are carried out through the Treasury.
Revenue and expenditure operations are recorded on a cash basis.
Nonoil revenue
11. Nonoil revenue comprises all government (tax and nontax) revenue, excluding revenue
from oil companies (i.e. companies engaged in crude oil extraction in Cameroon) and oil
royalties (redevance pétrolière). VAT is recorded net of VAT refunds. The pipeline fee paid
by the Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (CTOCO) is recorded as part of nontax
revenue.
Privatization proceeds
12. For the purposes of the program, privatization proceeds will be understood to mean all
funds received by the government from the sale or concessioning of the operation of a public
company or organization or publicly owned facility to one or more private company(ies)
(including companies that are fully controlled by foreign government(s), private
organization(s), or individual(s)). Privatization proceeds also include all funds received from
the sale of shares owned by the government in private companies or public enterprises. All
privatization proceeds should be recorded on a gross basis; if any costs are incurred in
connection with the sale or concessioning, these must be recorded separately as expenditure.

58
Goods and services
13. All budgetary expenditures on account of the purchase of goods and services are
recorded in the accounts 4000060, 4000090, 4011, 4010060, 48131, 4810 and 40001205 of
the Treasury balance account and shown accordingly in the TABORD. HIPC and C2D
spending is excluded.
Nonoil primary budget balance
14. The nonoil primary budget balance (on a cash basis) is calculated as government nonoil
revenue, excluding external grants, less all expenditure other than interest payments, foreignfinanced investment expenditure, HIPC-financed expenditure, C2D-financed expenditure,
and restructuring expenditure.
Net claims of the banking sector on the central government
15. Net claims on the government by the banking system comprise the stock of all
outstanding claims on the government by the banking system (loans, advances, and any other
government debt instruments, such as long-term government securities), less all deposits held
by the Treasury with the banking system, excluding the HIPC account, the C2D account, and
the two accounts held by the CAA in a commercial bank to pay the government’s domestic
and external debt obligations.
Payments to utility companies
16. The floor relating to “payment to utility companies” will be considered observed if
payments to the utility companies (water, electricity, fixed-line telephones, railway and
refinery companies) are made in quarterly amounts, as indicated in Table 3 of the MEFP.
These payments are to exclude fiscal compensation, and they are assessed on the basis of
cash disbursements. They are to be registered as current expenditures in the TOFE.
Restructuring expenditure
17. Restructuring expenditures are defined as those expenditures that are made in the
context of implementing a privatization strategy (CAMAIR, CAMTEL, CDC), a publicprivate partnership (SNEC) or a restructuring plan (CAMPOST, SONARA). The
classification of an expenditure as “restructuring expenditure” should be made after
consultation with the IMF.
Spending advances by SNH (interventions directes)
18. Spending advances (interventions directes) by SNH (Société Nationale des
Hydrocarbures) are defined as advance payments by SNH on behalf of the government. They
are deducted from the monthly cash revenue transferred by the SNH to the government.
There will be no interventions directes in 2006 or later.

59
Quasi-fiscal spending by SNH (autres charges)
19. SNH spending to cover costs that are not shared with the other oil companies as part of
the production-sharing agreements are called autres charges (other costs). Some of this is
related to the SNH mission (e.g. decommissioning costs). Other elements of this spending are
not related to SNH oil sector activities and are quasi-fiscal in nature (e.g. the cost of
operating the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline).
Subsidy to fuel consumers
20. The budgetary transfer to SONARA to cover the fuel subsidy to consumers will amount
to the difference between the retail price applied and the price that would be needed to keep
SONARA’s net result on domestic operations at zero for the previous month, times the
volumes sold by SONARA in the domestic market. It will be calculated jointly by SONARA
and CSPH and will be paid during the month (t+1) subsequent to the reference month (t) for
which it has been calculated. It will not exceed CFAF 7.0 billion in the first quarter of 2007,
CFAF 7.0 billion in the second quarter of 2007, CFAF 7.0 billion in the third quarter of 2007,
and CFAF 7.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. If, based on this mechanism, the quarterly
budget transfer does not suffice to cover in full the fuel price subsidy/SONARA’s shortfall,
the government will revise retail prices upward, on a monthly basis, so as to prevent losses
on domestic operations at SONARA. If oil prices weaken on international markets, the
government will first reduce transfers to SONARA and then eliminate them completely,
before lowering the retail price.
C. Modalities of the Contingency Mechanism for the Adjustment of Targets
21. The floor on the nonoil primary balance will be adjusted:
•

upward by the amount of lower-than-programmed receipt of budget support grants;

•

upward by the amount of lower-than-programmed transfers made to SONARA.

22. The ceiling on net claims of the banking sector on the government will be adjusted:
•

downward up to the amount of higher-than-programmed oil revenue and privatization
proceeds that are not used to reduce domestic debt, buy back external debt owed to
commercial lenders, or finance one-off investment projects (Country Report
No 07/129, ¶15 of the MEFP);

•

upward/downward by the amount of lower/higher-than-programmed external budget
support (grants and loans) and by half of the amount of lower/higher than
programmed debt relief (defined in paragraph 6 above); the revision upward will be
capped to a cumulative amount of CFAF 15 billion; for the purposes of the adjustor,

60
budget support is defined as all nontargeted grants and loans, excluding C2D, HIPC
Initiative, and MDRI grants;
•

downward by the amount of lower-than-programmed restructuring expenditure;

•

downward by the amount of lower-than-programmed payments of domestic debt (as
defined above).

23. Higher-than-programmed oil revenue and all privatization proceeds will be allocated to
repayments of domestic debt (as defined above), buyback of external debt owed to
commercial creditors, or the financing of one-off investment projects (Country Report
No. 07/129, ¶15 of the MEFP). The domestic debt repayments will be made within one
month following the end of the quarter in which the surplus occurred.
24. In case the shortfall/excess in oil revenue, external budget support (including debt
relief), privatization revenue, and/or adjustments in the ceiling on net bank credit to the
government exceed a cumulative 0.2 percent of 2007 GDP, the government will consult with
the staff of the IMF to formulate corrective policies.
D. Program Exchange Rates
25. Exchange rates to be applied for the conversion of amounts in SDR or U.S. dollars are
US$1.5059 per SDR and CFAF 497.56 per U.S. dollar for the first quarter of 2007,
US$1.5037 per SDR and CFAF 498.89 per U.S. dollar for the second quarter of 2007,
US$1.5035 per SDR and CFAF 499.08 per U.S. dollar for the third quarter of 2007, and
US$1.5054 per SDR and CFAF 498.14 per U.S. dollar for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Liabilities to the IMF, which are included in the definition of net bank credit to the
government, will be valued at the same exchange rates. Any deviation from the exchange rate
will lead to a full upward or downward adjustment, as appropriate, of the value of the stock
of IMF liabilities to the BEAC, and to a similar adjustment of the ceiling on net bank credit
to the government.
E. Structural Performance Criteria
26. The performance criterion pertaining to the consolidation of the online connection
between the IT systems of the General Directorates of Budget and the Treasury will be
considered observed if, by June 30, 2007, monthly summary reports on budget execution—
from commitment through to payment—are produced on a functional basis for the JanuaryApril 2007 period.
27. The performance criterion on completion of the preparatory work for the establishment
of a financial subsidiary for CAMPOST will be considered observed if, by June 30, 2007, the
decree establishing the subsidiary is published and the following tasks are accomplished and
the results are adopted by the government: bye-laws of the subsidiary, list of shareholders

61
and managers, business plan including projected activities, network and structure of post
offices and postal agencies, financial statements and accounts certified by the statutory
auditors and validated by the competent entities, payment of capital or minimum available
budgetary transfers.
F. Structural Benchmarks
28. The benchmark related to the establishment of harmonized civil service personnel

Administration and Decentralization, and (14) the Ministry of Water and Energy.
29. The benchmark concerning the diagnostic study on the budget and treasury
nomenclature to assess its consistency with GFS standards and the preparation of an
analytical report will be considered met if the government submits to the IMF, by end-March
2007, an analytical report containing the following: (i) a description of the deficiencies of the
current budget classification, particularly with regard to simplicity, interpretation, and
consistency with international standards, and (ii) an action plan to improve the budget
classification in the 2007-2009 period.
30. The benchmark regarding the preparation of actions to be taken during the transitional
period of the new organic law on government finance and the timetable for their
implementation will be considered met if, by end-April 2007: (i) a new draft law establishing
the government financial system is prepared with the assistance of IMF staff and is presented
to Parliament, along with the key objectives for the transitional period, and (ii) the

ministries and government entities, and holds a seminar for those ministries to present the
plan and explain its implications.

62
31. The benchmark pertaining to the preparation of consistent monthly budget execution
tables on a cash and a commitment basis and a monthly expenditure table broken down by
economic function to track spending on priority sectors will be considered met if, by the 25th
of the month following the reporting month, the following are sent to the IMF: (i) the
TABORD, the treasury balances, expenditure tracking tables with a breakdown by chapter
and account and a functional breakdown (up to payment authorization and for the central
offices only), (ii) the TABORD contains an annex showing payment authorizations and

32. The benchmark on adjustment of the retail prices of petroleum products and payment of
budgetary transfers to SONARA as agreed with Fund staff will be considered met if the
authorities raise the prices of the three main fuel products, i.e., premium gasoline, oil, and
diesel fuel, and make transfer payments as indicated in paragraph 26 of the MEFP and
paragraph 20 above. Fuel prices are to be raised on the first business day of the month.
33. The benchmark on the preparation of a diagnostic study of the civil service
remuneration system (salaries and benefits) will be considered met if, by end-March 2007,
the final report on the study, conducted in accordance with the terms of reference approved
by the authorities and the IMF, has been submitted to the minister responsible for finance.
34. The benchmark concerning publication of the quarterly report on execution of the
central government budget will be considered met if, two months after the end of the quarter,
a report detailing and commenting on execution of the budget in terms of revenue,
expenditure, and financing (based on a model similar to the TOFE) is available on the
website www.spm.gov.cm.
35. The benchmark related to publication on the website www.spm.gov.cm of judicial
decisions and administrative sanctions against civil servants will be deemed met if the
government creates on its website a section devoted to the fight against corruption, where the
following information is published on a continual basis: (i) all judicial decisions, including
appealed decisions, with the necessary reservations; (ii) all administrative sanctions against
civil servants. As understood in this Memorandum, administrative sanctions are punitive
measures taken by the authorities against civil servants for failing to act with integrity and
observe professional ethics. The sanctioned behaviors may involve indirect actions
detrimental to sound financial management and good governance, such as misappropriation,
corruption, favoritism, or influence-peddling. Without prejudice to criminal prosecution,
persons guilty of such behaviors are, in particular, subject to being relieved of their
responsibilities (if any) and liable for disciplinary sanctions ranging from a written warning
to the revocation, suspension, or forfeiture of pension rights.

63
36. The benchmark related to completion of the work to connect the General Directorate of
Taxes (MESURE) to the General Directorate of Customs (SYDONIA) will be considered
met if before end-November 2007 one or more modules of the automated management
system of the General Directorate of Customs is connected to one or more modules of the

drafted and approved at a plenary session of the commission by December 31, 2007.
38. The benchmark related to the reduction in the number of tax centers for small taxpayers
with the establishment of initial experimental pilot sites in Yaoundé and Douala will be
considered met if by end-December 2007 the following actions have been implemented: (1)
each pilot center incorporates at least three tax centers based on the current model; and (2)
the pilot tax centers will be modeled on the tax centers for medium-sized enterprises
(customer management).
39. The benchmark related to completion of the work to streamline taxpayer identification,
overhaul the taxpayer identification software, and make the single taxpayer database secure
will be considered met if the following actions have been carried out by end-October 2007:
(1) the taxpayer registration software is operational; (2) this software is the sole IT
application for registering taxpayers (no other application may register or change taxpayer
information, centrally or in the provinces); and (3) a direct connection is established between
this software and the software for the management of taxes and fees at the General
Directorate of Taxes (MESURE).
40. The benchmark related to adoption of a formula for revising the SONARA exit prices
and a simplified price structure for petroleum products allowing automatic adjustment will be
considered met if by December 2007 the new formula for petroleum prices after they exit
SONARA reflects international prices, precludes the economic adjustment in favor of
SONARA, and allows an automatic adjustment of prices. The simplified price structure
should reduce or eliminate cross-subsidies between petroleum products (including liquefied
gas) and the tax distortions of the current price system.
41. The benchmark related to installation of the automated system of integrated civil service
personnel and payroll management (SIGIPES) in 24 ministries will be considered met if at endDecember 2007: (i) the equipment, the protocol on communications among the various

64
SIGIPES sites, and the SIGIPES application are in place at each of the ministries; (ii) staff
have been trained in their use; (iii) the SIGIPES has been actually brought into operation in
the ministries; and (iv) the data on the staff of these ministries in the SIGIPES are consistent
with the data contained in the payroll management system. The 24 ministries in which the
SIGIPES will be installed include the 14 already identified above (see paragraph 28) and the
following 10 ministries: (1) Civil Service, (2) Basic Education, (3) Health, (4) Finance and
Economy, (5) Secondary Education (6) Foreign Affairs, (7) State Audit Office, (8) Urban
Development and Housing, (9) Social Affairs, and (10) General Delegation for National
Security.
42. The benchmark related to publication on the www.spm.gov.cm website of a summary of
the reports of the local committees monitoring the physical and financial implementation of
the investment projects in the central government budget will be considered met if three
months after the end of a quarter that summary includes: (i) observations on the causes of
delays in investment projects, (ii) statistics on the use of investment-related funds and the
rate of progress of the individual projects, and (iii) recommendations to improve the physical
and financial implementation of investment projects.
43. The benchmark related to finalization of the draft law on bank electronic
communications and electronic payments will be considered met if by end-November 2007
the government presents to Parliament a law defining the regulatory framework for electronic
communications and payments, in consultation with World Bank staff, including transactions
between individuals and legal entities on the one hand and banks on the other.
44. The benchmark related to the transfer of secondary market transactions in zero-coupon
treasury bonds to the financial market will be considered met if by end-October 2007 all
transactions (purchases, sales, repurchases) involving such bonds between individuals and
legal entities, or between the government and other entities (including public enterprises),
take place in the financial market. By end-October 2007, the CAA will be capable of
publishing each day the volume and prices of all transactions on the website: caa.gov.cm.
45. The benchmark related to completion and implementation of the electronic one-stopshop to facilitate foreign trade will be considered met if from end-September 2007 all foreign
trade transactions are being conducted through the electronic one-stop-shop. The government
will send a letter to Fund staff confirming that the electronic one-stop-shop has began its
operations. .
G. Reporting Requirements
46. The Cameroonian authorities will send data, as in the attached Tables 1 and 2, to the
IMF within the established time limits. The authorities will supply the IMF, on a timely
basis, with any additional information that the IMF may request for the purpose of

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for
the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief
to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the
time the member qualifies for such debt relief.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of Central
African States, of which Cameroon is a member. A safeguard assessment of the BEAC
completed on August 30, 2004 found that BEAC has implemented a number of measures to
strengthen its safeguards framework since the 2001 safeguards assessment, but further
progress needs to be made in key areas. A summary of the recommendations of the
safeguards assesssment was reported in Country Report No. 06/231.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has
no separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the
fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 735.24 = SDR 1, as
of May 3, 2007. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was
based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change
in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.
Cameroon maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security
reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board decision 144152/51.

findings of the joint IMF-World Bank mission that visited Cameroon during February 29–
March 14, 2000. The findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission
were presented to the authorities on March 13-14, 2000 in the context of the 2000 Article IV
consultation.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency and
transparency of monetary and financial policies was issued on June 16, 2000.

Cameroon: Relations with the World Bank
(As of January 8, 2007)
Government’s Strategy Supported by the World Bank
27.
The government’s strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction, as described
in the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) communicated to the World Bank and the
IMF in April 2003, is articulated along seven pillars, as detailed in IDA/SecM2003–0434.
The Government has begun revising the PRSP, with an expected completion date of early
2008.
World Bank Lending and Strategy
28.
A joint IDA-IFC Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was presented to the Board on
December 7, 2006. The strategy, which covers fiscal year (FY) 07–08, maintains the broad
objectives of the previous Country Assistance Strategy but with enhanced emphasis on
governance including combating corruption, managing for results, and strengthening
partnerships, and alignment and harmonization of external assistance in line with the Paris
Declaration for aid effectiveness. World Bank’s support to the Government’s strategy is
integrated around six proposed outcomes:
29.
Strengthening PRSP implementation: Planned activities include policy dialogue and
technical assistance to support revision of the PRSP, with a focus on sharpened priorities and
an explicit results framework, including monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, as well as
Economic and Sector Work (ESW) to sharpen the PRSP gender focus.
30.
Strengthening governance, including anticorruption and public finance management:
Activities include planned financing of an operation to increase transparency and
accountability as well as planned programmatic support to strengthen public financial
management as part of a multi-donor platform; ongoing policy dialogue and technical
assistance to support implementation of the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI); and support to anticorruption efforts. Corruption assessments will be conducted in
key sectors as part of a coordinated support effort by international partners initiated by the
Bank and linked to OECD-DAC efforts to develop a common anticorruption policy.
31.
Fostering private sector development: Activities include enhanced IFC support to
small enterprises; stepped-up IFC/Bank policy dialogue and technical assistance to
strengthen Cameroon’s weak business climate, including through a jointly appointed senior
IFC/Bank staff based in Cameroon; and support to tighter regional integration, through
ongoing and planned financing of a regional payment systems operation and an operation to
strengthen regional financial institutions.

9
32.
Supporting infrastructure and urban development: Activities include ongoing
financing of the Douala infrastructure, the railway concession, and the regional air transport
safety and security operations; planned financing of an urban and water, an energy sector,
and a regional transport and trade facilitation operation; as well as ongoing policy dialogue
on energy and a planned multi-partner transport sector ESW.
33.
Supporting the forestry and environment sectors and strengthening rural and
agricultural development: Activities include ongoing financing of the multi-partnersupported forestry and environment program, the community development program, and an
operation to strengthen petroleum environment management capacity; an ongoing ESW on
forestry reform; and a planned rural investment climate assessment with a gender focus as
key input to the preparation of a Sector-wide approach (SWAp) in the agriculture sector.
34.
Promoting human development: Activities include financing of an ongoing operation
to increase capacity in the education sector, an ongoing and a planned follow-up multisectoral HIV/AIDS operation, and planned support of a SWAp in the health sector (FY08).
Within the health SWAp, the Bank expects to provide financial support for capacity building,
systems development, and delivery of basic health services: (i) strengthen the normative
functions of the Ministry of Health; (ii) reinforce the capacity of provinces to manage,
allocate, and plan resources, and to supervise, and monitor districts; and (iii) fund a basic
package of services included in a consolidated health district plan which reflects sector
priorities based on the updated Health Sector Strategy. The Bank is also undertaking a series
of analytical work on the issues of governance, fiscal space and uses of debt relief in the
health sector
35.
As of January 8, 2007, the IDA portfolio (including GEF co-financing) comprises
nine active projects with a total commitment of US$216.1 million, of which US$131.5
million are not disbursed yet. These projects cover a broad range of sectors, including
infrastructure, education, transport, environment, forestry, HIV/AIDS, local development,
and public-private partnerships.

In addition to its lending activities, the World Bank has been supporting the
government with analysis and a policy dialogue in such areas as :
•

Monitoring and assisting on the PRSP implementation (i) by providing assistance and
formulating sector strategies, sector and global medium-term expenditure frameworks
to align the national budget to the PRSP development objectives; (ii) carrying out an
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in FY06 to sharpen PRSP policies for
economic growth and diversification, and poverty reduction.

•

Strengthening the dialogue and action on the governance agenda with an active role
in (i) the Multidonor Platform on Public Finance that is working with the Government
on improving public financial management, and (ii) working closely with other
partners to support the government’s efforts to combat corruption. To support these
activities a Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) and a Country Procurement Assessment Review have been undertaken.

IMF–World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
37.
The IMF and World Bank staffs collaborate on (i) the HIPC Initiative and the PRSP
process and specifically worked jointly on the documents for the HIPC completion point and
the JSAN of the PRSP progress report, which were presented to the Boards in April 2006;
(ii) analyses and reforms in public financial management; and (iii) other governance reforms,
including the customs systems. Table 2 briefly describes each area and the specific policy
advice support provided by the two institutions.

13
Cameroon: Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund remains adequate for surveillance purposes, but there is scope for
improvement in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic datasets. In recent
years, the authorities have taken the initiative to improve the macroeconomic database,
particularly the national accounts and balance of payments statistics
Cameroon has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
December 2000. Metadata and descriptions of current statistical practices and plans for
improvement are available on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
GDDS participants are encouraged to review and certify the accuracy of their metadata at
least once a year; Cameroon’s metadata were last updated and certified in November 2001.
The National Institute of Statistics (INS), an autonomous institution under the aegis of the
Ministry of Planning, Programming, and Regional Development, is the most important
macroeconomic data production agency. Unfortunately, lack of clarity concerning the role
and coordinating function of the INS has hampered the implementation of statistical
standards and classifications across government departments and agencies. In this regard, it is
encouraging that under the leadership of the Minister of Economy and Finance, the
authorities have formed a coordinating committee to take up publication of the tables of the
Statistical Appendix (accompanying the Article IV staff report) in the future.
National accounts statistics
In recent years, the INS has compiled a revised and updated set of national accounts
estimates based on the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA).
STA missions visited Cameroon in October 2003 and December 2004 to assist the authorities
with work on the national accounts. Both missions found the general methodology, analytical
tools, and adjustments to be generally appropriate and in accordance with the 1993 SNA
methodology. However, the STA expert and the recent article IV mission have identified
certain weaknesses in the national accounting for oil GDP.
STA review of source data resulted in recommendations in the areas of coverage and
timeliness. In particular, the framework for the collection and production of business
enterprise statistics was found to be weak, creating difficulties for gauging the structure of
the economy and current industrial activity. Particularly serious difficulties affect data on the
following key sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, local
government, and services. Stemming from the above-mentioned difficulties, the production
index should be overhauled and integrated with the corresponding components of the annual
national accounts. Other areas for concern include a limited selection of price indices for
deflation of national accounts concepts and the lack of information on employment. In light
of these shortcomings, technical assistance will remain essential in the coming years.

14
Consumer prices
The authorities intend to revise the monthly consumer price index (CPI) by extending the
underlying survey to rural areas. Currently, the CPI is compiled on the basis of surveys
carried out in the five principal cities: Yaoundé, Douala, Bafoussam, Bamenda and Garoua.
In addition, the authorities intend to contribute to the production of a regional CPI in the
CEMAC area. The consumption basket for the regional index will be larger than that of the
national CPI with coverage for the two largest cities: Yaoundé and Douala.
Socio-demographic indicators
Recently, progress has been made in the production of socio-demographic statistics. The
most recent household survey (ECAM II) carried out in 2001 provided comprehensive data
used to update Cameroon’s poverty profile. Work is ongoing with World Bank assistance to
update the household survey. The authorities have begun an update of two main social
indicators, the education map (carte scolaire) and the healthcare map (carte sanitaire),
previously prepared in 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Public finance statistics
Considerable progress has been made in the transparency and reporting of public finance
statistics of the central government, including the preparation of consistent monthly budget
execution tables on a payment order and cash basis and a table of expenditure by economic
function to track spending for priority sectors. Quarterly reports on the overall budget
execution, and the investment budget execution have been produced on a continuous basis.
Despite this progress, data on the public finances are still in need of improvements in quality,
coverage, and timeliness. Weaknesses in the fiscal data include: (i) incomplete compilation
of budget implementation data on a commitment and, to some extent, on a cash basis; (ii) a
lack of information on the financial information of local governments; (iii) poor monitoring
of cross-liabilities in the public sector and of public enterprise debt; and (iv) lack of
information on the financial information of public enterprises more generally.
Key reforms have been introduced in 2003-04 to address some of these shortcomings, but
have not yet been drawn upon fully. The introduction of a new accounting system should
permit the identification of expenditures by function (i.e., not only by spending ministries),
and to evaluate the “float” (i.e., spending committed but not yet paid). The integrated
financial management system (SIGEFI) should substantially improve the accuracy and
timeliness of fiscal data both on a commitment and on a cash basis.
In January 2005, the authorities began to prepare, based on the SIGEFI, preliminary fiscal
accounts 3 weeks after the end of the reported month (for 2004 final data were prepared with
a 2 month delay). They plan to elaborate comprehensive fiscal accounts on a commitment
basis and will strive to monitor the float. Moreover, the ongoing audit of government
domestic debt, which will cover cross-liabilities in the public sector and public enterprise
external debt, is expected to strengthen debt data. Efforts to enhance transparency of

15
financial operations in the oil sector should also improve overall fiscal reporting. Also,
efforts are underway to collect data on the operations of the largest 20 public enterprises.
Cameroon does not report data for publication in the IMF Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook or the government finance statistics section in International Financial Statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des États de l’Afrique Centrale
(BEAC) on a monthly basis, with delays of up to two months. Although the institutional
coverage is comprehensive, the quality of the data may be affected by large cross-border
movements of currency among member countries in the CEMAC. About 72 percent of the
currency circulating in Cameroon is issued nationally, with the rest originating for the most
part from Chad (12 percent) and Gabon (6 percent). About 93 percent of the currency issued
in Cameroon remains within the national territory, while most of the remaining currency
issued circulate in Chad (4 percent).
The mission that visited BEAC headquarters in May 2001 provided technical assistance for
addressing the main shortcomings pertaining to coverage, methodology, compilation
procedures, and timeliness of monetary statistics. The mission discussed an action plan for
the implementation of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for the
introduction of an area-wide page in IFS for CEMAC, publication of which started with the
January 2003 issue of IFS.
A regional workshop on monetary and financial statistics was organized by the BEAC in
Libreville (Gabon) in May 2002 to support the implementation of the MFSM in CEMAC
countries. Priorities for Cameroon include the need to adapt the bridge table linking bank
data with the monetary statistics to the new format for monthly reporting by the banks. Other
outstanding issues concern the accrual recording of interest, the treatment of nonperforming
loans, and proper sectorization of public entities. Also, a comprehensive financial survey is
still to be compiled. Actions remain to be taken by the BEAC to implement the MFSM
methodology in producing its member countries’ monetary statistics.
Balance of payments statistics
Data reporting for publication in the Fund’s Balance of Payments Statistic publications has
encountered delays. On the basis of STA technical assistance in March 2006, annual balance
of payments statistics for 1995-2003 were reported to STA in late 2006 and the authorities
are now expected to begin producing higher quality data within a reasonable time period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
CAMEROON
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis12
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
May 30, 2007
Introduction
1.
This report updates the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for low-income
countries (LIC)13 prepared in April 2006 (Country Report No. 06/190, Appendix I).
Three key differences underpin the results of this update relative to the previous DSA: (i)
This DSA uses an updated debt database on the existing debt, assuming the full delivery of
HIPC and MDRI debt relief; (ii) it includes debt service to France under the C2D initiative in
the debt service payments on a net basis; and (iii) the 2007 projections of GDP and exports
have been revised based on new information.
2.
The debt stock at end-2006 has been revised downward. Compared with the
estimates in Country Report No. 06/190, the end-2006 stock of external debt was smaller
reflecting front-loaded relief and additional bilateral cancellations. Repayments of domestic
debt in 2006 were also higher than envisaged in the 2006 arrears repayment plan.

Debt indicators post-HIPC and MDRI debt relief
3.
In staff's view, Cameroon faces a low risk of debt distress. Cameroon's external debt
levels are expected to remain well below their indicative thresholds for debt distress both under
the baseline scenario and under various stress tests throughout the projection period. Following
debt relief under HIPC and MDRI on external debt, Cameroon’s debt-related indicators at end2006 fell substantially below its policy-dependent thresholds. Nominal external debt declined
from US$ 6.5 billion in 2005 to US$2.1 billion in 2006, or from 39 to 11 percent of GDP.
Following substantial repayments, Cameroon’s domestic debt declined from US$ 2.3 billion in
2005 to US$ 1.7 billion by end-2006, or from 14 to 9 percent of GDP. As a result, public debt—
external and domestic— declined from US$ 8.9 billion to US$ 3.8 billion, or from 53 to
21 percent of GDP in the past two years.
4.
The NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio at end 2006 has changed insignificantly
relative to the Completion Point document. Compared with the projections prepared for the
HIPC Completion Point in April 2006, the estimate of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio for end
2006 increased by 0.7 percentage points owing mainly to the changes in the exchange rates,
higher than anticipated disbursements, and the use of annual exports instead of a three-year
backward looking moving average.

5.
The authorities are in the process of finalizing bilateral agreements on debt
cancellation with Paris Club creditors. As of March 1, 2007, eight such agreements had
already been signed. Agreements with France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland were pending at
that point but were expected to be signed in the near future. The authorities are still, expecting
the official proposal from the United Kingdom. Because of the delays in finalizing the bilateral
agreements, the Paris Club creditors agreed to postpone the deadline for signing of such
agreements from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2007.

The C2D debt relief is disbursed in semiannual installments; debt service on this debt category is
paid by Cameroon as scheduled and is offset by an equivalent grant from the creditor.

6.
The DSA is based on data provided by Cameroon’s main multilateral creditors and
by the authorities on the remaining creditors. The quality of data on Cameroon’s public debt
has improved but remains uneven, in particular on private sector and public enterprise debt, and
the structure of debt is complex (Figure 1).
Macroeconomic assumptions
7.
Key macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA are broadly the same as in
Country Report No. 06/190. Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 6 percent in 2011
reflecting economic stimulus from increased capital spending, the implementation of structural
reforms under the PRGF-supported program, and investment in infrastructure and energy with
support of the World Bank. Over the long-term, growth in the non-oil economy is expected to
stabilize at about 5.5 percent, while oil GDP will gradually decline. On average, the projected
growth rate is about 1 percentage point higher than the historical average on the account of
higher investment financed by debt relief. Oil production is assumed to increase slightly in 2007,
and then decline by 5 percent in 2008, 2-3 percent thereafter. Inflation is assumed to hold steady
at 2 percent over the long-term, in line with recent historical experience. Fiscal policy would be
supportive of economic growth and poverty reduction. Nonoil revenues are expected to rise from
12 percent of GDP in 2006 to 15 percent at the end of the projection period, reflecting tax and
customs administration measures. Government expenditure is expected to rise steadily before
declining to the more sustainable level of 17 percent of GDP in the outer years. Exports of goods
and services are projected to gradually decline over time reflecting the decline in petroleum

4
exports. As a result, the current account deficit, including grants, is expected to increase to about
7 percent of GDP over the medium-term, and gradually improve thereafter. The deterioration in
the current account is larger than was earlier envisaged reflecting lower oil prices. The deficit is
expected to be financed through foreign direct investment, private capital flows, and loans, a
mixture of which will be from IDA and the rest from other creditors on less concessional terms.
8.
Assumptions related to new borrowing and debt relief have been updated. New
public borrowing is assumed to increase gradually over the medium term to help finance new
investment. External borrowing is expected to rise gradually to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015 and
then to gradually decline to about 1 percent by 2027. IDA borrowing is assumed to constitute 47
percent of new borrowing, with the remainder loans originating from other multilateral and
bilateral creditors on less concessional terms. Cameroon is projected to graduate from IDA in
2010. Starting from that year, new lending on concessional IDA terms will be gradually phased
out. Other providers of concessional assistance are assumed to take similar action. Debt relief
under the Debt Settlement and Development Contract (C2D), a bilateral debt relief initiative by
France, will be provided in 2007-2011 under the terms and conditions of the Convention signed
between France and Cameroon in April 2006, and thereafter on comparable terms and
conditions. Under the Convention, Cameroon has to repay the amounts falling due, which are
then reimbursed by France within the same quarter. The DSA assumes full delivery of assistance
under the CD2 and additional bilateral debt relief provided by end-2006.
External debt sustainability
9.
External debt is sustainable over the long run. Cameroon ranks as a "medium
performer" in terms of the quality of its policies and institutions as measured by the three-year
backward looking average World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
index. 14 As is common for all DSA, for the post-completion point period, the relevant
sustainability thresholds15 have been used only as guideposts for informing debt sustainability
assessment and not as ceilings. Although debt indicators increase over the longer term, reflecting
additional borrowing to meet the country’s development needs and reduced concessionality from
2010 onwards, the sustainability thresholds on external debt are not breached under the baseline
nor under any of the alternative scenarios throughout the projection period. . Therefore, the risk
of debt distress will remain low assuming that GDP and export growth in the nonoil sector
remain robust in the long run, and the authorities maintain a prudent fiscal and borrowing
policies. The residual captures mainly private capital flows .
14

Preliminary findings of the 2006 CPIA round suggest that its CPIA could decline from 3.3 to 3.2, thus bringing
Cameroon in the group of the weak performer. Nevertheless, Cameroon would still remain in a low risk of debt
distress in the baseline scenario and at least until 2017 for most indicators in stress tests.
15

The following indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability applied to external debt burden indicators for
countries that are medium performers in terms of quality of policies and institutions: the NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio of 150 percent, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ration of 250 percent,
he debt service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent, and the debt service-to- revenue ratio of 30 percent.

5
10. Debt sustainability could worsen as a result of adverse exogenous shocks and
unfavorable policy scenarios. The scenario of lower GDP growth assumes that real growth in
2007-08 is one standard deviation below its historical average. As lower growth has a negative
net effect on public finances, the government closes the ensuing financing need through
borrowing. Hence, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio rises steadily over time and eventually levels
off. The scenario of lower export growth assumes that export growth in 2007-08 is one standard
deviation below its historical average. As a result, the NPV of debt-to-exports and the debt
service-to-exports ratios rise above the baseline leveling off towards the end of the projection
period. This scenario of new borrowing on less concessional terms assumes that the interest rate
on new borrowing in 2007-2027 is two percentage points higher than in the baseline. As a result,
all debt ratios will start deteriorating, but none of them will exceed the indicative thresholds. In
the case of Cameroon, the historical average scenario reflects past current account surpluses that
are not foreseen throughout the projection period. As a consequence, the country's external debt
burden indicators would seem more optimistic, under the historical average scenario than under
the baseline scenario.
11. Possible litigation by private nonparticipating creditors remains a risk to the
credibility of the authorities’ debt policies Twenty-two commercial creditors, holding about 20
percent (US$240 million in claims, including US$78 million principal) of the total debt to
commercial creditors in August 2003, did not accept the buy-back deal, and some sold claims in
the secondary market. Five commercial creditors (Winslow Bank, Del Favero SPA, Sconset Ltd.,
Antwerp, and Grace Church Capital) have pursued legal recourse through litigation and seizure
of Cameroonian assets abroad. The authorities are in contact with other creditors. In early 2005,
Winslow sued, and under a court ruling seized US$50 million from Cameroon’s state oil
company’s deposits in France, while Del Favero froze the account of the Cameroonian embassy
in London.. The negotiations with Sconset and Antwerp continue. These creditors have already
accepted to drop their claim of accumulated interest but insist on the full repayment of the
principal and of all representation charges and court fees. Grace Church Capital has agreed to
start negotiations with a view to reach an out-of-court settlement. As the absolute amount of
claims by private creditors is less than 1 percent of Cameroon’s GDP, most likely they can not
have a significant impact of debt sustainability.
Public debt sustainability
12. Cameroon’s public debt has declined considerably. The decrease is driven by large
cancellations of external debt (see above) and frontloaded domestic debt repayments. Building
on the results of comprehensive audit for the end-2004 stock of domestic debt, the government
repaid substantial amounts, which helped reduce domestic debt from 17 percent of GDP in 2004
to 9 percent of GDP by end-2006. The debt repayment plan prepared by the authorities implies
substantial additional repayments of domestic debt in the next several years.
13. The long-term fiscal strategy is anchored on preserving the overall public debt
sustainability. Consistent with this objective, the nonoil primary deficit is expected to gradually

6
decline over the longer term to about 1 percent owing to additional nonoil revenue mobilization.
New borrowing will amount to 1.5 percent of GDP annually during 2007-16, consistent with the
country’s absorption capacity and then declining to about 1 percent. Under these assumptions,
the NPV of public debt in percent of revenues is expected to remain broadly stable over time
with some reduction in the outer years. Debt service is expected to be reduced considerably over
time.
14. Alternative scenarios and stress tests yield a significant deterioration of the public
debt outlook. Any scenario implying new annual borrowing in excess of 3 percent of GDP
would result in an explosive and unsustainable path. Terms of new borrowing are assumed the
same as in the baseline scenario. Historical experience suggests that the government has been
unable to use scaled up foreign financed investment exceeding 2 percent annually. If
compounded with lower than projected GDP, exports, and fiscal revenue growth aggressive
upfront borrowing, even on concessional terms, will lead to an unsustainable debt buildup.
15. Weak domestic debt management may pose program risks. Nonresident investors may
increasingly be involved in trading in Cameroon’s domestic debt on the secondary market,
although so far such transactions have not been significant..
Conclusion
16. After the full delivery of debt relief Cameroon faces a low risk of debt distress. All
external debt indicators remain below the relevant country-specific debt burden thresholds.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests reveal an upward trend for the debt indicators but do not
result in a breach of the thresholds during the projection period. Therefore, the authorities should
monitor closely debt indicators and avoid excessive borrowing on nonconcessional terms over
the medium term.

1/ The historical average scenario reflects past current account surpluses, which makes external debt burden indicators unreasonably optimistic.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (im
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 15, 2007
This statement provides an update on recent economic developments based on information
received after the staff report was issued. This information does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
1.
Inflation declined, reflecting the impact of lower fuel prices. Consumer price
inflation fell to 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2007 (compared with 4.5 percent in the
same period last year).
2.
Fiscal performance in the first quarter of 2007 was broadly satisfactory, though
revenues and investment spending were lower than expected. Based on very preliminary
data, the overall fiscal surplus was significantly higher than projected as lower-thanprogrammed spending more than compensated for lower revenues. The underperformance in
nonoil revenues stems mostly from lower-than-projected nontax revenues reflecting delays in
the payment of dividends. Performance on investment execution was mixed: while
domestically-financed investment was close to the program target, foreign- and debt relieffinanced investments were significantly lower than expected. The end-March 2007
quantitative benchmark on the nonoil primary balance,16 was missed by a small margin
(0.03 percent of GDP). The authorities are taking steps, in line with program commitments,
to strengthen nonoil revenue collection and monitor spending closely.
3.
The authorities have relaunched the privatization process for the national
airline. As a first step, they announced in May a bidding process for the recruitment of an

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Cameroon
On June 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cameroon.17
Background
Cameroon’s economy has grown steadily over the past two decades, aided by the devaluation
of the CFA franc in 1994, and the accompanying macroeconomic and structural reforms. The
resulting growth, however, has not been strong enough to make a significant dent on poverty.
A number of factors have constrained Cameroon’s growth potential relative to the group of
lower-middle-income economies, including lower investment rate, shallower financial depth, less
open trade; weaker infrastructure and human capital base; and weaker business environment.
On the current trajectory, the MDGs, including the target on halving the percentage of
population living below the poverty line, are likely to be missed.
During recent years, the authorities made progress in restoring conditions for macroeconomic
stability and strengthening governance. This allowed Cameroon to reach the completion point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and receive additional debt relief under the MDRI. Its
challenges now are to preserve fiscal sustainability, while expanding priority spending, and
make the business climate more attractive for private sector-led growth.
Economic developments were encouraging in 2006. Growth picked up somewhat, following a
rebound in construction activities, oil output, and forestry production. Although inflation rose,
17

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

reflecting higher fuel prices, it was contained at about 5 percent. Higher oil prices and
production improved the external current account and resulted in a considerable improvement
of the overall fiscal balance. However, in the fourth quarter of 2006, emergency-related
extrabudgetary spending financed directly by the national oil company raised concerns about
budget transparency.
The PRGF-supported program was implemented satisfactorily in July–December 2006. Most
fiscal and financial targets were met. However, because of extrabudgetary spending in late
2006, the quantitative performance criterion on bank financing was narrowly missed. Structural
reforms monitored under the program were instituted as planned. Efforts to strengthen
transparency and improve budget management culminated in the publication of two EITI reports
covering the period 2001-05. However, the privatization process of the national airline was
declared unsuccessful as the revised offer by the winning bidder was considered unsatisfactory.
The authorities remain committed to the preparation of a new reform strategy for the airline
which will eliminate subsidies while improving air services. Anti-corruption efforts were
continued and the government appointed in early 2007 the members of the anti-corruption
commission set up a year ago.
The outlook for 2007 and the medium term is encouraging. Economic activity is expected to pick
up further in 2007, reflecting stronger performance in the forestry, construction and tertiary
sectors. Because of lower projected oil prices, inflation is expected to decelerate considerably
while the external current account deficit will widen over the medium term. Fiscal policies will
remain prudent. While the overall fiscal surplus will decline on average during 2007-08, largely
as a result of lower oil prices, fiscal consolidation efforts—as reflected in the nonoil fiscal
balance—will continue. The main risks to this outlook relate to slower progress in mobilizing
nonoil revenue and improving the business climate, and public spending overruns linked to the
parliamentary elections in 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Cameroonian authorities’ commitment to sound policies and reforms,
which have supported improved macroeconomic performance. Directors noted, in particular,
that progress made over the past two years in the areas of fiscal policy and public finance
management contributed to macroeconomic stability. While encouraged by the pick up in output
growth in 2006, they stressed the importance of consolidating the recent fiscal gains, preserving
fiscal sustainability, and strengthening the business climate, in order to accelerate growth,
especially given the recent decelerating trend in productivity. Maintaining a strong momentum in
the implementation of structural and governance reforms will be critical to the realization of
growth and poverty reduction objectives.
Directors underscored the importance of setting non-oil revenues on a steady upward path,
especially in the context of declining oil reserves and the expected trade liberalization. They
urged the authorities to stay vigilant about meeting their non-oil revenue objectives, including

3
through administrative measures to expand the tax base, and to be ready to accelerate their
implementation and to adopt tax policy measures if tax receipts fall below expectations.
Directors encouraged the authorities to monitor closely spending levels while enhancing the
quality of public spending. They urged the authorities to follow budgetary procedures and refrain
from undertaking extrabudgetary spending. Growth and poverty reduction objectives would be
better served by enhancing capital budget execution and reorienting spending toward priority
areas. Subsidies to public enterprises should be contained, first, and then eliminated over time,
to create more fiscal space for priority spending. More generally, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to prepare a medium-term action plan to improve budget management
further. Directors urged the authorities to continue improving public expenditure management by
better monitoring budgets and tracking expenditures, including those related to poverty
reduction. Improved transparency in the use of budget resources, including oil, remains a
priority.
Directors underscored the importance of pursuing a prudent debt management strategy in the
post-debt relief period. Borrowing over the medium term should continue to be on concessional
terms, and the related resources should be put to effective use to safeguard debt sustainability.
The authorities and non-Paris Club creditors are encouraged to continue good faith efforts to
reach agreements on debt relief.
Directors urged the authorities to take decisive actions to strengthen the business environment.
In addition to infrastructure improvements, this objective would require policies to improve
financial intermediation, liberalize trade, reform public enterprises and strengthen governance.
They underscored the importance of deepening financial intermediation, while preserving the
soundness of the banking system. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
build on the recommendations of the national Financial Sector Assessment Program mission.
Directors commended the authorities for pursuing the trade reform agenda within the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community, including a lowering of the common external
tariffs. They encouraged the authorities to accelerate the reform of public enterprises in a timely
and transparent manner in order to reduce the burden on public finances, allow the use of the
freed-up resources in more productive areas, and improve services. Directors urged the
authorities to step up anticorruption efforts aimed at lowering uncertainty in the regulatory and
judicial environment.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under the PRGF Arrangement with
Cameroon and Approves US$4 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of Cameroon’s economic performance and the review of financing assurances under a
three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)1 arrangement. In completing the
third review, the Executive Board also approved Cameroon’s request for a waiver of the nonobservance of a performance criterion pertaining to net claims of the banking sector on the
central government, on the basis of a minor deviation and corrective action taken. The
completion of these reviews enables the release of an amount equivalent to SDR 2.65 million
(about US$4 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 10.6
million (about US$16 million).
The three-year PRGF arrangement for Cameroon was approved by the Executive Board in
October 24, 2005 (see Press Release No 05/236) in an amount equivalent to SDR 18.57
million (about US$27.9 million).
At the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Cameroonian authorities are to be commended for implementing policies and reforms
that led to improvements in macroeconomic performance over the past decade. The
satisfactory implementation of the PRGF-supported program, notably in the areas of fiscal
policy and public finance management, contributed to the strengthening of macroeconomic
conditions in recent years. The challenge going forward is to build on recent gains in order to
resume the path to sustained growth and poverty reduction. This will require continued
efforts to preserve fiscal sustainability and improve the business environment.
“The authorities’ ability to mobilize nonoil revenues in the context of declining oil reserves
and the expected trade liberalization will be critical to the maintenance of fiscal

sustainability. Given this, efforts to expand the tax base should be accelerated, including, if
necessary, additional measures at the level of tax policy to safeguard fiscal objectives.
“The authorities should monitor closely spending levels while enhancing the quality of public
spending. Growth and poverty reduction objectives would be better served by strengthening
the execution of capital expenditure and reorienting spending toward priority areas. The
authorities should refrain from undertaking any extrabudgetary spending and continue efforts
to strengthen public expenditure management and transparency, notably by better monitoring
budgets and tracking expenditures. Improved transparency in the use of budget resources,
including oil and debt relief, remains a priority.
“Prudent debt management should remain a priority in the post-debt relief period. Borrowing
over the medium term should continue to be on concessional terms, and the related resources
should be put into effective use.
“Strengthening the business environment requires decisive action to improve infrastructure,
deepen financial intermediation, liberalize trade, reform public enterprises, and enhance
governance. In the period ahead, the authorities should build on the recommendations of the
national Financial Sector Assessment Program mission to prepare a financial sector strategy,
pursue the reform agenda within Central African Economic and Monetary Community,
including a lowering of the common external tariff, and accelerate the reform of public
enterprises in a timely and transparent manner to reduce the burden on public finances and
improve services. Anticorruption efforts should be pursued with the goal of lowering
uncertainty in the regulatory and judicial environment,” Mr. Lipsky said.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Cameroon
June 15, 2007
On behalf of my Cameroonian authorities, I would like to thank Executive Directors and
Management for their continued support to Cameroon’s efforts towards sustained growth and
economic development. I would also like to thank staff for the constructive policy dialogue
and fruitful exchanges during their recent visit to Yaoundé.
Cameroon continues to exhibit good overall macroeconomic performance. Economic growth
picked up in 2006, close to 4 percent, and external development were favorable owing to
higher prices and production and increased nonoil export volume. The contribution of nonoil
activity to this outlook is encouraging, particularly in the construction and forestry sectors.
The nonoil activity, which grew by 3.5 percent in 2006, has made a solid contribution to the
rebound in economic growth last year. Despite the erosion of preferential treatment granted
by the European Union to the country’s agricultural exports, and the increased competition
faced by local production from finished products from lower cost producing countries, the
external balance has improved owing to oil prices and production.
Efforts by the Cameroonian authorities on fiscal policy continue to bear fruits. Good outturn
in both oil revenue and nonoil revenue collection, combined with reduced current spending.
Bottlenecks in aid disbursement under the debt relief initiative, coupled with difficulties in
procurement procedures, have led to lower-than-planned capital expenditure. At a time when
grants and concessional borrowing should be made more available to low-income countries,
it should also be noted that concessional resources have been scarce to Cameroon, making
even more difficult for the country to meet its daunting infrastructure and social needs. While
efforts are underway to improve the use of resources freed by HIPC and MDRI debt relief,
additional resources are needed to address the energy issue.
As for debt management, Cameroon has committed to the Paris Club to offer comparable
treatment to creditors that did not participate in the 2003 debt buy-back operation.
Negotiations with private creditors are ongoing, and some of the creditors have already
agreed to forgo accumulated interest and penalties.
On the monetary front, my authorities have reduced government liabilities to the banking
system, whose health has strengthened overall. The reduction in net bank credit to the
government contributed to containing money supply growth and inflation amid higher prices
for petroleum products.
Regarding structural reforms, my Cameroonian authorities have, in line with the program
target, submitted a draft 2007 Budget Law which was adopted by end-2006. The authorities
have started to implement the customs information system in the Littoral province, which is
aimed at curbing customs fraud and boosting revenue. In addition, tax centers for
mediumsized enterprises have been established in the two main cities, Yaoundé and Douala,
with the view to improve the efficiency of tax monitoring. On the expenditure side, the
tracking summary tables, which also covers pro-poor spending, are produced on a regular

2
basis. As part of efforts to streamline the size of civil service, the government completed its
census of civil servants and used results to clean up the payroll.
Regarding public enterprises reforms, the authorities are pursuing their agenda with
assistance from the World Bank and the IFC. International invitation for bids for the
privatization of the national telephone company (CAMTEL) and the public-private
management contract of the national water company (SNEC), respectively, were launched.
As for the airline company, CAMAIR, the government has already issued a new tender for its
privatization. In the meantime, agreement has been reached with Fund staff on subsidies to
the company.
In the financial sector, a management team for CAMPOST was recruited and assumed
operations in February 2007. The government took actions to ensure the reconstitution of the
assets of the company, including depositing at the central bank the transfer it made to
CAMPOST as part of its domestic debt settlement and ensuring a quarterly supervision
report on the company by the unit within the Ministry of Finance in charge of the oversight
of nonbank financial institutions.
Further efforts have been made to enhance governance and transparency in the
management of public resources, notably in the oil, public enterprises and anti-corruption
areas. My authorities have continued to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) principles and publish the quarterly budget-execution reports, the operating
reports of the national oil company, the financial aggregates of the main public enterprises,
statistical data, debt analysis, and judicial decisions and administrative penalties against
corrupt government employees. Members of the National Anti-Corruption Commission
(CONAC) were appointed and the Commission is now operational. As for the functioning of
the Commission planned as part of the implementation of asset disclosure by senior
government officials, the implementing regulations under the related law have been adopted,
and my authorities are currently visiting other countries for comparison purposes. On a
different front, my authorities are working, in collaboration with the World Bank, to put in
place an appropriate procurement system.
My authorities’ sustained efforts have allowed them to meet most of the program’s
quantitative criteria and benchmarks at end-December 2006. The missed performance
criterion on the increase in net claims of the banking system on the central government is due
to exceptional circumstances, notably contingent obligation related to the provision of
economic and social (education, health, clean water) infrastructure in the Bakassi peninsula.
This was in accordance with the conditions laid down by the United Nations international
arbitration ruling on the peninsula. As my Cameroonian authorities had no revenue
provisions, they were compelled to use windfall revenue from the oil company. My
Cameroonian authorities have however committed to ensure that such extrabudgetary
expenditure does not occur again. They request a waiver for the nonobservance of this
criterion and the modification into a performance criterion of the structural benchmark on
cash payments by the national oil company on account of the government.

3
In view of overall satisfactory program performance and the commitments made in the Prime
Minister’s Letter of Intent and the government’s Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies for the period ahead, I request, on behalf of my Cameroonian authorities, the Board
to approve the requested waiver, the completion of the third review and the completion of the
financing assurances review.
ECONOMIC POLICIES AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS GOING FORWARD
Going forward, my authorities will continue to act within the medium-term macroeconomic
framework. In this framework, annual GDP growth should remain above 4 percent, inflation
contained below 2 percent, fiscal position favorable notably with nonoil primary deficit
stabilized around 2.2 percent and overall budget balance (commitment basis, excluding
grants) in surplus, and the current account current account weaken due to lower oil prices.
This positive outlook owes to the beneficial impact of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative
and the MDRI and better prospects for forestry, construction and tertiary sectors. Nonoil
activity is also expected to grow at levels above 4 percent.
Fiscal policy
It is my authorities’ intention to meet the fiscal objectives of the 2007 program. Based on
their determination and recent results, they feel confident that the nonoil revenue objective,
set at 12.5 percent of GDP will materialize. On the expenditure side, two-thirds of
noninterest spending in 2007 will be allocated to capital expenditures on which the
authorities will put much focus. They will invite donors and lenders in discussions at budget
conferences in order to improve the execution of poverty reduction expenditure while
accelerating the latter. In the same vein, the government will prepare a road map toward
executing a multiyear investment budget. Furthermore, starting next year, my authorities will
enter as priority items in the budget for the following year all expenditure items that have
been committed but for which payment has not been authorized by the end of the fiscal year.
My authorities commit to continue using any windfall in oil revenue to accelerate payments
on domestic debt and arrears, repurchase debt held by external commercial creditors who did
not take part in the commercial debt repurchase initiative within the London Club, and
finance investment projects in priority sectors of infrastructure development, education,
health, and rural and urban development. The financing of these projects will be made after
consultation with IMF staff.
Structural reforms
As underscored above, my authorities commit to maintaining budget transparency and make
further efforts to enhance budgetary procedures and continuing the fiscal reforms envisaged
in the context of the PRGF-supported program. These include measures to boost tax and
customs revenue and broaden the tax base within this year, notably by: (i) connecting online
the IT systems of the tax and customs directorates; (ii) establishing the electronic one-stop
window to facilitate foreign trade; (iii) eliminating the minimum administrative values for all

4
imported products while taxing imported goods in accordance with CEMAC rules;
(iv) pursuing efforts to control and reduce duty exemptions and improve ex-post controls;
(v) mproving the implementation and control of customs and economic regimes; (vi)
increasing the number of taxpayers covered by the tax centers for medium-sized enterprises
in Yaoundé and Douala; (vii) streamlining taxpayer identification; (viii) completing the
implementation of a tax-related information management software (AREN); (ix) creating a
commission in charge of reviewing domestic tax and foreign trade taxation, which will make
recommendations aimed at boosting revenues from these taxes. The authorities also intend to
increase forestry revenue by restoring the capacity to monitor sectoral data and control the
tax base. On the expenditure side, they remain committed to strengthen the monitoring of
public expenditure through consistent monthly budget execution tables on a cash basis and
on a payment order basis, as well as monthly expenditure table broken down by economic
function to track spending in priority sectors. Finally, the government will also pursue its
public procurement reforms by periodically assessing the public procurement system and
systematically publishing the penalties imposed on offenders.
Reforms will also be pursued in the civil service. The government’s objectives in this area is
to establish a solid basis for determining staffing levels and the payroll, secure and
harmonize the related data and increase the efficiency of the civil service. As regard the
payroll, it plans to give priority to adjusting the salaries for promotions using the savings
from the census and clean-up of the payroll.
Concerning fuel pricing, the policy began in 2005 which transfers resources to the national
refinery, SONARA, will be pursued this year. Regarding SONARA, measures to bolster its
financial position will be pursued. No further investments will be made unless their economic
viability is proven and their financing maintains a fiscal sustainability.
Turning to the public enterprise reform, it is my authorities’ firm intention to continue
implementation of its public enterprise privatization and restructuring programs, including
for CAMTEL, SNEC and CAMAIR. Specific timetables have been set in this regard, as
specified in their new Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.
On the financial sector, initiatives to facilitate credit access will be encourage, notably by
improving financial reporting, simplifying the procedures for calling in collateral, and
establishing a commercial court. As alternative source of financing, its is envisaged to
develop the securities market with the issuance of new stocks and bonds and the transfer of
secondary market transactions on treasury bonds to the financial market. As for the financial
sector assessment, the authorities of Cameroon fully support the BEAC in implementing the
recommendations made by the regional FSAP.
External debt management
My authorities will pursue a prudent debt policy going forward, one that will be consistent
with the medium-term macroeconomic framework and fiscal objectives. My authorities will
ensure that loans are contracted on concessional terms. Moreover, bilateral agreements with

5
the various Paris Club member creditors will be signed while good-faith negotiations to clear
arrears with private creditors will proceed with continued concern for comparable treatment.
Business environment
My authorities remain committed to their efforts to enhance transparency and good
governance and combat corruption, with the view to improve the business environment. The
initial results obtained reinforce their resolve in this area. With the assistance of the World
Bank and the IFC, they intend to put in place a Business Forum—modeled on the example of
Vietnam— to coordinate public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Trade liberalization and boosting the volume of foreign trade remains important objectives
for Cameroon. In this vein, subregional integration within the CEMAC is an important
component of their strategy. My Cameroonian authorities intend to use their central position
within the Community to advance reforms aimed at removing barriers to intracommunity
trade, lowering the maximum common external tariff (CET), revising the CET exemptions,
and reducing nontariff obstacles to the development of intraregional trade.
CONCLUSION
My authorities have once again demonstrated their commitment to policies and reforms
defined in the PRGF-supported program. Since the HIPC completion point, there have been
significant achievements in putting in place needed policy measures. Their ownership of the
needed measures remain intact. In view of the satisfactory macroeconomic policies since the
last review under the PRGF-supported program, the broadly smooth implementation of the
structural reform agenda, the overall satisfactory program performance as reconfirmed in the
most recent staff update, and the renewed commitments made by the Cameroonian
authorities on policy and reform implementation for the period ahead, I will appreciate the
Board's support for the completion of the third review under the PRGF for Cameroon. In
addition, in light of the appropriate debt policies pursued by my authorities, including
prudent borrowing policies and their good-faith efforts to reach agreements with the private
holders of the country’s debt, I also request the Board’s support for the completion of the
financing assurances review.
