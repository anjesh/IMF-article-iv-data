IRELAND
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Ireland
Approved by Robert Ford and Michael Hadjimichael
August 2, 2007
Executive Summary
Background and outlook: Economic performance remains impressive, though in recent
years economic growth became increasingly reliant on house building. Competitiveness
eroded somewhat, though it is still broadly appropriate. The rise in euro area interest rates
has prompted a welcome cooling of the housing market, which will help to rebalance
economic growth and reduce inflation, though there is a risk of a sharper slowdown. The key
policy challenges are therefore to support adjustment to sustainable growth.
Fiscal policy: Fiscal stabilizers have ample room to operate fully, but discretionary measures
that weaken the underlying fiscal position should be avoided. The authorities and staff agreed
on the importance of maintaining fiscal prudence. Over the medium term, it will be important
to further improve the quality of spending and review the tax base. As age-related spending
will rise considerably in the long term, improving public understanding of fiscal pressures
and a better approach to pension planning are needed.
Financial system: Banks have large exposures to the property market, but stress tests suggest
that cushions are adequate to cover a range of shocks. Financial regulation and supervision
have improved over the past year with the introduction of a new liquidity management
framework for banks and the strengthening of capacity for insurance supervision. The
authorities and staff shared the view that continued careful monitoring of banks’ risk
management practices is essential.
Labor market policies: The authorities and staff concurred that wage moderation—in both
the social partnership agreement and the forthcoming public sector pay benchmarking
exercise—and firm-level wage flexibility are crucial to minimizing the expected rise in
unemployment and seizing new growth opportunities.

1.
Economic performance remains very strong, supported by sound policies. The
growth rate of real GNP per capita continues to be one of the highest among advanced
economies and the unemployment rate one of the lowest. Higher value-added activities such
as financial services, information technology services, and other business services are
expanding. Inward foreign direct

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy has been prudent, with a medium-term fiscal objective of close to balance or
surplus, in line with Fund advice. In the past couple years, windfall property-related revenues were saved and
the fiscal stance was not procyclical, in line with Fund advice.
Financial stability: The Fund supports the supervisory framework, which aims to prioritize resources across
sectors based on risk profile. The regulatory and supervisory framework continues to be strengthened in line
with the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP Update.
Wage policies: The present social partnership agreement contained no fiscal concessions, in line with Fund
advice, though the wage increases were a little on the high side.

However, in recent years, economic
growth has become more reliant on house
building and competitiveness has eroded. The
share of residential investment in economic
activity rose to a higher level than in other
advanced economies. House prices increased
rapidly and the ratios of house prices to rents and
to household disposable income rose to historical
highs. The construction boom was accompanied
by surging bank credit to property-related
sectors, strong wage growth and inflationary
pressures, and a deterioration in the external
current account balance.

3.
A new government was formed in June following parliamentary elections, but
substantial continuity in economic policies is expected. Fianna Fail remained the largest
party in parliament and Prime Minister Ahern formed a coalition government with the
Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and supported by some independent members of
parliament. Brian Cowen was reappointed as Finance Minister and also appointed as Tanaiste
(Deputy Prime Minister). Given the comfortable majority of the ruling coalition, parliament
is likely to run its full course, with the next general election in mid-2012.
II. STRONG GROWTH IN 2006, THOUGH HOUSING MARKET STARTED TO COOL
4.
Economic growth was strong in 2006, driven by robust domestic demand
(Table 1). Private consumption growth remained buoyant, as support from dynamic
employment growth and steady wage growth partly offset the adverse effects of higher debt
service and energy costs. Business investment growth fell sharply, reflecting the base effect
of exceptionally large purchases of aircraft the previous year (and was therefore matched by
a decline in import growth). Residential investment growth slowed, but this was partly offset
by a pickup in nonresidential building investment. Lost competitiveness contributed to a
slower growth of exports of goods and services.

Strong growth in 2006 diminished economic slack and boosted inflationary
pressures. HICP inflation rose to 2¾ percent, above the euro area average, driven by rapid
increases in services prices. The unemployment rate was stable, as both employment growth
and labor force growth were robust, reflecting high net immigration and increased
participation rates, especially among women. For the year as a whole, wage growth was
broadly in line with productivity (GDP per employee) growth, suggesting that economy-wide
unit labor costs were broadly flat in 2006. In light of rising inflation and low unemployment,
the authorities and staff agreed that output was at or slightly above potential in 2006, though
such estimates have large margins of uncertainty.

Higher-than-trading-partner inflation led to a further erosion of
competitiveness. Ireland’s share of industrial country exports of goods and services
continued its gradual decline and the current account deficit widened to 4¼ percent of GDP
(Table 2). Net FDI was negative but improved relative to 2005, mainly reflecting the passing
of the impact of temporary U.S. regulatory changes. The authorities and staff agreed that,
while external competitiveness has eroded, the external position is stable (Appendix II) and

6
that Ireland’s real effective exchange rate is close to, but perhaps slightly above, its
equilibrium value.2

The rise in euro area interest rates since late 2005 has prompted a cooling of the
housing market. The growth of residential investment declined significantly in 2006 and
house prices have fallen in recent months. The share of residential investment in GDP in
Ireland is higher than in other countries, partly reflecting catch-up in Ireland’s housing stock.
With the ratio of house prices to rental income above its historical average, house prices were
seen as somewhat overvalued by Central Bank officials and staff, though in line with
fundamentals by Department of Environment officials.

Estimates based on the CGER methodology suggest that the real effective exchange rate is 0–10 percent
above equilibrium. The standard deviation of the errors in the estimates is about 10–15 percent.

III. GROWTH SLOWDOWN AHEAD, WITH RISKS ON THE DOWNSIDE
8.
Residential investment is expected to wind down as house completions return to
a sustainable level. Although rapid population growth and a relatively low number of
dwellings per capita ensure strong underlying demand for housing, the staff consider the
sustainable level of house completions to be about 50,000 to 70,000, well below the 88,000
dwellings finished in 2006. Thus, residential investment is projected to contract substantially
during 2007–10. The authorities saw a soft landing of the housing market as likely. The
shared view is that any overvaluation of house prices would likely diminish gradually over
time as rental income and other fundamentals grow more quickly than house prices. The
authorities and staff agreed that housing wealth effects on consumption are small.3
9.
The growth slowdown in 2007 will be cushioned by strong private consumption
and fiscal stimulus (Table 3). In addition to robust employment growth, steady wage
3

8
growth, and increased government transfers to households, private consumption will be
supported by maturing Special Saving Investment Accounts (amounting to about 12 percent
of private consumption), a small portion of which will be spent. Nonresidential structures
investment is also expected to be strong, in light of continued favorable growth prospects
over the medium term and Ireland’s need for public infrastructure. Altogether, staff project
that real GDP will grow by about 4¾ percent. Given the strength of domestic demand, the
current account deficit is expected to widen further to about 4½ percent of GDP.

Growth will rebalance further in 2008, as the easing of domestic demand relieves
inflationary pressures and helps to narrow the current account deficit. Economic growth
is projected to slow further, as the temporary supports to private consumption fade, euro area
interest rates continue to rise, and the downturn in residential investment gains momentum.
The slowdown in domestic demand growth should increase economic slack and dampen
import growth. Over the medium term, assuming the completion of the adjustment in the
housing market, GDP growth will likely run at about 4 percent, reflecting employment
growth of about 2 percent and labor productivity growth of about 2 percent. The authorities
noted that official projections would only be updated in the autumn, but gave a broadly
similar characterization of the outlook.
11.
The risks to the short-term outlook are tilted to the downside. The housing market
could cool more sharply than expected or the external environment could deteriorate (or
both). If realized, these risks would further dampen economic growth, reduce government
revenue, and increase financial sector stress:

External developments: Growth in
Ireland’s trading partners is projected to
remain robust, but risks are skewed to
the downside. In particular, a weakening
of U.S. growth is an important risk
(Box 2). Also, given the relatively high
share of exports to the United States, a
further appreciation of the euro would
undermine Ireland’s competitiveness to a
greater extent than for other euro area
countries. A reversal of still benign
global financial market conditions could
lead to a deterioration in investor
sentiment toward Ireland.

Box 2. Spillovers to Ireland
As a small, open economy, Ireland is vulnerable to spillovers from its main trading partners.
Merchandise exports amount to about 50 percent of GDP, of which more than two-fifths go to
the euro area and less than one-fifth each to the U.S. and the U.K. Ireland is also vulnerable to
swings in its real effective exchange rate.
Staff analysis yields two main findings:1/
•

Spillovers from the U.S. account for a much larger share of the variance of Ireland’s GDP
than implied by the U.S. share in Ireland’s merchandise exports. This could reflect a larger
U.S. share of services exports or the dominance of U.S. multinationals in inward FDI.
Therefore, a further slowdown in U.S. growth could have a large effect on Ireland.

•

The impact of shocks to the real effective exchange rate on Ireland’s GDP increases over
time, with their share of the variance decomposition rising to about 12 percent after two
years and higher still at a longer horizon. This suggests that past erosion of competitiveness
may yet have a more substantial impact on economic activity.

With a rebalancing of economic activity in prospect, the discussions focused on
the policies needed to support the adjustment to sustainable growth. Specifically:
•

How is fiscal policy positioned to cushion the slowdown? How will demographic
change affect the public finances over the long term?

•

What are the key vulnerabilities and how large are the buffers in the banking system?
How will financial stability and growth be promoted over the medium term?

11
•

How can wage-setting mechanisms help to ensure wage moderation and wage
flexibility in response to changing macroeconomic conditions?
IV. AMPLE ROOM FOR FISCAL STABILIZERS, BUT POPULATION AGING AHEAD

13.
Already-strong fiscal performance improved further in 2006 (Table 4). Following
a decade of close-to-balance-or-surplus fiscal positions, the general government surplus
surged to almost 3 percent of GDP in 2006 and net debt fell to about 12 percent of GDP. The
better-than-expected fiscal outturn reflected mainly the strength of property-related revenues,
as stamp duties and capital gains tax benefited from rising house prices. Government
expenditure as a share of GDP fell slightly, as a decline in current spending more than offset
a rise in investment.

The budget for 2007 implies substantial fiscal stimulus at a time when the
economy may be operating at or above capacity.4 In staff projections, most of the
2 percentage point of GDP deterioration in the fiscal position comes from a rise in
expenditure, due to increases in social welfare payments and higher education and health
spending. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall, reflecting both lower corporate
income tax and some weakening of stamp duties and capital gains taxes in the second half of
the year. While tax buoyancy could once again surprise on the upside (as it has done in recent
years5), housing market turnover (the base for property-related taxes) could slow more
sharply than expected. Staff noted that, given inflationary pressures, eroding competitiveness,
and a widening current account deficit, substantial fiscal stimulus in 2007 is unfortunate, but
the authorities pointed to the need to achieve social objectives.
4

After the election, the new government announced a reduction in stamp duty on house transactions, but the
fiscal cost is very small (less than 0.05 percent of GDP on a full-year basis).

15.
On unchanged policies, some cyclical weakening of the fiscal position in 2008 is
likely, stemming from the impact of the growth slowdown on government revenue. In
staff’s central scenario, the fiscal balance is projected to decline by ½ percent of GDP, with
risks to this projection tilted to the downside. However, a faster-than-expected cooling of the
housing market could result in a much sharper fall in the fiscal balance, reflecting lower
property-related revenues, lower income tax and VAT revenues, and higher spending on
unemployment benefits. If external shocks were to occur at the same time, the deterioration
in the government balance could be even larger, as illustrated by the large deterioration in the
fiscal balance (almost 5 percentage points of GDP) between 2000–02. The authorities agreed
with the characterization of risks.
16.
Against this background, the authorities and staff shared the view that prudent
fiscal policy should be maintained. With the new government’s five-year program
containing some potentially costly proposals, such as a reduction in the social security
contribution rate, a rise in pension benefits relative to average earnings, and a cut in personal
income tax rates, staff cautioned against discretionary measures that would weaken the
underlying fiscal position and suggested restraining the growth of current spending to
nominal GDP growth. The authorities said that a sound fiscal position would be maintained
by reducing current expenditure growth and targeting a balanced budget.
17.
Turning to the medium term, the authorities and staff agreed on the importance
of further improving the quality of spending and reviewing the tax base. Specifically,
while a high level of government investment spending is appropriate given Ireland’s
significant infrastructure needs, robust cost-benefit analysis is needed to ensure value for
money. In this regard, project sponsors need to ensure that full economic analysis is carried
out: compliance with this requirement should be subject to audit by the central unit
responsible for oversight and quality control of cost-benefit analysis. Turning to current
spending, value for money could be enhanced by introducing multi-year envelopes and
requiring efficiency gains in the delivery of public services. On the revenue side, the

13
authorities noted that a Commission on Taxation will be established to review the efficiency
and appropriateness of the taxation system. Staff suggested that the Commission could
consider, among the other issues, the nature of taxes on property, with a view to establishing
whether revenue neutral adjustments might be made which would encourage mobility while
ensuring a dynamic tax base and avoiding distortionary effects. Staff also suggested
broadening user fees, for example by fully charging for water supply and sewage treatment
and introducing a congestion charge in Dublin. The authorities pointed to the political
sensitivity of property-related taxes and user fees.
18.
Looking further ahead, population aging will put increasing pressure on public
finances. While Ireland’s population actually became slightly younger over the past 50 years,
the old-age dependency ratio will start to rise quite steeply very soon. As a result, the EC
Aging Working Group projects a rise in age-related government spending between 2004–50
of about 8 percentage points of GDP (primarily due to increased pension spending), higher
than the average for other EU countries.6 To prepare for this spending, the government is

setting aside every year 1 percent of GNP in a
National Pensions Reserve Fund. Another
partial offset will be an eventual decline in
government investment spending as a share of
GDP to a level more in line with the industrial
country average. Nevertheless, an illustrative
scenario shows that government net debt could
rise substantially by mid-century. To improve
public understanding of the pressures on public
finances, staff suggested the regular publication
of a report on long-term fiscal sustainability, as

cover these issues and that work on a longer report is underway.
19.
To address long-term fiscal pressures, the authorities and staff agreed that a mix
of measures will be needed (Box 3). Staff noted that the state pensionable age (currently 65)
could be raised in line with rising life expectancy and that the government’s annual
contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund could be raised. Staff further observed
that some other countries are addressing concerns about the adequacy of private saving for
retirement by introducing a national defined-contribution scheme with automatic enrolment
and low operating costs. The authorities responded that these and other options would be
analyzed in a forthcoming Green Paper on Pension Policy.

V. BANKS HAVE LARGE EXPOSURES TO PROPERTY, BUT BIG CUSHIONS TOO
20.
The banking system continues to perform well, but rapid credit growth has led
to vulnerabilities (Table 5). Reflecting the strength of the economy, the banking system is
well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid, and nonperforming loans are low. However, bank
lending to construction and real estate firms amounts to about 47 percent of GDP (Figure 1).
Household debt now amounts to about 160 percent of household disposable income and,
with most debt at variables rates, rising euro area interest rates have raised households’ debt
burdens. While about ⅓ of the mortgages taken out by first time buyers in 2006 was at a
100 percent loan-to-value ratio, the average loan-to-value ratio is low compared to other
countries and households’ financial assets far exceed financial liabilities. At the same time,
as loan growth has outstripped deposit growth, banks have become more reliant on wholesale
funding, which is more expensive and potentially more volatile than retail funding. However,

banks also hold high levels of liquid assets. Looking forward, the slowdown in credit growth
associated with the cooling housing market is expected to put some pressure on profits.
21.
Stress tests by the Central Bank indicate that the major lenders have adequate
buffers to cover a range of shocks. Even in an extreme scenario, involving a sharp rise in
unemployment and a sharp decline in house prices, capital remains adequate at every bank.
In addition, even a very substantial withdrawal of private sector deposits would not exhaust
any major lender’s stock of liquid assets. However, the stress tests only incorporate firstround effects and the long period of strong economic performance limits the ability to
quantify the relationship between macroeconomic variables and credit risk. The Central Bank
is working on extending stress tests to banks’ foreign exposures.
22.
The regulatory and supervisory system has been strengthened over the past
year, in line with the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP Update. New liquidity
requirements for credit institutions—involving a forward-looking mismatch approach under
which cash flows are assigned to relevant time bands—came into effect in July 2007. In
insurance supervision, the Financial Regulator has recruited experts, trained staff, and

17
reorganized, with the new structure having both an on-site inspection unit and a reinsurance
unit. Insurance supervisors are focusing on assessing companies’ risk management
frameworks and capacities, in preparation for the eventual adoption of Solvency II. The
implementation of the EU Capital Requirements Directive could lead to declines in
regulatory capital, though the declines would initially be limited by the capital floors
imposed by the Capital Requirements Directive. As banks could use any excess capital to
expand into unfamiliar activities, the authorities and staff agreed that it will be important to
continue to carefully monitor banks’ risk management practices, including for commercial
property lending. Staff supported the Financial Regulator’s prudent approach on the riskweighting of lending to speculative commercial property and residential investment property.
Although the amount of subprime mortgage loans is small (less than 2 percent of outstanding
mortgage loans), staff supported the proposal to make all subprime lenders subject to the
consumer protection code.
23.
Over the medium term, the financial system has an important role to play in
supporting economic growth. Staff noted that Ireland’s financial system is already
characterized by a relatively high degree of arm’s length transactions (Box 4). In addition to
maintaining high standards in areas such as bank competition, investor protection, and
corporate transparency, policy measures that contribute to the further development of
securities markets could be considered. For example, the relatively high stamp duty on
securities transactions could be dampening market turnover.
VI. LABOR MARKET FLEXIBILITY IS CRUCIAL TO FACILITATING ADJUSTMENT

economy will depend on the flexibility of the labor market. Earlier reform of the tax and

Box 4. Finance and Growth
Staff analysis examines the link between types of financial systems and economic growth in
advanced economies.1 Specifically, staff finds that increased corporate borrowing has an especially
favorable impact on the growth of industries more reliant on external finance in those countries with
financial systems that rely more on arm’s length transactions and greater labor market flexibility. An
arm’s length financial system is one characterized by a more competitive banking sector and more
developed capital markets. Turning to the implications for Ireland:
•

Ireland already ranks well in terms of banking sector competition, investor protection, and
corporate transparency. Here, the challenge is to remain at the forefront of international best
practice.

•

At the same time, the authorities could consider whether additional policy action could
contribute to the further development of capital markets, notably the stock market, the bond
market, and derivatives markets.

•

Maintaining the flexibility of Ireland’s labor market is also important. While the tax wedge is
low, Ireland needs to avoid any increases in the obstacles to workers’ ability to move to their
most productive jobs.

benefit system resulted in a sharp fall in the structural unemployment rate during the 1990s.7
The tax wedge is now one of the lowest among industrial countries. Employment protection
legislation in Ireland is less restrictive than the OECD average, though more restrictive than
in the United Kingdom or the United States.
25.
Wage moderation and wage flexibility under the social partnership agreement
will also be essential to limiting the depth of the downturn and avoiding any further loss
of competitiveness. Social partnership agreements (between employers, unions, and the
government) have provided a useful vehicle for developing a common view of economic
prospects, established sensible guidelines for wage increases while allowing considerable
flexibility at the firm level, and preserved peaceful labor relations. With current wage growth
(about 5 percent) already somewhat above the sum of projected HICP inflation (about
2 percent) and projected labor productivity growth (also about 2 percent), the staff suggested
that increases in global energy prices and mortgage costs should not be allowed feed into
wage growth.

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Economic performance remains impressive, though in recent years growth
became increasingly reliant on house building and competitiveness eroded somewhat. In
2006, real GNP growth was the fastest in the EU15 and the unemployment rate among the
lowest in advanced economies. Ireland’s remarkable performance continues to be
underpinned by outward-oriented policies, prudent fiscal policy, low taxes on labor and
business income, and labor market flexibility. However, rapid increases in house prices and a
boom in residential construction have been accompanied by surging credit to property-related
sectors, inflationary pressures, and a deteriorating external current account balance. While

7

Report 05/370, 2005.

20
still broadly appropriate, competitiveness has eroded. Ireland’s real effective exchange rate is
now close to, but perhaps slightly above, its equilibrium value.
28.
Rising euro area interest rates have prompted a welcome cooling of the housing
market, which will help to rebalance growth, though there is a risk of a sharper
slowdown. As residential investment winds down and house completions return to a more
sustainable level, real GNP growth is projected to slow considerably by 2008. This will
dampen inflationary pressures and narrow the current account deficit. However, risks to
growth from the housing market and the global economy are tilted to the downside. If these
risks crystallize, growth could slow more sharply, with potentially adverse effects on
government revenue and the financial sector. Over the medium term, strong fundamentals are
expected to drive robust growth.
29.
Fiscal stabilizers have ample room to operate fully, but discretionary measures
that weaken the underlying fiscal position should be avoided. Fiscal performance in 2006
was very strong, though the fiscal stimulus in 2007 is unfortunate, in light of inflationary
pressures and the widening current account deficit. In 2008, on unchanged policies, some
weakening of the fiscal position due to the cooling housing market is likely. Given the
uncertainty about the size of the decline in revenue from the cooling housing market, this is
the time to preserve a strong underlying fiscal position by restraining current spending
increases to nominal GDP growth and avoiding tax cuts. Over the medium term, fiscal policy
should focus on improving the quality of spending and modernizing property-related taxes.
30.
Looking further ahead, Ireland’s current demographic sweet spot is already
passing. The authorities’ coverage of long-term fiscal issues in the budget and their
commitment to improve public understanding of these issues are therefore welcome.
Consideration of future pension policy needs to include a review of the state pensionable age
in line with rising life expectancy, the contributions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund,
and the level of private saving for retirement, with a view to encouraging a better approach to
long-term pension planning.
31.
The key challenge for the financial authorities is to maintain the soundness of
the financial system. Banks have large exposures to the property market, but stress tests
suggest that cushions are adequate to cover a range of shocks. The Financial Regulator’s
general approach—which aims to prioritize supervisory resources across sectors based on
risk profile—is appropriate. The introduction of a new liquidity management framework for
banks and the improvement in the capacity for insurance supervision are important steps
forward. Looking ahead, continued careful monitoring of banks’ risk management practices,
including for commercial property lending, is essential. The envisaged upgrading of the
stress-testing framework and the commitment to continue to improve supervision are
welcome.
32.
Wage moderation and labor market flexibility are essential to minimizing the
expected rise in unemployment and seizing new growth opportunities. Both the

21
implementation of the current social partnership agreement and the forthcoming public sector
pay benchmarking exercise should avoid adding to wage pressures.
33.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix II. Ireland: Sustainability Exercise
Fiscal Sustainability
General government net debt (defined as gross debt minus the assets of the National Pensions
Reserve Fund and the Social Insurance Fund) is low. Under the baseline scenario, net debt
declines from 12 percent of GDP in 2006 to 6 percent of GDP by 2012 as the primary balance is
projected to remain in surplus and GDP growth is expected to exceed the average real interest
rate throughout this period.
The sustainability of the fiscal position over the next five years is assessed under alternative
scenarios regarding key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions, as well as several bound tests
(Table A1 and Figure A1). The medium-term fiscal position is resilient to a variety of shocks.
The worst outcome—a rise in the debt ratio to 16 percent in 2012—is achieved under the
assumption that there is a negative shock to real GDP growth.
However, in the long run, the projected increase in age-related spending will put pressure on
public finances and substantial adjustment would be required to prevent debt from rising sharply
(see Box 3).
External Sustainability
External sustainability does not appear to be an issue in Ireland (Table A2). The net international
investment position is in a moderate deficit against a backdrop of very large FDI flows into
Ireland over the past decade. Ireland’s role as an international financial center implies large gross
external assets and liabilities. In 2005, gross external assets amounted to about 1,000 percent of
GDP, compared to about 400 percent of GDP in the United Kingdom and 100 percent of GDP in
the United States. The large gross positions generate significant volatility in the components of
the net external position. Over 1998–2005, the standard deviation of the net foreign direct
investment position, the net portfolio investment position, and the net other investment position
were 26 percentage points of GDP, 22 percentage points of GDP, and 31 percentage points of
GDP, respectively. As a result, changes in the net international investment position are
dominated by factors other than the current account deficit.
The composition of the external position implies a large negative net income flow in the current
account. The large stock of inward foreign direct investment, which reflects the substantial
presence of multinationals, earns a high rate of return (about 20 percent on average during
2000–05).
The 2006 FSAP Update noted that the large gross assets and liabilities in portfolio and other
investments associated with Ireland’s role as an international financial center do not appear to
pose a systemic risk to the domestic financial system.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions
Ireland’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.
Ireland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under
Decision No. 144 (52/51).

Article IV Consultations
The discussions for the last Article IV consultation were conducted in Dublin during
May 10–17, 2006. The staff report (Country Report No. 06/293) was considered by

3
the Executive Board on July 26, 2006 (EBM/06/69). Article IV consultations with
Ireland are on the standard 12–month cycle.

Annex II. Ireland: Statistical Issues
Data provision is overall adequate for surveillance purposes. Ireland is subject to the
statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European
Central Bank (ECB). It has also subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS).
1.
The consumer price index is published monthly. The weights were updated in 2006,
and are to be updated every 5 years. Quarterly national accounts are currently published
within 3 months of its reference period. Real sector data are sometimes published with a lag
of 3–6 months, but some non-SDDS series even one and a half years later (e.g., household
disposable income). Employment, earnings, unit wage costs, and national income and
expenditure data are usually available with a 3 month lag. Ireland does not have an overall
earnings index or comprehensive sectoral balance sheet data.
2.
While the authorities publish Exchequer returns on a monthly and quarterly basis,
only annual data on the general government balance are currently available.
3.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and
are based on statistical surveys combined with administrative data. These data are closely
integrated with the compilation of national accounts and are in line with the Balance of
Payments Manual, 5th edition (BPM5). However, the historical data cover only years starting
from 1998, because of improvements in coverage of the International Financial Service
Center and other methodological changes that were introduced for that year. Exports and
imports data from the national accounts and the balance of payments differ due to different
treatments of financial services in the European System of Accounts 1995 and BPM5, but can
be reconciled.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
IRELAND
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by European Department
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Michael Hadjimichael
September 11, 2007
1.
This supplement provides an update on developments since the staff report was
issued. These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
While recent economic developments in Ireland have been consistent with the staff
report, the global outlook has weakened. As discussed in the staff report and a Selected
Issues Paper, Ireland is vulnerable to spillovers from the United States. This likely reflects
not just the impact on merchandise exports, but also the impact on exports of business and
financial services and substantial U.S. foreign direct investment in Ireland. In light of the
changes to the partner-country growth forecasts, notably those of the United States and the
euro area, the projection for Ireland’s real GDP growth in 2008 has been marked down from
3½ percent to 3 percent. A full set of revised tables is attached. Risks to the forecast from the
Irish housing market and the global economy remain on the downside.
3.
Nonetheless, assuming that global financial market conditions stabilize in the coming
months, the adverse effect of the recent turbulence on Ireland’s economic prospects should
be modest. Irish financial institutions have zero to moderate exposure to U.S. subprime
mortgages. Where the exposure is moderate, it is small compared to capital or operating
profit. The fall in Irish banks’ stock prices and the widening of their credit spreads have been
of about the same magnitudes as those of other major European banks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Ireland
On September 14, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ireland.1
Background
Economic performance remains very strong, supported by sound policies. The growth rate of
real GNP per capita continues to be one of the highest among advanced economies and the
unemployment rate one of the lowest. However, in recent years, economic growth became
more reliant on house building and competitiveness eroded. Rapidly rising house prices were
accompanied by surging bank credit to property-related sectors, strong wage growth and
inflation measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) above the euro area
average, and a deterioration in the current account balance. The rise in euro area interest rates
since late 2005 has prompted a significant fall in the growth of residential investment and
declines in house prices in recent months.
Following a decade of close-to-balance-or-surplus fiscal positions, the general government
surplus rose to almost 3 percent of GDP in 2006 and net debt fell to 12 percent of GDP. The
better-than-expected fiscal outturn reflected mainly the strength of property-related revenues, as
well as a small decline in government expenditure relative to GDP. To prepare for the projected
rise in age-related spending over the long term, the government is setting aside every year 1
percent of GNP in a National Pensions Reserve Fund.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The banking system continues to perform well, but rapid credit growth has led to vulnerabilities.
The banking system is well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid, and nonperforming loans are low.
However, bank lending to construction and real estate firms amounts to 47 percent of GDP.
Most lending to households is at variable rates and household debt amounts to 160 percent of
household disposable income. At the same time, loan growth has outstripped deposit growth, so
banks have become more reliant on wholesale funding.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended Ireland’s continued impressive economic performance,
characterized by one of the highest growth rates of GNP per capita among advanced countries
and one of the lowest unemployment rates. This performance has been underpinned by
outward-oriented policies, prudent fiscal policy, low taxes, and labor market flexibility.
Given the Irish economy’s strong fundamentals and the authorities’ commitment to sound
policies, Directors expected economic growth to remain robust over the medium term. At the
same time, however, a number of downside risks will need careful attention in the period ahead.
Directors pointed to inflationary pressures in the context of an economy that is operating at or
above full capacity, declining competitiveness and a widening current account deficit, a
deterioration in global financial market conditions and the growth outlook of the United States,
and the adjustment to a cooling of the housing market. Directors underscored that rapid house
price increases and a boom in residential construction have been an important driver of growth
and bank lending. While the slowdown of the housing sector has been gradual so far, and will
help to rebalance growth and contain inflationary pressures, a sharper correction in house
prices could significantly slow economic growth.
Directors commended Ireland’s sustained strong fiscal performance, and the authorities’ firm
commitment to fiscal discipline over the medium term. Many Directors, however, saw the
planned reduction in the fiscal surplus in 2007 as an undesirable pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus,
while acknowledging Ireland’s pressing need to increase infrastructure and social spending, and
the leeway to do so provided by the strong fiscal position. Looking ahead to 2008, Directors
cautioned against discretionary measures that would weaken the underlying fiscal position.
They encouraged the authorities to restrain current expenditure growth and to continue to focus
on improving the quality of public spending through cost-benefit analysis. They also welcomed
the decision to establish a Commission to review the tax system.
Over the long term, Directors considered the projected increase in age-related spending to be
the most important fiscal challenge. They concurred that Ireland is well-placed to meet this
challenge, noting that the authorities have been preparing for it, and welcomed the forthcoming
Green Paper on Pension Policy. They agreed that a combination of measures is preferable to a
policy based solely on increasing social security contribution rates. In this regard, Directors saw
merit in reviewing the state pensionable age and the level of contributions to the National
Pensions Reserve Fund, and strengthening incentives for private savings. They also supported
the authorities’ commitment to improve public understanding of fiscal challenges.

3
Directors welcomed the indicators confirming the soundness of the Irish banking system,
including the stress tests suggesting that cushions are adequate to cover a range of shocks
even in the face of large exposures to the property market. Nevertheless, financial sector
vulnerabilities, including those arising from high household indebtedness and rising interest
rates, require continued supervisory vigilance. In this context, Directors commended the
progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment
Program update. They called for continued careful monitoring of banks’ risk management
practices, including those pertaining to commercial property lending. Directors supported the
envisaged upgrading of the stress-testing framework and the commitment to continue to
improve supervision.
Directors stressed that preserving and enhancing Ireland’s external competitiveness will be key
to underpinning future growth prospects. To this end, wages should continue to grow in line with
productivity, and increases in global energy prices and mortgage costs should not be allowed to
feed into wage growth. Directors recommended that both the implementation of the current
social partnership agreement and the forthcoming public sector pay benchmarking exercise
avoid adding to wage pressures. Directors underlined the importance of labor market flexibility
in facilitating adjustment to the cooling housing market.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
