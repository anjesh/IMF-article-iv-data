TIMOR-LESTE
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 7, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is very dependent on natural resources. Government spending,
funded by oil exports, has driven rapid non-oil GDP growth but with high inflation, a loss
of competitiveness, and weak employment generation. The political situation is relatively
stable with elections in 2012 and the long-term UN presence has ended but fragilities
persist as poverty remains high. The Strategic Development Plan guides policies, aiming
for upper middle-income status and significant poverty reduction by 2030.
Outlook and Risks. Non-oil GDP growth should average around 8 percent assuming
structural reforms to catalyze the private sector and a sustainable fiscal stance. Key risks
are: (i) fiscal slippages risk sustainability and inflation remains high, hampering
diversification and poverty reduction; (ii) no agreement on the development of a major
new oil field leads to the end of oil production by 2024; and (iii) lack of inclusiveness and
poverty reduction results in social discontent and pressures for expansionary policies.
Policy assessment. Policy discussions focused on shifting to a higher quality and
poverty reducing growth path with stability and sustainability. Policy challenges include:


Ensuring a sustainable level of public spending that is well targeted on projects with
high socio-economic returns and calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures and
improve competitiveness.



Developing an asset-liability management framework linking debt accumulation with
the Petroleum Fund; avoiding off-balance sheet and non-concessional liabilities.



Enacting structural reforms to create an enabling environment, promote access to
finance, provide basic infrastructure, and investment in human capital.



Strengthening the Banco Central de Timor-Leste’s prudential and supervisory
regime, preparing a crisis management framework, and developing a strategy for the
financial system to support inclusive growth. Full dollarization remains appropriate
for now given limited capacity for independent monetary and exchange rate policies.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

CONTEXT
1.
Timor-Leste has made substantial progress in overcoming the difficult challenges it has
faced as a sovereign nation. A number of key milestones have been achieved as it enters its second
decade as a sovereign nation. The 13 year UN presence was concluded successfully in 2012 and
parliamentary and presidential elections were held in mid-2012, with Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão
re-elected to head a coalition government. A Strategic Development Plan (SDP) to guide Timor-Leste
to upper middle-income status and a significant reduction in poverty by 2030 started in 2011. TimorLeste is a founding member of the g7+ group of 18 fragile and conflict-affected countries and has
taken a leadership role, pioneering the New Deal approach that is consistent with its SDP (Box 1).
Developmental partners including the IFIs and bilateral donors have worked collaboratively with the
Timorese authorities on policies and operational reforms required to achieve the goals of the SDP
and New Deal.
2.
Nevertheless fragilities remain. Timor-Leste is one of the most natural resource dependent
countries in the world with large developmental needs. Oil revenues have been used to promote
development but reserves with production agreements will end in 2024 and many uncertainties
persist over potential production from new fields (Box 2).1 Diversification is crucial to generate much
needed employment and poverty reduction. The government has scaled up expenditures with the
aim of kick starting the non-oil sector and developing forward and backward linkages from oil
production. However, higher spending has faced significant capacity and absorptive constraints and
has led to inefficiencies, the emergence of rent seeking behavior, and persistently high inflation that
hurts the poor and undermines long-term growth.
3.
Governance frameworks are in place but policy implementation capacity is limited.
There is a relatively strong governance framework that promotes accountability with an active civil
society. A well regarded Petroleum Fund (PF) has assets equivalent to over two times GDP and is
compliant with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Santiago Principles with firm
parliamentary oversight. Oil revenues are solely channeled through the PF and withdrawals are
limited by law to the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI) that is calculated as 3 percent of estimated
oil wealth—although excess withdrawals are allowed under certain circumstances. Under this fiscal
rules based approach, expenditures are constrained by the ESI and non-oil revenues. Given full
dollarization, this serves as the nominal anchor. Policy making is conducted by a small technocratic
elite but implementation capacity is weak, constraining the effectiveness of policies and outcomes.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The non-oil economy has grown rapidly averaging over 12 percent from 2008 to 2011
allowing per capita incomes to steadily increase.2 Domestic demand was driven by the rapid

GDP data for 2012 have yet to be released. The authorities projected non-oil growth of 10.6 percent (in the 2013
Budget Book). Staff expects a downward trend in the growth momentum due to a significant under-spending on

increases in government current and capital spending that also fueled high import growth. On the
supply side, growth was led by sectors that were highly dependent on government spending such as
construction. Conversely, the contributions from labor intensive sectors such as agriculture and
manufacturing have been weak. As a result, living standards appear not to have increased in line
with GDP growth indicating a lack of inclusion (Box 3).
5.
Despite full dollarization, inflation has risen, touching 15.4 percent in 2011. Inflation
moderated in 2012 but is still running at well over 10 percent –much higher than in other fully
dollarized economies. Initially the high inflation was driven by high international commodity prices
(in dollar terms). More recently it appears to reflect the interaction of strong demand led by
government recurrent expenditures and structural bottlenecks (Box 4).
6.
High levels of government spending have risked sustainability but revised budgetary
plans in 2013 now anticipate a substantial moderation. Persistently large non-oil deficits at over
70 percent of non-oil GDP have been funded by the PF with large excess withdrawals at over
100 percent of the ESI justified by the policy of scaling up investment to promote development. The
2012 and 2013 budgets set out very ambitious spending plans with expenditures stabilizing at
around $2 billion to 2018. This would be more than double the revenue from the ESI and non-oil
taxes necessitating high levels of excess withdrawals from the PF and borrowing on concessional
terms. Continuation of these trends would not be sustainable as net public sector assets would
steadily fall (see the accompanying DSA). However, preliminary 2012 data show a significant underspending on capital items due to capacity constraints but a continued rise in current spending. The
unsustainable nature of the ambitious plans has now been recognized by the authorities and, in the
revised medium-term budgetary plans (the so-called “Yellow Road” process), adopted by the Council
of Ministers in June 2013, spending plans were significantly scaled back, starting in 2013.3

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The medium-term growth outlook will hinge on the pace of fiscal consolidation, the
reprioritization of expenditures, and sound implementation of structural reforms. These are
required to expedite the transition to higher quality private sector led growth. Given the declining
trend of oil production, overall GDP growth will be weak and volatile but real non-oil GDP (which
directly affects living standards and can be influenced by policies) should average around
8.5 percent—significantly lower than the double digit rates experienced from 2008 to 2011.
However, with the right policies, lower growth will be of a higher quality with sustainable job
creation and poverty alleviation and more inclusive and broad-based growth. Under the baseline
capital projects with a projection of around 8 percent. However, there are downside risks given the considerable
statistical uncertainties, especially relating to agricultural production and other hard-to-measure private sector
activities. The end of the UN peacekeeping role may have had a more significant second round impact on growth
than the headline numbers would imply.
3

The Yellow Road process is an internal discussion of budgetary plans, albeit with contributions from outside parties,
and was conducted just before the mission. In the process, the overall expenditure envelope has been substantially
reduced compared to the original 2013 budget plans. The reprioritization of expenditures is still underway.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

scenario the reprioritization of government expenditures and reforms would boost the private
sector, with a pickup in agricultural and manufacturing growth plus robust growth in private services
providing an offset to the declining contribution from public administration and construction. As a
result inflation would fall and real living standards rise. A higher growth scenario in which non-oil
GDP growth averages over 10 percent might be achievable if deeper reforms and expeditious
implementation of basic infrastructure projects induce a strong private sector investment response.
8.
Given the environment, there are a number of downside risks. A weaker pace of
structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, and poor implementation of basic infrastructure projects
(especially roads and ports) would lead to a slower growth path, especially if the weaker reform
environment and high inflation result in a poor private sector investment response. Spillovers from
adverse global developments would likely have a relatively limited impact in the short term given the
low integration into global (non-oil) trade and investment networks. The impact of short-term oil
price volatility on the budget is smoothed by the ESI rule. However, longer-term global economic
instability and/or a permanent fall in oil (and especially) gas prices would undermine the oil sector’s
prospects and reduce inward investment. The resulting fall in net oil wealth, and thus the ESI, would
necessitate a tighter fiscal stance and slower GDP growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Policy discussions focused on the challenge of shifting to a higher quality growth path.
Given the large developmental needs amid persistently high poverty levels and the emergence of
macroeconomic imbalances, policies need to evolve. Consistent with the objectives of the SDP and
the Fragility Assessment conducted under the New Deal, this will involve three broad elements.
Firstly, the fiscal policy challenge of reining in public expenditure to that consistent with the
authorities’ fiscal rule, improving its quality to promote inclusive growth through changes in the
composition of spending, and diversifying revenues. Secondly, the complementary reforms needed
to catalyze the private sector to induce more labor-intensive growth that reduces poverty. Thirdly,
financial sector development to support a higher quality growth path driven by the private sector;
this will require, inter alia, better access to finance and improved regulation and supervision.

A. Bolstering the Macroeconomic Framework
10.
The high government spending in recent years has led to macroeconomic imbalances
as well as unbalanced growth and a lack of inclusion. These macroeconomic imbalances have
been manifest in a number of ways including very high non-oil fiscal deficits, inflation stabilizing at
high levels, an erosion of sustainability, and a significant decline in competitiveness. Although data
limitations and uncertainties over future resource production limit the scope for macroeconomic
balance type analysis, high inflation, the appreciation of the REER, the very low level of non-resource
exports, lack of foreign direct investment in labor intensive sectors, and rising imports suggest that
the underlying exchange rate is overvalued. In a fully dollarized economy, this indicates that the
fiscal stance has been too expansionary given absorptive capacities.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

Unsustainable debt dynamics and persistently high inflation
11.
Continuation of recent expenditure trends is not sustainable. Staff’s analysis of potential
illustrative scenarios indicates that a continuation of the 2013 budget plans that included high
excess withdrawals from the PF would significantly run down the net assets of the public sector (Text
Table 1, scenario A) whereas strict adherence to the authorities fiscal rule (scenario B) is fully
sustainable. Given that after 2024, investment income derived from the PF would be the main source
of revenue, a continuation of expenditure trends in excess of investment income would lead to a
depletion of net assets as debts steadily rise and assets fall. In addition, inflation has resulted from
high levels of government spending especially on current items including transfers. This has reduced
competitiveness, hampering employment generation, undermining social cohesiveness and
generally exacerbating fragilities as the poor are hurt the most.
12.
Staff welcomed the revised budgetary plans that anticipate a stabilization of public
expenditure (Figure 1). Under this framework, budgeted expenditure (excluding donor projects)
would stabilize at around $1.3 billion in the medium term compared with around $2 billion in the
original 2013 budget. On the revenue side, non-oil revenues are targeted to increase by 15 percent a
year from a low base with more intensive tax reforms. As a result, the non-oil fiscal deficit steadily
falls from a budgeted 92 percent in 2013 to 27.5 percent by 2018.
13.
Full and consistent implementation of these measures will ensure the sustainability of
the fiscal position and the value of the Petroleum Fund preserving inter-generational equity.
Under the Yellow Road baseline, the authorities’ fiscal rule will be met and borrowing needs would
steadily fall and end by 2023 (scenario C). This would allow external and public debt to remain
sustainable (Supplement 1). Lower expenditures and higher non-oil revenues mean that the non-oil
funding gap would steadily fall and so excess withdrawals from the PF and/or debt accumulation
would fall over time. This allows the value of the PF to stabilize in the medium term. The more
restrained fiscal policy now envisaged would also help dampen inflationary pressures curtailing the
recent trend of substantial appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.
Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities agreed with the staff analysis on the unsustainable and inflationary
nature of the budgetary plans and have built a consensus on the need for restraint. Officials
noted that the ramp up of spending in recent years has produced positive results e.g. the installation
of the national electricity grid, but recognized that capacity constraints have been reached in
spending ever increasing budgeted funds. They were particularly concerned that the scope for rent
seeking activities has increased.
15.
The new expenditure plans focus on projects that have a clear impact on poverty
reduction (e.g. basic infrastructure and human capital development) while maintaining valuefor-money and the elimination of waste. The authorities recognized that moving to higher quality
growth that is consistent with the SDP objectives of inclusive and non inflationary economic
development and with the aspirations of the New Deal would be best served through deeper
structural reforms and a focus on creating an enabling environment. The fact that the Council of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Ministers has approved the new stance is an important sign that there is political consensus on this
approach. This will help to minimize the risks of fiscal slippages in years ahead.

B. Fiscal Policy
Expenditure Choices
16.
The new budget framework implies a sharply lower spending path than that envisaged
in the 2013 budget plans. After significant under-spending in 2012 especially on capital items but a
continued rise in current spending, expenditures will be stabilized at around current levels and will
fall in GDP terms. The revised plans will provide an opportunity to improve the overall quality of
expenditure that is consistent with promoting efficiency and inclusive poverty reducing growth as
per the SDP and provide rapid and sustainable benefits in terms of high growth and job creation.
These effects could come through: (i) a greater prioritization of public investment on projects that
will generate sustainable employment generation in the private sector (especially on basic
infrastructure such as roads and ports plus human capital enhancing projects especially on health
and education); and (ii) a more general focus on value for money in budget planning and execution.
However, realizing the new expenditure path will require some difficult policy choices:
Capital expenditures: there will be a trade-off between greater spending on high profile capitalintensive projects and increased funding of basic infrastructure (roads, port and airport) with
direct links to export and high employment generating sectors (Box 5).

Recurrent expenditures: the challenge will be to restrain the growth of the wage bill and better
target subsidies and transfers to generate space for much needed higher spending on
operations and maintenance and provisions of essential supplies in health and education. It will
be important to contain electricity subsidies as these could well rise sharply as consumption will
increase in line with newly installed capacity. Nevertheless, cuts to subsidies and transfers will
need to be at a measured pace given the need to maintain social cohesion.

17.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to raise non-oil revenues and continued reform
of public financial management. On the revenue side, the main priorities are to support revenue
diversification and strengthen the capacity in tax administration to limit tax evasion. The former
would be based on the introduction of new taxes e.g., a VAT in line with recent FAD TA advice. This
would broaden the tax base, raise buoyancy, and limit the dependence on (declining) oil revenues.
The main impediment to the introduction of VAT so far has been poor capacity at the Ministry of
Finance (MoF). This is being addressed through staffing reforms but further TA on implementation
would be useful. It is important to ensure that customers pay equitably for electricity usage as the de
facto large subsidy will rise as new capacity is utilized. There has been progress made in
strengthening expenditure and cash management at the MoF. The next step is to strengthen budget
planning and implementation capacity in line ministries. TA donors are working with the MoF on
these areas.
Developing an Asset-Liability Management Framework
18.
The government will need a strong asset-liability management framework as its
balance sheet becomes more complex. In the period ahead, the government is planning to take
on new debt liabilities and enter into public-private partnerships (PPPs) that may generate
contingent liabilities.4 On the asset side, there are plans for government and/or government owned
entities to take equity positions in major capital projects. Key considerations are:


Public debt. Contracting concessional debt from developmental partners is beneficial as it could
improve the quality and returns of capital projects. Non-concessional debt should be avoided.



Off-budget investments. Major capital-intensive projects tend to have complex financing
structures and the cost-benefit of public participation in these projects can be difficult to assess.
All such projects should be transparent and subject to the full scrutiny of the Major Projects
Secretariat and the Audit Court whose capacity needs to be strengthened. Off-balance sheet
liabilities, including by state owned companies should be avoided.



Petroleum Fund. The revised Petroleum Fund Law allows a shift in strategic asset allocation away
from high quality bonds toward global equities with a 50:50 split allowed with an intention to
maximize returns. This may be appropriate from a long-term inter-generational perspective, but
the risk-return trade-offs in inherently volatile global financial markets need to be carefully
considered. The new provision to allow the PF to guarantee government debts (up to 10 percent
of the PF’s assets) is potentially risky and should be avoided as should any domestic investments.

4

PPP projects currently under development comprise the new Dili Port and the enhancement of Dili Airport. These
are both important projects, with the PPP tender for the new Port at Tibar Bay launched in August 2013 and work ongoing for the airport. The authorities are working with IFC. The details have yet to be finalized but it is estimated that
investment in the Port will be $300-400 million with significant private sector participation. The overall size of the
airport project is not yet finalized but the expected level of private investment is likely to be much smaller.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities agreed that a reprioritization of expenditures is warranted. This would
align expenditures with the SDP’s key objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable growth while
reducing waste, increasing value-for-money and improving employment generation. Particular focus
is planned on reducing subsidies especially regarding the electricity sector, limiting transfers, and on
civil service reforms. The capital budget will also be assessed much more carefully to prioritize key
projects that have high rates of return and employment generation but the scope of the Tasi Mane
project (Box 5) has yet to be fully determined. The MoF plans to raise non-oil tax revenues through
better administration and the introduction of a VAT in line with recent Fund TA. Measures to
improve capacity in tax administration are underway and this will smooth the introduction of the
VAT.

C. Boosting Growth by Catalyzing the Private Sector
20.
Given fiscal retrenchment, growth can only come through private sector development
requiring steps to improve competitiveness and address structural bottlenecks. The “organic”
private sector that is not linked to government contracts remains very small. Impediments to private
sector development include low human capital, bureaucratic obstacles, lack of contract enforcement,
and limited access to finance. This pattern reflects structural problems and a number of binding
legacy issues as well as the existence of “Dutch disease” type issues. The government has several
initiatives underway to boost quickly the private sector and stimulate entrepreneurship including the
establishment of a one-stop shop for new businesses and the development of PPPs.
21.
Staff argued that the pervasive state role needs to be carefully managed within a
sound governance framework and based on sound cost-benefit assessments. Developing the
fundamental prerequisites for growth and creating an enabling environment and complementary
infrastructure are vital for private sector development. Some steps could be done relatively quickly in
order to allow a more rapid transmission of growth to the overall population. This is particularly so in
the agricultural sector where new and better maintained roads, irrigation facilities, and technical
training could produce an immediate supply response. Staff noted that the international experience
with establishing institutions to promote development such as special economic zones (SEZs) and
development banks is mixed with successful outcomes focusing on overcoming clear market failures
with proper governance, full transparency and accountability. Staff noted that the priority should be
to extend required key reforms across the country rather than partially through the establishment of
SEZs. Regarding the development bank, considerable work will be needed to build the institutional
and operational capacity to ensure that this would operate efficiently and without risking the public
sector balance sheet. TA, especially from countries that have had successful track records regarding
SEZs and developmental banks, would be useful.
22.
With regard to labor cost competitiveness, the key priority is to reduce general and
wage inflation in the economy. Lower spending plans will facilitate this, but minimum wage levels
in Timor-Leste should be brought in line with peers in the ASEAN region as they now are at levels
that discourage foreign investment in labor intensive sectors. In addition, progress is needed
regarding:
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE



Logistics. Investment in basic transport infrastructure (roads, ports, and airport) remain a high
priority requiring a mix of investment strategies covering self funded, donor funded, and PPPs.



Structural Reforms. Priorities include implementation of the Land Law, improving the investment
climate by reducing red tape, streamlining the Investment Law, and increasing legal certainty
especially with regard to contract enforcement.

Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agreed that the private sector needs to develop and become
independent of the government. There was widespread recognition that reliance on government
contracts led to rent seeking type behavior and inefficiencies. However, the authorities were
confident that recent steps such as the establishment of a one-stop shop for investors and the PPP
financed airport and port projects will encourage considerable foreign investment that will, in turn
induce domestic investment in areas such as cement production. The authorities noted that these
developments will help boost growth prospects offsetting the contractionary fiscal impulse.

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
24.
The use of the U.S. dollar remains appropriate. This implies that to improve
competitiveness that has been eroded by high inflation a restrained fiscal stance is required. Longerterm, the SDP raises the possibility of Timor-Leste introducing its own national currency. The pros
and cons of any reform to the exchange rate arrangement will need to be carefully considered. Staff
noted that analytically, there are two separate although interrelated issues, viz.: (i) issuing a national
currency; and (ii) the exchange rate arrangement with a wide spectrum of options. Issuance of a new
national currency that is linked to the US dollar in a hard peg arrangement (for instance, a currency
board) would have conceptual similarities to the present arrangement of full dollarization. Softer
pegs or more flexible arrangements would imply more space for independent monetary policy and
act as a buffer in case of oil shocks.
25.
However, such moves would require a number of institutional and operational
prerequisites including the sustained enhancement of the BCTL capacities. These would
inevitably take considerable time to be implemented. In any case, a sound and prudent fiscal policy
is needed and the consistent adherence to the Yellow Road framework is a positive step. The
introduction of the 100 centavo coin (replacing the one U.S. dollar note) and its usage will be a
useful learning experience for the BCTL as it assesses potentially more fundamental innovations.
Authorities’ Views
26.
There was no firm view within government on the need to move away from full
dollarization. It was uniformly accepted that it is too early for any fundamental change and that
further research is needed on the various options. MoF officials noted that the prudent fiscal stance
as set out in the Yellow Road process would help restore competitiveness in tandem with the
provision of basic infrastructure and structural reforms that will lower the high cost base. The BCTL

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

described on-going work with partner central banks on the theoretical and practical issues regarding
the introduction of a currency and the most appropriate long-term exchange rate arrangement.

E. Financial Policies
27.
The financial sector remains small with low penetration rates and limited access to
finance for the private sector. The banking sector comprises four banks and a number of micro
credit institutions. Three banks are branches of international banks (from Australia, Indonesia, and
Portugal) and there is one local bank (that is government owned) that was recently upgraded from a
micro credit institution—it is the only bank with its own capital base. Banks maintain substantial
excess liquidity that is placed abroad as lending is problematic. Judicial enforcement of problem
loans is poor and NPLs are high, especially at one particular bank as the result of problems
associated with the political violence in 2006. Reflecting high risks, interest rate spreads are wide.
28.
Safeguarding the soundness of the banking system will become increasingly important
as it grows and develops. The main priority is to continue to strengthen prudential supervision,
including the development of a crisis management framework. The placement of most of the deposit
base overseas with parent banks raises country, counterparty, and concentration risks. It will be
important to avoid the risks inherent in lending to priority sectors through the state-owned bank.
Progress in enhancing the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
framework as identified by the mutual evaluation conducted by the Asia/Pacific Group on Money
Laundering in 2012 will also be important. Key actions include the enactment of appropriate
legislation, the establishment of a Financial Intelligence Unit, and the mobilization of the anti-money
laundering framework to further support the authorities’ anti-corruption efforts.
Authorities’ Views
29.
There was general agreement that the financial system has not supported growth and
policies need to be put in place to create the incentives for lending. These include legal changes
such as the introduction of the Land Law to boost the mortgage market and enacting a law on
electronic banking, institutional changes such as modernizing the payments system, and improving
the oversight role of the BCTL. A new Financial Sector Master Plan will address the weaknesses.
Senior management at the BCTL agreed that an increased engagement with the Fund would be
useful and requested a TA Needs Assessment mission to identify priority areas for enhancement.

F. Other Issues
Developing Official Statistics
30.
Data shortcomings due to limited capacity hinder analysis but there are notable strides
in putting in place key data series and statistical reporting is steadily improving. National
income accounts to 2011 are now available for the first time but substantial ongoing revisions and
lack of timeliness limit the analysis of trends and structural changes. The inflation methodology has
been substantially improved but more work needs to be done regarding the accuracy and timeliness
of poverty data. Work is on-going to improve fiscal reporting in line with GFSM 2001. Staff
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

welcomed the participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in October
2012. This will help develop the statistical system supported by continued TA from the Fund in
collaboration with other donors.
TA Needs
31.
Despite high TA delivery, the next step, consistent with the New Deal’s focus on
country ownership, is to boost knowledge transfer and avoid over dependence on expatriate
staff. TA has been received in many policy and operational areas and the IFIs have worked
collaboratively alongside bilateral donors in line with the objectives of the SDP. The IMF has
provided high levels of TA to the MoF and the BCTL in core macroeconomic areas; the WB has
recently concluded its Country Partnership Strategy that is fully aligned with the goals of the SDP;
and the ADB is, inter alia, supporting the development of key infrastructure and human capital
enhancing projects. To facilitate knowledge transfer and lower dependency, the training of local
officials is vital. The conference on natural resource management held in Dili in September 2013, cohosted by the IMF with the ADB, JICA, and the WBG provided a good opportunity to highlight
international experience and best practices.
32.
The IMF stands ready to continue to provide the authorities with technical assistance in
its areas of expertise. In addition to the assistance to the BCTL to strengthen supervision, planned
technical assistance includes on estimating the ESI and Petroleum Fund asset management.
Assistance on the development of an asset-liability management framework would be useful. The
authorities also requested TA on integrating national accounts and the balance of payments, in
addition to continued TA on developing the statistics infrastructure and on fiscal reporting.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The strategic challenge is to convert oil wealth into long-term sustainable growth,
generating broad based increases in living standards—essential given the high poverty rate.
After six years of strong non-oil GDP growth driven by large increases in public expenditure, the next
step is to generate a shift to higher-quality growth in which an organic private sector, operating
independently from government contracts, takes the lead. This is required as the economy needs to
generate employment opportunities for a fast growing labor force to ensure broad based poverty
reduction and as the government has reached capacity limits in productively spending more.
34.
Staff welcomed the more prudent budgetary plans but stressed that potential
slippages need to be contained. This framework, that is consistent with the SDP’s key objectives,
will: (i) reduce inflationary pressures, help tackle poverty and improve competitiveness; (ii) ensure
sustainability and preserve the PF assets; and (iii) improve the quality of public expenditure. Provided
structural reforms are accelerated, this framework is consistent with strong growth in household
consumption, lower inflation, and declining poverty. Slippages need to be contained to avoid the
risks to sustainability, especially as the outlook for gas prices remains highly uncertain—a sustained
fall would necessitate further fiscal restraint.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

35.
Realizing the new expenditure path will require policy choices. In general, there is a
need to maintain expenditure on high priority programs that can generate sustainable growth and
poverty reduction plus a greater focus on cost-benefit analysis, value-for-money and budgetary
planning and execution. On the capital side, funding of basic infrastructure (roads, port and airport)
should be prioritized over capital-intensive projects with low employment generation. On the
recurrent side, the challenge will be to generate space for much needed higher spending on
operations and maintenance and provision of health and education. This can be done via greater
restraint in the wage bill, and better targeted subsidies and transfers.
36.
To protect wealth for future generations, the government needs to strengthen the
asset-liability management framework as its balance sheet becomes more complex. The
government is planning to take on debt for the first time and enter into PPPs that may generate
contingent liabilities and these need to be comprehensively assessed. On the asset side, plans to
take equity positions in major capital projects need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that public
participation is justified. The shift in strategic asset allocation toward equities by the PF needs to be
properly managed with the priority toward capital preservation rather than maximizing returns.
37.
Catalyzing an organic private sector will become an increasing priority to shift the
economy from public to private-sector led growth. This will require steps to improve
competitiveness and address structural bottlenecks and there are a number of steps that can be
taken that will enhance living standards especially in the rural sector. With regards to labor cost
competitiveness, the key priority is to reduce inflation and ensure that wage levels are in line with
peers in the ASEAN region. Investments in basic transport infrastructure remain a high priority.
Structural reforms need to be advanced and there are a number of institutional and operational
considerations that suggest the piecemeal implementation via SEZs is unlikely to be optimal.
38.
The BCTL needs to enhance its capacity for core central banking activities. In a number
of key areas, the BCTL needs to upgrade its capabilities and the deeper TA engagement with the
Fund is welcome. Safeguarding the soundness of the banking system will become increasingly
important as it develops and TA in this area will be valuable. Regarding the possible move away from
full dollarization, there was agreement that considerable further work is required regarding the pros
and cons of issuing a national currency and the associated exchange rate arrangement. The
introduction of the 100 centavo coin is a welcome step and learning opportunity for the BCTL.
39.
Further work on improving statistical data shortcomings due to capacity constraints is
needed. The production of disaggregated national accounts and improved CPI statistics are positive
steps but their timeliness and accuracy need to be improved. The recent participation in the GDDS is
welcome but the on-going development of a broader range of economic and social indicators,
particularly regarding trends in living standards, would enhance analysis and better guide policies.
40.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Timor-Leste will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

(high, medium or low)

Expected Impact if Threat is Realized
(high, medium or low)

High
The demarcation of the maritime boundary with
Australia is subject to international arbitration that
could take some time to conclude. This will delay key
decisions on the project’s development.

High
Long-term growth prospects would be curtailed as
potential foreign investment flows would be limited.
Lower future revenues means a firm limit on
spending plans to maintain fiscal sustainability.

Medium/High
This could be due to the implementation of capitalintensive projects with overly ambitious cost-benefit
analysis. Strong oil prices may heighten this trend
but relatively strong governance may be an offset.

High
There is a high opportunity cost. Capital-intensive
projects that have limited linkages with the rest of
the economy mean that job creation and poverty
reduction is limited.

Medium
Inability to restrain current expenditures as planned
raise inflation, which is already too high, back to
close to 20 percent as the absorptive capacity of the
economy is limited. This hurts the poor and limits
diversification.
Medium
Instability could break out within the ruling coalition
or through popular protests. These could be
triggered by public perceptions that oil wealth is not
trickling down, not reducing poverty but raising
inequality and corruption.

Medium
High inflation adversely affects the poor leading to
social discontent. Higher subsidies and transfers to
compensate would place pressure on spending as
would higher public sector wages.

Medium
Global economic weaknesses emanating from: (i) a
reemergence of tensions in the euro area; (ii) a
deeper than expected slowdown in emerging
markets: (iii) or a sharp slowdown in China.

Low
These could lead to lower global trade and capital
flows, weak demand for oil and accommodative
monetary policies. The impact is limited by low levels
of non-oil trade and capital account integration.

Medium
This could be triggered by stalled or incomplete
delivery of national and euro area policy
commitments The main banks are foreign branches
of international banks (one is from a eurozone crisis
country) and place high levels of excess liquidity with
their parents.

Medium
Renewed global shocks that affect international
banking operations could impact on local liquidity
conditions.
No crisis management or contingency planning
frameworks are in place.
Prolonged weakness in credit supply would limit
private sector growth and diversification efforts.

Low
Global oil shock triggered by geopolitical events
(driving oil prices to $140 per barrel).
Conversely, low prices for gas could emerge as a
result of technology-induced new global supply.

Medium
PF acts a stabilizer to limit short-term volatility.
However, fiscal discipline may be more difficult in a
high price scenario.
If prices trend downwards, expenditure plans will
need to be scaled back to limit risks to sustainability.

High
Higher rent seeking behavior and more pressures to
raise current expenditures and lower the quality of
public investments.
Foreign investment, vital for new oil production and
diversification may be discouraged.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding

“high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities.

Box 1. The g7+ and Timor-Leste
Timor-Leste is a key member of the g7+ grouping that is becoming increasing influential in
the global development debate. The g7+ was formed in 2010 and comprises 18 countries that
are or have been affected by conflict and are now in transition to the next stage of development.
The main objective of the g7+ is to share and learn from experiences and to argue for reforms to
the way the international community engages in conflict-affected states. The Minister of Finance
of Timor-Leste is currently the Chair of the g7+.
In an important step, the g7+ issued the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States in
Busan, Korea in 2011. This calls for more effective engagement between fragile countries and
developmental partners to support inclusive country-led and country-owned transitions out of
fragility. The New Deal takes an integrated approach to development that prioritizes ownership of
the developmental process as key for successful outcomes. The New Deal has three important
pillars:


Peace-Building and State-Building Goals (PSGs) as the foundation to enable progress
towards the MDGs. This pillar consists of 5 main principles:


Legitimate Politics–fostering inclusive politics and conflict resolution



Security–establishing and strengthening the population’s security



Justice–addressing injustice and increasing access to justice



Economic Foundation–generating employment and improving livelihoods



Revenue and Services–managing revenues and building capacity for better delivery
of government services



New ways of engagement to support inclusive country-led and country-owned transitions
out of fragility; and



Better and more effective management of aid and domestic resources and the alignment
of these resources to achieve the key PSGs.

A number of countries including Timor-Leste are piloting the implementation of the New
Deal in partnership with key donors and the track record will be assessed in 2015. An
important part of this process is the Fragility Assessment that looks at the country’s situation
regarding the PSGs. Timor-Leste was assessed in mid 2012. Key findings were that: Security has
made the biggest improvement; Legitimate Politics and Revenue and Services have made good
progress but more work needs to be done on Justice and Economic Foundations to ensure their
sustained improvement.

Box 2. Recent Developments in the Petroleum Sector
The oil and gas sector is the mainstay of the economy. Although modest by international standards
with production at 65 million barrels of oil (equivalent) per year, the country’s oil and gas resources are
vast compared to its small non-oil GDP. The sector accounts for around 78 percent of GDP and
95 percent of exports of goods and services. Revenues are comprised of a complex set of taxes and
royalties. These are paid into the PF that transfers funds to the government according to a rules based
approach designed to preserve the real value of oil wealth for future generations—the ESI is set at
three percent of the present value of oil wealth (PF assets plus reserves with production agreements)
and is based on conservative assumptions. The flows from the PF account for around 95 percent of
government (non grant) revenues. However, as production is offshore and raw natural gas is piped
from the main Bayu-Undan field to Australia for processing into liquefied natural gas (LNG), the sector
directly accounts for virtually no on-shore employment. Its economic impact is entirely via government
spending.
It is subject to a number of uncertainties. There is a
complex set of interim arrangements for the sharing of
resources in the Timor Sea. Timor-Leste has no maritime
boundaries there, but has three interlocking treaties with
Australia, covering the Joint Petroleum Development Area,
JPDA (currently in production) and the Greater Sunrise area
(as yet undeveloped). The latter is currently subject to
international arbitration to delineate the maritime border.

Production of proven reserves has peaked but Greater
Sunrise, a large new field, has yet to be developed. Overall production in current fields within the
JPDA is estimated to have peaked in 2012 and will likely cease by 2024. The government has recently
established a national oil company, the Timor Gap, which will work with foreign partners on exploration
projects. Production at the Greater Sunrise field is contingent on a number of factors that remain
unresolved, viz.: (i) the finalization of the demarcation of the maritime boundary; and (ii) the decision as
to the handling and processing of the raw natural gas. As the resolution of these factors will take time,
no contribution of the Greater Sunrise field is assumed in the ESI or PF calculation or in any macro
projections by Fund staff or the authorities.
An important implication of the trends in the oil industry
is that inflows from oil revenues into the PF will steadily
decline as output falls. Conversely, the contribution to the PF
assets from investment income will steadily increase, putting a
greater premium on the safety of the assets and on the
strategic asset allocation process.

Box 3. Economic Growth and Living Standards in Timor-Leste
The preparation of disaggregated national accounts data for the first time in 2012 allows a greater
understanding of the performance of the Timorese economy. However, the lack of recent data on
living standards prevents a conclusive analysis on the relationship between growth and poverty
alleviation. The data indicate that the economy has grown rapidly since the onset of the oil sector with
real per capita non-oil income rising at an average of close to 10 percent growth per year between 2007
and 2011 but methodological problems with the recent survey on living standards have prevented
the calculation of a new poverty rate. However, overall living standards appear not to have increased:
for instance, real consumption of food per capita has shown a downward trend—particularly worrisome
given the modest progress toward reducing hunger by half by 2015, which is one of the targets of the
MDGs.
This dichotomy reflects that government spending has boosted the public sector and construction
sector and has been highly import intensive but has had little wider impact. Growth opportunities in
employment intensive sectors such as agriculture (relied on by over 50 percent of households for income)
and labor intensive manufacturing have been hampered meaning limited progress in poverty reduction
especially in rural areas. Inflation has also risen, mainly driven by government spending. This has had a
number of adverse consequences:



Undermining the living standards of the overwhelming majority of the population that are outside
the small formal sector, exacerbating poverty.



Reducing competitiveness and the scope for diversification and the establishment of labor-intensive
manufacturing export sectors that are vital for employment growth and poverty reduction.

A greater focus on poverty reduction will be key under a high quality growth scenario. Provided the
government’s economic strategy focuses on generating sustainable employment growth, especially in
agriculture, manufacturing and services such as tourism, even the lower growth scenarios should
generate a more sustained increase in living standards and reductions in poverty than achieved over the
last decade. Lower inflation as envisaged under the more prudent fiscal framework that is now underway
will also help improve consumption and help boost employment growth as competitiveness is restored.

Box 4. Inflation and Government Spending
Inflation in Timor-Leste has remained in double digits since early 2011 after a long period of
tracking international inflationary trends. Inflation in Timor-Leste was in line with global trends,
consistent with the high import dependence, but rose sharply after 2009 partly driven by higher food
prices. However, food prices in Timor-Leste have not fallen in line with global food prices and continue to
lead headline inflation. Food price inflation was 15.6 percent in June 2013, which is much higher than in
other Asian low income countries.
There is strong evidence that the growth in recurrent expenditure in Timor-Leste has contributed
to high inflation. Statistical analysis suggests a one percent increase in recurrent expenditure as a
percent of GDP causes 0.20 percent increase in the inflation rate This indicates that inflationary pressures
are due to the intersection between excess demand growth driven by an expansionary fiscal policy and a
number of structural barriers to external and internal trade e.g. poor infrastructure including inadequate
transport links that keep prices higher than the global level.
The more restrained medium-term budget framework will help reduce inflationary pressures. The
original 2013 budget called for significant increases in public expenditure that would have exacerbated
inflation; it would have been very unlikely that inflation would have fallen to 7 percent as outlined in the
budget or the 4-6 percent range targeted in the SDP. However, the Yellow Road budget that calls for real
cuts in recurrent expenditures should significantly reduce inflation—staff’s analysis suggests this would
allow inflation to fall toward the targeted level by 2018. The rate of deceleration of inflation would be
boosted by invigorated supply side policies that reduce the high cost structure. These trends will be
positive for poverty reduction and diversification in line with the SDP objectives.

Box 5. Development Strategy and Industrial Policy
The current developmental strategy includes a strong focus on industrialization to attain the key
goals of upper middle income status and reduction in poverty. Diversification is promoted through
the development of the industrial sectors, such as petrochemicals, that leverage off the oil resources. To
achieve these goals, the SDP calls for more activist policies including the creation of an infrastructure
fund, a human capital fund, a number of special economic zones (SEZs), and a development bank. A
national oil company (the Timor Gap) has recently been established.
Integral to these plans is the development of the south coast of Timor-Leste (the Tasi Mane project).
Plans call for the comprehensive development of the area based on the establishment of three industrial
clusters each with a specific focus, supporting infrastructure within new towns, with the intention that
backward and forward linkages will generate much needed employment. The plans comprise:



Supply base area, industrial estates. The plan is for the supply base to service offshore production
facilities including those in Australian waters based on perceived costs advantages.



Refinery and petrochemical complex. To supply fuel to the local markets and for export.



LNG plant complex. To process raw gas feedstock for export.



The development of supporting infrastructure is also planned (including a major highway linking the
three clusters, other roads, a seaport, an airport and heliport).

The national oil company, Timor Gap, is acting as the lead in the Tasi Mane project but final costs

Box 6. Implementation of Past IMF Policy Recommendations
Recent Article IV missions have emphasized the need for fiscal restraint. The planned investment in
infrastructure was welcomed, but staff advised slowing planned increases in spending to better align
expenditures with the absorptive capacity of the economy and administrative constraints. Staff also
highlighted the inflationary consequences of this strategy and the adverse consequences for the poor.
Staff set out a path for reducing expenditures but the authorities have hitherto preferred to maintain
high expenditures given the large developmental needs.
The continuation of high inflation and the slow pace in poverty reduction has led to an increased
acceptance of Fund advice. The revised budgetary framework that has been approved by the Council of
Ministers in June 2013 is in line with Fund advice on a tighter fiscal envelope. The next stage will be to
ensure a reprioritization of expenditures to increase their effectiveness.
Public financial management has improved. The government has enhanced the PFM system in line
with Fund recommendations and new institutions have been established to manage large public
investment programs. The operations of the PF have been improved consistent with Fund advice.
Previous missions have highlighted the need to contain subsidies especially regarding electricity
consumption but consensus on reforms has been slow to emerge.
Advice on structural reforms has been broadly followed. In line with recommendations on reducing
impediments to business, the authorities have made a number of steps recently including establishing
one stop shop for business investors and on promoting PPPs.
Fund advice on financial sector development has been accepted. The authorities are planning to
implement a new Financial Sector Master Plan and have requested Fund TA on enhancing the capacities
of the BCTL. However, a number of crucial laws have yet to be passed e.g. the Land Law that would allow
the development of the mortgage market, as it has proved difficult to reach a consensus on land issues.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
OF TIMOR-LESTE
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

October 7, 2013

Approved By

Brian Aitken and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)

Prepared By1
International Monetary Fund

Timor-Leste is at low risk of debt distress on the basis of the revised fiscal framework that
leads to low debt accumulation and a continuation of a high level of assets in the
Petroleum Fund. Under this baseline, debt ratios are comfortably below thresholds.2 This
compares with the adverse debt dynamics inherent in the 2013 Budget Book that would
have led to a steady fall in net assets. This assessment is fully contingent and conditional
on the authorities consistently implementing the revised fiscal framework. This implies a
tighter budget envelope with a reprioritization of spending on projects that spur
sustainable growth, and borrowing only on concessional terms from multilateral and
bilateral donors. The challenge to long-term debt sustainability comes from slippages to
the revised budgetary plans, an inefficient investment program, and the maintenance of
high current spending that does not enhance growth prospects. Risks from off-balance
sheet operations that are likely to become more complex should be closely monitored
and assessed.

1

This DSA has been prepared by IMF staff with input from World Bank staff, using the debt sustainability
framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both institutions.

2

The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework.
See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm) and “Debt Sustainability in LowIncome Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework, Policy Implications”
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm).

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.
The assessment has been updated from the previous DSA work undertaken in 2011
and 2010 in light of the new policy that allows the buildup of external debt for
developmental purposes. This DSA is based on the macroeconomic framework outlined in the
IMF’s staff report for the 2013 Article IV consultation. The revised medium-term fiscal framework
reflects more conservative spending plans consistent with macroeconomic and debt sustainability.
The assessment assumes for analytical purposes that debt accumulation reflects the gap between
revenues (ESI and non-oil revenues) and expenditures, e.g., the non-oil fiscal deficit is funded
through external borrowing rather than excess withdrawals from the PF as in the past. This is to
highlight that excess withdrawals from the PF are a form of borrowing from future generations and
in light of the financial advantage of borrowing—as the return on the PF assets is likely higher than
the interest cost on concessional borrowings. Since the public sector only borrows externally and the
private sector does not incur any medium- or long-term external liabilities, the DSA does not
separately assess external and public sector debt sustainability (they are essentially equivalent
barring that the public sector external debt is partially illustrated in net terms).
2.

2

The DSA is based on the following:


Timor-Leste has a weak Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) performance
rating, corresponding to the lowest set of indicative debt thresholds.



An estimate of gross national disposable income (GNDI) is replaced by gross domestic
product (GDP), components of which are now available to more accurately capture the
debt servicing capacity of the wider economy—excluding payments to non-residents in
the petroleum sector and including transfers from abroad (grants).



A wide concept of exports includes exports of goods and services as well as primary oilrelated income.



Total public sector revenue equals non-oil tax revenues plus the estimated sustainable
income (ESI) from the PF.



All debt is undertaken by the central government and no off-balance sheet debt is
accumulated, including by state owned enterprises, such the national oil company, the
Timor Gap.



Oil reserves are depleted by 2024 and no new reserves come on stream during the
forecast horizon.

FISCAL FRAMEWORK
3.
The DSA is based on the authorities’ current fiscal framework outlined in the
accompanying Staff Report, which significantly improves the fiscal and public balance sheet
outlook over the long term compared to the 2013 Budget Book plans. The so-called Yellow
Road framework cuts expenditure growth over the medium term vis-à-vis the 2013 Budget, thereby
also lowering the need for financing either through external borrowing or excess PF withdrawals
(see text table). Under this framework, staff projects that external borrowing ceases by 2022 yielding
stable long-term dynamics regarding public assets in gross and net terms. This contrasts with the
unsustainable

assets after 2024 when oil production is projected to end (see text figure). The unsustainable debt
dynamics of the 2013 budget plans are highlighted in Figure 1a.
4.
The government will need a strong asset-liability management framework as its
balance sheet becomes more complex. In the period ahead, the government is planning to take
on new debt liabilities and enter into public-private partnerships (PPPs) that may generate
contingent liabilities.3 On the asset side, there are plans for government and/or government owned
entities to take equity positions in major capital projects. Key considerations are:


Public debt. Contracting concessional debt from developmental partners is beneficial as it could
improve the quality and returns of capital projects. Non-concessional debt should be avoided.



Off-budget investments. Major capital-intensive projects tend to have complex financing
structures and the cost-benefit of public participation in these projects can be difficult to assess.
All such projects should be transparent and subject to the full scrutiny of the Major Projects
Secretariat and the Audit Court whose capacity needs to be strengthened. Off-balance sheet
liabilities, including by state owned companies such as newly established oil company, Timor
Gap, should be avoided.

PPP projects currently under development comprise the new Dili Port and the enhancement of Dili Airport—both
important projects, with the PPP tender for the Port at Tibar Bay launched in August and work ongoing for the
airport. The authorities are working with IFC. The details have yet to be finalized but it is estimated that investment in
the Port will be $300-$400 million with significant private sector participation. The overall size of the airport project is
not yet finalized but the expected level of private investment is likely to be much smaller.



Petroleum Fund. The revised Petroleum Fund Law allows a shift in strategic asset allocation away
from purely high quality bonds toward equities with a 50:50 split allowed with an intention to
increase returns. This may be appropriate from a long-term inter-generational perspective, but
the risk-return trade-offs in inherently volatile global financial markets need to be carefully
considered. The new provision to allow the PF to guarantee government debts (up to 10 percent
of the PF’s assets) is potentially risky and should be avoided.

ASSESSMENT
5.
Staff’s debt sustainability analysis suggests that the authorities’ revised fiscal
framework outlined in the Staff Report is consistent with external and public debt
sustainability. Under the current medium-term expenditure framework, a moderate accumulation
of gross debt through 2021 with the debt stock peaking at under 12 percent of GDP in present value
terms in 2018 is forecast (see Table 1, Figure 1, panels a & b). Due to the high stock of public assets
in the Petroleum Fund, at around $13 billion, and continued asset accumulation through 2024, net

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

public debt remains negative in nominal and present value terms throughout the period (see Table
2, Figure 2). In general, contracting concessional debt from developmental partners is beneficial as it
should improve the quality and returns of capital projects. Non-concessional debt should be
avoided. Not harnessing resources to stimulate long-term growth in the context of ending
petroleum production in the future represents the main risk to debt sustainability.
6.
Risks relating to off-balance sheet liabilities need to be very carefully monitored. The
government is developing a more complex balance sheet, entering into PPPs for the first time and
has recently established a national oil company. These developments pose risks that may be opaque
and not immediately identifiable. All such liabilities should be subject to the full scrutiny of the
Ministry of Finance whose capacity in this regard needs to be strengthened. It is especially important
to minimize contingent liabilities and to avoid guarantees (either explicit or implicit) being made by
the government.
7.
Within the next ten years, there is a low risk of debt distress under the baseline. As
long as the authorities stick their plans for a prudent fiscal framework allowing the PF assets to
continue to grow, there is a low risk of debt distress throughout the period. This is reflected by debt
ratios which are projected to remain well below thresholds (Figure 1) even taking into consideration
the projected end of oil inflows in 2024 and the small non-oil export sector. Under current
projections, debt amortization beginning in 2020 mitigates stock ratios even as oil inflows are
projected to end, which has a deleterious effect on GDP, export and revenue growth (Figure 1,
panels a-d). At the same time, given the concessionality of the debt and moderate pace of
accumulation, debt service ratios remain well within debt stability tolerances even after oil flows are
projected to cease (Figure 1, panels e & f).
8.
Risks to the outlook are reflected in the non-debt creating flows shock (the most
extreme) and the less favorable terms of new debt shock, illustrating the low debt carrying
capacity of the economy given its narrow base. While net public debt will remain significantly
negative as a percent of GDP and in PV terms throughout the period in the baseline scenario (Figure
2), lower permanent growth of about 1.5 percentage points over the baseline consistently worsens
the debt outlook. The worsening net debt-to-GDP ratio as of 2024 under the baseline is a function
of GDP declining faster than the accumulation of public foreign assets in the context of oil inflows
ending. However, gross public external assets are projected to increase throughout the forecast
period based on the assumption that the authorities maintain their plan of ending excess PF
withdrawals.
9.
These conclusions critically depend on maintaining the prudent fiscal policies outlined
in the staff report. In particular, policies to eliminate excess PF withdrawals and enhance the quality
of expenditures to diversify the economy must be followed through. Figure 1 demonstrates the
importance of oil flows and of diversifying the economy as the shock to non-debt creating flows is
the most adverse, with the stock equalling the threshold in the stress scenario. This illustration also
underscores the importance of borrowing only on concessional terms as the less favorable terms
scenario is the second worst shock. The importance of maintaining an appropriate fiscal stance and
diversifying growth is illustrated by the fixed primary balance and permanent growth shocks in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

Figure 2, particularly in order to maintain a sustainable debt service burden. Similarly, avoiding
significant negative returns on the PF is critical to maintaining debt sustainability given the lack of
alternative debt servicing capacity, suggesting a conservative and carefully considered investment
strategy is called for.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
10.
Authorities agreed with the conclusions of the DSA. In discussions with the mission, it
was recognized that adopting the Yellow Road framework would stabilize the long-term PF balance
and external debt outlook, implying a low risk of debt distress.

CONCLUSION
11.
Critical to Timor Leste’s debt sustainability is the adoption of a prudent fiscal policy
and diversifying the economy to realize growth in the non oil sector. The revised fiscal
framework, Yellow Road that replaces the 2013 Budget Book would ensure sustainability. However,
consistent implementation will be critical to maintaining sustainability. Policy slippages would
increase risks to the external debt outlook, particularly in view of Timor Leste’s narrow economic
base and low debt servicing capacity. Consistent with this fiscal path will be the need for higher
quality growth in the non-oil sector. This will require, inter alia: (i) structural reforms to stimulate the
private sector; (ii) careful prioritization of complementary public investments that efficiently support
the development of labor-intensive and export orientated sectors; and (iii) a public asset-liability
management framework that optimizes the financing mix from the PF and development partners.
The authorities should avoid non-concessional financing and the buildup of contingent liabilities.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
On January 24, 2000, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency of then East Timor by the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This arrangement has been
maintained after Timor-Leste’s independence on May 20, 2002. At present, the monetary authority
does not undertake foreign exchange transactions; they are handled by commercial banks on the
basis of rates quoted in the international markets. Timor-Leste has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The authorities noted
that no changes have been made to the exchange system since the last Article IV mission.

Article IV Consultations
Timor-Leste is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The previous Article IV consultation was concluded
on January 31, 2012. The Public Information Notice may be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13222.htm. The Article IV consultation in 2012 was
delayed by the change in government.
Technical Assistance (TA) and Training
Since late 1999, Timor-Leste has been one of the largest recipients of Fund technical assistance as
part of the international community’s efforts to reconstruct the Timor-Leste economy. The Fund’s
technical assistance and training has focused on establishing key economic institutions (especially
what are now the Ministry of Finance and central bank) essential for macroeconomic management,
as well as on developing local capacity to manage them. More recently, technical assistance
provision has been focused in key areas including the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI)
calculation, the Petroleum Fund’s (PF) investment strategy and improving statistics. TA has been
provided by HQ based staff and experts in collaboration with the Pacific Financial Technical
Assistance Centre (PFTAC). Current and planned technical assistance is described in more detail
below:
FAD: Building on the high level of technical assistance delivery in the past, recent technical
assistance has focused on follow up to the Public Expenditure Financial Assessment and fiscal ROSC
that were conducted in 2010 as well as in specific areas. To support the 2011 Ministry of Finance
Strategic Plan (MoFSP), follow-up TA mission on treasury management was delivered in 2012, laying
the groundwork for the placement of a resident advisor to the Ministry of Finance. The advisor
started working on Public Finance Management in March 2012 and concluded in March 2013.
Recent FAD TA missions include (i) strengthening macro-fiscal capacity; and (ii) non-oil tax policy
and administration. Planned TA for 2013/14 includes on: (i) the ESI calculation; and (ii) public
expenditure management in collaboration with other donors.
MCM: The recent focus has been on the PF, with a mission in 2013 on improving its governance and
investment capabilities as it moves to a more sophisticated investment approach. Follow-up TA is
likely in 2014. During the 2013 Article IV mission, the BCTL requested TA on a number of core
central banking areas and a Needs Assessment mission will visit toward the end of 2013 to identify
key areas. Subsequent more focused follow-up missions are planned to the BCTL in 2014.
STA/PFTAC: Recent missions have focused on (i) government finance statistics as part of an ongoing project regarding the compilation of fiscal data for operational and statistical purposes—
based on the GFSM 2001 framework—and publishing Timorese data in the International Financial
Statistics; (ii) balance of payments including on ensuring compliance with the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6); and (iii) national accounts statistics
collaboratively between PFTAC and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in order to review the
methodology and the compilation system. Follow-up TA in these areas is planned for 2014. IMF staff
has also worked closely with other TA providers especially on enhancing the inflation methodology

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

and preparing national income accounts. The authorities have requested TA on ensuring consistency
in the treatment of oil exports in the national income accounts and the balance of payments.
STI/PFTAC: Government officials from Timor-Leste generally attend IMF training courses on
macroeconomic and financial policies including statistics and legal issues offered by the STI, both in
Singapore and in the region. During 2012, a total of nine participants attended STI training courses
in Singapore and in the region (officials attended the Financial Programming course offered by
ICD/STI/PFTAC in Fiji during November-December 2012). Going forward, the STI will continue to
focus on macro-critical capacity building needs and developing synergies between TA and training
will also be a priority. In FY 2014 it is expected that staff from the Ministry of Finance and the CBTL
will participate in regional courses and workshops organized by PFTAC’s macroeconomic advisor.
Resident Representative
The resident representative office in Dili, established in August 2000, closed at end-June 2009.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
The Bank and Fund country teams for Timor-Leste, led by Mr. Luis Constantino (World Bank
country manager) and Mr. Neil Saker (IMF mission chief), have closely cooperated on
macroeconomic issues and macro-critical structural reforms. The Bank’s country economist,
Mr. Hans Beck, joined the 2013 Article IV consultation mission.
The two teams have worked closely on the following:


Macroeconomic developments and economic updates. There has been close dialogue
throughout the year on macro policies and economic developments. There is regular sharing
of information and development of common policy recommendations. The Fund provided
comments on the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy that was finalized in 2013.



Public finance management. Bank staff has been following up on the PEFA and ROSC
recommendations, including helping the Ministry of Finance (MoF) put together a Strategic
Plan.



External debt. The teams have engaged very closely on discussions around the government’s
plans to borrow. A joint DSA was been conducted in July 2013, which is an important
building block for the Bank’s creditworthiness assessment.



Capacity building. The Fund and the Bank both co-hosted alongside the Government of
Timor-Leste, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), and Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA), the conference on Harnessing Natural Resource Wealth for Inclusive Growth
and Economic Development, held in Dili in September, 2013.

The teams agreed that Timor-Leste’s main macroeconomic challenge is to manage the
country’s petroleum wealth effectively and sustainably develop a stronger non-oil economy
and reduce poverty. To meet this challenge, Timor-Leste needs to shift to a higher quality and
poverty reducing growth path while ensuring macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. This
will require a prudent fiscal stance, the prioritization of public expenditures; strengthened public
financial management and an acceleration of reforms to promote productivity and competitiveness.
The government launched the Strategic Development Plan (SDP) 2011–30 in July 2011 and both the
Bank and Fund have made concrete recommendations to help ensure that it achieves its goals.
Based on this shared assessment the following structural reform areas were identified as
macro-critical:


Medium-term fiscal plans. The government is working on a revised medium-term budget
that will stabilize public spending at sustainable levels. Expenditures will be prioritized to
ensure value for money and compliance with SDP objectives.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE



Public financial management (PFM) reform. The recent Fiscal ROSC and PEFA missions and
the Bank’s review of the Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program
found solid progress but also highlighted pressing issues around medium-term budgeting,
expenditure (in particular public investment) management and procurement, and auditing.
These areas are critical for the quality of expenditure.



Promoting productivity and competitiveness: Timor-Leste faces a number of challenges to
promoting productivity, competitiveness and diversification in the non-oil economy. Key
priorities include addressing human capital; improving access to finance; improving the
agriculture sector; and strengthening the business environment, in particular access contract
enforcement.

The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The table below details the
specific activities planned by the two country teams in 2013/14 period. In summary, the Fund will
continue to lead on macro issues, and the Bank will continue to lead PFM and macro critical
structural reform issues.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 2013)
Timor-Leste joined the AsDB in 2002. The relationship evolved from an initial focus on rehabilitation
and reconstruction to developing vital infrastructure to support economic growth and development.
The relationship is currently guided by the AsDB’s country partnership strategy (CPS), 2011–2015
that aligns the engagement with Timor-Leste’s Strategic Development Plan, 2011–2030. The CPS
outlines a five-year strategic partnership with the government in support of infrastructure, financial
services, and the skills training required to meet the needs of a growing economy. It will support the
private sector to help Timor-Leste make the transition from a public sector-led economy. Assistance
will also be provided for governance and capacity development, gender equity, knowledge
solutions, and helping Timor-Leste integrate regionally.
Timor-Leste first accessed the Asian Development Fund (ADF) in 2005. The ADF has provided grants
for road rehabilitation, water supply and technical and vocational education and training projects.
Timor-Leste is the recipient of one of AsDB’s largest ever technical assistance (TA) grant, the
Infrastructure Project Management TA. This $15 million six-year package, co-financed with AusAID,
helps plan, prepare, and execute the government’s capital development program. Other AsDB
activities include support for regional economic integration, the finance sector, small-scale
infrastructure, and the strengthening of statistics and macroeconomic management, the civil service,
and environmental management. The AsDB has provided technical support for the establishment of
the Petroleum Fund and other core elements of public sector management. The AsDB helped
establish the Institute of Microfinance in Timor-Leste, which, in July 2011, became the country’s first
locally owned commercial bank, the Banco Nacional Comércio de Timor-Leste (BNCTL).
In October 2011, available resources were increased following Timor-Leste’s reclassification as a
B member country. This provides access to AsDB’s ordinary capital resources, while retaining access
to Asian Development Fund (ADF). The indicative ordinary capital resources allocation for 2013–
2015 is $60 million, with actual allocation to depend on demand and on portfolio performance. The
$50.32 million in ADF resources for 2013–2015 are available as loans only. Under the CPS, financial
resources for 2011–2015 are expected to be concentrated on major roads, seaports, mid-level skills
training, and water supply and sanitation in urban centers. The AsDB will promote the provision of a
range of infrastructure services, including operations and maintenance by the private sector. Road
transport has been identified as the main infrastructure subsector, reflecting the AsDB’s presence in
the subsector, the substantial resources needed to achieve the government’s targets, and the
importance of quickly improving of road infrastructure. In 2012, Timor-Leste received $68.7 million
loan cofinancing from the government of Japan for the Road Network Upgrading Project.
The AsDB also co-hosted alongside the government of Timor-Leste, the IMF, the World Bank, and
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) the conference on Harnessing Natural Resource
Wealth for Inclusive Growth and Economic Development, held in Dili in September, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has shortcomings due to capacity constraints that significantly
hamper surveillance. Most affected areas are national accounts and trade statistics. TA is being provided
by the Fund and other donors to help improve capacity.
National Accounts: The national accounts have been developed for 2004–11, with details of GDP and its
components available for the first time. This has been developed by a national accounts advisor funded
by donors. To improve national accounts data further, appropriate staff and substantial efforts in data
collection and compilation are needed. With TA from PFTAC and in conjunction with the ABS, the
methodology was reviewed in May 2013 and assessed as broadly compliant with the System of National
Accounts 2008. The review also recommended identifying areas for simplification of the compilation
system to facilitate the compilation of future national accounts estimates by the General Directorate of
Statistics and reduce its reliance on external assistance. In the longer term, a new compilation system
might be redeveloped with support from the ABS which is likely to provide substantive TA in the future.
Price Statistics: The inflation methodology has recently been enhanced. Starting 2013, CPI has been
rebased and basket weights updated using data derived from the Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES) that was conducted in 2011. Data is released monthly for Dili but the national data is only
available quarterly. Shortcomings in data collection, especially in rural areas, also remain and products
and outlets should be updated.
Government Finance Statistics: The compilation of revenue and expenditure is moving toward the
GFSM 2001 approach but progress has been hampered by capacity constraints. STA has an ongoing
technical assistance project to facilitate the migration to GFSM 2001. A technical assistance mission
conducted in early 2013 was able to update both the chart of accounts (COA) classifications and public
sector delineation. However, only partial data are available on fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities undertaken
by bilateral donors outside the central government budget.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary statistics are compiled by the BCTL, generally following the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, data are incomplete because of
the absence of official data on public currency holdings—which are difficult to compile under the current
currency regime—and of banks’ positions with public nonfinancial corporations.
Detailed monthly monetary data are available from July 2002 onward, following the introduction of the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank and other depository corporations (ODCs).
Currently, there is a need to: (i) introduce SRFs for the central bank based on the new chart of accounts
and for the ODCs based on the revised call report form, (ii) include the credit unions in the institutional
coverage of the ODCs, and (iii) introduce the SRF for other financial corporations.

Balance of payments: While progress has been made, measuring non-PF related current account
transactions accurately remains a work in progress. Monthly merchandise trade data are now published
regularly but there are significant gaps in the series for 2006 and 2007. Data on monthly merchandise
exports and imports is based on the tariff system – ASYCUDA. Significant underestimation of transactions
stem from the large, unrecorded border trade; the exemption of some goods from customs duties; and
the undervaluation of declared goods, particularly for imports. Service transactions are largely estimated
with data collection largely limited to the official and tourism sectors. Currently, primary and interest
oil/gas revenues are recorded as current income based on fiscal data.
With technical assistance provided by the IMF’s Statistics Department, annual balance of payments data
are now available for 2006–12. While methodology for the production of basic annual estimates of the
balance of payments statistics are in place, further development work is needed to address limitations of
existing data sources, in particular, merchandise trade statistics and service transactions. This includes
work to ensure consistency between current account data and the new National Accounts Statistics,
particularly related to the exports of commodities and imports of services. The authorities are considering
the recording of primary oil/gas income as an export to mirror the treatment in the National Accounts
Statistics in the context of upcoming TA missions. The coverage of the survey of foreign direct investment
enterprises needs to be expanded, and the exploration and extraction activities in the Joint Petroleum
Development Area and in the exclusive territory, requires ongoing monitoring.
Currently, there is limited information on remittances from Timorese working abroad and improvement in
the estimation and compilation procedures of such remittances should be pursued.
Since October 2012, Timor-Leste participates in the Japan Administered Account for Selected IMF
Activities (JSA) Project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics in the Pacific Region. TA under
this project has resulted in the dissemination of annual IIP data on the central bank’s website and an
improvement in the periodicity and timeliness of external sector statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Timor-Leste
October 23, 2013
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Following the revision of the discount rate approved by the IMF and World Bank Boards
on October 11, 2013, staff has recalculated the debt sustainability assessment for Timor-Leste
using the new five percent discount rate. This results in a slightly more favorable outlook for the
calculated net present value of debt in relation to GDP and exports. The overall assessment of
risk of debt distress and debt vulnerabilities discussed in the staff report and DSA remains
unchanged.
2.
The budget for 2014 remains under preparation but discussions with the authorities
indicate that actual expenditures are planned to be stable in line with the framework agreed with
Fund staff in June 2013. This is important not only for fiscal sustainability but for lowering
inflation that remains above 10 percent, despite the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
regional currencies.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Timor-Leste
On October 23, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Timor-Leste.1
Timor-Leste has made substantial progress as it enters its second decade as a sovereign nation. A
number of key milestones have been achieved. The 13 year UN presence was concluded
successfully in 2012. Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in mid 2012 and a
coalition government was formed. A Strategic Development Plan (SDP) to guide Timor-Leste
toward upper middle-income status was developed in an inclusive manner and its
implementation started in 2011. Timor-Leste has accumulated a highly regarded Petroleum Fund
that now stands at over $13 billion. Oil revenues have been used to tackle large developmental
needs, but oil production has peaked and many uncertainties persist over the development of
new fields. Fragilities persist as poverty remains high.
The non-oil economy has grown rapidly in recent years with growth averaging close to
12 percent from 2008 to 2011, allowing the average per capita income to steadily increase. The
growth was driven by a rapid increase in government spending which boosted the public
administration and construction sectors. So far, the contributions from agriculture and
manufacturing have been modest, hampering employment opportunities outside of the public
sector and constraining widespread growth in living standards.
Despite falling from the peak of over 15 percent in 2011, the inflation rate is still in double
digits. Initially inflation was driven by high international commodity prices but more recently it
appears to reflect, among other factors, the interaction of strong demand led by government
recurrent expenditures and structural bottlenecks. In addition to hitting the low-income
households, high inflation in a dollarized economy hampers Timor-Leste’s ability to diversify
and generate employment growth.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
High levels of government spending have risked sustainability, but revised budgetary plans in
2013 now anticipate a substantial moderation. In the revised medium-term budgetary plans (the
so-called “Yellow Road” process), adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2013, spending
plans were significantly scaled back, starting in 2013. This will bring a number of benefits.
Firstly, it will reduce inflationary pressures in the economy, helping reduce poverty. Secondly,
by largely eliminating excess withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund, the financing of the budget
will be placed on a long-term sustainable path. Lastly, it will provide an opportunity to improve
the overall quality of public expenditure.
The medium-term growth outlook will hinge on the pace of fiscal consolidation and the ongoing implementation of structural reforms to expedite the transition to higher quality private
sector led growth. Under the baseline scenario the reprioritization of government expenditures
and reforms would boost the private sector, allowing more inclusive and broad-based growth.
Key risks include a weaker pace of reforms, poor implementation of key infrastructure projects
(especially transport links), or an adverse external environment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Timor-Leste’s substantial progress as it enters its second decade
as a sovereign nation. The end of the 13-year UN presence, the successful elections in 2012, and
the accumulation of substantial assets in the well regarded Petroleum Fund are important
indicators that Timor-Leste is overcoming the fragilities inherent in a post-conflict nation.
Directors recognized that substantial development challenges remain given still high levels of
poverty. The overriding challenge now is to successfully use oil revenues to foster economic and
social development and the diversification of the economy. Directors supported the goals of the
authorities’ Strategic Development Plan that aims for upper-middle income status and a
substantial reduction in poverty by 2030.
Directors noted that, after six years of strong non-oil GDP growth driven by large increases in
public expenditure, the next step is to generate a shift to higher-quality growth in which an
organic private sector, operating independently from government contracts, increasingly takes
the lead. This would support economic diversification, increase employment opportunities, and
ensure that economic growth results in broad based poverty reduction.
As part of this approach, Directors welcomed the revised budgetary framework that anticipates a
stabilization of government expenditures and revenue diversification. Given the dollarized
economy, a restrained fiscal stance that contributes to lower inflation will also have benefits for
external competitiveness. Directors also welcomed the on-going reprioritization of expenditures
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
with a renewed focus on growth-enhancing investments in basic infrastructure and a shift away
from transfers and subsidies. Directors stressed that although the revised framework limits the
buildup of public sector debt, contingent and off-balance sheet liabilities will need to be avoided.
In addition, it will be important to ensure that withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund are in line
with fiscal sustainability and absorptive capacities, while also carefully monitoring their asset
allocation strategy.
Directors emphasized that catalyzing the private sector will require steps to improve the business
climate and address structural bottlenecks through improvements in infrastructure and the
implementation of productivity-enhancing structural reforms. Directors noted that the priorities
include implementation of the Land Law, streamlining the Investment Law, and improving
contract enforcement.
Directors observed that the official dollarization of the economy has played a positive role,
especially in light of underdeveloped or missing financial and money markets. In this regard,
Directors encouraged the authorities to enhance their capacity to support a potential transition
over the long term to a monetary and exchange rate framework that provides more autonomy
and flexibility.
Directors noted that financial deepening and improving access to credit will become increasingly
important as the economy develops. At the same time, safeguarding the soundness of the
banking system will require strengthening central bank prudential supervision, developing a
crisis management framework, and addressing weaknesses in the anti-money laundering
framework.
Directors welcomed the closer dialogue between the Fund and the authorities. They noted the
important role that Fund technical assistance can play in a number of areas to help the authorities
achieve their development goals.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Timor-Leste
and Ivan Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director
and Felipe Santarosa, Advisor
1.
On behalf of the Timorese authorities, we would like to thank staff for the
constructive dialogue during this Article IV consultation. Timor-Leste has continued on
an accelerated economic trajectory with non-oil GDP growing 11.5 percent on average
from 2007 to 2012. The authorities have demonstrated strong commitment to sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction in tandem with their Strategic Development Plan
(SDP). This long-term strategy envisions the utilization of oil revenues to foster
economic and social development and the diversification of the economy. Timor-Leste’s
aim is to transition from low to high middle-income status by 2030. The SDP foresees the
development of three core sectors – petroleum, agriculture and tourism – by means of
targeted investment in infrastructure, education and human and social capital.
2.
The authorities are aware of the formidable challenges ahead. Timor-Leste is a
young nation still coping with the legacy of long-lasting conflicts and the need to build
solid institutions to manage its natural resources and deliver the services required by its
citizens. Peace-building and state-building have been at the forefront of the government’s
priorities, in line with the principles of the “New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States”
advocated by the g7+ grouping, currently chaired by Timor-Leste. Progress in these two
crucial areas can be attested by the peaceful handover of power to the V Constitutional
Government in 2012 and the smooth withdrawal of the United Nations mission in
January 2013.
3.
The authorities are determined to further consolidate democracy and strengthen
social inclusion. This will go hand in hand with efforts to enhance institutional and
administrative capacities, which will contribute to maximize the positive impact of public
expenditures on living standards. In the Risk Assessment Matrix, staff considers political
instability as a risk with medium probability of materializing. We find this assessment
rather pessimistic, given the social and political progress achieved in only one decade of
independence. These accomplishments and the favorable track record in setting up key
institutions would suggest a low probability of political instability.
Recent economic developments and medium term outlook
4.
Besides an impressive economic growth, Timor-Leste has exhibited sturdy fiscal
indicators. As of May 2013, the Petroleum Fund (PF) balance was 13.6 billion US dollars
and rising – it is expected to reach the 14 billion mark by January 2014, according to
official data. As can be seen from Tables 1 and 2 of the staff report, the PF balance has
risen from 650 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009 to as much as 868 percent in 2012. The
overall government balance for 2012 is estimated by IMF staff at 47 percent of non-oil
GDP.

5.
The external position is also very strong. According to staff estimations, the
current account surplus reached 43.5 percent of GDP in 2012. Public foreign assets (the
sum of the PF balance and the central bank’s official reserves) rose from 58 to 91 months
of imports from 2009 to 2012 (Tables 1 and 4 of the staff report). Very few IMF
members can display such strong fiscal and external indicators.
6.
The medium term outlook is positive. After peaking at 15.4 percent in 2011,
inflation fell to 10.8 percent in 2012 and is projected to continue on a declining trend,
albeit still somewhat high for a dollarized economy. While real non-oil GDP growth is
likely to moderate slightly in the coming years, it is expected to remain robust by
international standards, averaging about 8.5 percent according to staff’s projections. The
authorities are projecting a medium term outlook somewhat better than staff’s. The
government has received strong indications that private sector investment will
substantially increase in coming years as a result of past and ongoing reforms,
contributing to the expansion of the non-oil economy. Enhanced political stability should
also play a role in attracting greater private sector participation.
7.
We note that staff has consistently underestimated Timor-Leste’s non-oil GDP
growth prospects. In the 2009 Article IV consultation, staff had projected non-oil GDP
growth for 2009 at 7.4 percent – the actual result was 12.8 percent, much closer to the
authorities’ forecast of 12.2 percent. In the 2010 Article IV report, non-oil GDP growth
for 2010 was expected to “slow to around 6 percent due to the impact of adverse weather
on harvests”, whereas the authorities’ estimate was 9.5 percent. Food production was
indeed affected by rains but the absence of growth in agriculture was more than
compensated by buoyancy in other sectors and non-oil GDP grew in line with the
authorities’ projections. In the subsequent Article IV report, of January 2012, staff again
underestimated non-oil GDP growth, expecting it to “remain strong at about 10 percent”
in 2011– the final numbers were even stronger with non-oil GDP expanding by 12
percent in 2011.
Fiscal policy and debt sustainability
8.
Timor-Leste has put in place a strong fiscal framework with the successful
implementation of the PF and the concept of Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI). This
has reduced unpredictability in oil revenues and enhanced transparency in public
spending. The authorities agree with staff’s overall assessment that the revised mediumterm budget framework outlined by the Council of Ministers in June 2013 – the so-called
Yellow Road process – is consistent with non-oil GDP growth, falling inflation, poverty
reduction and fiscal sustainability. The Yellow Road framework has already been
reflected in the revised 2013 budget and in the preparation of the 2014 budget. It strikes
an appropriate balance between strict adherence to the ESI, which would not be
consistent with the required scaling up of infrastructure to address supply bottlenecks,
and the need to limit withdrawals from the PF so as to preserve oil wealth for future
generations.
9.
As stated in the staff report, the recourse to concessional borrowing and publicprivate partnerships (PPPs) to complement budget resources for capital investment is

likely to render public financial management more complex over time. The authorities
concur that the development of a strong asset-liability framework will be critical and
would like to remain engaged with the Fund and other multilateral financial organizations
to receive technical assistance in this area. However, it should be noted that TimorLeste's current level of debt is very low with most loan agreements signed on highly
concessional terms. According to the Debt Sustainability Analysis, the implementation of
the Yellow Road baseline entails a moderate accumulation of public debt, yet the present
value of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to be low throughout the forecast
period. Moreover, net debt will remain negative both in nominal and present value terms,
given the high stock and continued accumulation of assets in the PF.
Monetary and financial sector developments
10.
The debate on dollarization versus national currency has been a long-standing
one. International experience shows that full dollarization is not easy to reverse.
Nonetheless, the possibility of introducing a national currency is contemplated in the
SDP and a study was made in the past with the help of the central bank of Portugal.
Another one is planned by the Central Bank of Timor-Leste (Banco Central de TimorLeste - BCTL). Staff asserts that “full dollarization remains appropriate for now given
limited capacity for independent monetary and exchange rate policies”. However, if the
country is still adopting full dollarization it is because the authorities see advantages in
retaining it at the current stage and not necessarily because they lack the capacity to
implement alternative policies.
11.
As highlighted in the report, the small banking system has not adequately
supported growth. Policies are needed to create incentives for lending, such as ensuring
timely recovery of collateral. The Land Law currently under discussion is expected to
address legal uncertainties related to the use and ownership of real estate in Timor-Leste.
This is fundamental for a more sustained expansion of agribusiness and will also open the
way for the future development of a mortgage market. Additionally, enhancing the
supervisory capacity of the BCTL and reinforcing the legal and institutional framework
for financial sector regulation are priority areas on which the authorities have requested
Fund’s technical assistance.
Structural reforms and poverty reduction
12.
Timor-Leste’s structural reform agenda builds on the country’s considerable
resources and potential to achieve economic growth and diversification while also
fostering a higher presence of the private sector. In that vein, the authorities have taken
steps to reduce the cost of doing business, strengthen the judicial system and the rule of
law, and improve the country’s infrastructure. Together with the planned introduction of
the Land Law, an important step to enhance the business climate has been the
implementation of the one-stop shop for investors. Also, substantial progress in basic
infrastructure is under way with the recent launching of phase two of the National
Electrical Grid and the development of PPPs for the improvement of Dili airport and the
construction of the new port at Tibar Bay.

13.
Economic and social development requires a reduction in inequality. The
authorities continue to promote active social policies targeted at the most vulnerable. A
cash transfer program directed to poor families – Bolsa da Mãe – has been launched and
welfare benefits are being provided to the elderly and other groups in need. Progress has
also been made on health and education. The number of vaccinated children has risen
whereas infant and maternal mortality have decreased. There has also been an increase in
the number of schools and enrolled children country-wide. The expansion in financing
for higher education, both inside the country and abroad, is part of a sustained effort to
develop human capital.
