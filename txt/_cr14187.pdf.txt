STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

June 11, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Economic context. Economic growth has been solid, supported by tourism, hospitality,
and a rebounding real estate sector. Rapid price increases in some segments of the real
estate market have prompted concerns about possible excessive risk-taking. The pace of
fiscal consolidation slowed in 2013. The economic recovery, combined with higher real
estate prices and a liquid banking system, has further supported the rollover of the stilllarge debt maturities of government-related entities (GREs).
Policy Focus. Economic and financial policies should continue to aim at mitigating the
risk of a renewed cycle of exuberance, and at strengthening the fiscal position. Efforts in
deleveraging and restructuring GREs should continue.
Macroeconomic policy mix. Fiscal plans for this year and the medium term imply
appropriate countercyclical fiscal policy amid economic strengthening. Monetary policy
in coming years is expected to tighten under the U.S. dollar peg, helping the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) mitigate the risk of potentially large private credit growth, and could be
supported by macroprudential tightening should deposit and credit growth accelerate
further.
Real estate. Further measures, such as setting higher fees for reselling properties within
a short time, and restrictions on reselling off-plan properties, are warranted, particularly if
rapid price increases continue. These measures could be supported by targeted
macroprudential tightening in case real estate lending picks up further.
GREs. Strengthening the coordinating mechanisms for prioritizing and sequencing major
projects will be important, as is continuing to avoid new large-scale risk-taking by highly
indebted GREs. Building on recent progress, upcoming debt maturities should be
managed proactively; this should include timely communication and improving GREs’
transparency and governance.
Financial stability. The banking system maintains significant capital and liquidity buffers.
Banking system soundness should be further strengthened by gradually reducing the
exposure to emirate governments and GREs of those banks exceeding recently imposed
loan concentration limits, by strengthening corporate governance in banks, and by
continuing to enhance the financial integrity framework.

BACKGROUND
1.
The UAE continues to benefit from its perceived safe-haven status amid regional
instability. Against a backdrop of political stability, confidence has further increased, tourism and
hospitality have expanded, and capital inflows have continued. The real estate sector, which had
been impaired since the 2008/9 crisis, has been recovering quickly, especially in the Dubai
residential market.
2.
Economic diversification efforts are ongoing. Dubai continues to expand its role as a hub
for retail and wholesale trade, as well as a major tourism and real estate investment destination for
the wider region. Dubai’s successful bid for the World Expo 2020 is expected to further increase
confidence and growth in the medium term Abu Dhabi, while continuing to expand its hydrocarbon
production capacity, is pursuing an economic diversification strategy into areas such as
petrochemicals, logistics, financial services, aviation, renewable energy, and cultural tourism.
Meanwhile, consistent with IMF staff advice, the authorities have been implementing a number of
reforms aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities and strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework,
including bolstering the GRE and banking sectors and strengthening fiscal policy coordination and
economic statistics.

Status of Staff Recommendations Made during the 2013 Article IV Consultation
Recommendation

Current Status

Continue fiscal consolidation

The fiscal stance in 2013 tightened by around 1 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP, about half of what had
been expected. The consolidated 2014 budget implies significant consolidation.

Continue to focus on
strengthening the GRE sector

Consider targeted increases
in real-estate-related fees

All major debt restructurings from the 2008/9 crisis have been completed, and large intergovernmental
maturities have been rolled over. GREs have made progress with selling assets and partially prepaying
maturities. Further progress is needed in strengthening the transparency and coordination of GREs.

Dubai authorities raised the real estate registration fee from 2 percent to 4 percent in October 2013, and
regulatory measures to assure orderly market conditions for new real estate development were introduced.

Introduce new prudential
regulations for mortgage
lending and loan
concentration

The Central Bank introduced new maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgage lending, debt-service-toincome limits, and loan concentration limits for GREs and local governments in early 2014.

Further strengthen fiscal
policy coordination

The Ministry of Finance compiles consolidated fiscal data in the GFS 2001 format for the federal and
emirate governments.

Further improve economic
statistics

The authorities have improved GFS reporting, started a project to compile the international investment
position, and have begun implementing an international transactions reporting system for the balance of
payments.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic growth has been solid, supported by tourism, hospitality, and a rebounding
real estate sector. While growth in oil production moderated in 2013, public projects in Abu Dhabi
and robust growth in Dubai’s service sectors continued to underpin growth, which reached 5.2
percent in 2013. The current account surplus declined to 16 percent of GDP (from 18½ percent in
2012), reflecting buoyant imports. The real estate sector has been recovering quickly in some
segments, especially in the Dubai residential market. While the momentum of price increases
appears to have slowed in recent months, sales prices nonetheless increased 27 percent year-overyear in May 2014 (Box 1).1 With this increase only gradually feeding into higher average rents,
headline inflation increased to 1.9 percent year-on-year in March 2014 (from 1 percent a year ago).
4.
Strong financial market performance also reflects improved confidence. The Dubai
Financial Market (DFM) stock index rose by 100 percent year-over-year in May 2014, in part
supported by the UAE’s inclusion in MSCI’s emerging markets index.2 Credit default swap spreads
have further tightened. Foreign capital flows, particularly to domestic banks, have risen (Box 2).
5.
Fiscal consolidation slowed in 2013. The fiscal stance tightened by around 1 percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP, about half of what had been expected.3 While the Dubai government reduced
its deficit slightly faster than planned, Abu Dhabi’s consolidation was less than budgeted, driven by
higher security, defense, and other current spending. The overall fiscal surplus is estimated to have
declined, however, to 6.5 percent of GDP (from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2012), raising the estimated
fiscal breakeven oil price to US$84, from US$78 in 2012.4
6.
Private sector credit has begun to recover. Deposit growth has strengthened, boosting
liquidity in the banking system. Following years of credit-less recovery, lending to the private sector
has begun to rebound (8.2 percent year-over-year growth in 2013, and further accelerating in the
first quarter of 2014). Banks continued to increase their exposure to government and public
enterprises, by AED15 billion (equivalent to 6 percent of bank capital) during 2013, in some cases
further increasing their already substantial loan concentration. Banks remain amply capitalized, and
nonperforming loans (NPLs) have begun declining from their post-crisis peak, though they remain
high, especially among Dubai banks.

In mid-2013, MSCI announced the reclassification of the UAE from its Frontier Markets Index to its Emerging
Markets Index as of June 2014, triggering increased demand by investors that track this index.

3

The fiscal stance, measuring the fiscal impulse on aggregate demand, is defined as the consolidated
nonhydrocarbon primary balance for the federal, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah budgets, including loans and equity
but excluding (i) the operations of Dubai Financial Support Fund, (ii) the investment income from the sovereign
wealth funds, and (iii) grants to foreign governments.

The breakeven oil price is the oil price that would be needed to balance the consolidated budget of the federation
and the emirates.

7.
Solid economic growth, combined with higher real estate prices and a liquid banking
system, has helped indebted GREs. With the debt restructuring of Dubai Group in January
($10 billion), reportedly at a large net present value (NPV) haircut for creditors, the last major
restructuring from the 2008/9 crisis has been completed. In addition, $20 billion in Dubai
government debt to the Central Bank of the UAE (CBU) and Abu Dhabi falling due this year was
rolled over at reduced interest rates. Nakheel has begun to prepay bank debt falling due in 2015.
Dubai World has stepped up asset sales (sometimes to other GREs) to raise cash and repay debt
under its debt restructuring agreement, though markets continue to monitor Dubai World’s capacity
to make forthcoming repayments. Financially healthy GREs have stepped up debt issuance
(Figure 3). Abu Dhabi kept its total government and GRE debt contained.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The macroeconomic outlook is positive. Economic growth is expected to be about
4¾ percent in 2014 and 4½ percent in coming years. Driving economic growth, the
nonhydrocarbon economy is expected to grow at about 5½ percent this year and beyond,
supported by public investment projects and strength in services sectors such as tourism, logistics,
finance, and real estate. An improving global economy and strengthening domestic confidence,
associated with a rebounding real estate market, recently announced megaprojects, and the Expo
2020, also support nonhydrocarbon growth. By contrast, growth in hydrocarbon production will
likely be limited in the context of an amply supplied global oil market. Inflation is expected to
increase, driven by higher rents. The current account is set to further decrease, reflecting a projected
moderate decline in hydrocarbon prices and continued import growth.

9.
Domestic and external conditions pose risks to the largely favorable medium-term
outlook (see risk assessment matrix).


The strengthening real estate cycle, particularly in the Dubai residential market, could attract
increased—and potentially destabilizing—speculative demand, creating the risk of
unsustainable price dynamics and an eventual, potentially disruptive correction. An
acceleration of the Dubai megaprojects, currently planned to be flexible and in line with
projected demand, could exacerbate this risk. Moreover, the projects could weaken Dubai’s
still substantially indebted GREs: Dubai’s total government and GRE debt is estimated at
$142 billion (141 percent of Dubai GDP) with $92 billion falling due in 2014–19. With rent
controls recently relaxed, rising real estate prices may also feed more strongly into inflation.



External risks also remain important. A sustained decline in oil prices, which could be
triggered by deceleration of global demand or coming-on-stream of new supply, would
reduce export earnings and fiscal revenues. The UAE’s substantial foreign assets and fiscal
surplus provide buffers against moderate or short-lived shocks. But a large and prolonged
fall in oil prices would reverse the accumulation of savings and ultimately result in lower
fiscal spending. Renewed global financial market volatility could increase interest costs for
the Dubai government and its GREs. By contrast, heightened geopolitical risks surrounding
Russia and Ukraine or the Middle East could raise global energy prices and support the
UAE’s external position, though a deeper deterioration could disrupt global financial and
trade flows. A permanent easing of international sanctions on Iran could benefit the UAE by
allowing the resumption of closer economic and financial linkages.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Against the backdrop of a strengthening economy and rising real estate prices, discussions focused on
appropriate macroeconomic policies, including gradual fiscal consolidation, mitigating risks from real
estate and GREs, and further strengthening the financial sector.

A. Pursuing Prudent Macroeconomic Policies
10.
Continuing on a path of fiscal consolidation in 2014 is adequate. The combined federal
and emirate budgets imply further fiscal consolidation this year. Staff agreed that continued fiscal
consolidation is appropriate, because it would undo earlier stimulus that is no longer needed as the
economic cycle strengthens and private credit growth picks up. It would also help reduce fiscal
vulnerabilities (indicated by an increased breakeven oil price) and bring the fiscal stance closer to
levels needed to bequeath future generations an equitable share of resources (Box 3). The federal
budget is balanced and Dubai, appropriately, plans to continue gradual consolidation that will help
further reduce its debt-related vulnerabilities. Abu Dhabi’s budget implies a large fiscal tightening
(estimated at nearly 6 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP), including reductions in security, defense,
and other current expenditures. Because budget amendments in Abu Dhabi in the course of the year
are likely to result in higher spending than initially budgeted, staff projected a more moderate
consolidation for 2014, which it felt would be appropriate under current cyclical circumstances. It
recommended a cautious approach to midyear budget amendments, particularly if aggregate
demand strengthens further.
11.
Dubai’s government debt sustainability has improved. Dubai’s government debt
(including extrabudgetary obligations) is expected to decline to 56 percent of Dubai GDP this year.
Although Dubai’s debt could still become unsustainable under severe shocks, the outlook has
improved: continued fiscal consolidation and improving growth prospects have been strengthening
Dubai’s resilience to external shocks (Appendix 1). Overall UAE gross government debt (15 percent
of GDP) is manageable, also considering the UAE’s large net foreign asset position.
12.
Medium-term fiscal plans are appropriate, though not sufficiently binding to guide
fiscal policy. The federal government plans a balanced budget until 2016, and Dubai targets
continued gradual consolidation. Abu Dhabi’s informal medium-term fiscal framework also aims at
consolidation, though the framework guides fiscal policy in the emirate only loosely. Staff
recommended rebalancing the composition of expenditure. For example, reducing energy and water
subsidies, while protecting those in need, would create fiscal space and improve energy efficiency. In
addition, limiting further increases in the wage bill would help maintain budgetary flexibility and
make private sector employment more attractive to nationals.
13.
The authorities are further strengthening intergovernmental fiscal coordination.
Spending is dominated by Abu Dhabi, with the federal government responsible for a smaller share
of spending than in any other country. Each emirate has full autonomy over its fiscal policies, but the
Fiscal Policy Coordination Council, supported by the Ministry of Finance, now prepares consolidated

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

backward-looking fiscal data for the UAE as a whole. Work on fiscal coordination is supported by a
self-financed program of IMF technical assistance.
14.
Individual governments are also reforming their budgets. The federal government has
introduced a three-year budget cycle with a thorough evaluation of costs between cycles. Spending
ceilings are set top-down and spending is presented on a program basis with associated
performance indicators. Dubai has a medium-term fiscal framework setting budget targets through
2017, though targets are not published. Abu Dhabi produces a report on the medium-term fiscal
outlook and has started work on performance-based budgeting. Staff recommended that Abu Dhabi
strengthen its annual budget process, to avoid frequent mid-year budget amendments, and to
adopt a formal medium-term fiscal framework to set more clearly the direction for fiscal policy for
the emirate and the UAE as a whole. Improvements in budgeting could also further increase the
efficiency of public spending (Box 4).
15.
The longstanding exchange rate peg has served the UAE well. As a commodity-based
open economy with open labor markets, the UAE would benefit little from expenditure switching
under flexible rates. Staff estimates of the three alternative CGER-type models produce widelydispersed exchange rate assessments (Appendix II). The projected current account balance is close
to the norm implied by the macro-balance approach, but is significantly below the level implied by
the external sustainability approach—pointing to the need to generate more savings and consistent
with fiscal consolidation. By contrast, the equilibrium exchange rate approach points to moderate
undervaluation. While short-term capital flows, such as through bond funds, have been more
vulnerable to the change in US monetary policy since mid-2013, external buffers in the form of
international reserves and sovereign wealth fund assets are ample, and higher interest rates have
not prevented rises in stock and real estate prices. Higher interest rates as a result of a normalization
of U.S. monetary policy, unless disruptive, would help the UAE mitigate the risk of potentially large
private credit growth.
16.
The recent pickup in private credit growth amid ample liquidity in the banking system
warrants close monitoring. Staff and the authorities agreed that should credit growth accelerate
significantly, tightening macroprudential regulations, such as the advances-to-stable-resources ratio,
capital adequacy ratio, risk weights for lending, or reserve requirements on time deposits, could be
appropriate to prevent excessive risk-taking and support the macroeconomic policy mix.

B. Managing Risks in Real Estate, GREs, and the Financial System
17.
Further policy action is needed to address potential risks from the real estate market,
particularly in case of continued rapid house price increases. The situation in the real estate
market is different from 2008 in that price increases still partially reflect a recovery from the postcrisis trough and demand (stemming to a large extent from foreign buyers) is significantly less bankfinanced. Nonetheless, by some measures, nominal residential real estate prices in Dubai have
already reached their 2008 peak. The rapid pace of price increases, if continued, could trigger an
intensification of destabilizing speculative demand, and thus warrants close monitoring. With the
majority of residential real estate purchases being cash-based, fee-based measures are likely to be

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

most effective in addressing speculation. The increase in Dubai’s real estate registration fee from 2
percent to 4 percent last October, along with regulatory measures to assure orderly market
conditions for new real estate development, was a welcome step. Staff and the authorities agreed
that imposing additional fees and restrictions on reselling off-plan properties would further
discourage speculative demand. In addition, staff recommended setting higher fees for reselling
properties within a relatively short time.
18.
Recently imposed macroprudential regulations are supporting these efforts. The new
maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgage lending and debt-service-to-income limits provide
banks with a buffer against undue exposures, while also helping to limit speculation.5 Staff
recommended that the CBU should further tighten these rules if real estate price increases remain
very high and if growth in real estate lending increases.
19.
GREs should closely coordinate and prioritize planned projects to avoid an
exaggerated supply response. Upcoming real estate and hospitality projects will be planned and
executed, to a large extent, by GREs. Staff recommended that these projects should continue to be
executed gradually and in line with expected demand, which will require close coordination and
oversight. Care should also be taken to prevent GRE activities from crowding out private sector
activity. Moreover, as some GREs are still highly indebted, it will be important to continue managing
upcoming debt repayments proactively, including using timely communication to guide market
expectations. Continued improvements in the availability of information on Dubai GRE debt,
including on the terms of asset transfers among GREs, and in their risk management, reporting, and
governance, will be important to facilitate a further strengthening of GRE balance sheets.
20.
The authorities agreed with the need for further policy actions in the real estate sector
and stressed their intention to further strengthen the GREs. They agreed that further measures,
including higher, targeted fees, may be needed to address potential speculative real estate demand.
While they felt that the recently introduced macroprudential regulations are sufficiently
comprehensive in the current situation, they agreed with the need to review these if real estate
prices continue to increase rapidly, and particularly if lending to the real estate sector should pick up
more markedly. They pointed out their intention to execute the new megaprojects gradually,
keeping their plans flexible and in line with demographic forecasts. With respect to servicing the
GREs’ debt, the authorities noted that GREs have been actively looking at refinancing options,
prepaying debt before maturity, diversifying funding sources, and extending maturities, taking
advantage of the low-interest-rate environment. They also stressed that most GREs are financially
5

The new regulation limits first-time mortgage loans for expatriates to 75 per cent (65 percent) of a property's value
that is worth less than AED5 million (more than AED5 million). For Emiratis, the limit is kept at 80 per cent (70
percent) of the property value if it is worth less than AED5 million (more than AED5 million). For subsequent property
purchases, expatriates are eligible to take loans up to 60 per cent of a property's value while UAE nationals are
allowed up to 65 per cent, regardless of the value of the property. For off-plan properties, all mortgages are
restricted to 50 per cent. Monthly repayments cannot exceed 50 per cent of a borrower's monthly income, and the
total loan amount cannot be larger than seven years' annual income in the case of an expatriate and eight years'
annual income for a national.

healthy, and that they aim at strengthening the commercial viability of the remaining GREs. The
authorities also pointed to improvements in transparency of the GREs, with those that are listed or
that issue debt disclosing their financials.
21.
In the context of a strong cyclical position and accelerating deposit growth, a
continued focus on the health of the banking system is warranted. The CBU conducted stress
tests to assess risks to the banking system. Liquidity stress tests implied that eight (mostly small)
banks would fall below a 60 percent liquidity

likely to be below the threshold.6 Solvency
stress tests with increases in sectoral NPLs ranging from 50 percent to 130 percent resulted in only
one bank with a Tier 1 capital ratio below 8 percent. The CBU recently introduced loan concentration
limits for GREs and local governments, which will help contain risks to banks’ balance sheets from
planned megaprojects.7 It will now be important to agree, as planned, on transition paths for banks
that exceed the new limits, while avoiding any further build-up of exposures in these banks.

The new regulation limits exposures to emirate governments and their noncommercial entities to 100 percent of
bank capital, with a 25 percent individual exposure limit to noncommercial entities. Commercial entities of the
Federal and Emirate governments also face a 100 percent aggregate and a 25 percent individual exposure limit.
Overall, the exposure to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers is limited to 25 percent of bank capital.
Banks exceeding the exposure limits were required to submit, to the central bank, plans for reducing their excess
exposures by at least 20 percent annually, thus complying with the limits within five years.

Amid ongoing monitoring of risks, strengthening the CBU’s supervisory toolkit would
help bolster the stability of the financial system further. Staff stressed the importance of
ongoing monitoring and reporting of risks, including through the CBU’s financial stability reports. In
this context, staff welcomed the CBU’s efforts to establish a financial stability stress index to identify
risks and vulnerabilities. Staff recommended further strengthening the toolkit available for enforcing
bank supervision through improvements to the sanction framework, and the authorities noted that
this would be done in the context of the forthcoming Financial Services Law. More broadly, an
assessment under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) could play an important role in
further strengthening the CBU as banking system regulator and supervisor, and other regulatory and
supervisory agencies, while facilitating further financial sector development.
23.
The authorities have stepped up the implementation of Basel III. They are planning to
phase in Basel III capital and liquidity standards over 2015–19, and are consulting with banks about
technical issues such as the definition of high-quality liquid assets, and about a simple liquidity rule
for smaller banks. In light of the significant liquidity and capital in the banking system, the CBU felt
that banks would be able to comply with the new standards.
24.
Staff stressed the importance of assuring the independence of banks’ decision making
amid significant interconnectedness among bank, GRE, and private enterprise board
members. Adherence to best practices in corporate governance and risk management is needed to
safeguard the independence of banks’ decision making. Staff recommended strict enforcement of
existing corporate governance rules—and tightening rules where weaknesses are identified—for
banks and GREs to address potential conflicts of interest (Box 5).
25.
Given the open nature of the economy and its geographic location, continued focus on
measures to mitigate risks stemming from money laundering is warranted. Increasing flows
from abroad, channeled to the banking sector and financial, real estate, and gold markets, including
through trade, create potential vulnerabilities related to possible illicit financial flows. Continuing to
strengthen the regime for anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) is essential to mitigate these risks. Following the adoption of the 2002 AML law, the
establishment of the AML suspicious cases unit in the CBU, and its increasing engagement in
international cooperation, amended AML legislation will come into force shortly.
26.
Staff recommended areas for further improvement in the AML/CFT framework. Once
the legislative and regulatory framework is upgraded, efforts should focus on conducting a national
risk assessment and strengthening the role of the supervisors of financial and nonfinancial
businesses and professions, including real estate agents, to ensure that they adequately apply
preventive measures including reporting of suspicious transactions commensurate with their risks.
More broadly, staff encouraged the authorities to continue improving their understanding of the
origins of financial flows and making further refinements to the identification of the beneficial
owners of deposits and loans in the UAE. An AML/CFT assessment in the context of the FSAP would
help define priority areas for further improvements. The authorities stressed their strong efforts in
the area of AML/CFT, including domestic regulation and international cooperation.

C. Structural and Statistical Issues
27.
Steering nationals towards private-sector jobs remains a priority. The nonhydrocarbon
private sector is expected to be the engine of growth and job creation in the medium term; yet only
12 percent of nationals currently work in the private sector. To increase the participation of nationals
in the private sector, the government is developing training and placement programs and
partnership initiatives with the private sector. It is also supporting internal labor mobility, providing
financial incentives to companies that hire highly skilled nationals, and supporting small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to which at least 10 percent of new government contracts are
expected to be awarded starting 2014.
28.
Timely development of the local debt market would provide an alternative source of
financing while supporting banks’ liquidity management. Developing the debt market would
reduce the reliance of governments, GREs, and private companies on external funding and bank
lending. It would also provide instruments for banks’ liquidity management under forthcoming Basel
III liquidity rules. Passage of the draft Public Debt Law, which is currently under consideration, would
allow the federal government to issue debt, while requiring the establishment of debt management
offices in the emirates. In addition, Abu Dhabi has made significant progress in technical
preparations for potential regular debt issuance.
29.
Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Significant improvements in the UAE’s statistical base are under way. The Ministry of Finance now
produces government finance statistics for general government. With IMF technical assistance, the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), in cooperation with the CBU, ministries, and other agencies, has
started a project to compile the International Investment Position, which will close an important
statistical gap, including for the reporting of foreign assets and debt. With the implementation of an
international transactions reporting system, improvements are also under way in the area of balance
of payments statistics. It will be important to ensure adequate staffing for balance of payments
statistics to make this reform a success. The participation of the NBS in the recently inaugurated
GCC-Stat is also an important step toward further improving the UAE’s statistical systems. Some
significant data gaps remain: for example, there is still only limited data on Dubai GRE debt and
potential contingent liabilities to the government; demographic and labor market statistics also
remain very limited.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Prospects for economic growth are broadly positive, though not without risks. The
nonhydrocarbon economy is expected to grow at around 5½ percent this year and beyond,
supported by an improving global economic environment, the UAE’s perceived safe-haven status,
returning economic confidence, and public projects, including the Expo 2020. Domestic and external
conditions pose risks to this largely favorable medium-term outlook, though the UAE’s sizeable
foreign assets provide significant buffers.
31.
With solid economic growth and a buoyant real estate sector, strengthening the
economy’s resilience and mitigating the risk of a renewed boom and bust are essential. This
entails further fiscal consolidation, considering additional measures to contain speculative demand
in the real estate sector, limiting new risk-taking by GREs, and strengthening financial sector
regulation.
32.
A continued focus on prudent fiscal policy will help manage aggregate demand and
set a clear direction for public spending. The strengthening economy suggests that a further
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is appropriate, reducing fiscal vulnerabilities and bringing spending
closer to levels that would allow saving an equitable share of oil wealth for future generations.
Strengthening the budget process in Abu Dhabi would support medium-term fiscal planning and
clarify fiscal policy for the emirate and the UAE as a whole. Staff welcomes the progress made and
ongoing efforts in fiscal coordination among the federal and emirate governments.
33.
The recent pickup in private credit growth, amid ample liquidity in the banking
system, warrants close monitoring. Facing strengthening domestic demand, monetary policy
choices are limited in the context of an open capital account and a fixed exchange rate. Should
credit growth accelerate significantly, tightening macroprudential regulations would be appropriate
to limit excessive risk-taking.
34.
The rapid increase in real estate prices, if continued, warrants further policy action.
Rapid price increases could trigger an intensification of potentially destabilizing speculative demand.
Setting higher fees for reselling properties within a relatively short time and imposing restrictions on
reselling off-plan properties would help address these risks. Should real estate lending pick up more
strongly, this should be complemented by tightening the recently imposed loan-to-value ratios and
debt-service-to-income limits.
35.
Building on the recent progress in restructuring the debt of GREs, Dubai should
continue to focus on strengthening the GRE sector. Continued close oversight of GREs by the
Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee will be essential to ascertain that projects continue to be executed
gradually and in line with expected demand, and to avoid new large-scale risk-taking by GREs that
are still in a vulnerable financial position. Further improvements in the transparency and governance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

of GREs, and a continuation of the proactive approach to upcoming debt maturities, will be essential
to support market confidence.
36.
The strong cyclical position and accelerating deposit growth highlight the need for a
continued focus on banking system soundness. Ongoing monitoring and reporting of risks,
including through the CBU’s financial stability reports, will be important in this context. Following
the introduction of loan concentration limits for GREs and local governments, it will now be
important to ensure that banks that do not meet these limits gradually reduce their exposures.
Adherence to best practices in corporate governance and risk management is needed to safeguard
the independence of banks’ decision making in light of the significant interconnectedness among
board members. The planned assessment under the FSAP will also be a welcome opportunity to
review the financial sector’s strengths and weaknesses.
37.
Building on progress with developing the AML/CFT framework, a continued focus is
needed to mitigate potential risks. Following the adoption of legislation and establishment of
AML infrastructure at the CBU, efforts should now focus on conducting a national risk assessment
and strengthening the regulatory framework and the role of the supervisors.
38.
Staff encourages the authorities to build on recent progress in improving statistics. It
will be important to maintain the recent momentum of strengthening economic statistics by
pressing ahead with their plan of compiling the International Investment Position and providing
adequate resources for improving the quality of overall balance of payments statistics. It will also be
essential to develop more comprehensive demographic and labor markets statistics, while
disseminating complete data on Dubai GRE debt and potential contingent liabilities to the
government.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. Real Estate Market Developments
The residential segment of the real estate market has recovered strongly in Dubai, and to a
lesser degree in Abu Dhabi. With the return of confidence in the real estate market, also helped by
a successful bid for the Expo 2020, residential property prices in Dubai have been increasing quickly,
though the momentum appears to have slowed in recent months. Some data sources suggest that
Dubai’s residential sale prices have already reached their previous peak in nominal terms. The
recovery in Abu Dhabi’s residential market has started much later than in Dubai and the price level is
still well below its peak.
Similar trends can be seen in residential rents. In Dubai, residential rental growth has accelerated
strongly, but rents are, so far, below their peak. The rental yield has been slowly declining. In Abu
Dhabi, rents started rising only in the second half of 2013 and remain well below their peak, with a
broadly stable rental yield. The recent removal of the 5 percent rent cap, together with the new
requirement for public sector employees to reside in Abu Dhabi, is expected to put an upward
pressure on rents.
Price-income and price-rent ratios can provide some guidance on valuation in the real estate
market. Dubai’s price-income ratio has been rising back to its 2008 peak, which could indicate a risk
of overvaluation. Price-rent ratios also increased in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
Other segments of the real estate market have been recovering much slower. Rent prices in
Dubai’s retail sector were broadly stable in 2013. Average daily hotel rates increased by 5 percent in
2013, supported by a 10 percent increase in tourists visiting Dubai. In the office segment, rental
growth has been slow amid a high vacancy rate of 29 percent. In Abu Dhabi, rental growth in the
commercial segments has also been sluggish, reflecting oversupply.
International experience suggests that real estate fees in particular can be a succesful tool for
reducing price pressures in real estate markets.1 For the UAE, real estate fees are especially
useful, given a largely cash-based market. Such fees could be raised substantially for properties resold within a short time (as was done, for example, in Hong Kong and Singapore). In addition,
imposing differentiated fees for reselling off-plan properties, as is currently under consideration,
could help further discourage speculative demand. These measures could be accompanied by
further tightening of macroprudential measures, such as loan-to-value ratios and debt-service-toincome ratios, in case rapid price growth continues and real estate lending accelerates. International
experience shows that countries that were faced with strengthening real estate cycles often
repeatedly tightened fees and macroprudential measures, in some cases thereby effectively
mitigating real estate–related risks to the economy.

Box 2. Capital Flows to the UAE
Capital inflows, alongside strong rises in real estate and stock market prices, reflect improved
confidence in the economy. Portfolio flows from equity ETFs and mutual funds indicate an increased
appetite by foreign investors for UAE securities. The equity allocations by ETFs and mutual funds to
the UAE have increased four-fold since end-2012, according to EPFR Global. By contrast, bond
allocations by ETFs and mutual funds have declined significantly within the same period, illustrating
risks related to international capital flow volatility. Both bond and equity funds have been posting
net inflows into the UAE since April 2014.
Capital flows to domestic banks are also on the rise. Their foreign liabilities rose 32 percent in 2013
(by $28 billion). By contrast, foreign banks’ claims on nonbank UAE sectors have been recovering
gradually. This reflects an improvement in market access by GREs, especially through syndicated
loans and bond issuances, allowing them to benefit from the low interest rate environment.

Box 3. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability Analysis in UAE
Staff’s fiscal sustainability analysis based on the permanent income hypothesis suggests that
the UAE’s fiscal stance is too expansionary to ensure intergenerational equity.¹ Staff’s baseline
fiscal consolidation path would reduce the gap between projected and sustainable nonhydrocarbon
deficits from about 10 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2013 to 5 percent in 2019 under baseline
assumptions. These estimates, however, are highly sensitive to assumptions (see chart). For example,
with a slightly lower real return on assets or a lower oil price, the sustainable nonhydrocarbon deficit
(benchmark) would be lower in 2019 by 2 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively.
Lower population growth or a higher rate of return on domestic investments, by contrast, would add
4 percentage points and 4½ percentage points, respectively, to the baseline. Fiscal consolidation in
staff’s baseline scenario would also reduce the fiscal breakeven oil price to about US$82 in 2019,
from US$84 in 2013.

Long-term sustainability assumes intergenerational equity by calculating a constant real per capita government
spending path (and related nonhydrocarbon deficit) that delivers a constant real per capita annuity to finance
government spending after hydrocarbon revenues are exhausted. The baseline calculations assume long-term values
of the real rate of return of assets, inflation, and population growth of 4 percent, 2 percent, and 1.5 percent,
respectively. Oil reserves are assumed to be depleted in 70 years and the oil price to be at US$87 per barrel in 2019
and to remain constant in real terms thereafter. The alternative scenarios assume (i) lower population growth by 0.5
percentage point, (ii) lower real return on assets by 0.5 percentage point, (iii) lower oil price by one standard
deviation (US$26.5), and (iv) more productive capital spending (half of domestic public investment is assumed to
yield the same rate of return as investments abroad).

Box 4. Public Spending Efficiency in UAE1
The efficiency of public investment spending compares favorably to GCC peers but could be
improved further. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Partial Free Disposal Hull (PFDH)
techniques measure the effectiveness of countries in transforming inputs (resources) into outputs
(infrastructure). 2 The quality of infrastructure was approximated using the infrastructure subcomponent of the Global Competitiveness Indicators, while inputs were measured as the public
capital stock. A higher estimated score implies the stronger efficiency. The UAE’s scores are among
the highest in the GCC, but are lower than those of some advanced economies with strong
institutions, such as Canada, Chile, and Singapore.

The federal government’s new approach to budgeting offers the promise of improved
spending efficiency. Traditionally, budgeting had a one-year horizon and a focus on the control of
inputs. Starting in 2011, the federal government adopted a top-down three-year budget in which
spending is organized into programs and now also services, and in which indicators of financial and
nonfinancial performance are tracked. Clarifying the objectives of spending, measuring performance,
and setting relatively firm spending limits over the medium term are all likely to improve the
efficiency of spending. While it is too soon to judge how successful the new approach is, experience
from other countries suggests, for example, that the difficulties of measuring performance, and the
consequent possibility of problems such as gaming, make it important not to rely exclusively on
performance targets to generate good performance, and that organizational culture and the
rigorous evaluation of spending programs outside the budget also matter. Further, most public
spending in the UAE is carried out by Abu Dhabi and Dubai and, to a smaller extent, the other
emirates. Greater efficiency gains might therefore be possible through further strengthening of the
emirates’ budget processes.

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

The main difference between these approaches is that the DEA compares each country against a fixed sample,
whereas the PFDH uses repeated randomized subsamples, thus reducing sensitivity to outliers.

Box 5. How Independent Are the Boards of Directors in UAE Banks?
The board of directors plays an important role in the corporate governance of banks. It has
overall responsibility for banks, including the approval and oversight of the bank’s objectives, risk
tolerance and management, internal controls system, corporate governance, and compensation
system.1 It is also responsible for overseeing senior management. The board should exercise
objective judgment independently of senior management, shareholders, and any other interest. A
good practice is to appoint a large number of qualified, independent nonexecutive board members,
which may also include board members representing minority shareholders. The revised draft 2006
CBU guidelines also promote the appointment of independent nonexecutive directors and contain
indicative criteria for their selection.2
Questions about the independence of the board of directors in UAE banks could arise in light
of close inter-linkages (see Text Figure). The 20 domestic UAE banks have a total of 162 board
members, who are associated with 492 different job positions in other institutions, with an average
of three positions per board member. 109 board members hold positions directly in the controlling
shareholder institutions, 40 board members are also associated with institutions that might have an
indirect interest in the controlling shareholder institutions, including public sector officials, while 13
board members only hold positions in their respective banks. In total, UAE banks have 18 controlling
shareholder institutions that can appoint board members. As a result of these interlinkages, this
large network of related institutions, shareholders, and board members could pose challenges to the
objectivity and independence of board decisions in UAE banks.
The OECD et al. (2009) also found similar results for a group of MENA banks (excluding UAE
banks).3 They indicated that controlling shareholder institutions often appoint the entire board,
which undermines the objectivity and independence of the board. They also reported that 54
percent of MENA banks do not have independent directors and that national guidelines require that
at least half of the board of directors be nonexecutive directors.

1/ As a result of changes in economic sector classifications in bank report forms during 2013, readings for annual percent changes
for broad money, private sector credit, and customer deposits for 2013 are inaccurate. The central bank estimates that private
sector credit growth was around 8.2 percent in 2013.

Dubai’s Government Debt Sustainability Analysis
Dubai’s government debt sustainability has improved on account of better growth prospects and fiscal
consolidation plans. Having peaked at 66 percent of Dubai’s GDP in 2009, the government debt declined to 60
percent in 2013. The baseline scenario assumes a steady recovery of growth, which is projected to accelerate in the
medium term due to the upcoming Expo 2020 event, and a gradual fiscal consolidation in Dubai going forward.

Sources: Country authorities; and IMF staff projections.

Dubai’s debt could still become unsustainable under severe shocks. A sharp decline in GDP growth in 2014 (by
¾ of standard deviation from the baseline) and a gradual recovery in 2015–19 would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by
11 percentage points in 2019 compared to the baseline. Under a severe global downturn scenario, which assumes a
real GDP shock, lower real interest rates, and deterioration in the primary balance in the medium term, Dubai’s
government debt would increase to 71 percent of GDP in 2019. A scenario that combines a global downturn with a
real estate shock, under which the government would take over 20 percent of the GREs’ total debt in the medium
term, would imply a substantial increase in the government debt-to-GDP ratio, to 86 percent, more than twice as
large as under the baseline.

Appendix II. Exchange Rate Assessment
Estimates from the standard methodologies for exchange rate assessment indicate mixed results. As a
commodity-based, open economy with open labor markets, the UAE would benefit little from expenditure
switching under flexible rates. The macroeconomic balance approach does not point to significant
misalignment, while the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests moderate undervaluation. The
projected medium-term current account, which is significantly below the norm of the external sustainability
approach, suggests a need for increased public sector savings, consistent with the long-term fiscal
sustainability analysis in Box 3.
1.
The real exchange rate has been
appreciating in line with the nominal
effective exchange rate. Following a period
of depreciation since 2009, the trade-weighted
real effective exchange rate (REER) index
appreciated by 4.5 percent from December
2012 to March 2014. The nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) has appreciated by 8
percent over the same period, in line with the
U.S. dollar (Figure 1). Most of the appreciation
took place in 2013. Since December 2013, the
rates have been broadly stable.

The equilibrium exchange rate approach indicates a moderate undervaluation. For many
commodity exporters, commodity price fluctuations can explain exchange rate changes (Cashin,

The macroeconomic balance approach indicates that the currency has remained in line with
fundamentals. In contrast to the equilibrium exchange rate approach, which directly compares the REER
to its determinants, the macroeconomic balance (MB) compares the projected current account balance to
a number of macroeconomic determinants of the current account, including the nonhydrocarbon fiscal
balance, hydrocarbon wealth,

fundamentals (Table 1).
4.
The external sustainability approach indicates an overvaluation of the dirham. The
underpinning of this approach is that the sustainability of the current account trajectory requires that the
net present value (NPV) of all future oil and financial or investment income (wealth) be equal to the NPV
of imports of goods and services net of nonhydrocarbon exports. The current account norm is that which
supports intergenerational equity, given volatile oil prices and exhaustible oil reserves, through an
appropriate pace of accumulation of net foreign assets. This approach indicates that current account
surpluses are too low (Figure 3). Using conventional elasticities (Faruqee and Isard, 1998), a devaluation
of about 15 percent would be required, but some studies (Hakura and Billmeier, 2008) indicate there is

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 2014)

Technical cooperation between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Bank began in 1980 and a
framework agreement for annual technical cooperation was signed to cover a two-year period
(1995-96) that featured two studies: a comprehensive national health assessment study and a
government computer center restructuring study. Assistance was later requested in agriculture and
water resource management, and in environmental impact assessment. Cooperation was modest
until recently, and covered a few key areas including debt market development (2008) and labor
market development (2011).
More recently, in 2013, the Ministry of Finance conducted an awareness program about Bank Group
services to various audiences which helped increase the level of engagement with the Bank. The
Bank recently helped prepare Public Expenditure Reviews (PER) in the health and higher education
sectors, and is currently preparing PERs for the transport and for the education (schools) sectors.
The Bank also helped formulate recommendations to enhance the new Universal Health Insurance
and its financial sustainability, and is assisting the Ministry of Finance to set up a tax information
exchange unit. Looking forward, the Bank hopes to provide assistance in improving the efficiency
and effectiveness of service delivery, improving labor market management, and further enhancing
the investment climate.
The Bank has also delivered technical assistance to individual Emirates:

4



In Abu Dhabi, the Bank assisted the government better target food security programs, and
is helping the Judicial Department to become one of the better performing judicial
departments by enhancing institutional capacity and performance.



In Dubai, the Bank provided assistance in the analysis of retirement planning options for
expatriate workers. In addition, at the request of the Knowledge and Human Development
Authority of Dubai – the regulator of private education, the Bank helped enhance
governance and institutional capacity in this domain.



In Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), the Bank assisted in promoting a better investment climate,
mobilizing private investment, and devising a multi-jurisdictional student loan program.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 2014)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are substantial shortcomings on
the dissemination of accounts of government-related entities (GREs). In particular, there is limited data on
GRE debt and contingent liabilities to the government. The federal and individual emirates’ agencies have
improved the availability and quality of the statistics, but more progress is needed. The adoption of the
Federal Statistics Law on May 18, 2009, and the establishment of an independent National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) are important steps in establishing a statistical system at the federal level. While the Law
expressly requires all agencies and local statistical centers to provide data as required by the NBS, its
success will depend on implementing arrangements, staffing, funding and training.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1968 SNA. GDP is compiled annually with
a lag of around 5 months. Some progress has been made in improving the source data but further work is
needed to improve updating procedures, and quarterly indicators are not available.
Price statistics: Consumer price indexes and GDP deflators need further harmonization at the federal
level.
Government finance statistics: In 2011, GFSM 2001 was introduced by the federal and several emirate
governments, and the institutional arrangement to ensure adequate data provision was established. This
consolidation should complement initiatives to establish debt management units at both the emirate and
federal levels. The UAE submitted its fiscal accounts to the GFS Yearbook for the first time in 2012.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has shifted the responsibility for compiling and disseminating
monetary data to the Banking Supervision Department, in order to improve the timeliness of data to
monthly frequency with less than a month lag. Although some monetary aggregates and FSIs are already
published on a monthly basis, the Banking Supervision Department has not been trained in MFSM 2000
and the published data do not follow the recommended methodology.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as the
data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not published
or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive Balance of Payments and IIP is however
within the reach of the UAE if the central bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of Economy strengthen their
capacity and receive appropriate support at the high level. The CBU has introduced an international
transactions reporting system to strengthen the quality of balance of payments statistics. The authorities
started a project to compile the International Investment Position, which will close an important statistical
gap.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the GDDS since July 31, 2008. The metadata were last updated in 2008 (Monetary and BOP),
2008 (National Accounts and Prices), and 2008 (Government Finance). No Data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the United Arab
Emirates

On June 26, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates.1
The United Arab Emirates has continued to benefit from its perceived safe-haven status amid
regional instability. The economic recovery has been solid, supported by the tourism and
hospitality sectors, and a rebounding real estate sector. While growth in oil production
moderated, public projects in Abu Dhabi and buoyant growth in Dubai’s service sectors
continued to underpin growth, which reached 5.2 percent in 2013. The real estate sector has been
recovering quickly in some segments, especially in the Dubai residential market. As a result,
headline inflation started to increase moderately. The current account and fiscal surpluses
continue to be sizable owing to high hydrocarbon prices.
The macroeconomic outlook is positive. Economic growth is expected at 4.8 percent in 2014 and
about 4.5 percent in coming years, supported by a number of megaprojects announced over the
past 18 months and the successful bid for the World Expo 2020. Inflation is projected to further
increase, driven by higher rents. The strengthening real estate cycle, particularly in the Dubai
residential market, could attract increased speculative demand, creating the risk of unsustainable
price dynamics and an eventual, potentially disruptive correction.
Dubai has made significant progress managing financial obligations from the 2008/9 crisis. The
major debt restructurings from that crisis have been completed, and US$20 billion in Dubai
government debt to the central bank and Abu Dhabi was rolled over at reduced interest rates.
Nakheel has begun to prepay bank debt due in 2015. Dubai World has stepped up asset sales

(sometimes to other government-related entities) to raise cash and repay debt under its debt
restructuring agreement, though markets continue to monitor Dubai World’s capacity to make
forthcoming repayments.
The banking system maintains significant liquidity and capital buffers, and nonperforming loans
have begun declining from their post-crisis peak. Following years of credit-less recovery, lending
to the private sector has begun to rebound amid accelerating deposit growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the solid economic growth and favorable outlook. They noted,
however, potential risks from rapidly rising residential real estate prices and, more broadly, from
the economy’s dependence on the global oil market, despite some recent progress in economic
diversification. Directors took note of the UAE’s sizeable buffers that could be used in case of a
shock.
Directors regarded the continued focus on prudent fiscal policy as appropriate. They particularly
welcomed the continued gradual consolidation plans and bringing spending closer to levels that
would allow saving an equitable share of oil wealth for future generations. They also noted that
strengthening the budget process in Abu Dhabi would support better fiscal planning. Directors
commended the authorities’ continued efforts to strengthen coordination of fiscal policies
between the federal and emirate governments.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg has served the UAE well. In case of a pronounced
acceleration in credit growth, Directors recommended tightening macroprudential regulations to
limit excessive risk taking.
Directors emphasized the need for further policy action if real estate prices continue to increase
rapidly. They welcomed the recent introduction of targeted macroprudential measures and the
increase in Dubai’s real estate registration fee, and encouraged additional fees for reselling
properties within a relatively short time to discourage speculative demand. Directors felt that
these measures could be complemented by further tightening the recently introduced
macroprudential policies if real estate lending increased more strongly.
Directors welcomed the recent progress in restructuring the debt of Dubai’s government-related
entities (GREs), and stressed the need for continued strengthening of the GRE sector. They
cautioned that continuous and close oversight of GREs will be essential to ascertain that projects

are executed in line with expected demand, and to avoid further risk taking. In this context,
Directors encouraged continued improvements in the transparency and governance of GREs and
a continuation of the proactive management of upcoming debt repayments.
Directors took note of the ample liquidity and capital buffers in the banking sector, and
encouraged the authorities to continue to focus on financial soundness on the back of a strong
cyclical position and accelerating deposit growth. They welcomed the recently introduced loan
concentration limits on GREs and emirate governments. Directors encouraged the development
of domestic debt markets, which would support banks’ liquidity management in preparation for
the introduction of the Basel III liquidity framework. They also encouraged the authorities to
build on progress with developing the AML/CFT framework to mitigate potential risks.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve statistics by pressing ahead with
their plan to compile the International Investment Position, providing adequate resources for
improving the quality of balance-of-payments estimates, improving demographic and labor
statistics, and disseminating complete data on Dubai GRE debt and potential contingent
liabilities to the government.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on United Arab Emirates
June 26, 2014
1.
At the outset, I would like to thank staff for the constructive Article IV discussions
with the United Arab Emirates authorities as well as their valuable policy recommendations.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The United Arab Emirates continues to record a high economic growth rate in an
environment of relative price stability. Growth was driven mainly by robust tourism activity,
the trade and transport sectors and, more recently, a rebound in real estate activity. These
developments reflect the country’s diversification policy, which contributed to a marked
expansion of the non-hydrocarbon sector and are expected to sustain strong growth going
forward. Investments related to Expo 2020 as well as the expanding tourism and real estate
sectors will further support the growth momentum.
3.
While UAE’s growth prospects are favorable, the authorities remain vigilant about
macroeconomic risks, including those related to speculative real estate demand and a
possible decline in oil and gas prices. However, these risks are cushioned by the country’s
substantial foreign assets and fiscal surplus which provide ample buffers and policy space to
mitigate these potential risks.
Fiscal Policy
4.
The fiscal position remains strong, and is characterized by budget surpluses, low
gross debt, and sizeable reserves. Notwithstanding this strong position, the authorities are
pursuing their fiscal consolidation plan to lower the budget’s dependence on oil revenues.
5.
Fiscal consolidation will continue at a stronger pace in 2014 at both the federal and
emirates levels. The government of Abu Dhabi intends to eliminate spending overruns and to
reduce current expenditures, while prioritizing health, education and capital spending. These
measures are likely to increase the overall fiscal surplus. The authorities are also considering
several initiatives to reduce the dependence of fiscal revenues on the hydrocarbon sector,
including the introduction of a value-added tax in the context of a GCC-wide initiative.
6.
Government Related Entities (GREs), which encountered severe financial difficulties
during the financial crisis, have made considerable progress in restructuring and financing
their debts. This was achieved through a combination of refinancing, assets sales, and early
repayments of liabilities as domestic economic conditions improved and real estate prices
increased. In addition, large intergovernmental debt was rolled over, such as the US$ 20
billion in Dubai government debt which was extended to 2018 at reduced rates. The
authorities are determined to strengthen the commercial viability of the remaining GREs,
who have not yet completed their restructuring efforts, and to increase their transparency and
disclosure policies.

2
Financial Sector Policies
7.
The financial sector continued to perform strongly, and the banking sector remains
highly capitalized and profitable. Following a number of years of sluggish growth, bank
credit growth has picked up and non-performing loans have begun to decline for the first
time since the crisis.
8.
The Central Bank of the UAE’s (CBU) regulatory and macroprudential policies are
aimed at preserving the soundness of the financial sector. The CBU is reviewing and
updating existing regulations to strengthen the prudential framework in line with the
requirements of Basel III. It is currently in the process of finalizing new liquidity regulations,
which are expected to be issued later this year. Moreover, staff’s analysis and the CBU’s
stress testing point to the resiliency of the banking sector to severe shocks. The CBU is also
working on establishing a financial stability stress index to identify possible vulnerabilities
and monitor risks in the banking system.
9.
The authorities will continue to closely monitor credit growth in the banking system
and developments in the real estate markets as well as banks’ exposure to these markets.
They are confident that the recently introduced macroprudential measures are sufficient for
the time-being, taking into consideration that real-estate prices are recovering from very low
levels. These measures include regulations for mortgage lending and loan concentration
limits for GREs and local governments. The cap introduced on banks’ loan concentration to
emirate governments and GREs will help contain bank exposures to mega projects as
elaborated by staff. The new maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgage lending as well as
debt-service-to-income limits will help to control speculation. Moreover, the authorities stand
ready to tighten macroprudential regulations to prevent excessive risk-taking if needed.
These measures could include higher fees to limit speculative real estate demand.
Other Reforms
10.
The federal government intends to further improve the business environment in order
to attract foreign investment. Labor policy will continue to focus on increasing the
employment of nationals in the private sector. In this regard, a number of initiatives have
been taken to develop training and partnerships with the private sector.
11.
The authorities have taken steps to improve the quality and dissemination of
economic statistics. They have improved GFS reporting and started a project to compile the
International Investment Position with IMF technical assistance. They have also begun
implementing an international transactions reporting system for the balance of payments.
