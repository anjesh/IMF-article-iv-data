Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Dominica
Approved by Antônio Furtado (WHD) and Michele Shannon (SPR)
April 27, 2010



Discussions. Article IV consultation discussions were held in Roseau during
January 18–28, 2010. The mission comprised Messrs. Monroe (head), Gonzalez-Garcia, Lemus
and Tashu (all WHD), and ECCB and CDB staff also participated. Mr. McGoldrick (OED) joined
the concluding meeting. The mission met with Prime Minister Skerrit, the Cabinet, the Financial
Secretary, and other senior government officials, as well as representatives of the private sector.



Background. The global downturn has adversely affected the Dominican economy through
lower stayover tourist arrivals, FDI inflows, and remittances from Dominicans abroad, but not as
severely as other Eastern Caribbean economies. Dominica has benefited from a relatively
favorable fiscal position, which allowed the government to respond to the global slowdown by
maintaining capital spending at the high post-hurricane level in 2008.



Focus of the consultation. The discussions centered on policies to ensure fiscal sustainability,
reduce financial sector vulnerability, and enhance the medium-term outlook for growth.



Key policy recommendations. The fiscal stance for FY2009/10 continues to be based on an
appropriate target of 3 percent of GDP for the primary surplus. However, in the next three years,
additional spending to be financed by external loans would imply a substantial weakening of the
primary surplus. To ensure debt sustainability, a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP should be
restored as soon as possible. In the financial sector, the collapse of the Trinidad and Tobagobased CL Financial Group and the large role played by credit unions underscore the need to
strengthen the supervision of non-bank financial institutions. Resolution of the CL Financial
subsidiary British American Insurance Company (BAICO) should proceed promptly and the
financial difficulties of a second subsidiary, the Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO), will
also require close monitoring. In addition, the authorities should continue to make progress with
structural reforms geared toward improving the business environment.



Fund relations. In July 2009, the Executive Board approved a disbursement of SDR 3.28 million
(about US$5.1 million) under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility
(RAC-ESF). Dominica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The last Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2008.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Dominica, like other ECCU members, depends on tourism, foreign investment and
remittances, and has high debt, openness, and disaster risks. However, in many ways,
Dominica is an outlier, with a stronger macroeconomic framework, a less developed tourism
sector, and a larger share of agriculture in GDP. As a result, the impact of the global downturn
has been less severe than in other Eastern Caribbean countries, and economic activity in 2009
contracted only slightly.
In recent years, Dominica has maintained a prudent fiscal stance, anchored on a primary
surplus of 3 percent of GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 130 percent in 2003 to 84 percent
in 2009, which has increased the government’s flexibility to respond to shocks, in particular, by
maintaining capital spending in 2009 at the high post-hurricane level in 2008. The latter was
facilitated by the strong performance of the VAT, which, despite elevated spending levels,
allowed the government to maintain a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP in
FY2008/09-FY2009/10.
However, additional spending to be financed by external loans would imply a substantial
weakening of the primary surplus in the next three years. The government agreed with the
Export-Import Bank of China on a concessional loan amounting to 11 percent of GDP for
projects in education and infrastructure, about 7 percent of GDP of which would be for new
spending. This will result in less favorable debt dynamics and potential credibility costs. Staff
encourages the authorities to maintain a primary surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP and urges
them to return to the fiscal anchor (a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP) as soon as possible.
The government was considering an additional loan of US$60 million (16 percent of GDP) for a
tourism resort. This additional borrowing would likely prevent Dominica from reaching the
ECCB debt-to-GDP ratio target of 60 percent by the target date of 2020. Staff noted that it would
be of paramount importance to carefully evaluate the project’s viability and involve a private
strategic partner, which authorities are actively pursuing.
Strengthening the supervision of the financial sector should be a priority. The collapse of the
CL Financial Group and the large role played by credit unions underscore the need to strengthen
the Financial Services Unit. ECCU members are making progress toward creating a new
company to take over BAICO’s operations in the region but finding sufficient funds to capitalize
the new company will be a challenge. In addition, the financial difficulties of CLICO will require
close monitoring. The mission emphasized the need for close monitoring of the Agricultural and
Industrial Development Bank due to potential contingent fiscal liabilities and recommended an
on-site examination.
Progress with structural reforms has been substantial. Dominica will benefit from automation
of customs and land titling, the appointment of a second judge to hear civil matters, and the
improvement of airport facilities. The medium-term growth challenge is to manage the transition
from bananas to tourism and diversified agro industries, and to foster private sector-led growth
and poverty reduction.

4
I. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT
1.
Dominica is a highly vulnerable, small island economy. It shares many
characteristics with other Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) members
(Figures 1-4): it depends on tourism, foreign investment, and remittances; has a high debt
level; has large current account deficits; and is vulnerable to external shocks due to its high
degree of openness and elevated risk of natural disasters. Like other small island states, it has
a relatively large government. Commodity exports have shown a secular downward trend for
some decades, and the erosion of EU trade preferences has reduced implicit transfers from
5 percent of GDP in 1996–2001 to 1½ percent in 2001–05.
2.
However, in many ways, Dominica is an outlier within the ECCU. Growth has
historically been lower than in other ECCU economies, particularly during 2001–05. The
underperformance reflects its less-developed tourism sector and greater reliance on
agriculture. These characteristics contributed to a relatively stronger performance during the
global downturn.1 Dominica’s emigration rate is particularly high—more than 30 percent of
the labor force has emigrated—and its population is in fact falling. In 2003, around one third
of the population -was below the poverty line, and inequality -was high.2 Dominica receives a
high level of external grants, and, within the ECCU, had the lowest per capita GDP in 2008
of US$4,931. Dominica has had a relatively high number of natural disasters even compared
with other ECCU countries; most recently, Hurricanes Dean and Omar in 2007–08 together
caused damages of 35 percent of GDP.
3.
Dominica has a relatively stronger fiscal position than other ECCU members,
and has made greater progress with debt reduction. It put its fiscal house in order after
the 2001–02 crisis, with Fund support, and established a fiscal anchor of a 3 percent of GDP
primary surplus, which has often been exceeded.3 The public debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen
sharply. As a result, Dominica has been well positioned to undertake rehabilitation and
reconstruction spending in the wake of natural disasters and to respond to external shocks.

1

In 2008, agriculture accounted for 16 percent of GDP, compared to an average of 5 percent of GDP in the rest
of the ECCU. By contrast, tourism accounted for only 8 percent of GDP, compared to an average of 13 percent
of GDP in the rest of the ECCU.
2
3

See the 2003 Country Poverty Assessment.

These reforms were supported by a Stand-by Arrangement in 2002–03 and a Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement in 2003–06. In addition, in 2008, the Executive Board approved SDR 2.05 million
(25 percent of quota) in emergency assistance to help the government deal with the effects of Hurricane Dean,
and, as noted above, in 2009 the Board approved a RAC-ESF disbursement.

5
4.
The main drivers of inflation in Dominica, as in the rest of the ECCU, have been
international fuel and food prices. Annual average inflation in Dominica during 2001–07
was only 1.9 percent. However, owing to international fuel and food price hikes, average
inflation reached 6.4 percent in 2008.
5.
Dominica’s Growth and Social Protection Strategy (GSPS) guides medium-term
economic policies. The main goal of the GSPS is to foster economic growth and reduce
poverty while reducing public debt. These objectives are to be pursued by maintaining
prudent fiscal policies, strengthening the oversight of the financial sector, undertaking
structural reforms to activate the economy, and improving the targeting of social assistance.
6.
The authorities have implemented, to a large degree, the recommendations from
the 2008 Article IV Consultation. Specifically: (i) in the fiscal area, a primary surplus of
3 percent of GDP was achieved in FY2008/09; (ii) regarding regulation and supervision of
the financial sector, the authorities have continued to build the capacity of the Financial
Services Unit (although the collapse of the CL Financial Group underscores the need for
further progress); (iii) to improve disaster preparedness, they have continued to participate in
the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF); and (iv) to improve the business
climate, structural reforms are being implemented including the automation of customs and
land titling, plans to expand airport facilities, and the appointment of a second judge to hear
civil matters. The authorities are continuing their efforts to enhance the diversification of the
economy in particular by promoting the tourism sector.
7.
National elections were held in December 2009 and Dominica scores well on a
number of governance indicators. The increase in the Dominica Labor Party’s majority
suggests a strong mandate to continue with the government’s economic and political agenda.
Dominica has strong ratings for voice and accountability, political stability, government
effectiveness, control of corruption, regulatory quality, and the rule of law.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
8.
The global downturn has adversely affected the Dominican economy through
lower tourism arrivals, FDI inflows and remittances, albeit less severely than other
ECCU economies (Appendix I). Real GDP is estimated to have declined by only 0.3 percent
in 2009. Total tourism receipts contracted by 16 percent during 2009. This decline reflected
falling stayover arrivals after the Reunion 2008 event and greater discounting by hotels in
2009. The decline was partly offset by extraordinary growth in cruise arrivals. FDI and
remittances inflows dropped in 2009 by 51 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

6

9.
In response to the global slowdown, the government decided to maintain capital
spending in 2009 at the high post-hurricane level in 2008. Despite high capital spending,
the overall fiscal position remained in surplus during FY 2008/09 (July–June) and so far in
FY 2009/10. This reflects primarily continuing strong performance of the VAT introduced in
2006.4 The strength in tax receipts also helped finance a scaling up of social assistance to
protect the poor from the effects of the 2008 spike in food and fuel prices, as well as from the
impact of the global economic downturn.
10.
Consumer price inflation has picked up. The CPI increased by 4.4 percent (yoy)
through February 2010, as continuing increases in world food and fuel prices were passed
through. On a period average basis, inflation was close to zero.
11.
The external current account deficit decreased to 28 percent of GDP in 2009. In
2008, the deficit had widened to 32 percent of GDP due to higher reconstruction-related and
fuel imports. Lower FDI-related and fuel imports in 2009 are estimated to have more than
offset lower tourism receipts and remittances.
12.
Monetary aggregates show steady growth and the banking system has remained
resilient. In the 12 months to December 2009, banking sector credit to the private sector
grew by 6.9 percent and broad money by 10 percent. Prudential indicators suggest that banks
are liquid and well capitalized. Nonperforming loans have declined, although banks have
restructured loans in some cases. The average nonperforming loans ratio and capital-based
soundness indicators remain above prudential norms, although returns on assets have
declined markedly in recent years.

4

VAT collections were 10 percent, 11 percent and 12 percent of GDP in FY 2006/07, FY 2007/08 and
FY 2008/09, respectively. Dominica’s VAT productivity ratio relative to GDP is superior to most small island
economies, according to the Fiscal Affairs Department.

7

13.
The collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group has exposed
regional weaknesses in the regulation of nonbanks. In Dominica, the total exposure of
residents to two insurance subsidiaries of the Group offering deposit-like annuity products
amounts to about EC$194 million (19.4 percent of GDP). The eight KPMG judicial
managers appointed in each ECCU jurisdiction for the British American Insurance Company
(BAICO) issued a joint report in October 2009 finding that the company is insolvent and
illiquid. The ECCU member authorities are making progress in the creation of a new
company to take over BAICO’s operations in the region. Another subsidiary with operations
in the ECCU, the Colonial Life Insurance Company of Barbados (CLICO), has been facing
liquidity problems, and has been barred from writing new insurance business in Barbados.
14.
There is no clear evidence of fundamental misalignment of the exchange rate.
The CPI-based real effective exchange rate has been on a declining trend since 2002 and is
an estimated 2 percent below equilibrium when assessed using the fundamentals-based
approach (Appendix II). Other assessments give mixed results. An approach based on the
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis suggests that the real exchange rate at end 2008
was undervalued by 9 percent. However, the macroeconomic balance approach indicates an
overvaluation of 7 percent as the medium-term current account is 2.6 points of GDP above
the current account norm. The conflicting indicators may reflect structural changes, including
the improved macroeconomic environment after the 2001–02 crisis, and the prevalence of
external shocks. Dominica has increased its share of ECCU and Caribbean stayover arrivals
in recent years, which suggests that competitiveness may in fact be improving.
15.
Dominica has achieved some success in improving social conditions. It has already
reached or made significant progress toward several of the Millennium Development Goals,
by raising primary enrollment to 99 percent, eliminating gender disparities in education, and
reducing child mortality from 23 per 1000 in 1990 to 13 per 1000 in 2006. However, poverty
is high by Caribbean standards, with 40 percent of households in poverty and 10 percent of
households very poor, according to the 2003 Country Poverty Assessment.
16.
The near to medium-term economic outlook is modestly positive. With the
recovery of the global economy and expected improvements in international trade and
tourism activities, the Dominican economy is expected to grow by 1½ percent in 2010. The
downside risks are related to a potentially very slow recovery in advanced economies, which

8
would adversely affect tourism activity. In addition, a rebalancing of global demand could
imply weaker demand for tourism services from Dominica’s main source markets.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy and Reforms
17.
Dominica has generally maintained a prudent fiscal stance, anchored on a 3 percent of
GDP target for the primary surplus that allows for a steady decline in the public debt-to-GDP
ratio. The introduction of a VAT in 2006 has contributed to a sustained increase in tax
revenue, while the authorities have also been successful in containing current expenditure.
The public debt has declined significantly, supported by the 2004–05 debt restructuring,5 a
major reduction in the fiscal deficit, and the emphasis put on grants and concessional loans to
finance capital expenditure. Notwithstanding these efforts, public debt remains high.
18.
The authorities believe that the benchmark primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP
is achievable in FY2009/10, far better than expected at the time of the July 2009
RAC-ESF request. Capital spending is expected to slow slightly during the second half of
the fiscal year, reflecting implementation constraints, and the government intends to slow the
pace of spending on goods and services to achieve this target.
19.
However, the government has recently taken a large loan that risks undermining
fiscal performance in coming years. The government agreed with the Export-Import Bank
of China on a concessional loan of US$40 million (11 percent of GDP) for projects in
education and infrastructure. About US$24 million (7 percent of GDP) of the total would
represent new expenditure and external financing not previously incorporated in the fiscal
projections.6 This expenditure and the existing financing pipeline from other creditors will
imply a weakening in the primary surplus in the period FY2010/11–FY2012/13 during
execution of the loan.

5

The government is continuing with good-faith efforts to reach collaborative debt restructuring agreements with
holdouts. The government will continue to make debt service payments into an escrow account at the ECCB on
the terms of the restructured debt, in the event that holdouts agree to these terms.

6

The terms of the loans are 2 percent interest, 5 years grace, and 20 years maturity, which imply a grant
element of 36 percent.

9

20.
This deviation from the fiscal anchor will result in less favorable debt dynamics
and may entail credibility costs.7 The mission encouraged the authorities to maintain a
primary surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP during FY2010/11–FY2012/13, and to return to
3 percent thereafter. This policy would allow Dominica to reach the ECCB target of reducing
the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent by 2017, one year later than anticipated at the time of the
RAC-ESF request (July 2009), but still three years ahead of the ECCB’s 2020 target date.
21.
Moreover, the government was considering a large additional loan from China
of US$60 million (16 percent of GDP), which would be used to finance construction of a
tourism resort. The mission noted that projects of this nature carry considerable commercial
risks and uncertain rates of return, and are likely to be more successfully managed by the
private sector. This particular project would likely prevent Dominica from reaching the
ECCB debt-to-GDP target by 2020: only with a considerable positive impact of the resort
project on GDP growth would the target would be reached (Appendix III).8 In addition to
carefully considering the effects of additional borrowing on the debt trajectory, it will be of
paramount importance to base their decision on a rigorous, independent assessment of the
resort project’s viability, to secure concessional terms, and to involve a private strategic
partner. The authorities noted that they were already exploring potential partnership
arrangements.
22.
The authorities are working to strengthen debt management and developing a
medium-term debt management strategy, with MCM assistance.9 Improved debt
management is essential given the high level of indebtedness and the substantial risks to the
current downward trajectory of debt ratios. The debt management strategy would improve
institutional arrangements and build on the current approach that focuses on the less costly
sources of financing; it would also contain a plan for managing financial risk and accessing
grant financing. Staff suggested that the authorities also consider expanding the investor base
cautiously via the ECCU’s Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) (Appendix IV).

7

The growth impact of the loan is uncertain as most materials would be imported and the investment in
education is likely to take some time to yield a return.
8

In this scenario, it is assumed that the project increases the rate of GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points in
2010–12, and by one percentage point in each of the five subsequent years.

9

At the request of the authorities, an MCM mission visited Dominica during October 2009 to provide advice on
debt management.

10

23.
The authorities are continuing with fiscal reforms. These comprise completing the
income tax reform, improving tax administration, modernizing customs, and continuing to
move towards a medium-term expenditure framework.


Income tax reform. The final phase of a three-year income tax reform became
effective on January 1, 2010. It



Tax administration reform. Although tax administration capacity is strong, as
evidenced by the performance of the VAT, broader tax administration reforms are still
needed. In this context, the authorities are reorganizing the Inland Revenue
Department (IRD) in phases, focusing on creating a large and medium-sized taxpayer
unit in the first phase and a planning unit and small taxpayer unit in phases two and
three. The proposed reform strategy aims at implementing a new organizational
structure where operations are integrated, and audit and enforcement activities are
organized separately for large/medium and small taxpayers, with the goal of achieving
higher efficiency and a lower compliance burden.



Customs administration reform. Passage of a new Customs Act and a major upgrade
to the customs IT infrastructure, to ASYCUDA World, will allow risk-based
inspections and electronic manifests and signatures, leading to reduced clearance times.
Duty-free concessions which had been approved by cabinet will now be processed at
customs, which will provide reports on concessions granted and duties foregone.



Medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). The government would continue to
move towards a MTEF to improve predictability of capital expenditure and its
consistency with the medium-term fiscal objectives. The budget already incorporates
projections over a three-year horizon.

11
24.
Further action is needed to strengthen Dominica Social Security (DSS), which is
burdened by an aging and shrinking population and very high labor force emigration.10
In this regard, a package of reforms was announced in 2007 to improve the sustainability of
the DSS, including an immediate rise in contribution rates. However, several other key
measures announced in 2007 were not implemented as planned in January 2009, including an
increase in the retirement age from 60 to 61 and a second round of increases in contribution
rates. The government decided instead, in the context of the global financial crisis, to wait for
the results of the tenth actuarial review to be completed shortly. The authorities restated the
high importance they attach to ensuring the sustainability of the DSS.
B. Financial Sector Policies
25.
A committee appointed by the ECCU governments is discussing with strategic
investors the establishment of a new company to take over BAICO’s operations in the
region. The strategy comprises a regional solution, which would transfer the property
insurance portfolio to an existing insurance company and establish a Medical Claims Support
Fund. Finding sufficient funds to capitalize the new company will be a challenge, and
haircuts or a rephasing of payments are likely to be part of the solution.11 The mission
recommended that the resolution of BAICO adhere to three principles: (i) avoiding systemic
contamination; (ii) minimizing the fiscal costs to the extent possible, given the region’s high
debt levels and related vulnerabilities; and (iii) giving priority to claims up to a low threshold
to protect vulnerable groups. The financial difficulties of CLICO Barbados are a significant
concern, and the authorities are monitoring developments closely.
26.
The collapse of the CL Financial Group and large role played by credit unions
underscore the need to strengthen the recently established Financial Services Unit
(FSU), the Single Regulatory Unit for the nonbank financial sector.12 Indeed, one credit
union is larger than all but two commercial banks, and nonperforming loans of credit unions
were 8.7 percent of total assets as of end-June 2009. In addition, some smaller institutions
have significant exposure to the CL Financial Group. In the context of regional efforts to
establish an all-encompassing regulatory framework, the FSU should be made fully
operational through supporting legislation; adequate staffing; capacity building; and on-site
examination of insurance companies and credit unions. The authorities are working to enact
10

See Hunter Monroe, “Can the ECCU Afford to Grow Old?”, IMF Working Paper 09/38.

11

To date, the Trinidad and Tobago government has contributed US$50 million and ECCU governments are
expected to contribute US$75 million to the capitalization of this new company.

12

A Ponzi scheme, SGL Holdings, operated briefly in Dominica but did not grow as large as in several other
Caribbean jurisdictions. See Ana Carvajal, Hunter Monroe, Catherine Pattillo, and Brian Wynter, “Ponzi
Schemes in the Caribbean,” IMF Working Paper 09/95.

12
updated harmonized legislation on insurance, credit unions, and money services, which will
strengthen capital, prudential, and other requirements, as well as the FSU’s ability to enforce
them. It is also important for the authorities to work closely with the ECCB to improve bank
supervision, including more frequent on-site examinations. In light of the CL Financial
experience, it will be important to ensure that insurance companies place assets under
trusteeship in their statutory funds to back up local insurance liabilities. The mission advised
keeping the SDR allocation (SDR 7.2 million) as a shared buffer for ECCU members against
risks stemming from potential stress in financial systems in the region.
27.
The Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank has been refocused on its
original mandate as a development bank and placed under the supervision of the FSU.
It no longer takes deposits or makes consumer loans and has reduced its large portfolio of
nonperforming loans (NPLs). The bank’s lending has recently grown rapidly, and it has
contracted loans amounting to US$22.4 million (6 percent of GDP) to finance its operations.
The mission emphasized the need for close monitoring due to the potential contingent fiscal
liabilities and recommended an on-site examination by the FSU.
C. Medium-Term Outlook
28.
Medium-term growth prospects are expected to be driven by industries related
to the environment, water and energy sources. Comparative advantages in some natural
resource-based industries should be better exploited as in the case of eco-tourism, agroindustries, niche focused agriculture and fisheries, and geothermal energy.
29.
The authorities have made significant progress with measures aimed at
improving competitiveness, easing infrastructure bottlenecks, and reducing the costs of
doing business. The government has intensified its focus on building infrastructure such as
roads, airport, and seaports. Nevertheless, Dominica’s Doing Business ranking has slipped
recently, reflecting faster progress in other countries.
30.
Continuing the rapid pace of structural reforms will be necessary for the
authorities to achieve their medium-term annual growth objective of 3 percent. In
particular, the mission recommended:


Formulating and implementing a national export strategy and facilitating the
diversification of agricultural exports from bananas towards agro-industries and
high value specialty crops, which have grown rapidly in recent years. Higher
quality standards would also facilitate maintaining a presence in certain markets,
and improved land titling will facilitate financing.



Exploiting geothermal energy resources, which could reduce electricity costs and
be exported to neighboring islands.



Emphasizing infrastructure investments complementary to Dominica’s other
comparative advantages, for instance, in off-shore education and cruise tourism.

D. Statistical Issues

31.
The Central Statistical Office has improved the compilation of national accounts
with assistance from CARTAC. However, GDP may be underestimated due to incomplete
information provided by an offshore university—one of the largest employers—and the
mission encouraged the authorities to redouble efforts to obtain this information.13
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Dominica’s prudent fiscal policy in recent years has improved its debt
sustainability in the context of an appropriately focused development strategy. After the
2001–02 crisis, Dominica has put its finances in order by introducing a VAT, containing
expenditure, and undertaking a successful debt restructuring. The FY 2008/09 fiscal outturn
was far better than expected despite high reconstruction spending and the lowering of income
tax rates in the context of a three-stage income tax reform. As a result, debt ratios have
declined markedly. The country has thus deservedly acquired a solid reputation for good
fiscal management. At the same time, the Growth and Social Protection Strategy sets forth a
clear strategy for fostering growth, and the government has made notable progress in
implementing its key elements.
33.
The prudent fiscal stance of the last several years created the space for the
government’s response to the global downturn. The government was able to maintain
capital spending in 2009 at a high level, which—coupled with Dominica’s lesser dependence
on tourism—helped moderate the impact of the adverse external shock. However, the
continuing strong performance of the VAT allowed the government to maintain its target of
3 percent of GDP for the primary surplus thus far.
34.
Looking forward, fiscal policy will need to target further reducing the public
debt ratio and maintaining room for maneuver in response to natural disasters and
external shocks. To help them achieve these objectives, the authorities are considering a
welcome set of additional fiscal reforms, including further improvements in tax
administration and modernization of customs. Staff believes that these reforms will not only
enhance the public finances in the coming years but will also improve the business
environment. In parallel, debt management should be enhanced in light of the still high
public debt ratios.
13

When a similar institution in Grenada began providing information for the compilation of national accounts,
2006 GDP was revised upward by 7 percent.

14

35.
However, large forthcoming projects financed by China risk slowing significantly the
downward trajectory for the public debt-to-GDP ratio. While the associated departure from
the anchor of a 3 percent of GDP primary surplus is expected to be temporary, it will
significantly affect the debt dynamics and may entail credibility costs. Staff therefore urges
the authorities to return to the fiscal anchor as soon as possible. Furthermore, the expenditure
that was being contemplated on a large new tourism resort also carries considerable
commercial risks which may be better managed by the private sector. Hence, it will be
essential for the government to base its decision to obtain a rigorous, independent
assessment, to obtain concessional terms, and—if it proceeds—to involve a private strategic
partner.
36.
Improved nonbank supervision is essential to limit financial vulnerabilities. The
resolution of BAICO should proceed promptly, avoiding systemic spillovers while
minimizing fiscal costs to the extent possible. Furthermore, the authorities should continue to
monitor closely developments with CLICO, given its financial difficulties. Strengthening the
work of the FSU is essential, for instance, through on-site examinations of insurance
companies and credit unions.
37.
The staff welcomes the reform of the AID Bank. The bank is now appropriately
focused on its role as a development bank and no longer takes deposits or makes consumer
loans. Notwithstanding the reduction of its NPLs, the rapid rate of portfolio growth and large
amount of loans recently contracted by the bank are a significant concern. An on-site
examination by the FSU would help ensure that the bank’s resources are well allocated.
38.
Recent progress with structural reforms has been notable. Dominica is ahead of
many neighboring countries with reforms to improve customs processing, land registration,
and contract enforcement. Expanded airport facilities will soon improve Dominica’s
accessibility. Nevertheless, sustained and deepened structural reforms will be critical to
achieving the targeted level of growth. The medium-term growth challenge is to manage the
transition from bananas to tourism and diversified agro industries, and to foster private
sector-led growth and poverty reduction.
39.
The statistics provided by the Dominican authorities are generally adequate for
Fund surveillance, although areas for improvement remain. In particular, the authorities
are encouraged to address the possible underestimation of GDP.
40.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Dominica will take place
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I
Impact of the Global Crisis on the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
The ECCU has been severely impacted by the global slowdown. Real regional GDP
is expected to contract by about 6 percent in 2009, down from positive growth of
2 percent in 2008, reflecting a collapse in tourist arrivals and FDI-financed
construction activity. A slow recovery is expected with growth only in 2011.
A regional currency board arrangement and high public debt levels (90 percent of
GDP at end 2008) limit regional authorities’ fiscal policy responses to the current
downturn. Government revenue losses induced by the economic slowdown and higher
debt-servicing costs are projected to raise the region’s overall fiscal deficit to 9 percent
of GDP in 2009 from 3 percent in 2008.
The global financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the ECCU’s financial sector.
Although the presence of international banks has offered an important source of
stability, some indigenous banks have significant exposures to government debt. Rising
NPLs and tightening of liquidity pose increasing concerns about the stability of the
banking system. Problems in the insurance sector related to the CL Financial Group
have not yet been resolved, despite some progress toward a regional solution.
The ECCB Monetary Council adopted an “Eight Point Stabilization and Growth
Program” in April 2009 as the basis for developing a coordinated regional response to
the economic downturn, covering financial programs, fiscal reforms, debt management,
PSIP, social and financial safety nets, and reforms of indigenous banks and the
insurance sector.
The reserves of the ECCB were at a comfortable level at end 2009, reflecting Fund
financial assistance and SDR allocations. Gross international reserves stood at
US$895 million at end 2009 (5.2 months of imports), compared to US$759 million at
end 2008 (3.4 months of imports).

The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis approach suggests that
the real exchange rate was undervalued at end 2008. The PPP hypothesis
is a starting point to provide a benchmark for the equilibrium real exchange
rate. Based on this analysis the real exchange rate was undervalued by
9 percent at end 2008.

If the current account deficit projected over the medium term exceeds the
estimated equilibrium, there is evidence of overvaluation. The current
account norm is determined through regression analysis where the fiscal
balance, the oil balance, relative income, relative economic growth, FDI, and
grants are the explanatory variables. Dominica’s projected medium term
deficit is 20.6 percent of GDP, above the norm by around 2.6 percent when
using either (i) a sample of CARICOM countries, or (ii) an extended sample
of tourism dependent countries in the regression analysis. This implies an
overvaluation in the REER of 7 percent.

Appendix III
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
The updated DSA shows some deterioration relative to the previous exercise.1 The
previous baseline scenario assumed: (i) real GDP growth of 3 percent annually over the
medium term; and (ii) a primary fiscal surplus of at least 3 percent of GDP from FY 2010/11
onwards. In that scenario, Dominica would reach the ECCB target of 60 percent for the
debt-to-GDP ratio in 2016, four years ahead of the ECCB’s 2020 target. In the new baseline
scenario, the US$40 million loan from China reduces the primary surplus to only 1.3 percent of
GDP during FY 2010/11 to FY 2012/13, and the primary surplus remains at 3 percent of GDP
thereafter. Under these assumptions, and maintaining the same real GDP growth rate, the
public debt ratio would reach the 60 percent of GDP target in 2017, one year later than before.
Risks to the debt sustainability outlook. The projected real GDP growth and revised path for
the primary surplus are subject to several downside risks:


Proposed large new borrowing. The government was considering an additional loan
from China of US$60 million (16 percent of GDP) for a tourism resort. The additional
borrowing would prevent Dominica from achieving the ECCB target by 2020 without a
strong growth impact. Also, the new borrowing would increase the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio in 2010–14 above the 50 percent threshold. Assuming a considerable positive impact
of the resort project on GDP growth, the 60 percent target level would be reached in 2020.



Vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters. Commodity price shocks,
downturns in tourism, and hurricanes (like those in the last two consecutive years) could
slow growth and undermine the fiscal position.



Volatility of grant inflows. The projected grant financing at around 6.6 percent of GDP
over the medium term implies a decline from the average of 12 percent in 2007–08, but is
still higher than the historical average of close to 5 percent for 1990–2006.2 In the event
that grant inflows were lower than expected, capital expenditure would need to be scaled
back further to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory.



Degree of concessionality. Multilateral borrowing is assumed to be available on
concessional terms, reflecting current Caribbean Development Bank lending policies for
small countries like Dominica.



Possible contingent liabilities. The large capital shortfall of the CL Financial insurance
subsidiaries could represent a large potential contingent liability.

See IMF Country Report No. 09/293.

The government has taken steps in recent years to diversify its trade and economic cooperation
linkages, especially with China and Venezuela, which has resulted in increased aid flows (see Box 5, in

Appendix IV
Debt Management
Dominica’s high public debt level, coupled with its vulnerability to external shocks, natural
disasters and regional financial risks, presents a substantial risk to the economy and challenges to
long-term debt sustainability. At the request of the authorities, an MCM mission visited Dominica in
October 2009 and provided advice on how to address these risks, including developing a medium-term
debt management strategy and implementing measures to strengthen debt management capacity and
institutional arrangements. The key recommendations were:


Pursue debt sustainability vigilantly. While the public debt ratio has been falling and is set
to continue its downward trajectory on staff’s baseline assumptions, substantial risks remain.
Recent experience shows that debt sustainability could unwind very rapidly—the debt stock
almost doubled in five years to about 130 percent of GDP in 2003, before undergoing a debt
restructuring. Prudent fiscal policies and debt management would have to be pursued
vigorously to maintain the downward path of the debt to GDP ratio. In this context, the
control of public corporations and the management of their guaranteed debt should be
strengthened, allowing the government to minimize potential shocks to its balance sheet
arising from guarantees being called. In the near-term, the government should avoid an
aggressive accumulation of debt, including the build-up of concessional debt, as this could
jeopardize the gains made in controlling the public debt.



Strengthen debt management capacity and institutional arrangements. It is important to
develop the capacity to analyze, manage and control debt and guarantees. Improvements are
needed in debt data recording and introduction of procedures to require public corporations to
supply information such as debt data and disbursement plans. Over the next year, further
reforms, including development of operational risk management, the introduction of a Code
of Conduct and a staff training program should be implemented. Consideration should also be
given to introducing a public debt law. A Public Debt Committee, chaired by the Minister of
Finance, with the participation of the ECCB as appropriate, should be established, with
responsibility for approving the debt strategy and the associated annual financing plan.



Implement a medium-term debt management strategy. As a first step, the government
should identify clear debt management objectives, and formulate and implement a mediumterm debt management strategy aimed at meeting these objectives. As the high level of debt
restricts the government’s access to commercial borrowing, this strategy should, building on
the current approach, emphasize the reliance on grants and concessional sources of financing,
and would also need to contain a clear plan for managing refinancing risk.



Seek cautiously to expand the investor base via the Regional Government Securities
Market (RGSM). The RGSM provides a good platform to expand the investor base, to
reduce costs, and possibly to refinance maturing restructured Eastern Caribbean dollar bonds
should that be necessary. However, this should be approached cautiously, seeking first to
establish a presence with small volumes of short maturity securities, which could be expanded
over time.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
DOMINICA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with the World Bank Staff
Approved by Antônio Furtado (WHD) and Michele Shannon (SPR)
April 27, 2010
Dominica’s debt outlook has deteriorated slightly since the previous debt sustainability
analysis (DSA).1 In the baseline scenario, Dominica would reach the ECCB’s 60 percent
debt-to-GDP ratio target in 2017, three years before the target date of 2020. However, a
large potential loan to build a tourist resort would delay achieving the target until after
2020. Relative to the thresholds based on Dominica’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) rating of “strong”, the threshold on the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is
exceeded during 2010–12. Dominica is considered as having a moderate risk of debt
distress. However, some of the simulated shocks and potential additional borrowing plans
would lead to breaches of the debt burden thresholds.2
I. CONTEXT
1.
The Dominican authorities have pursued sound macroeconomic and structural
policies in recent years. They successfully implemented a reform agenda supported by a
Stand-by Arrangement (2001–03) and a PRGF Arrangement (2004–06). The strong fiscal
position has allowed a significant reduction in the debt to GDP ratio and created fiscal space
to respond to the 2009 global downturn.
2.
Dominica’s debt prospects have improved considerably in recent years. The
public debt-to-GDP ratio has declined from 130 percent in 2003 to 84 percent in 2009. The
major factors behind this improvement are the cooperative debt restructuring that took place
in 2004–05 and the prudent fiscal policy maintained by the authorities since then, supported
by the strong performance of the VAT introduced in 2006.

Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility, June 26, 2009.

For a description of the exercise see Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (IMF Publication, January 25, 2010
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419 )

2
3.
The global economic downturn has resulted in lower inflows related to tourist
arrivals, FDI and remittances. However, in contrast to other countries in the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), real GDP has declined only modestly reflecting in part
the decision of the government to maintain public capital spending in 2009 at the high
post-hurricane level in 2008.
4.
Debt management capacity needs to be strengthened and a medium-term debt
management strategy implemented. At the request of the authorities, an MCM mission
visited Dominica during October 2009, and provided technical assistance on debt
management. The mission recommended pursuing debt sustainability vigilantly as substantial
risks remain around the current downward trajectory of debt ratios. It also recommended
strengthening debt management capacity and institutional arrangements, and implementing a
medium-term debt management strategy. This strategy should build on the current approach
that focuses on minimizing the cost of financing, including concessional debt, and contain a
plan for managing financial risk and accessing grant financing. The mission also
recommended expanding the investor base cautiously via the Regional Government
Securities Market (RGSM).
5.
Dominica is rated as a strong performer according to the World Bank’s CPIA
ratings. The CPIA rates countries against a set of 16 criteria grouped in four clusters:
(i) economic management; (ii) structural policies; (iii) policies for social inclusion and
equity; and (iv) public sector management and institutions. In 2008, Dominica’s CPIA three
year average, 3.84, implies the country is categorized as a “strong performer”.

* Refer to the fiscal year (July-June) that begins in the year shown.

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2010–29)


Real GDP growth in the medium term is projected to reach 3 percent, above the average
of 0.9 percent in the past ten years, but below the average of 3.4 percent excluding the
crisis years of 2001 and 2002. The projection incorporates the effects of authorities’
continued efforts to advance their reform agenda and to foster private-sector led growth.
Inflation is expected to remain at about 1.5 percent from 2011 onwards.



The primary surplus (including grants), which averaged 4.8 percent of GDP in
FY2006/07–FY2008/09, is expected to be 3 percent in FY2009/10. The primary surplus is
assumed to remain at around 1.3 percent of GDP in FY2010/11–FY2012/13, as a result of
the infrastructure spending associated with the loan from China. Afterwards, the level of
the primary surplus is assumed to remain at a similar level, around 3 percent of GDP, and
the associated overall fiscal deficit is around 1 percent of GDP.



Grants peaked in FY2008/09 at 11.6 percent of GDP because of post-hurricane
reconstruction aid, but a slight decline is expected in FY2009–10. Projected grant
financing at around 7.2 percent of GDP over the medium-term implies a decline from
recent high levels but would still be higher than the historical average of 6.3 percent
during FY2000/01–FY2006/07. This reflects in part recent diversification of trade and
economic linkages, especially with China and Venezuela (see SM/08/242, Box 5).



Concessional lending represents most of the external debt, primarily from the Caribbean
Development Bank (CBD) and the International Development Association (IDA). Other
sources of concessional lending are China and Venezuela.



After peaking at 32 percent of GDP in 2008, the external current account deficit is
expected to stay at a level close to 23–25 percent of GDP in 2010–12 due to imports
related to infrastructure spending, and then stabilize at around 20–21 percent afterwards.
Exports are expected to stabilize after an 11 percent reduction in 2009 and a somewhat
slow recovery in 2010–14. FDI flows are expected to finance around half of the current
account deficit from 2013 onwards.

4
7.
The current baseline scenario incorporates a US$40 million concessional loan
from the Export-Import Bank China. The loan will finance education and infrastructure
projects leading to a reduction of the primary surplus to around 1.3 percent of GDP in the
next three fiscal years. It is assumed that the primary balance remains at around 3 percent of
GDP thereafter. The medium-term growth impact of the loan is uncertain as most materials
would be imported and the investment in education would likely take some time to yield a
return.
III. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
Dominica’s public debt has decreased considerably. From a peak at 130 percent of
GDP in 2003, the public debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 84 percent in 2009. External debt
accounts for three quarters of total debt. The central government accounts for 94 percent of
public debt. Among external creditors, multilateral lending represents 66 percent of the total,
followed by lending from commercial banks, 16 percent, and bilateral sources, 15 percent
(Table 1).

The baseline scenario
9.
The debt sustainability outlook has deteriorated slightly relative to the last DSA
analysis, reflecting in part new borrowing discussed below. In the baseline scenario,
Dominica will reach the ECCU target of 60 percent debt-to-GDP ratio by 2017, one year
later than in the previous DSA but still three years before the 2020 target date. It is projected
that the ratio of NPV of the public debt-to-GDP will fall from 72 percent of GDP in 2008 to
25 percent in 2029. On the other hand, the ratio of the NPV of external debt-to-GDP is
expected to fall from 46 percent in 2008 to 19 percent in 2029 (Table 4).
10.
The baseline projection incorporates a US$40 million loan from China for
projects in education and infrastructure. About US$24 million (7 percent of GDP) of the
total would represent new expenditure and external financing not previously incorporated in
the fiscal projections.6 This expenditure and the existing financing pipeline from other
creditors will imply a weakening in the primary surplus in the period FY2010/11-FY2012/13.
11.
The baseline scenario does not include a proposed additional US$60 million loan
from China, equivalent to 16 percent of GDP. This additional borrowing to build a resort
project constitutes the main risk to the debt sustainability projections, even when its potential
effects could be partially limited by the revenue stream that may be obtained from the
project. However, those revenue flows involve a high degree of uncertainty.
12.
This loan would need to generate substantial economic growth to be debt
neutral. Although the terms of the possible loan are not clear, we assume for the purposes of
analysis that the loan will be disbursed during 2010–12, with two percent interest rate, five
years grace, and 20 years maturity. In that case, the debt to-GDP ratio in 2012 once the loan
is fully disbursed would be 15 percentage points higher than under the baseline. As a result,
achieving the same debt-to-GDP ratio in 2020 as in the baseline scenario would require GDP
to grow 2.8 percentage points faster each year during 2013–20.
13.

The risks surrounding the baseline debt projections are:



Additional borrowing. The proposed US$60 million loan for the construction of a
tourism resort could have an adverse impact on the debt trajectory;



GDP growth. A slow global recovery and the potential effects of the rebalancing of
global demand could lower demand for tourism services; there is a risk of further
external shocks; and the growth impact of the reform agenda may be lower than
projected;



Potential contingent liabilities associated with the collapse of the CL Financial
Group;

3

The terms of the loans are 2 percent interest, 5 years grace, and 20 years maturity, which imply a grant
element of 36 percent.

6


Exogenous shocks as commodity price shocks, natural disasters, reductions in grant
inflows and volatility in the demand for tourism services could both slow growth and
undermine the fiscal position, preventing further debt reduction; and



Changes in access to concessional lending. The baseline scenario assumes that
multilateral borrowing is available on concessional terms, which is in line with the
current Caribbean Development Bank lending policies.

Alternative scenarios and bound tests
14.
The debt outlook generally worsens under alternative scenarios. If there is a
permanently lower rate of growth or if GDP growth and the primary balance stay at historical
averages, trajectories for the debt-to-GDP ratio are higher than in the baseline scenario. On
the other hand, if the primary balance remains unchanged at the 2009 level, the trajectory for
the debt-to-GDP ratio would be very similar to the one in the baseline (Table 3).
15.
A possible additional US$60 million loan from China would worsen the debt
outlook. The additional loan that may be disbursed in 2010–2012 would imply that the
60 percent target level for the debt-to-GDP ratio would not be reached by 2020 without a
strong growth impact. On the other hand, taking into account a considerable positive impact
of the resort project on GDP growth,4 the 60 percent target level would be reached in 2020.5
16.
According to standard bound tests, shocks to GDP growth may have the greatest
impact on the debt outlook. More specifically, a reduction of GDP growth by one standard
deviation from its historical average during 2010–11 would dramatically worsen the debt
projections. In this scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would be 70 percent in 2029
compared to 25 percent under the baseline scenario. Among bound tests, this shock also
produces the worst results for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio and the debt service-to-revenue
ratio (Table 3).
IV. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
17.
In the baseline scenario, one debt burden threshold would be breached
temporarily. Between 2010 and 2012, the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio is just below the
50 percent threshold. However, all other ratios—PV of debt to exports and revenue and debt
service to exports and revenue—will remain well below their corresponding thresholds
(Table 5a)

4

The rate of GDP growth is projected to increase by 0.3 percentage points during the construction period,
2010–2012, and afterwards GDP growth would be boosted by one percentage point for five years.
5

Historically, the link between public investment and growth in the ECCU has been weak; see Shaun Roache,
“Public Investment and Growth in the Eastern Caribbean,” IMF Working Paper 07/124.

7
18.
A second loan for US$60 million would worsen the debt outlook. The PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio would be over its threshold of 50 percent between 2010 and 2014
(Figure 2). However, the other four thresholds would not be breached.
19.
The risks depicted by the bound tests are concentrated on the PV of debt-toGDP ratio. For most bound tests performed, the PV of debt-to-GDP crosses the 50 percent
thresholds. However, all other ratios stay under their corresponding thresholds. In general,
standard bound tests show that a combination of shocks to real GDP growth and non debt
creating inflows has the largest impact on the external debt outlook (Table 5b).
V. CONCLUSION
20.
Dominica’s debt ratios have fallen sharply since 2003. The decline reflects the
cooperative debt restructuring in 2004–05 and the prudent fiscal policies subsequently
maintained by the authorities.
21.
The baseline scenario shows a slight deterioration in the debt outlook compared
to the previous debt sustainability analysis. This is the result of the global downturn and a
new US$40 million loan. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio will reach the ECCU 60 percent
target in 2017, three years before the target date.
22.
Large additional borrowing would delay achieving the ECCB target. The main
risk associated to the baseline scenario is a potential additional loan for US$60 million to
build a tourist resort. This additional borrowing implies that the ECCU target would not be
reached by 2020. Also, the additional borrowing would imply that Dominica could be
considered at moderate risk of debt distress, as one of the five thresholds of the PV of
external debt-to-GDP ratio, would be temporarily exceeded in the period 2010–2014.

Exchange rate arrangement: Dominica is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,
which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar.

Based on existing use of resources and present holdings of SDRs.

3
Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), of which Dominica is a member, is subject to a full safeguards
assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was completed in July 2007,
and concluded that the ECCB continues to have appropriate control mechanisms in place, which
have strengthened since the first safeguards assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management
places emphasis on good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the bank's
transparency and accountability since the last assessment, including the publications of financial
statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made
some recommendations to sustain the ECCB's safeguards framework going forward.
VII.

Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive
Board on July 30, 2008; the relevant document is IMF Country Report No. 08/310. Dominica is
on a 12-month cycle.

VIII.

Technical assistance: In December 2009 and August 2009 a Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Center (CARTAC) mission provided technical assistance on National Income
Accounts Statistics aimed at rebasing the GDP constant price estimates to 2006. In
October 2009, an MCM mission provided technical assistance on improving the debt
management capacity of the government. In January/February 2009 an FAD mission provided
technical assistance on ongoing customs and tax administration reforms including issues of
capacity building, organizational restructuring for greater effectiveness and efficiency, and
considerations of revenue authority (RA) options. In September 2007 an FAD mission reviewed
the tax policy aspects of the value-added (VAT) and excises and provided advice to the
authorities on possible reforms. In January 2007 an FAD and CARTAC mission provided
technical assistance on revenue administration and tax policy. In 2006, an MCM mission
provided technical assistance in drafting an action plan for AID Bank. In 2005, an MCM
mission provided technical assistance in strengthening the supervisory framework for
AML/CFT in the nonbank sector. FAD missions have provided technical assistance on tax
policy and administration, and social security reform. The most recent missions include: pension
reform options (2005); TA on fiscal responsibility laws (2004); VAT implementation (1999);
urban property taxation (1997); and tax policy and administration, and expenditure control
(1995). Technical assistance from MCM and FAD has complemented the assistance that has
been provided by the CARTAC in Barbados. LEG has been providing assistance with the
drafting and interpretation of the VAT legislation.

IX.

FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCB, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20−31, 2003. The
principal objective of the missions was to assist the authorities in assessing the development
needs and opportunities for the financial sector and identifying potential vulnerabilities of
financial institutions and markets to macroeconomic shocks, as well as the risks to
macroeconomic stability from weaknesses and shortcomings in the financial sector. A detailed
assessment of the AML/CFT regimes of Dominica was conducted in September 2003 by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). The Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on
the IMF’s external website, including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) on Banking Supervision.

Appendix II. Dominica: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of February 16, 2010)
The World Bank is in the process of elaborating its Eastern Caribbean Sub-Regional Partnership
Strategy for FY10–14 and it is scheduled to be presented to the Board of the Bank in May 2010.
The interventions elaborated on below were launched under the Bank’s Eastern Caribbean
Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY06–09. The FY06–09 Strategy supported
the sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion
and strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened
creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities focused on leveraging available donor
grant financing. The OECS countries have confirmed that the objectives under the FY06–09
Strategy remain relevant.
I. Projects
There are currently four active Bank projects in Dominica for a net commitment of
approximately US$8.89 million:
The OECS E-Government for Regional Integration Program was approved by the Board in
May 2008. This project consists of a US$2.4 million loan to Dominica and is designed to
promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency of public services through the delivery of
regionally integrated e-government applications that take advantage of economies of scale. The
program is structured in phases. Phase 1 focuses on cross-sectoral e-government issues, as well
as on specific applications in the public finance area (including public financial management,
tax, customs and procurement), and also includes an e-government in health pilot project
(possibly together with preparatory and complementary activities in other social and productive
sectors). Subsequent phases of the program are expected to deepen the assistance provided under
Phase 1, while expanding the program to cover other sectors, in particular, health, education,
agriculture, tourism, postal, among others that may emerge during the early stages of
implementation of Phase 1.
The Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project was approved in February
2007 for US$1.45 million. The objectives of the project are to enhance the capacity of the public
sector to implement focused reforms geared at improving the public sector delivery of services
as well as creating the institutional and policy framework to facilitate private sector-led growth.
The project has the following five components: Component (1) focuses on making the public
sector more efficient and effective through support to implement the government’s public sector
modernization strategy; Component (2) targets improvement of the investment climate through
the strengthening of the institutional and regulatory framework for attracting investment into
Dominica; Component (3) focuses on reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector
and support the creation of a framework for the development of alternative sources of energy;
Component (4) addresses the improvement of the existing social safety net programs;
Component (5) deals with the management of the overall project. The total project cost is

5
US$2.6 million, of which the Bank is providing US$1.45 million and the EU is providing
US$0.58 million of grant financing.
The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project was approved in January 2007. This is
the world’s first ever multi-country catastrophe insurance pool. The Bank has approved a
US$4.5 million IDA credit for Dominica to finance their contribution to the fund over three
years. The Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe insurance coverage against
adverse natural events, such as a major earthquake or hurricane. The CCRIF allows participating
countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, better-diversified portfolio, resulting in a
substantial reduction in the premium cost of 45–50 percent.
The OECS Telecommunications and ICT Development Project was approved in
September, 2005 for US$541.6 thousand and aims at improving the access, quality, and use of
telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socio-economic development in the OECS. The
project has the following four components: Component (1) aims to strengthen the national and
regional regulatory frameworks and promote additional competition in the telecommunications
sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs)
by providing them with assistances to revise the regional and national sector legislation, and
develop a modem interconnection regime; Component (2) supports the review current universal
access policy, create related guidelines, and provide financial support to establish a Universal
Service Fund (USF); Component (3) aims to improve growth and competitiveness in ICTenabled services through utilization of broadband infrastructure; and Component (4) supports
management and administration of the overall project.
II. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical studies relating to public sector capacity in the
OECS including a number of Public Expenditure Reviews, an Institutional and Organizational
Capacity Review and, in late 2007, a Country Fiduciary Assessment. The Bank also prepared an
OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness (2005), an OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note
(2006), a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006), and a regional study on Crime, Violence, and
Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007). In addition, an OECS
Private Sector Financing Study and the OECS Tourism Backward Linkages Study were
completed in 2008. The publication “Caribbean—Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options
for Sustained Growth, Job Creation and Poverty Reduction” was released in the summer of 2009.
Dominica will also benefit from ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities including
the following: a CARICOM study on Managing Nurse Migration and a preparatory study aimed
at developing a Caribbean-wide Regional Energy Strategy.

Appendix III. Dominica: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
(As of December 31, 2009)
CDB has played a significant role in Dominica’s development process. Bank support has been
provided through the provision of investment loans, policy-based loans and TA grants. The Bank
has also extensively utilized its Basic Needs Trust Fund as a key modality for direct poverty
intervention programs. Significant support was provided towards the expansion of the productive
capacity of the economy, as well as strengthening HRD and reducing poverty. In particular,
support has been provided to strengthen economic management systems, expand agricultural
output, improve critical road infrastructure, upgrade ecotourism-related sites and attractions,
promote shelter development and interventions to support development in the indigenous Carib
territory. Disaster rehabilitation works have also represented a consistent element of past
interventions.
Over the period 1970–2009, total loans and grants approved for Dominica stood at
USD194.9 million, making it the eighth largest beneficiary of resources from the Bank. At the
end of 2009, CDB’s exposure to Dominica was USD82.4 million, which represented 6.1% of
CDB’s total disbursed debt outstanding. However, lending to the country has stagnated over the
four-year period to 2008. Following its debt restructuring exercise in 2004, GOCD has been
hesitant to engage in borrowing. The fiscal policy stance has become increasingly prudent, as
greater reliance has been placed on grant receipts to fund Government’s development program.
The policy has been relatively successful. Grants as a share of GDP have increased to record
levels (in excess of 10%) allowing public sector investment to climb significantly above
historical averages. This has facilitated a relatively long growth spurt, together with an improved
debt profile. The challenge for Dominica, and in some respects the opportunity, is to translate
these transitory flows into positive medium to long-term development impacts.
Given the aging portfolio, net resource flows to CDB turned negative in 2007 and 2008, but
recovered marginally in 2009 (see Table below). Disbursements declined from an average of
USD6.3 million (excluding 2003 and 2004) to under USD3.0 million. Disbursements in 2003
and 2004 were abnormally high and represented CDB’s support to Dominica during the crisis
period. In 2003 the Bank provided a single tranche Economic Stabilization Loan
(USD3.0 million) followed by provision of exceptional finance (USD14.9 million) in 2004.

Appendix IV. Dominica: Statistical Issues
While data provision for surveillance purposes is broadly adequate, certain areas need to be
improved. There are weaknesses in coverage, accuracy, frequency, and timeliness that continue
to hamper effective economic analysis and policy formulation. Priority should need to be given
to compilation and dissemination of national accounts, in particular tourism, agriculture and
labor statistics. Despite progress significant weaknesses remain in the compilation of fiscal
accounts, and the balance of payments.
Dominica participates in the General Data Dissemination System. However the metadata for
national accounts, external sector and government finance statistics have not been updated since
December 2002.
Real sector
Annual nominal GDP data are compiled using the production and the expenditure approaches.
Estimates by economic activity are compiled using production approach at 1990 prices. GDP
estimates are available about four months after the end of the year. The data are revised
frequently and are usually finalized with a two-year lag following completion of the National
Accounts Survey. There is an ongoing project to improve national accounts data which involves
rebasing to 2006 and expanding the basket with the Assistance of CARTAC and the ECCB. The
newly revised GDP is expected to be released by February 2010. CPI data are compiled with a
two-month lag. The weights are based on the 1997/1998 Household Expenditure Survey. There
is a program to develop export and import price indices (XMPIs), but a shortage of staff working
on price statistics limits developments in CPI methodology and the likelihood that XMPIs will
be developed in the near future. Data on employment are limited and there are no official data on
producer prices or wages in the private sector. Results of the 2001 population census have not
yet been published.
Government finance
Statistical capacity problems affect the timely production of quality government finance
statistics. In particular, the data are subject to frequent revisions stemming in part from
omissions and misclassifications. Data on central government operations are incomplete and
must be supplemented with additional information from external sources. For instance, some
operations are undertaken outside the consolidated fund. These include certain investment
spending, loan and grant receipts, and on-lending and transfers to public enterprises. As a result,
capital expenditure data, recorded by the Treasury, must be supplemented with additional donor
financing information, particularly because the public sector investment program (PSIP) data are
not timely. Delays in the reporting of the PSIP data reportedly stem from reporting delays from
the line ministries.
Several ongoing initiatives to strengthen expenditure management should help minimize the
extent of this problem. There is an ongoing effort to automate the expenditure execution process.
A new automation technology was installed in all line ministries in 2005. With this technology

9
all local purchase orders (LPOs) are generated electronically and tracked. Commitments are
charged against a specific budget allocation once the LPOs are generated. All ministries and
suppliers of goods and services are compelled to use the new system.
Only limited financing data are available. Although progress has been made in improving the
measurement of the government's debt, there are concerns that there is still some under-recording
of government commitments.
The authorities do not provide consolidated nonfinancial public sector data. Data for the rest of
the public sector—Dominica Social Security and the public enterprises—must be obtained
directly from each entity during Fund Article IV consultation missions.
No government finance data are reported to STA for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook.
Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis
based on a standardized report form since July 2006. The institutional coverage of monetary
statistics needs to be improved by including the accounts of mortgage companies, building
societies, credit unions, and insurance companies. In this respect, close coordination between the
ECCB and the single regulatory unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those
licensed under the Banking Act) is crucial.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis but are not reported in
the format recommended in the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data
reported to STA are becoming more timely, but still suffer from relatively numerous and volatile
errors and omissions.
External debt
The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed external loans
that provides detailed and reasonably current information on disbursements, debt service, and
debt stocks. The Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two
databases are not consolidated, requiring further adjustments to measure total debt stock. In
addition, information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) should be available to the
compilation agencies at least on a monthly basis, in order to produce timely debt stock data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Dominica
On May 10, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Dominica.1
Background
The global downturn has adversely affected the Dominican economy through lower
tourism arrivals, foreign direct investment inflows and remittances, although less
severely than other Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) economies. Real Gross
Domestic Product is estimated to have declined by only 0.3 percent in 2009. Total
tourism receipts contracted by 16 percent during 2009. This decline reflected falling
stayover arrivals after the Reunion 2008 event and greater discounting in 2009 partly
offset by growth in cruise arrivals. FDI and remittances inflows dropped by 51 percent
and 18 percent respectively in 2009.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

In response to the global slowdown, the government decided to maintain capital
spending in 2009 at the high post-hurricane level in 2008. Despite high capital spending,
the overall fiscal position remained in surplus during FY 2008/09 (July–June) and so far
in FY 2009/10. This reflects primarily continuing strong performance of the VAT
introduced in 2006.The strong performance also helped finance a scaling up of social
assistance to protect the poor from the effects of the 2008 spike in food and fuel prices
and the global economic slowdown.
Consumer price inflation has picked up recently. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
increased by 4.4 percent (yoy) through February 2010, as increases in world food and
fuel prices were passed through. This reflected a pick up in the later part of the year. On
a period average basis, inflation was close to zero.
The external current account deficit decreased to 28 percent of GDP in 2009. In 2008,
the deficit had widened to 32 percent of GDP due to higher reconstruction-related and
fuel imports, which were mostly financed by external grants and FDI. Lower FDI-related
and fuel imports in 2009 are estimated to have more than offset lower tourism receipts
and remittances. To mitigate the adverse impact of the global downturn on the balance
of payments, the Executive Board on July 10, 2009 approved a disbursement of SDR
3.28 million (about US$5.1 million) under the Rapid-Access Component of the
Exogenous Shocks Facility.
Monetary aggregates show steady growth and the banking system has remained
resilient. In the 12 months to December 2009, banking sector credit to the private sector
grew by 6.9 percent and broad money by 10 percent. Prudential indicators suggest that
banks are liquid and well capitalized, with declining nonperforming loans. The average
nonperforming loans ratio and capital-based soundness indicators remain above
prudential norms, although returns on assets have declined markedly in recent years.
The collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group has exposed
regional weaknesses in the regulation of nonbanks. The eight KPMG judicial managers
appointed in each ECCU jurisdiction for the British American Insurance Company
(BAICO) issued a joint report in October 2009 finding that the company is insolvent and
illiquid. The ECCU member authorities are making progress in the creation of a new
company to take over BAICO’s operations in the region.
The near to medium-term economic outlook is modestly positive. With the recovery of
the global economy and expected improvements in international trade and tourism
activities, the Dominican economy is expected to grow by 1½ percent in 2010. The
downside risks are related to a potentially very slow recovery in advanced economies,
which would adversely affect tourism activity. In addition, a rebalancing of global
demand could imply weaker demand for tourism services from Dominica’s main source
markets.

3

Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that the Dominican economy has been more resilient to
the global crisis than other ECCU countries and that its near- to medium-term outlook is
positive. Directors welcomed the authorities’ Growth and Social Protection Strategy,
which is appropriately aimed at guiding the economy toward fostering growth and
reducing poverty while lowering public debt. Downside risks relate to a slower global
recovery, possibly implying weaker demand for tourism.
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent fiscal policy stance in recent years, which
has placed public debt on a declining path and allowed the government to respond to
the global downturn by keeping capital spending in 2009 at high levels. They
encouraged the authorities to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio further, thus maintaining the
ability to respond to external shocks.
Most Directors expressed concern that the large externally financed projects could
significantly slow the pace of decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. While the likely departure
from the fiscal anchor of a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP implied by a loan for
education and infrastructure projects is expected to be temporary, it risks undermining
fiscal performance in the coming years. Directors encouraged the authorities to return
rapidly to the fiscal anchor that has served the economy well. The expenditure that the
authorities have contemplated on a large new tourism project carries considerable
commercial risks. Directors recommended conducting an objective and independent
assessment of the project, obtaining financing on concessional terms where feasible
and— if the project proceeds—exploring partnerships with the private sector. A few
Directors were of the view that some flexibility in borrowing and a temporary deviation
from the declining debt trend with prudent policies should not be ruled out.
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening the supervision of the financial
sector, including on-site examination of the insurance companies and credit unions.
They welcomed the establishment of a single regulatory unit for the nonbank sector.
Directors also welcomed the authorities’ regional approach to address the collapse of
the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group and recommended that the
resolution strategy should avoid systemic spillovers while minimizing fiscal costs.
Directors recognized the recent considerable progress with structural reforms and noted
that sustained efforts, geared toward improving the business climate, will be critical for
achieving the growth target.
