EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Azerbaijan is at the beginning of a large but temporary oil production boom that will peak in
2009–10 if no new oil deposits are discovered. The oil boom resulted in exceptionally high
real GDP growth and a significant improvement in the external position during 2005–06. It
also made it possible to increase government expenditure by almost 30 percent in 2005 and
to ratchet it up by over 80 percent in 2006. The resulting massive fiscal expansion in the
context of a de facto slowly appreciating exchange rate crawl contributed to an increase in
inflation from 5.5 percent in December 2005 to 16.4 percent in March 2007. The non-oil
economy continues to suffer from important structural rigidities and an unfavorable business
climate.
Authorities’ views
Appropriate pace of spending out of oil revenue. While the authorities acknowledged
rising inflationary pressures and medium-term fiscal sustainability concerns, they only saw
limited room for expenditure restraint in the short term. In the medium term, the authorities
will consider implementing fiscal reforms to support a reduction in the non-oil primary fiscal
deficit toward a sustainable level, but they have not made firm decisions on the pace of
adjustment.
Reducing inflation to single digits in the medium term. The Azerbaijan National Bank
(ANB) will consider tightening monetary policy gradually, if inflation continues to rise and if
key cabinet members support this tightening. The authorities aim at reducing inflation to
single digits over the medium term once fiscal adjustment has been initiated and institutional
reforms underpinning the transition to inflation targeting have been advanced.
Key productivity-enhancing structural reforms. The authorities intend to privatize the two
state-owned banks and improve the business climate.
Staff recommendations
•

It would be appropriate to scale down expenditure increases in 2007 to support
disinflation and put fiscal policy on a more sustainable path.

•

A detailed medium-term fiscal strategy consistent with long-term fiscal sustainability
should be prepared and adhered to.

•

If fiscal restraint is not considered in 2007, it is all the more important to tighten
monetary policy to facilitate the real exchange rate adjustment through nominal
appreciation rather than through higher inflation.

•

On the structural front, the banking privatization terms should be made attractive to
reputable strategic investors, and higher priority should be given to effective
measures to strengthen the oversight of the large spending program, reduce
corruption, and improve governance at the customs and tax administration agencies.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Azerbaijan is at the beginning of a large but temporary oil production boom that
will peak in 2009–10 if no new oil deposits are discovered. The key challenge facing the
country is to use the financial opportunity presented by the oil boom to ensure sustainable
non-oil output growth and poverty reduction, in particular after the oil boom has peaked, in
an environment of macroeconomic stability. Against the background of exceptionally rapid
expenditure increases and rising inflation, the consultation discussions focused on the
following issues:
•

What is the appropriate pace of spending out of oil revenue?

•

How to reduce inflation to single digits?

•

What are the key productivity-enhancing structural reforms?

2.
In recent consultations, the Fund’s advice has focused on the need to adopt a
sustainable medium-term fiscal strategy, increase exchange rate flexibility, and
implement macro critical structural measures. After a long period of closely following
the Fund’s fiscal policy advice, the authorities did not moderate the pace of fiscal expansion
in 2006, as recommended by the Fund, because they felt that infrastructure and other
development needs should be addressed urgently despite rising inflation. Regarding
exchange rate policy, in line with the Fund’s advice, the authorities exited the fixed peg in
early 2006, but they did not allow the exchange rate to appreciate sufficiently to contain
inflation due to concerns regarding financial system stability and competitiveness. The
Fund’s structural policy advice has been only partially implemented in recent years.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The oil production boom resulted in remarkably high growth and a
strengthening of the external position in 2006. Real GDP grew by 31 percent, and the
current account surplus reached 16 percent of GDP, improving Azerbaijan’s public sector net
external asset position (Tables 1–2). Non-oil real GDP, excluding oil and gas transportation,
grew by about 8 percent, as nontradable sectors benefited from buoyant budgetary
expenditure and banking credit (Figure 1). According to official data, rapid growth
contributed to a significant poverty reduction during 2003–06 (Text Table 1 and Table 3).
4.
The officially reported 12-month CPI rate rose to double digits by August 2006
and reached 16.4 percent in March 20071 (Figure 1). This rise in the inflation rate was
fueled by a significant relaxation of macroeconomic policies and substantial wage increases

1

Alternative CPI measures compiled by nongovernmental organizations show much higher inflation.

5.
Continued real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation and rising labor
costs have intensified competitiveness pressures. There are initial signs of Dutch disease,
as the tradable non-oil sector only grew by 4.0 percent in 2006 compared with 10.4 percent
in 2005. While non-oil exports grew by more than 30 percent per year in U.S. dollar terms in
both 2005 and 2006, this rapid growth is in part explained by rising international agricultural
and metal prices, as well as significant subsidies on energy inputs from which non-oil
exporters benefited. Despite their recent rapid growth, non-oil exports still represented only
about 10 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006 (Figure 2).
6.
Following a decade of cautious fiscal policy, there was an exceptionally large
fiscal relaxation in 2006. A 118 percent increase in oil revenue made it possible to ratchet
up the non-oil primary deficit to 33 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006 compared with only
13 percent in 2005 (Tables 4–5). Non-oil revenue increased by 4 percent of non-oil GDP in
2006 compared with 2005 owing to booming consumption and incomes. Capital expenditure
more than tripled, and wages, pensions, and other current expenditure increased by about
50 percent.
7.
There has been mixed progress in fiscal structural reforms. The authorities put in
place a new system of targeted social assistance in mid-2006, and increased energy and
utilities prices as of January 8, 2007, which will contribute to a reduction in implicit energy
subsidies from 21 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006 to an estimated 11 percent in 2007.
However, some key state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operated without approved budgets in
2006, and there has been limited progress in improving budgetary expenditure management

or strengthening the auditing capacity of the chamber of accounts (the government’s supreme
audit institution), raising concerns about the quality of the rapidly increasing expenditure.
8.
At the time of the massive fiscal expansion, the ANB pursued an accommodating
monetary policy in the context of the de facto crawling peg to the U.S. dollar initiated in
early 2006. With very limited instrument independence, the ANB undertook large
unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange mainly from the government, in order to limit the
annual exchange rate appreciation to the targeted 5 percent (Figure 3). Key policy interest
rates have remained negative in real terms since mid-2006. These policies led to a
133 percent increase in manat base money in 2006. This rapid base money increase reflected,
in part, a reversal of the negative shock to money demand that occurred in late 2005 and
some dedollarization, but it also fueled inflation in 2006 and created large inflationary
pressures spilling over into 2007. Broad money and credit increased by 86 and 64 percent,
respectively, in 2006 (Tables 6–7).
9.
Despite recent progress, the financial system remains small and highly
concentrated. The banking system’s assets, the main pillar of the Azerbaijan financial
system, represented only 21 percent of GDP in 2006, significantly below the ratios for Russia
(53 percent) and Kazakhstan (91 percent). The two state-owned banks controlled more than
50 percent of the banking system’s assets in 2006.
10.
While the authorities continue to improve prudential regulations, significant
vulnerabilities in the banking system remain. In response to rising credit and foreign
exchange risks, the ANB has tightened the prudential rules pertaining to loan collateral and
open positions in foreign currencies, as well as increased the minimum capital requirement.
However, as of January 1, 2007, many banks, including the two state-owned banks, failed to
comply with one or more prudential regulations (Text Table 2). The two state-owned banks
registered an increase in nonperforming loan ratios during 2006, reportedly due to previous
under-reporting (Table 8).
11.
Business climate and governance reforms are losing momentum. The
implementation of the anti-corruption program has been delayed, and the drafts of the antimonopoly code, the investment law, and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) legislation
remain in parliament. Several international surveys have reported on Azerbaijan’s persistent
problems with transparency, corruption, and the business climate (Figure 4).
III. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
A. Short-Term Outlook
12.
Azerbaijan’s growth and external outlooks for 2007 are exceptionally
favorable. Driven by further oil production increases, real GDP is set to expand by about
30 percent, and the current account surplus is expected to increase to 27 percent of GDP in
2007. Non-oil real GDP growth, excluding oil and gas transportation, is projected to

The authorities intend to continue the ambitious fiscal expenditure program,
which will maintain high domestic demand and liquidity growth and push inflation
upward in 2007. The non-oil primary fiscal deficit is projected to jump to 40 percent of nonoil GDP2 from 33 percent in 2006 and 13 percent in 2005. If monetary policy remains
accommodating, inflation will continue to increase in 2007 (Tables 1 and 6–7), potentially
entering an inflation/indexation spiral and negatively affecting the poor who do not benefit
from public sector wage increases.
B. Medium- and Long-Term Outlook
Baseline scenario
14.
Rising inflation and a slow pace of reforms would lead to intensified political
pressures for further large nominal expenditure increases in the medium term. Given
these political economy risks, the staff developed a scenario of continued fiscal expansion in
the context of slow reforms.3 Under this scenario, the non-oil primary deficit, including
implicit energy subsidies, is projected to deviate from the sustainable level starting in 2008
(Figure 5)4 based on the current World Economic Outlook (WEO) oil price assumptions

2

This estimate accounts for the effects of a forthcoming 2007 budget revision (paragraph 18).

3

The authorities have not concluded their internal discussions on various medium-term fiscal policy options.

4

Staff’s estimates of the sustainable non-oil primary deficit are based on the principle of constant real
expenditure out of oil wealth envisaged in the authorities’ long-term oil revenue management strategy.

(Table 9 and Appendix). Driven by relatively large budget expenditure increases, real non-oil
GDP would grow by 6–7 percent during 2008–12, mainly on account of nontradable
activities. Under the projected oil revenue path, both the external and government’s net asset
positions would strengthen during 2008–12, but current account surpluses would decline
significantly and the overall fiscal balance would shift into a deficit by 2012.
15.
Under the baseline medium-term scenario, the economy is still vulnerable to a
decline in oil prices. Should oil prices decline to $40–$50 per barrel, current account and
fiscal deficits would emerge and the oil fund assets would be depleted by the early 2010s
(Figure 6).
16.
Oil prices aside, the deviation of the non-oil primary deficit from the
sustainable path during 2008–12 carries significant long-term risks. By the mid-2010s, a
sharp decline in oil production and revenue would necessitate a large fiscal adjustment and
import compression, even if oil prices remained at about $60 per barrel. The ensuing
substantial expenditure cuts may lead to prolonged economic stagnation and a deterioration
in living standards.
Illustrative sustainable scenario
17.
The staff also presented to the authorities an illustrative medium-term scenario
consistent with fiscal sustainability. In particular, it suggested a significant reduction in the
pace of expenditure increases starting not later than in 2008, so as to bring the non-oil
primary deficits to sustainable levels (about 18 percent of non-oil GDP by 2012). The
recommended fiscal adjustment would also help accumulate larger foreign assets and reduce
competitiveness pressures during the peak oil production years, strengthening medium- and
long-term external sustainability (Table 10).
IV. REPORT ON THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
A. What is the Appropriate Pace of Spending out of Oil Revenue?
18.
The authorities will revise the budget in mid-2007, mainly to account for higher
revenue associated with the increased utilities and energy tariffs which they intend to
use to increase expenditure. After these revisions, in 2007, expenditure is projected to
increase by 47 percent, including a 59 percent increase in the wage bill and 40 percent
increase in capital expenditure, compared with 2006. The authorities were confident that they
would be able to increase non-oil revenue by 28 percent compared with 2006. In line with
the staff projection, the authorities expected the non-oil primary deficit to increase to about
40 percent of non-oil GDP in 2007.
19.
While the authorities acknowledged rising inflationary pressures and mediumterm sustainability concerns, they saw only limited room for reducing expenditure
growth in the short term. They indicated that they could not adjust current expenditure
downward in light of their desire to raise wages and pensions to improve living standards at
the beginning of the oil boom. The authorities also maintained that the public investment

program included the most critical projects in the social sectors (schools and hospitals) and
basic infrastructure (power stations, highways, railroads, irrigation), which needed to be
implemented after years of under-investment and neglect. They recognized that there was
significant room for improving capital expenditure management, but they felt that they could
address this issue without delaying project implementation.
20.
The government will strengthen the SOEs’ budgetary discipline to restrain
domestic demand growth. In particular, the government intended to enhance collection on
utility payments and approve and enforce the 2007 SOEs’ budgets, including those of major
utilities and energy companies. Notwithstanding these measures and higher electricity tariffs,
the authorities believed that it would be premature to remove the electricity subsidy
(3.2 percent of non-oil GDP) from the 2007 budget.
21.
The authorities agreed that the pace of expenditure increases would need to be
moderated in the medium term to ensure fiscal sustainability, but did not provide a
firm indication of the appropriate pace of adjustment at the time of the consultation
discussions. Furthermore, they underlined that it would be difficult to contain expenditure
increases in 2008 due to the forthcoming presidential elections. However, by end-2008, the
authorities expected that many infrastructure projects would be close to completion and the
level of wages and pensions would be consistent with their social objectives, reducing the
need for further large real expenditure increases. Over the medium term, the government
intended to make a transition to program budgeting, implement reforms in health and
education, and eliminate energy subsides. The authorities will also continue to improve
revenue administration with a view to broadening the tax base and reducing tax rates
(Box 1). Moreover, they will expand oil revenue coverage under the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI). While the authorities were still working on concrete plans for
implementing these measures and evaluating their fiscal impact, they believed that the nonoil primary deficit could be reduced significantly by 2012.
B. How to Reduce Inflation to Single Digits in the Medium Term?
22.
The authorities acknowledged that it would be challenging to reduce inflation
by end-2007. The ANB forecast that the expected increase in the non-oil primary deficit
would lead to 60–70 percent manat base money growth in 2007, if it maintained a slowly
appreciating crawling peg. This, according to the ANB, would fuel continued rapid growth of
banking credit and monetary aggregates.
23.
The authorities indicated that they needed to weigh the benefits of an increase
in policy interest rates and faster exchange rate appreciation against the attendant
risks. They maintained that the benefits would be limited because of the ineffectiveness of
the interest rate channel, and a low pass-through of exchange rate appreciation to prices,
which they explained by structural bottlenecks at the customs and in the retail sector.

17
At the same time, the authorities were of the view that the risks to financial system stability5
and competitiveness were high under more proactive exchange and interest rate policies. On
balance, they will consider a gradual increase in interest rates and faster exchange rate
appreciation later in 2007, if inflation continues to rise, provided there is consensus among
the ANB and key cabinet members on the appropriateness of these measures. As a first step,
the ANB has recently increased the refinancing rate to 12 percent from 9.5 percent. In any
event, the ANB will most likely maintain the de facto crawling peg as its key operating target
while paying increasing attention to manat base money during 2007.
Box 1. Non-Oil Taxation Issues
In recent years, non-oil revenues have increased as a share of non-oil GDP (Table 5) but they are
below potential. VAT and customs duty revenue losses arise from costly tax exemptions and tax
administration problems (Text Tables 3 and 4). The authorities also face tax administration problems
with other non-oil taxes mainly due to the importance of the informal economy.
In the short term, the authorities are considering to expand the non-oil tax base by (i) phasing out
some tax exemptions; (ii) improving the tax administration infrastructure for the taxpayers’ selfassessment and voluntary compliance; and (iii) reinforcing the pre-registration requirements for VAT
refunds. In addition, the staff advises the authorities to quantify the value of existing and newly
proposed exemptions, if any, annually, and seek parliamentary approval of new exemptions and their
duration.
Over the medium term, the authorities will consider reducing some tax rates once the tax base has
been expanded and revenues increased. In this regard, the staff recommends assessing if a simpler tax
system with flat personal income and lower corporate income taxes could work in Azerbaijan,
drawing on the experience of the Baltics, Russia, and some other former Soviet Union countries.

While the authorities’ stress tests showed that the direct impact of faster appreciation and higher interest rates
was manageable for the banking system, they expressed concern that rapid dedollarization, which might be
triggered by further exchange rate appreciation, may put undue stress on the banking system that still suffers
from insufficient expertise in risk management.

18
24.
The authorities broadly agreed that the real exchange rate was undervalued
(Box 2). However, they did not intend to accelerate the real exchange rate adjustment process
through rapid nominal appreciation. Rather, the authorities will seek to offset the impact of
fiscal policy on the REER through structural measures, such as gradual capital account
liberalization, improvements to customs administration and WTO accession, a reduction in
red tape in the retail sector, and increased scrutiny of “unjustified” price increases by
monopolists.
Box 2. Assessing the Exchange Rate Level
The macroeconomic balance approach estimates how much the real exchange rates would
have to adjust to move the current account balance (CAB) to its medium-term equilibrium
level—the norm consistent with a
Figure 7. Azerbaijan: Current Account Balance, 2006-07
(In percent of GDP)
number of fundamental variables. The
CAB norms for Azerbaijan in 2006 and
Current account norm
2007 are computed by applying the
Underlying current account
coefficients estimated by the
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues. The CAB norms are then
compared with the underlying CAB—
the estimated CAB for 2006, and the
CAB for 2007 projected to emerge
under the current exchange rate policy.
Source: Fund staff estimates and projections.
For both years, the underlying current
account surplus is substantially larger
than the CAB norm (Figure 7), suggesting significant undervaluation of Azerbaijan’s REER.

Azerbaijan falls below the regression

25.
The authorities stated that it would be desirable to reduce inflation to single
digits in the medium term. They fully agreed that moderating expenditure increases in the

19
medium term was key to reducing the fiscal dominance of monetary policy and achieving
low inflation. Even before fiscal dominance has been fully eliminated, the ANB will continue
to lay the institutional foundations for a transition to inflation targeting, including through
(i) fostering the development of money markets by introducing an interest rate corridor and a
key policy rate close to the middle of this corridor in line with MCM TA as of April 1, 2007;
(ii) improving its communication policies through the publication of forward-looking
inflation reports; (iii) enhancing its forecasting capacity; and (iv) further improving banking
supervision drawing on inputs from forthcoming MCM TA. In addition, the authorities will
recapitalize the ANB, if a capital shortfall arises, to strengthen the credibility of its policies.
C. What are the Key Productivity-Enhancing Structural Reforms?
26.
The authorities intended to improve financial intermediation by reviving
banking sector privatization. A recent presidential decree calls for the privatization of
the Kapital Bank (the smaller of the two state-owned banks) through the tender of five
10 percent ownership stakes. The authorities said that they would build on the experience of
the Kapital Bank sale to begin the privatization of the much larger International Bank of
Azerbaijan.
27.
The authorities were aware of domestic and foreign investors’ growing
concerns regarding the recent deterioration in the investment climate, and considered
remedial action in selected areas. They fully recognized that rapid progress in this area
was essential to help the non-oil economy cope with the inevitable real exchange rate
appreciation. In particular, the authorities were considering a number of steps to simplify
the licensing and business registration requirements in cooperation with the World Bank.
They also expected parliament to pass the anti-monopoly code, the investment law, and
AML legislation in the near future. As part of their anti-corruption program, the authorities
have submitted the draft laws on the Code of Conduct of Civil Servants and on Preventing
the Conflict of Interest of Public Officials to parliament, and will continue to work on other
anti-corruption legislative acts.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The current oil production boom has spurred growth, but rapidly increasing
spending has posed important challenges. During 2005–06, rising oil production resulted
in record-high real GDP growth and sizeable current account surpluses, which helped
further increase the Azerbaijan public sector’s net external assets and reduce poverty.
However, against the background of capacity constraints and deep-rooted structural
problems, the combination of the ballooning non-oil primary fiscal deficit and the
accommodating monetary policy stance has led to rising inflation.
29.
Going forward, the temporary oil boom presents a unique opportunity to
modernize the country and reduce poverty significantly, but continuing with current
policies poses significant risks to the achievement of these objectives. In the absence of a
moderation in expenditure increases and a monetary policy tightening in 2007, inflation will

20
most likely continue to increase in 2007. In the medium term, further rapid expenditure
increases in the context of slow reforms would intensify Dutch disease problems and
jeopardize long-term growth and fiscal sustainability, and may even reverse recent progress
in poverty reduction.
30.
It is regrettable that there is no political consensus on the need for moderating
expenditure increases in 2007 to contain domestic demand growth as the staff
recommends. Bringing down inflation close to single digits by end-2007 would require a
reduction in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit to somewhat below its 2006 level of
33 percent of non-oil GDP from the expected 40 percent. This fiscal adjustment could be
achieved through a significant reduction in explicit energy subsidies following the recent
increase in electricity tariffs, better selectivity and control of the execution of investment
projects, and cuts in non-essential purchases of goods and services.
31.
At the same time, the authorities’ intent to consider slowing down expenditure
increases in the medium term to reestablish macroeconomic stability and ensure longterm fiscal sustainability is welcome. The structural measures that the government is
currently implementing or considering, including stricter controls on SOEs’ spending, the
transition to program budgeting, the elimination of energy subsidies, reforms in health and
education, improvements to revenue administration, and continued adherence to the EITI
principles, deserve full support.
32.
There is a risk, however, that the authorities could delay the fiscal adjustment
beyond 2008 as political pressures for higher spending are rising in the run-up to the
2008 presidential elections. Such a delay heightens the probability of an
inflation/indexation spiral and increases resistance to fiscal reforms, which could jeopardize
the reduction of the non-oil primary fiscal deficit to a more sustainable level (about
18 percent of non-oil GDP by 2012). To avoid slippages, it is essential to approve a credible
medium-term expenditure framework and a sustainable path for the non-oil primary fiscal
deficit consistent with the long-term oil revenue management strategy which is yet to be
operationalized. Furthermore, expenditure management and control should be enhanced
substantially by strengthening the auditing capacity of the chamber of accounts and
ensuring full compliance with tendering and procurement regulations, in order to reduce the
risk of waste and opportunities for corruption.
33.
Since reducing the non-oil primary deficit in 2007 is not considered feasible by
the authorities, an immediate monetary policy tightening is all the more important to
prevent further significant increases in inflation. Allowing for greater exchange rate
flexibility and adopting manat base money as the primary operating target of monetary
policy will help regain monetary control. Moreover, the ANB, which is de jure independent,
should be granted de facto instrument independence. To tighten monetary conditions, the
ANB should scale down its unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange, which is key to
reducing the 12-month manat base money growth rate to below 50 percent by year-end
consistent with the objective of keeping inflation below 20 percent in 2007. This would lead

21
to faster nominal exchange rate appreciation. While the interest rate transmission
mechanism is weak, it will still be important to continue to increase the refinancing rate
until it becomes positive in real terms for signaling purposes.
34.
Despite recent appreciation, the real exchange rate appears undervalued. This,
together with further fiscal expansion, will intensify real appreciation pressures in the near
term. As demonstrated by Azerbaijan’s recent experience, these pressures would manifest
through higher inflation if the nominal exchange rate were not allowed to appreciate
sufficiently. The contemplated capital account and trade liberalization, as well as an
improved business climate in the retail sector, might reduce somewhat real appreciation
pressures in the medium term. However, these measures alone would not be sufficient to
alleviate real appreciation pressures in the short term.
35.
Faster exchange rate appreciation and higher interest rates pose manageable
risks to banking system stability. The authorities’ stress tests indicate low direct
vulnerability of the banking system to exchange and interest rate shocks. The residual risks
that are not captured by the stress tests should be manageable in case of a gradual
acceleration of exchange rate appreciation, provided the authorities immediately address the
remaining banking system vulnerabilities through zero tolerance to noncompliance with
prudential regulations. Absent monetary policy tightening and strict enforcement of
prudential regulations, unchecked credit growth in the context of insufficient risk
management expertise in banks may carry a higher risk to banking system stability.
36.
To reduce inflation to single digits in the medium term, the ANB and the
government should prepare and implement a joint disinflation strategy and
communicate it to the public. Adopting a sustainable medium-term fiscal framework
should be a key component of such a strategy. The ANB’s current plans to develop the
institutional preconditions for transition to inflation targeting are fully in line with previous
staff advice. The government should also support these efforts by engaging in closer
coordination with the ANB on the matters of treasury cash flow management, and
government securities market development, drawing on MCM regional TA in this area.
Moreover, the State Statistical Committee will need to address methodological issues in
CPI compilation following up on the conclusions of the forthcoming STA CPI assessment
mission. In addition, to strengthen the ANB’s credibility, it should be recapitalized through
tradable dated government securities bearing market interest rates in case its 2006 audited
financial statement reveals a capital shortfall.
37.
Deepening financial intermediation is essential for ensuring sustainable non-oil
growth. The authorities’ renewed interest in speeding up the privatization of the two stateowned banks is welcome. However, they should reconsider their privatization strategy to
make these banks more attractive to reputable strategic investors by offering larger
ownership stakes in individual tenders and ensuring that only fit and proper investors
participate.

22
38.
Other productivity-enhancing reforms should be revived to help the non-oil
economy withstand rising competitiveness pressures. The staff fully supports the
envisaged steps to improve the business climate and governance. However, greater efforts
and strong political support are need to strictly enforce the implementation of the anticorruption program, and improve governance at the customs and tax administration
agencies.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix. Analysis of Long-Term Sustainability of the Baseline Scenario
1.
Given the temporary nature of the oil production boom, this appendix analyzes whether
the continuation of expansionary policies is consistent with growth, fiscal, and external
sustainability by (i) presenting the standard debt sustainability template for emerging market
countries; (ii) using a theoretical growth model; and (iii) drawing on lessons from the experience
of Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.
2.
The baseline fiscal scenario assumes the continuation of expansionary policies in the
medium term. Against the background of slow reforms and rapidly rising oil revenue, there is a
risk that the government will maintain a relatively rapid pace of nominal expenditure increases in
the medium term in response to persistent double-digit inflation, entering an inflation/indexation
spiral. Based on these considerations, nominal expenditure is assumed to increase by over
45 percent in 2007, 35 percent in 2008, 30 percent in 2009, and about 25 percent annually during
2010–12. Under the current WEO oil price assumptions and the expected oil production profile,
oil revenue is projected to rise rapidly through 2010 and to decrease continuously afterwards, as
oil production declines. On current policies, non-oil revenue as a percentage of non-oil GDP is
projected to remain broadly stable (Table 9).
3.
The temporary oil production spike masks emerging sustainability problems during
2008–12. Under the current WEO oil price assumptions, the central government is projected to
generate overall fiscal surpluses through 2011, but a deficit will emerge by 2012. Despite
sizeable surpluses, the government is expected to borrow from international financial institutions
to implement a number of large-scale investment projects and float Eurobonds to provide a
benchmark yield for the corporate sector. Public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to
remain at 10–11 percent of GDP through 2012 (Table A1), and the oil fund assets are expected
to increase to about $37 billion (51.3 percent of GDP) by 2012. However, rapid import growth,
which is needed to satisfy booming domestic demand, is expected to contribute to a precipitous
decline in the external current account surplus from 27 percent of GDP in 2007 to 3 percent in
2012. Under this scenario, the private non-oil sector has only modest access to foreign financing.
This, together with broadly constant public debt ratios, will lead to a decline in total external
debt ratios during 2007–12 (Table A2).
4.
The medium-term sustainability assessment is sensitive to oil price assumptions.
Should oil prices decline to $40 per barrel (at constant 2004 dollars) and with other assumptions
remaining unchanged, the oil fund assets will most likely be depleted by 2012, and public and
external debt ratios will start to increase rapidly starting in 2012 (Tables A1–A2).
5.
Even if oil prices remained at about $60 per barrel in the long term, large
expenditure cuts and import compression would be needed in the mid-2010s in response to
a rapid decline in oil production and revenue. For illustrative purposes, the current

policy scenario is extended for 2013–24,6 assuming that nominal expenditure continues to
increase by about 20 percent per year until the oil fund dries up in 2015. In the face of
declining oil revenue and the depletion of the oil fund assets, a significant fiscal adjustment
will be needed by the mid-2010s to avoid explosive debt dynamics (Figure A1). During the
fiscal adjustment period, for illustrative purposes, current expenditure is kept at the previous
year’s nominal level, and capital expenditure is reduced so as to keep primary balances
consistent with an assumed public external debt ceiling of 40 percent of GDP.
6.
A neo-classical growth model is used to assess the impact of fiscal policy
assumptions on economic growth. This model has the following features: (i) public
investment increases the non-oil sector’s total factor productivity (TFP);7 (ii) fiscal decisions
and hydrocarbon production are given exogenously in the baseline scenario; (iii) there is a
ceiling on government borrowing; and (iv) the private sector reacts to fiscal decisions and the
profile of hydrocarbon production. The model calibrated for Azerbaijan shares many features
with the model presented in the IMF’s 2006 Selected Issues Paper for the Russian Federation
(Box A1 and Country Report No. 06/429).
7.
Because the model is very stylized, several caveats should be noted. First, the
model does not have nominal variables, such as prices or an exchange rate, and thus does not
capture the real effects of these variables. Inflation and exchange rates are projected outside
the model, and all nominal indicators are converted into real variables in local currency
terms. Second, the model has only one non-oil sector and does not distinguish between
tradable and non-tradable goods; thus it does not explicitly capture the potential impact of
Dutch disease.
8.
The main result of the model simulation is that once the fiscal adjustment starts
in the mid-2010s, there is a high risk of low non-oil GDP growth over a prolonged
period (Figure A1). The relatively high non-oil growth projected for 2007–12 is driven by
increased public sector investment and its attendant positive impact on the TFP, which also
stimulates a gradual pick-up in private investment. Subsequently, there is a prolonged growth
deceleration in the non-oil sector (to 2–3 percent). This deceleration mainly stems from a
reduction in private investment induced by a rapid tightening of the resource constraint

6
7

It is expected that oil production will end in 2024 in the absence of new discoveries.

The model assumes a moderate impact of public investment on the TFP, given slow progress in improving
expenditure management. However, because of the relatively short duration of the capital expenditure growth
spurt, the model is more sensitive to the assumption on the pace of the subsequent capital expenditure decline
rather than to the assumed measure of the public investment impact on the TFP. Indeed, even well-implemented
infrastructure projects will have a limited impact on long-term growth if public investment falls short of
depreciation and adequate maintenance is not undertaken following the completion of these projects.

starting in the early 2010s, which is compounded by the negative effects of reduced
government capital expenditure from the mid-2010s.

Box A1. Neo-Classical Growth Model
The model assumes that there are three types of agents in the economy: government, households, and
firms.
Government
Government revenue, expenditure, and financing are exogenously given with the government budget
constraint as follows:
g
g
g
*
*
*
(1) Ct + X t − Ot − Tt = Dt +1 − (1 + it ) Dt ,

X g is government investment, O g is oil revenue, D* is

government external debt, and i is the world interest rate. T is net lump-sum transfers, which are
g

where C is government consumption,

defined as the lump-sum taxes minus transfers to households plus domestic financing through the
issuance of government bonds. The domestic real interest rate equals the marginal productivity of capital
minus the depreciation rate by the firms’ maximization.
Households
Households earn wages and rental rates of capital, allocate their income to consumption and investment,
and also receive net lump-sum transfers. The households maximize their utility function (2) subject to
their budget constraint (3) and the transition equation for private capital (4):

where C is private consumption, K is private capital, X is private investment, w is wage, i is the
rental rate, and L is labor, β is the time preference factor.

The simulation results of the neo-classical growth model are consistent with the

experience of Nigeria and Saudi Arabia in managing a large spike and a subsequent
decline in their oil revenues during the 1970s and 1980s (Figure A2). In response to the
large oil price increase of the mid-1970s, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia undertook exceptionally
high expenditure increases. Saudi Arabia saw phenomenal real non-oil GDP growth rates
because of an effective expenditure management and the opening-up of its economy to trade
and immigration. Nigeria, on the other hand, saw more modest non-oil GDP growth—
6.5 percent, compared with the size of expenditure increases, as poor management of its
investment program and the ballooning wage bill intensified the negative impact of Dutch
disease on agriculture, while no material improvement in productivity occurred. After oil
prices had declined in the early 1980s, even Saudi Arabia experienced a prolonged period of
low growth because public expenditure needed to be reduced. Moreover, large expenditure
increases in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia fueled high inflation, which did not decline to the
international levels until expenditure increases were trimmed.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) was
subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on
July 6, 2001 and expired on July 4, 2005. A safeguards assessment of the ANB was
completed on March 8, 2002. The assessment concluded that risks may exist in the legal
structure and independence of the Central Bank, and in its internal audit and control systems.
The authorities have implemented all but one of the 2002 safeguards assessment
recommendations. The National Bank Law adopted in 2004 clearly specifies the modalities
for the ANB profit distribution, consistent with one of the last two outstanding

3

recommendations, and requires that ANB’s internal audit division be responsible only to the
chairman of the ANB Board. The latter falls short of establishing an independent audit
committee under the Board, as recommended by the safeguards assessment mission.
8.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994.
Currently de jure, the exchange rate is allowed to float against all currencies. Exchange rates
for cash transactions are quoted by commercial banks licensed to deal in foreign exchange on
the basis of market conditions. However, Azerbaijan has maintained a crawling peg exchange
rate system since early 2006.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective
November 30, 2004.

Article IV Consultation

The 2005 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan was concluded on March 27, 2006.

ROSCs

A fiscal transparency ROSC module was prepared by FAD (SM/00/278, 12/12/01) and
updated in April 2003 (SM/03/159, 04/30/03). A fiscal ROSC update mission took place in
April 2005. A data dissemination ROSC module was completed by STA in March 2003 (IMF
Country Report No. 03/86). The authorities published the fiscal ROSC, and it is available on
the IMF web site. Several financial systems ROSC were conducted in the context of the FSAP
(2003–04) but were not published.

Resident Representative

Mr. Basil B. Zavoico, the Fund's fifth Resident Representative, took up his duties in Baku in
July 2003.
12.

Resident Advisers

An adviser on the establishment of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Nurcan
Aktürk, was stationed in Baku from December 1994 until September 1996. He was succeeded
by Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi, whose assignment was extended twice, first through August 2000,
and then through May 2001. Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi was replaced by Mr. A. Khan, whose
assignment started in May 2001 and ended in August 2002. A technical long-term adviser for
tax administration, Mr. Mark Zariski, was stationed in Baku from April 1995 until April 1996.
He was succeeded by Mr. Peter Barrand, who was stationed in Baku from January 2001 until
December 2002. Mr. Isaac Svartsman was resident advisor in the ANB for bank supervision
and restructuring from September 1998 to April 2001. Nataliya Ivanik took up the position of
STA regional external sector statistics advisor in November 2006.

ANNEX II: AZERBAIJAN: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
•

The World Bank has been actively involved in structural reforms, poverty reduction
measures, public expenditure management, agricultural policies, private sector
development, institution building, and governance. A range of instruments is used to
conduct the dialogue. SAC-II, which was fully disbursed in June 2003, supported a
wide-ranging structural reform agenda and its accompanying second institution
building and technical assistance credit (IBTA II) assisted institutional capacity
building, especially of the Treasury Information management System (TIMS), public
investment program preparation, and utility reforms. The Bank’s Board approved a
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) in May 2005. By supporting the
authorities’ State Program of Poverty Reduction and Economic Development
(SPRED), the PRSC aimed to improve the business environment, the efficiency and
effectiveness of allocations in the social sectors, support anti-corruption efforts and
increased transparency and accountability of public finances.

•

The Bank’s new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was discussed at the World
Bank’s Board on December 7, 2006. The CPS is based on a broad policy reform
approach combined with sector investment projects in agriculture, transport, water,
refugees/IDPs, environment, education, health, and energy. Analytical and advisory
assistance for the next four years includes Programmatic Poverty Assessments,
Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews (PER), an update on the CFAA (financial
accountability) and CPAR (procurement), and ongoing work on trade facilitation and
mitigation of the social costs of utility price increases. The Bank is also continuing its
advisory services in the energy sector, the health sector, and the water sector.

•

After the PRGF arrangement expired in July 2005, close collaboration between the
IMF and the World Bank has continued. In a number of areas—social sectors and
safety nets, investment policy and expenditure management, environment,
governance, infrastructure, and agriculture—the Bank takes the lead in the dialogue.
The Bank is also leading the dialogue in private sector development and public
enterprise reform and Bank analysis serves as an input into Fund policy advice. In
other areas—energy, financial sector, and trade—both institutions work together.
Finally, in areas such as monetary and exchange rate policy, fiscal policy and customs
reforms, the IMF takes the lead with more limited Bank involvement.

•

The IFC’s strategy emphasizes support to the non-oil sector to help economic
diversification. To this end, the IFC will help catalyze FDI in non-oil sector projects,
which focus on exports, help generate foreign exchange earnings and contribute to the
modernization of the country’s manufacturing base and basic infrastructure. The
IFC’s strategy for the non-oil sectors involves (i) promoting competition in the
banking sector, establishing joint ventures in the non-bank financial sector, technical
assistance to private local banks for institutional capacity building; (ii) improving
access to finance through credit lines to local private banks for on-lending to small
and medium size enterprises (SMEs); (iii) enhancing the business climate and

6

reducing impediments to foreign investments; (iv) supporting agri-business and agroprocessing; and (v) creating conditions for private provision of public services.

ANNEX III. AZERBAIJAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. Although the authorities have made significant progress in improving
the quality and timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses should
be addressed, particularly in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and external
sector statistics. STA has provided extensive technical assistance and recommendations in
these areas.
2.
Azerbaijan has participated in the GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data ROSC
mission reviewed Azerbaijan’s data dissemination practices against GDDS guidelines and
conducted an assessment of the quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI),
producer price index (PPI), government finance, monetary, and balance of payments
statistics. The data module of the ROSC is available on the IMF’s external website.
Azerbaijan nominated a national SDDS Coordinator in August 2005, and an SDDS
assessment mission is planned for April 17-25, 2007 to provide focused technical assistance
on the outstanding issues required for SDDS subscription.
A. Real Sector
National accounts and price statistics
3.
Under STA’s national accounts project, significant technical assistance has been
provided to the State Statistics Committee (SSC) and progress has been made in a number of
areas. Methods for compiling gross national income have been improved and revised
estimates disseminated; quarterly national account estimates at constant prices for 1998–2004
have been compiled; capital investment data have been revised; estimates of undeclared
wages have been made; and a new methodology for calculating price indices for the
construction and transportation sectors is well underway. The March/April 2005 mission
identified the following problems: (i) the Oil Fund’s transactions are not adequately reflected
in the national accounts due to lack of information from the Oil Fund; (ii) the SSC does not
have sufficient information to make reliable estimates of remittances from domestic residents
working abroad; and (iii) there are no estimates of informal sector activity.
4.
In January 2005, the CPI was revamped: the consumption basket was expanded to
cover 585 items and expenditure weights updated to reflect recent consumption patterns.
With respect to regional coverage, which is now expanded to 54 regions, the SSC uses
population-based weights in the aggregation of elementary price indices. However, this
treatment raises methodological questions, because (i) international best practices suggest
the use of expenditure-based weights in every stage of aggregation in CPI compilation, and
(ii) population shares are not reliable proxies for regional expenditure shares.

8

B. Fiscal Sector
5.
Recent treasury modernization efforts are expected to improve the compilation of
fiscal data. With the assistance of a Fund peripatetic advisor, the Ministry of Finance
developed the treasury chart of accounts (COA), an essential input to the new treasury
system. The October 2006 STA government finance statistics mission found the latest draft
COA broadly consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001. The work
on the COA is proceeding in parallel with the computerization of Treasury operations.
6.
The 2002 data ROSC mission recommended expanding the coverage of government
finance statistics by including all operations recorded by the treasury and publishing details
on financing and debt outstanding. Starting in 2006, the state budget incorporates transfers
to Nakhichevan as a separate expenditure item, but no further details are provided.
C. Monetary Sector
7.
Following two STA technical assistance missions in 2000 and 2002, the Azerbaijan
National Bank (ANB) compiles monetary statistics according to the methodology of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The ANB reports monetary data to STA within
three weeks after the end of the reference month, via Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
Monetary and financial data have also been published in the December 2006 issue of the
International Financial Statistics(IFS) Supplement.
D. External Sector
8.
Starting in November 2006, a Regional Advisor in External Sector Statistics to
Azerbaijan and Georgia has been stationed in Baku to (i) facilitate activities carried out by
different government agencies in the development of external sector statistics; (ii) assist
with statistical capacity building; (iii) coordinate the technical assistance activities of STA
with the MCD’s work program; and (4) assist the authorities in coordinating with other
international institutions and bilateral agencies involved in technical assistance in statistics
in Azerbaijan and Georgia.
9.
While the overall structure of the balance of payments (BOP) statistics is broadly
consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, several compilation
weaknesses remain. These include (i) insufficient data on FDI stocks and flows that prompt
inadequate estimates for FDI income and impede the proper treatment of profit taxes of the
oil sector; (ii) undercoverage of nonguaranteed external debt and growing inconsistencies
with the relevant creditor source data; (iii) incorrect treatment of operational leases of
mobile equipment; and (iv) an inadequate breakdown between FDI equity and other capital,
which is necessary to properly record transactions associated with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
Pipeline, Shah-Denis gas field, and South Caucasus Pipeline.
10.
The ANB has made steady progress toward implementing the short-term measures
recommended by the 2002 data ROSC mission. Almost all short-term measures have now

9

been completed: the methodology for compiling reserve assets has been revised to exclude
the Oil Fund assets, and they are now classified as other investment assets of the
government; a new survey form for oil sector enterprises (IOCs) has been designed and
distributed to international oil consortia; and the scope and classification of BOP statistics
have been improved. However, the data provision from IOCs remain insufficient, which
hampers the compilation of foreign direct investment estimates due to inconsistencies in
timing, coverage, and valuation of the source data.
11.
To date, significant progress has also been made in implementing the data ROSC
medium-term recommendations. Starting with data for the third quarter of 2005, the
classification of services has been expanded, and data on reinvested earnings have been
included in the BOP. Moreover, the compilation system appears to be facing some
operational problems due to the lack of collaboration with other data-producing agencies,
such as the Oil Fund. Problems also remain with the sources and methods, particularly with
regard to short-term liabilities. No data are available on intercompany lending to direct
investment enterprises, and trade credit transactions are estimated on the basis of trade
statistics and the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) data with no clear
distinction between asset and liability transactions.
12.
The ANB has initiated compilation of the International Investment Position (IIP)
statistics, but the IIP statement is still at an evolving stage. The IIP data have been published
in the IFS since 2002.
13.
Statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are reported quarterly on a
due-for-payment basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for public
and publicly guaranteed external debt, separately identifying the principal and interest
components, is also provided with a one quarter lag. However, systematic information on
nonguaranteed external debt, including a sectoral breakdown, is lacking. The law on
external debt, which includes the assignment of responsibility for external debt compilation,
has been drafted and provided to the Parliament. On external debt, the 2005 BOP mission
noted that it would be desirable to use balance sheet data from commercial banks pertaining
to banking sector liabilities, which would permit presentation of information with a
breakdown by maturities and instruments.
14.
Monthly data on total official reserve assets and daily ANB net interventions in the
foreign exchange market are provided within 15 days of the end of each month. Data on
official reserves during the month are provided on request from Fund staff. Azerbaijan does
not disseminate International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity Template data, but
the ANB and the government have stated that there have not been any forward or futures
transactions that could give rise to contingent short-term net drains on foreign currency
assets.

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Azerbaijan
On May 9, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Azerbaijan.1
Background
Azerbaijan’s real GDP growth accelerated to 31 percent in 2006, driven by rapidly increasing oil
production and transportation. Non-oil real GDP, excluding oil and gas transportation, grew by
about 8 percent, as nontradable sectors benefited from ramped up government spending and
rapidly growing banking credit. The tradable non-oil sector only grew by about 4 percent in 2006
compared with 10.4 percent in 2005, as labor costs increased and the real effective exchange
rate appreciated. The officially reported poverty level continued to decline during 2005–06.
Inflation rose into the double digits by August 2006, and reached 16.4 percent in March 2007.
The recent rise in the inflation rate was fueled by a significant relaxation of macroeconomic
policies in the context of capacity constraints, as well as by the immediate effect of a large
adjustment to utilities and energy prices.
The oil production boom and rising international oil prices have strengthened Azerbaijan’s
external position. In 2006, the external current account surplus is estimated to have increased
to 16 percent of GDP from about 1 percent in 2005. The large current account surplus
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
contributed to a significant increase in gross official reserves (US$2.5 billion, or 5 months of
non-oil imports) and government foreign assets (US$1.9 billion), whose sum has considerably
exceeded public and publicly guaranteed external debt (US$2.0 billion, or 10 percent of GDP) at
end-2006.
The authorities undertook an exceptionally large fiscal relaxation in 2006. Oil revenue increased
by 118 percent; and non-oil revenues increased by 4 percent of non-oil GDP owing to the
buoyancy of tax bases. Wages, pensions, and other current expenditure increased by about
50 percent and capital expenditure more than tripled, bringing the total expenditure increase to
81 percent in 2006 compared with 2005. As a result, the non-oil primary deficit reached
33 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006 compared with only 13 percent in 2005.
In early 2006, the Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) shifted from a fixed exchange rate to a
de facto crawling peg to the U.S. dollar. With limited instrument independence, it undertook
large unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange, in order to limit the annual exchange rate
appreciation against the dollar to the targeted 5 percent. These policies led to a 133 percent
increase in manat base money in 2006. Broad money increased by 86 percent and credit by 64
percent in 2006, fueling inflation.
The banking system continues to face important challenges. In response to rising credit and
foreign exchange risks, the ANB tightened the prudential rules pertaining to these areas and
increased the minimum capital requirement. However, at end-December 2006, many banks,
including the two state-owned banks, failed to comply with one or more prudential regulations.
The banking system remains relatively small (21 percent of GDP in 2006), highly concentrated
(one bank controlled 46 percent of assets in 2006), and dominated by the two public banks
(accounting for 51 percent of the banking system’s assets in 2006).
Progress in other structural reforms has been mixed. The authorities put in place a new system
of targeted social assistance in mid-2006, brought utilities tariffs closer to cost-recovery and
selected petroleum product prices to world market levels in early 2007, and continued active
participation in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. However, some key state-owned
enterprises operated without approved budgets in 2006, and there has been limited progress in
improving budgetary expenditure management and controls, raising concerns about the quality
of the rapidly increasing expenditures. In addition, several international surveys have reported
on Azerbaijan’s persistent problems with transparency, corruption, and the business climate.
The short-term growth and external outlooks remain exceptionally favorable, but keeping
inflation from increasing further represents a major challenge. Driven by further rapid oil
production growth, real GDP is projected to expand by about 30 percent, and the current
account surplus is expected to increase to 27 percent of GDP in 2007. While rapidly growing
capital expenditure would support non-tradable output growth, rising competitiveness pressures
would negatively affect the tradable non-oil sector. As a result, non-oil GDP growth (excluding
oil and gas transportation) is projected to decelerate to 7 percent in 2007. The continuation of
the fiscal expansion would fuel domestic demand and liquidity growth. If monetary policy is not
tightened, inflation is expected to increase further in 2007.

3

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong real GDP growth driven by the temporary oil
production boom, which resulted in a strengthening of Azerbaijan’s external position, and
enabled the authorities to initiate urgently needed investments in infrastructure and the social
sectors, with encouraging progress in reducing poverty. Directors agreed that the oil boom
presents an opportunity to lay a solid foundation for sustainable non-oil output growth and
poverty reduction in the long term. To seize that opportunity, Directors encouraged the
authorities to address the acceleration of inflation, the unsustainable pace of expenditure
increases, and weaknesses in the business climate and governance, with the objective of
further diversifying the economy.
Directors called on the authorities to moderate expenditure increases in the medium term to
reduce inflation and ensure fiscal sustainability. Against that background, they welcomed the
authorities’ intention to start reducing the non-oil primary fiscal deficit to more sustainable levels
in the medium term, while recognizing the pressing infrastructure and development needs. They
were encouraged by the plans to implement a wide range of supporting fiscal measures, and
emphasized the need to move expeditiously in these areas so as to firmly secure long-term
fiscal sustainability. They also underscored the importance of improving expenditure
management and developing a medium-term fiscal framework consistent with Azerbaijan’s longterm oil revenue management strategy. Directors commended the authorities for participating in
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
In the short run, Directors saw room for reining in the fiscal expansion in 2007 in order to
contain domestic demand growth. In this respect, they recommended that the non-oil primary
fiscal deficit be reduced to below its 2006 level, by curtailing energy subsidies, cutting lowpriority current expenditure, and introducing greater selectivity into the choice of, and
strengthened control over, investment projects.
Directors called on the ANB to pursue a more pro-active monetary policy, supported by greater
exchange rate flexibility and further development of indirect instruments of monetary policy.
Directors recommended that monetary conditions be tightened by reducing the ANB’s
unsterilized foreign exchange purchases, thus facilitating a real exchange rate adjustment via
nominal exchange rate appreciation in response to the large increase in budgetary expenditure
from oil revenues. In pursuing this strategy, some Directors recommended monitoring closely
the impact of manat appreciation on the competitiveness of the non-oil sector and on the
banking system. Directors generally recognized the authorities’ efforts on the structural side to
reduce real appreciation pressures, but believed that such efforts would be effective only in the
medium term.
Directors supported the authorities’ interest in moving to inflation targeting as part of their efforts
to reduce inflation to single digits in the medium term. Key prerequisites for a transition to
inflation targeting include enhancing the ANB’s independence, eliminating fiscal dominance of

4
monetary policy, developing securities markets, strengthening the banking system, and further
improving the Consumer Price Index compilation methodology.
Regarding the financial sector, Directors considered that effective enforcement of prudential
regulations would reduce the banking system’s vulnerability to exchange rate appreciation,
higher interest rates, and credit risks intensified by accelerating credit expansion. Noting the
authorities’ efforts to revive the privatization of the two state-owned banks, Directors
recommended that the privatization terms be such as to attract strategic investors, and that only
fit-and-proper investors be allowed to participate in the privatization.
Directors underscored that revitalizing productivity-enhancing structural reforms will be essential
for maintaining non-oil sector competitiveness in the face of real exchange rate appreciation.
They supported the authorities’ plans to improve the business climate by simplifying licensing
and registration procedures, and adopting and implementing the new anti-monopoly code,
investment law, and anti-money laundering law. They called for steadfast implementation of the
anti-corruption program and determined efforts to strengthen governance at the customs and
tax administration agencies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the statistical data base, which are aimed
at subscribing to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for the Republic of Azerbaijan
May 9, 2007

1.
On behalf of my Azerbaijan authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the
constructive discussions and the comprehensive staff report. Both provide valuable input to
the authorities’ policy formulation and implementation. Although Azerbaijan’s short term
growth and external outlooks are very favorable, the authorities are – not least thanks to the
staff’s hard work – fully aware of the medium term challenge that the substantial increase in
oil revenues entails.
2.
Azerbaijan is at the beginning of a large oil production boom, accompanied by rapid
economic growth and sizeable current account surpluses. Real GDP grew at about 30 percent
(non-oil real GDP, excluding oil and gas transportation, at about 8 percent) in 2006 and is set
to continue to grow at this pace in 2007. The authorities are determined to use the substantial
oil revenues to modernize the country and reduce poverty.
Fiscal Policy
3.
The population of Azerbaijan clearly expects the growing oil revenues to alleviate
their most pressing economic problems; particularly, they expect a significant reduction in
poverty and noticeable improvements in education and in the provision of stable energy and
water supply. The authorities therefore consider it imperative that they use the financial
opportunity presented by the oil boom to address the most pressing infrastructure and
development needs without delay. Capital expenditure has thus been substantially increased
to finance critical projects in the social sector (schools, hospitals, housing for the large
number of refugees) and to improve basic infrastructure (electricity supply, roads, irrigation).
In addition, pensions and public sector wages, which are at a modest level, are being
increased, while at the same time staffing reductions are being considered.
4.
However, the authorities understand the concerns raised by the staff with regard to
fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability, and they agree that the pace of expenditure
increases needs to be moderated in the medium term. With the most important infrastructure
needs being currently addressed, the increase in the public investment program will be
substantially scaled down in the coming years, and the authorities intend to implement a
number of fiscal reforms to reduce the non-oil primary fiscal deficit. They will continue to
further increase non-oil revenues by expanding the tax base and improving revenue
administration. As announced at the last Article IV discussion, the authorities have
implemented a new system of targeted social assistance and subsequently increased energy
and utilities prices significantly, which will contribute to a substantial reduction in energy
subsidies. Over the medium term, these subsidies will be fully eliminated. The government

2
also intends to improve collection on utility payments and to strengthen budgetary discipline
of state-owned enterprises.
5.
It should also be recalled that many crucial reforms were implemented early on in a
forward-looking manner to prepare the country for the management of increasing oil
revenues. In 1999, the Oil Fund was established to preserve oil wealth for future generations,
and Azerbaijan was the first oil-producing country to issue an Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI) report. In January, the government released its fifth EITI
report.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector
6.
Large oil-related foreign capital inflows and the significant increase in public
spending poses significant challenges for monetary and exchange rate policies. The main
objective of the monetary policy of the National Bank of Azerbaijan (ANB) is to bring
inflation back to single digits in the medium term, and to this end the ANB intends to use all
monetary instruments at its disposal, including nominal exchange rate appreciation. The
ANB has no specific exchange rate target. As pointed out in the staff report, however, the
authorities consider it essential that the benefits of an increase in interest rates and faster
nominal exchange rate appreciation are properly weighed against financial stability risks and
competitiveness considerations.
7.
The ANB will continue to further improve its monetary policy framework and
instruments. In line with IMF technical assistance recommendations, the ANB has introduced
an interest rate corridor and other recommendations to improve open market operations. In
addition, a number of additional improvements, including institutional reforms, are currently
being discussed between the ANB and the government. These improvements aim at
enhancing the ANB’s capacity to conduct more proactive monetary and exchange rate policy.
8.
As pointed out in the staff report, the ANB has tightened prudential regulation and
increased the minimum capital requirement in response to vulnerabilities in the banking
sector. Since the beginning of the year, substantial progress has been achieved in several of
the problem areas identified by the staff. Moreover, the two banks that were listed as not
having met the minimum capital adequacy ratio are in the process of resolving the problem.
The authorities are also determined to privatize the two state-owned banks.
Structural Reforms
9.
While the substantial increase in oil revenues will help the authorities to address
many of the country’s pressing development needs, the authorities are fully aware of the fact
that oil revenues are not a panacea and that they cannot afford to slow down implementation
of structural reforms. On the contrary, in order to address the rising competitiveness
pressures in the non-oil sector, the authorities intend to advance their structural reform
agenda.

3
10.
Apart from the above mentioned fiscal, monetary and banking sector reforms, the
authorities plan to implement further capital account and trade liberalization, improvements
to customs administration, and to address the concerns relating to the business and
investment climate. On April 30, 2007, the President of Azerbaijan issued a decree that calls
for measures to promote entrepreneurship, such as the simplification of licensing and
registration requirements. The authorities will also continue their work on a number of
legislative initiatives, including their work on anti-corruption legislation.
