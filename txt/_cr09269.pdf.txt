EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Singapore was among the first countries in Asia to enter a recession and is now
set for its worst economic contraction since independence in 1965. The economy is projected
to shrink by about 8 percent in 2009, primarily as a result of a slump in external demand and
private investment. Nonetheless, Singapore’s economic fundamentals remain strong and
provide an important buffer against the external shocks. As elsewhere in the region,
Singapore’s financial markets have experienced substantial turbulence, but the impact of the
downturn is being felt primarily through the trade channel. On the whole, financial markets
have continued to operate in an orderly fashion.
Policy issues. The government tackled the unfolding crisis by deploying a broad range of
instruments. The overarching strategy has been to lessen the impact of the external shocks,
while ensuring that Singapore is well positioned to rebound once the global economy
recovers.
Monetary policy. With inflation concerns out of the picture, the monetary settings are
appropriate. Staff and authorities agreed that, barring a significant deterioration of the
outlook for growth or inflation, monetary policy should stay the course until a recovery is
well established. Fiscal policy should provide any additional countercyclical fine-tuning, if
needed. There was agreement that a return to a trend appreciation for the NEER would
safeguard price stability further along the recovery path.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal package in the FY 2009 budget has been timely, appropriately large,
and diversified. It would also support growth over horizons beyond the near term through
accelerated infrastructure spending. The authorities intend to undertake additional measures
if the economy’s trajectory proves more fragile than currently expected. Staff and the
authorities shared the view that a premature fiscal withdrawal could undermine positive
confidence effects of actions taken.
Financial sector. The global turmoil will have a negative impact on short-term earnings of
most financial institutions. Nevertheless, Singapore’s financial system is sound and should
be able to withstand a deeper and more prolonged downturn. This resilience is in large part
the result of robust supervision and regulation as well as local financial institutions’ own
internal risk management and business models. The authorities have been proactive in taking
steps to support confidence and market functionality. There was a broad consensus that credit
quality will deteriorate in the near term, as the recession drags on. However, at present, these
pressures look manageable. Rigorous stress tests encompassing multi-year scenarios, tail
events, and correlated shocks remain a high priority for the period ahead.
Exchange rate. Staff estimates the real effective value of the Singapore dollar to be
somewhat weaker than its equilibrium. As such, it provides countercyclical support. The
authorities noted that according to their valuation models the real effective Singapore dollar
is broadly in line with its fair value. Staff and authorities agreed that unusual uncertainty
clouds these assessments.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Context. While integration into the world economy continues to underpin
Singapore’s economic success, its exposure to the global business cycle is posing
considerable challenges at present. Indeed, Singapore was among the first countries in Asia
to enter a recession and is now set for its worst economic contraction ever. Nonetheless,
economic fundamentals remain strong and provide an important buffer against the external
shocks. As a result, policymakers have ample room to maneuver.
2.
Focus of the mission. The 2009 Article IV discussions focused on the appropriate
policies to lessen the blow of the global recession, maintain financial stability, and ensure
that Singapore is well positioned when the world economy begins to recover. Given
Singapore’s importance as an international financial center, special emphasis was given to
adverse macro-financial interactions and the possibility of outward spillovers.
II. MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Context. As elsewhere in the region, Singapore’s financial markets have experienced
substantial turbulence, but the main impact of the downturn is being felt through the trade
channel.
4.
Growth. The decline in GDP started in
the second quarter of 2008 and accelerated in
the second half of the year (Figure 1 and
Table 1). Activity dropped by nearly
13 percent (q/q, saar) in the first quarter of
2009 as external demand collapsed. Exportoriented sectors (electronics, engineering,
transport and storage) have been hit the
hardest, but services, including in the financial
sector, have also suffered. By contrast, with
large projects underway, construction has held
up well so far.

5.
Inflation. Headline inflation has continued to recede from a peak of 7½ percent
(y/y) in mid-2008 to 1½ percent in March 2009. The drop in inflation was initially driven by
lower food and commodity prices, but recently has become more broad-based, reflecting
falling import prices and slack in demand.
6.
Labor market. The unemployment rate of the resident workforce (seasonally
adjusted) has risen from 2.8 percent in Q1 2008 to 4.8 percent in Q1 2009, and monthly

5
earnings growth has decelerated sharply.1 However, employment of residents has fallen less
than in previous downturns as the corporate sector entered the recession in a stronger
position. In particular, employment in the construction and services is still expanding and is
absorbing laid-off workers from the manufacturing sector. There is anecdotal evidence that
foreign workers are bearing the brunt of adjustment. Government programs (discussed
below) are also helping firms to reduce labor costs and retain employees.
7.
Balance of payments. The current account surplus has shrunk markedly as a result of
the slump in exports (Figure 3 and Table 2). It dropped from an average of 16.3 percent of
GDP in the first three quarters of 2008 to 10.4 percent of GDP in Q4 2008. FDI and portfolio
inflows have also fallen because of the deteriorating growth outlook and rising risk aversion.
However, the decline has been more than offset by lower capital outflows owing to weaker
corporate profits and concerns about asset quality in advanced economies. Outflows have
also been mitigated by Singapore’s status as a safe haven. Official reserves have declined
from the peak of US$177 billion at end-March 2008, but have begun to recover in recent
months, reaching about US$172 billion as of end-May 2009.
III. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
8.
Context. Singapore is a major funding center for South-East Asia. Accordingly,
financial market conditions are highly influenced by developments abroad. In particular, the
global financial volatility that erupted in late September 2008 spilled into domestic asset
prices (Box 1). Markets have been severely tested but, on the whole, have continued to
operate in an orderly fashion. Financial institutions have nonetheless suffered from a drop in
fees and commissions as well as from an increase in intermediation cost. The attendant
contraction in financial activity has contributed 1 percentage point to the y/y fall of quarterly
real GDP in Q4 2008 and Q1 2009 (of 4.2 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively).
9.
Outward spillovers. Overall, financial developments in Singapore had only minor
impact on the Asian Dollar Market. Domestic banks, which in late 2008 were net lenders in
U.S. dollars in the interbank market, became more cautious in their lending. Some foreign
banks seeking U.S. dollar liquidity faced much higher costs of borrowing. While banks that
needed Singapore-dollar liquidity had ready access to the MAS standing facility, financial
institutions that sought to borrow Singapore dollars to swap into U.S. dollars to meet funding
needs elsewhere were unable to pledge foreign currency collateral at the MAS window.
Rates for some transactions in the Asian dollar market exceeded the U.S. dollar SIBOR rate
at times when borrowers were charged a spread depending on their perceived
creditworthiness. Strains were largely over by end-2008.
1

The overall unemployment rate has risen from 2 percent to 3¼ percent during that period.

6
Box 1. Global Crisis and Financial Contagion
The global financial crisis has propagated rapidly around the world. In most markets
(including Asia) financial contagion was the direct result of the global sell-off caused by
deleveraging.
What has been the impact of global financial turbulence on Singapore’s asset prices?
Preliminary insights can be drawn from vector autoregressions (VAR) comprising of a
measure of risk appetite and an asset price, as well as the associated impulse response
functions.1/
Econometric analysis shows that shocks to global risk appetite have a large impact on
the equity returns and exchange rates in Singapore. A one standard deviation increase in
the VIX (a proxy for global risk aversion) leads to a 100 basis points decline in equity prices
and an eight basis point depreciation of the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The
impact on the stock market is comparable with that in the other countries included in the
estimations (the average impact on the
stock market is a decline of about 105 basis

transmitted to the exchange rate.
The impact of risk appetite shocks is instantaneous and long lasting. The shape of the
impulse response functions show that in almost all cases considered, the five-day cumulative
effect of the risk appetite shock is similar to the immediate (one-day) impact—which can
also be inferred from the VAR. Moreover, after 10 trading days the effects of financial
contagion are statistically significant, consistent with the notion that repricing of risk can
have long lasting global effects on prices and volatility.
____________________
1/ The VAR is estimated in first differences with daily data over the January 2004-May 2009 period. The VIX
precedes the “domestic” asset price in each VAR, i.e., shocks to the latter do not affect the former
contemporaneously.
2/ In the case of the Japanese yen, the finding is consistent with the unwinding of carry trades, i.e. as risk
appetite decreases financial home bias reasserts itself (causing the Japanese yen to appreciate).

7
10.
Equity market. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the equity market fell by
almost 24 percent in October 2008, the biggest month-on-month decline in more than twenty
years (Figure 2). The equity sell-off reflected global deleveraging, as well as investor
concerns about Asia’s growth prospects. In recent months, concerns about the severity of the
global downturn have eased and risk appetite has improved, lifting equity prices by
54 percent from the trough in March 2009.
11.
Money markets. Money markets experienced considerable liquidity pressures in the
fall of 2008. Interbank rates spiked with rising counterparty risk, but markets never seized
up. Liquidity pressures eased by January 2009, following coordinated actions by central
banks around the globe. The improved liquidity situation has been reflected in reduced
volatility in interbank rates and lower TED and OIS spreads.2
12.
Foreign exchange market. Turnover in the foreign exchange market—the fifth
largest in the world—fell by about 40 percent between September and December of 2008 as
financial institutions hoarded cash and U.S. dollar liquidity dried up. The Singapore dollar
weakened by 3¼ percent against the U.S. dollar during this period, broadly in line with
exchange rate movements elsewhere in the region. Turnover has improved with the global
increase in U.S. dollar liquidity, but it remains below the levels recorded in the first half of
2008. The Singapore dollar has strengthened against the U.S. dollar since March 2009 along
with other currencies in Asia as risk capital has begun to return to the region.
13.
Credit and corporate debt financing. Credit conditions tightened significantly in
October-November 2008. As banks became more conservative in their lending to protect
their capital base, credit growth has declined from about 20 percent (y/y) in mid 2008 to
8¾ percent in March 2009 (Table 3). Singapore dollar loans to nonbank customers fell by
2 percent between October 2008 and March 2009, while foreign currency loans to nonbank
customers outside Singapore dropped by 12 percent during that period. The relatively mild
contraction in Singapore-dollar credit reflects in part the stronger balance sheets of the
corporate sector than in previous downturns. Nevertheless, there appears to be considerable
tiering as banks have maintained credit lines with their prime customers, while many SMEs
have experienced difficulties accessing bank credit. As a result of rising counterparty risk,
stress has been felt in the trade financing where banks need to settle letters of credit with
overseas counterparties. Issuance of corporate debt securities, especially U.S. dollardenominated, has also fallen sharply in tandem with global markets.

2

A TED spread is the difference between the interest rate on interbank loans and that on a short-term
government security. It captures perceived counterparty risks. An OIS spread is the difference between an
interbank rate and that on an overnight indexed swap. It reflects the availability of credit in interbank lending.

8
14.
Property market. Financial turmoil has also spilled over to the property market,
which, after two years of brisk growth, has cooled off. Private home prices slipped by almost
14 percent (q/q) in the first quarter of 2009 and are down 21 percent from their peak in 2008
(Table 4). Nevertheless, they are still some 20 percent higher than in 2005. The slowdown in
the private market segment has begun to trickle down to the larger and more stable public
housing (or HDB) market where resale prices were marginally lower in the first quarter.
Lower prices have led to a pick up in transaction volumes for private properties in the first
quarter of 2009.
IV. POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
15.
A swift response. The government tackled the unfolding crisis by deploying a broad
range of instruments. The overarching strategy has been to lessen the impact of the external
shocks, while ensuring that Singapore is well positioned to rebound once the global economy
recovers.
16.
Monetary policy. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has loosened
monetary conditions in two steps. The MAS

17.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal response to
the global crisis has involved a large
stimulus package introduced in January
2009 (Box 2). The stimulus measures are
estimated to provide a fiscal impulse of
about 3 percent of GDP in 2009−10. The
implementation began in FY 2008 (ending
in March) and pushed the budget deficit (as
defined by the authorities) to ¾ percent of

Box 2. Resilience Package
The FY 2009 budget introduced the Resilience Package, aimed at blunting the effects of
the downturn and strengthening the longer-term prospects for Singapore. The package
amounts to S$20.5 billion (about 8 percent of GDP)—one of the largest stimulus packages
among advanced economies.
Measures cover five broad areas, and are focused at saving jobs and helping viable
companies to stay afloat as well as enhance their competitiveness (see table). Some measures
took effect in the last quarter of FY 2008, but the bulk of the package will be implemented
during FY 2009. A key element of the package is the Jobs Credit Scheme. It provides an
incentive for companies to maintain or increase their workforce, by giving them grants of
12 percent of the wages of employees who contribute to the mandatory pension scheme, up
to a specified maximum. This scheme is estimated to lower labor costs by 7−9 percent.
Another element of the package is the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative in which, inter alia, the
government assumes 80 percent of loan loss risk to encourage bank lending.

GDP. Recent constitutional amendments enable the government to use more of the returns
from the investment of its reserves to fund the budget. In FY 2009 the deficit is projected to
increase to 3½ percent of GDP, the largest on record (Table 5). However, given ample fiscal
reserves, no public borrowing will be required.
18.
Financial policies. To support the stability of Singapore’s financial system, the
authorities implemented a range of measures. In October, the MAS: (i) adopted a blanket
guarantee on Singapore dollar and foreign currency nonbank deposits in domestic and
foreign banks through 2010; (ii) entered into a precautionary US$30 billion currency swap
agreement with the Fed; and (iii) intensified its surveillance of the financial sector.
Furthermore, the MAS announced that it would inject additional liquidity through its
standing facilities, if needed.3 In November, the government introduced measures to help
SMEs maintain access to bank credit. The measures were adjusted and expanded in the
following months to maximize their effectiveness.
V. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
19.
Near-term outlook. The economy is projected to contract by about 8 percent in 2009,
with the trough in GDP occurring probably in 2009Q4 (Table 6). The slowdown would result
primarily from a slump in external demand and private investment. The 2009 budget should
mitigate the decline in aggregate demand and shore up private consumption by limiting the
rise in unemployment and softening the impact of the crisis on firms’ cash flow and
households’ disposable income. As the global economy recovers, activity is expected to pick
up modestly in 2010, with GDP growth reaching 2½ percent. Inflation would fall to about
zero in 2009, on the back of lower food and energy prices and a widening output gap. The
authorities agreed with the broad contours of these projections, but noted that the upturn in
2010 could be stronger given signs of resilience in intra-regional trade and in advanced
economies.
20.
Risks. There was broad agreement that, given Singapore’s status as a financial center
and dependence on exports, the main growth risks relate to a further worsening of the
external environment. First, global volatility may directly spill into local financial markets,
undercutting bank credit. Second, international financial developments may precipitate a
sharper contraction of the global economy, with renewed adverse effects on trade and related
services. Macro-financial interactions could amplify either channel of contagion. On the
upside, countercyclical policies at home and abroad could prove more effective than
anticipated, and intraregional trade may pick up faster than expected.

3

Access to standing facilities had been broadened beyond primary dealers in June 2008.

11
21.
Medium-term outlook. As global activity recovers, Singapore’s economy is expected
to regain forward momentum. Domestic demand and exports would pick up. Growth would
also be supported by increased public spending in infrastructure. Nonetheless, trend growth
is likely to be weaker than before the crisis, as credit conditions remain tight and production
adjusts to new patterns of external demand. In the outer years, assuming an unchanged real
effective exchange rate, the current account balance would hover around 15 percent of GDP,
substantially lower than before the crisis. This reflects: (i) declining savings owing to a
return of corporate profitability to more normal levels and the early impact of population
ageing; and (ii) rising public investment (about 2 percent of GDP per year on average over
the next five years in the authorities’ plans), which partially offsets the unwinding of the
recent boom in the property sector. The authorities shared staff’s views on the medium-term
evolution of the current account, and noted that Singapore’s flexible economic structures
should enable it to capitalize on new sources of growth. An Economic Strategies
Committee—chaired by the Finance Minister and comprising representative from the public
and private sectors—will be set up later this year. It will develop recommendations to
identify new growth opportunities, strengthen corporate capabilities, foster a knowledgebased economy, and secure high-value jobs for Singaporeans.
VI. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. The Role of Macroeconomic Policies
22.
Context. Recognizing the limits of countercyclical action in a small and highly open
economy, policymakers have calibrated their response so as to strike a balance between
supporting demand and facilitating structural adjustments.
23.
Monetary policy. For monetary policy, this balancing act has involved loosening
monetary conditions without undermining exchange rate stability or increasing the cost of
credit to businesses and households.4 The MAS’ actions have achieved these goals by
limiting volatility in both exchange and interest rates. Staff agreed that, with inflation
concerns out of the picture, the monetary settings are appropriate. Barring a significant
deterioration in the outlook for growth or inflation, monetary policy should stay the course
for some time to come. There was agreement that, once a recovery is well established, a
return to a trend appreciation for the NEER would safeguard price stability as slack in the
economy is taken up.

4

With the NEER as the intermediate target of monetary policy, a monetary loosening involving an increase in
the expected depreciation of the NEER (rather than a re-centering of the band) implies an increase in nominal
interest rates, consistent with uncovered interest parity.

12
24.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal policymaking has also involved balancing different objectives.
The authorities noted that the stimulus package for the current fiscal year supports growth
without blunting incentives for structural adjustments.5


Staff agreed that the fiscal package had been timely, appropriately large, and
diversified. It would support growth also over longer horizons through accelerated
infrastructure spending. Furthermore, the authorities’ intention to undertake
additional measures outside the normal budget cycle if the economy’s trajectory
proves more fragile than currently expected added a desirable element of contingency
to the fiscal plans. Staff and the authorities shared the view that a premature fiscal
withdrawal in the next budget could undermine positive confidence effects of actions
taken. The authorities noted that lack of sustainability concerns and a strong track
record of responsiveness as well as short inside and outside lags lessen the need for
pre-announcing the direction of fiscal policy.



Further along the recovery path, fiscal policy would need to play a part in fostering
likely transformations in a post-crisis world. Public investment in physical and social
infrastructure would continue to foster an enabling business environment. In the
staff’s view, consideration could also be given to strengthening automatic stabilizers
by assessing taxes on the basis of current rather than previous year’s income, with
due regard to the administrative and compliance costs that such change might impose
on taxpayers.
B. The Outlook for the Financial Sector

25.
Context. Although the global turmoil will have a negative impact on short-term
earnings of most financial institutions, Singapore’s financial system (which is
bank-dominated) should be able to withstand a deeper and more prolonged global downturn.
Post-crisis transformations would, if anything, boost demand for financial services, as
regional trade and financial integration deepens.
26.
Banks. Despite the turmoil, domestic banks remain profitable, liquid, and well
capitalized (Figure 4 and Table 7).6 Their exposure to toxic assets was low to start with, with
5

For instance, the temporary nature of the adopted measures was underscored by the unprecedented decision of
funding key components of the Resilience Package from past fiscal reserves. The remaining financing of the
FY 2009 deficit would come from the budgetary surpluses accumulated during the current election cycle and
will not require debt issuance.

For the banking system as a whole, the loan-to-deposit ratio is about 80 percent, regulatory capital is
16.7 percent of risk-weighted assets (Tier 1 ratio is 13.1 percent), and the liquid asset ratio is 19 percent. Banks
are funded primarily through retail deposits.

13
total CDO investments amounting to only 0.3 percent of total assets (2.6 percent of
regulatory capital). Foreign banks (which account for over 50 percent of total banking system
assets) are subject to stringent licensing procedures, and the MAS has assurances of liquidity
support from their head offices.7 Looking forward, there was broad agreement that, although
credit spreads have widened, banks will face pressure on profits from lower fee income and
higher provisioning. Credit quality is expected to deteriorate in the near term, as a result of
the slowing domestic economy. However, at present, these pressures look manageable. The
MAS has undertaken extensive stress tests and, even under a severe scenario, domestic
banks’ Tier 1 capital will remain substantially above the regulatory minimum.
27.
Insurance. Although investment income and premium revenues fell in late 2008,
insurance companies continue to have strong capital and liquidity buffers. Insurers had no
significant exposure to subprime loans or structured credit products, and regulations stipulate
that they can only engage in derivatives trading for hedging purposes or efficient portfolio
management. As a result, insurers tend to invest predominantly in cash, deposits, and
government securities. Their liabilities also tend to be conservative (e.g., investment linked
products account for a small fraction of their offerings). The MAS has stepped up its
oversight of the industry, and the policyholders’ protection scheme is under review. There
was agreement that the insurance sector is unlikely to pose systemic risks, given its small
size and limited financial linkages.8
28.
Property. The slowdown in the real estate market has weakened the financial position
of property firms. Given the prospective excess supply, some segments of the private
property market may come under further downward pressure, leading to some consolidation
in the sector. However, the authorities noted that most property developers entered the
downturn with strong balance sheets, and are benefiting from government schemes to support
their cash flows (e.g., through property tax rebates or deferrals). Furthermore, bank lending
to the property sector remains well within regulatory limits and there are no large exposures
to individual developers.

7

Domestic Banking Unit assets (primarily in Singapore dollars) are split about equally between domestic and
foreign banks. However, foreign banks account for 86 percent of Asian Currency Unit assets, all in foreign
currency (Box 3). Most foreign banks operate in Singapore as branches. Their liquidity needs are included as
part of the head office's overall liquidity management and commitment to global operations. The MAS has
regular contacts with both the head offices and home-country supervisors of the larger foreign banks in
Singapore. The money market and funding operations of these entities in Singapore are important for these
banks in the Asia and Pacific region and hence liquidity support by the head office is an issue often discussed
and agreed upon.

8

Insurance sector accounts for less than 6 percent of total financial sector assets. Local banks’ loans to
insurance companies account for less than 0.2 percent of total loans.

14
Box 3. Asian Currency Units and Domestic Banking Units
Banks operating in Singapore book their activities in two distinct accounting units—the
Domestic Banking Unit (DBU) and Asian Currency Unit (ACU). Singapore dollar
transactions are recorded in the DBU, while foreign currency transactions are recorded
primarily in the ACU.1/ The distinction between the DBU and ACU is purely an accounting
convention, which in itself does not have implications for assessment of banks’ financial
soundness. ACU and DBU are not separate legal entities. However, banks seeking to operate
an ACU will need approval by the MAS. This arrangement was designed in 1970s to
encourage foreign currency business in the so-called Asian Dollar Market (ADM), and thus
develop Singapore as a regional financial hub. While ACUs are primarily funded from the
interbank market, the main source of funding for DBUs is retail deposits.
As in other financial centers, foreign currency activities in Singapore are subject to a
different regulatory treatment. ACUs are exempt from certain provisions of the Banking
Act, notably the minimum cash balance and the minimum liquid asset ratio requirements.
Historically, many foreign banks have set up operations in Singapore with the purpose of
establishing an ACU.
While ACUs are exempt from some prudential rules, they are closely supervised by the
MAS. Individual ACUs are subject to size limits set by the MAS. Banks are required to
provide monthly detailed financial statements on their ACUs, and are subject to regular onsite inspections. Foreign banks with ACUs are required to provide assurances of liquidity
support from their head offices.

29.
Asset management. Hedge funds, wealth managers, private banking, corporate fund
advisory, and REITs are an important segment of Singapore’s financial system. Assets under
management in Singapore stood at US$814 billion at end-2007, but have dropped by
end-2008 as a result of the global financial turmoil. Like elsewhere in the region, hedge
funds managed in Singapore (which are reportedly less leveraged than their foreign
peers) have faced large redemption pressures. Lack of comprehensive data on these funds
makes it difficult to assess their links with the rest of the financial system. Nonetheless, in
the view of many market participants, Singapore will continue to attract asset management
business.
C. Exchange Rate
30.
Developments. Since mid-2008, the Singapore dollar has depreciated by 2 percent in
real effective terms. This reflected mostly a comparable depreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate, as the monetary stance has been loosened.
31.
Assessment. Staff estimates the real effective value of the Singapore dollar to be
somewhat weaker than its equilibrium (Box 4). As such, it provides countercyclical support.
This assessment is subject to considerable uncertainty, as reflected in unusually high
volatility implied by foreign exchange options as well as poor visibility about the direction of
the global economy and fundamentals. In fact, since mid-2008, reserves have declined by
nearly US$7 billion, but intervention has been two-sided. The authorities noted that
according to their valuation models the real effective Singapore dollar is broadly in line with
its fair value. They recognized nonetheless that unusual uncertainty clouds these
assessments. They also stressed that monetary policy has delivered a trend appreciation of
the exchange rate and has not hindered structural adjustments. There was agreement that
Singapore’s exchange rate regime, which has helped achieve a track record of low inflation
with prolonged economic growth, continues to serve the country well.
32.
Policy mix. In the staff’s view, once a recovery is in train, the policy settings should
allow for a resumption of the trend appreciation of the NEER. A longer-term appreciation of
the Singapore dollar would be facilitated by a recalibration of the policy mix toward reduced
public savings and tighter monetary conditions. The authorities noted that higher public
spending is planned for the medium term. They also agreed that the real effective exchange
rate would likely experience a trend appreciation over the medium term, and that such
appreciation should not be resisted, if driven by fundamentals.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Macroeconomic setting. Singapore has been hard hit by the global recession and is
set for the worst economic contraction in its history. The effects of the slowdown are being
felt mostly through the trade channel as reflected in the slump in exports. Local financial

16
Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
The real effective Singapore dollar is somewhat weaker than its estimated medium-term
equilibrium level.
The exchange rate has been on an appreciation
trend since early 2005. This trend reflects relatively
stable inflation differentials vis-à-vis trading
partners and the appreciation of the NEER. The
Singapore dollar weakened in real effective terms at
the onset of the global crisis, but it has moved
sideways in recent months, reflecting in part policy
changes.

To assess the level of the exchange rate in relation
to its medium term equilibrium, three CGER-type methodologies have been applied:


The macroeconomic balance approach estimates current account norm of about 10 percent of
GDP. The relatively large norm reflects Singapore’s significant fiscal surpluses and the rising
share of the working-age population. Estimates of the norm are derived from a panel of
55 advanced and emerging economies over 1973−2007. According to the macroeconomic balance
approach, the Singapore dollar is undervalued by about 5 percent (after multilateral consistency
adjustments).



The external sustainability approach points to a broadly similar undervaluation. Under the
assumption that the net foreign asset position (NFA) is stabilized at its 2007 level (estimated at
about 175 percent of GDP), the implied undervaluation is 10 percent. Computing Singapore’s
NFA with cumulative current account balances gives an NFA of around 200 percent of GDP—
and an undervaluation of the Singapore dollar of around 2 percent.1/



The estimate from the equilibrium exchange rate approach is broadly in line with those
above. According to this approach, the exchange rate is some 3 percent below its estimated
medium term equilibrium. Productivity gains in tradables and rising NFA support a more
appreciated equilibrium exchange rate, partly offsetting the effect of the steady deterioration in
the terms of trade.

During the 2008 Article IV consultation, staff’s assessment was that the real effective Singapore
dollar was 5−15 percent undervalued relative to its equilibrium level. The lower undervaluation in the
current assessment reflects inter alia a smaller underlying current account balance (consistent with
weaker projected demand in Singapore’s main export markets), negative terms of trade shock (from
lower prices for financial services and refined oil products) and losses on Singapore’s external assets.
____________________
1/ As discussed in IMF Country Report No. 08/280, estimates based on the external sustainability approach are
sensitive to the level of NFA used. For instance, adding market estimates of the GIC’s assets to the reported IIP
would put Singapore’s NFA at about 250–300 percent of GDP. Using the MSCI-World index as a proxy for
GIC’s equity portfolio, estimated annual capital gains would average about 4 percent of GDP during 2001–07
(similar to the CGER’s adjustment for capital gains). In this case, the estimated undervaluation is about zero.

17
markets have come under stress, but have continued to operate in an orderly fashion.
Nevertheless, a further worsening of international market turbulence remains an important
macroeconomic risk. Against this background, and given the openness of the economy, the
authorities have rightly focused on lessening the blow of the external shocks, while ensuring
Singapore is well positioned once the global economy starts to recover.
34.
Response to the global crisis. The authorities have responded forcefully with a large
fiscal stimulus package, monetary policy easing, and measures aimed at ensuring financial
stability. The extraordinary circumstances have warranted some departure from the
medium-term compass at the core of Singapore’s policy frameworks, but the response has
managed to strike a balance between supporting demand and avoiding delays in necessary
structural adjustments.
35.
Monetary policy. For monetary policy, this balancing act has involved loosening
monetary conditions—inter alia to fend off deflation risks—without undermining exchange
rate stability or increasing the cost of credit to businesses and households. The MAS’
two-step decision to first eliminate the appreciation bias and then re-center the NEER target
band has achieved these goals. With inflation concerns out of the picture, the monetary
settings are appropriate. Barring a significant deterioration of the outlook for growth or
inflation, monetary policy should stay the course until a recovery is well established. Further
along the recovery path, monetary policy will need to shift to a tightening stance, including
with a return to a targeted trend appreciation for the NEER, to safeguard price stability as
slack in the economy is taken up.
36.
Exchange rate. The REER is somewhat weaker than its medium-term equilibrium.
This assessment—which is subject to considerable uncertainty—does not imply the need of
policy adjustments at present but points to the likely evolution of the real exchange rate once
a global recovery takes root. The floating exchange rate continues to serve Singapore well
and the exchange-rate-centered monetary framework has been an important source of
stability in times of economic turbulence.
37.
Fiscal policy. The large stimulus for the current fiscal year will go a long way toward
mitigating the impact of the output contraction on households and businesses. The package is
designed to minimize tensions between limiting the downturn and fostering microeconomic
incentives that will support rapid adjustment to the changes in the global economy. Further
measures should be considered if the economy’s trajectory proves more fragile than currently
expected. As the authorities recognize, the next budget will need to be crafted in line with the
evolving economic situation and avoid a premature fiscal withdrawal that could undermine
positive confidence effects of actions taken. Over the medium term, fiscal policy will need to
play a part in readying the economy for shifts in the pattern of global demand (as balance
sheets are rebuilt in advanced economies and internal sources of growth gain prominence in
emerging markets). Along with the flexible labor and product markets, stepped-up public

18
investment in physical and social infrastructure would create an enabling environment in
which Singapore could seize new opportunities.
38.
Financial sector policies. Singapore’s financial system has entered the global crisis
from a position of strength, and has coped well with the turbulence in international financial
markets so far. Yet, asset quality will deteriorate as the recession drags on. Rigorous stress
tests encompassing multi-year scenarios, tail events, and correlated shocks should remain a
high priority for the MAS in the period ahead. Continued efforts to upgrade contingency
planning and coordinate with supervisors in other jurisdictions, particularly as regards the
unwinding of deposit guarantees, should also be a priority. Looking beyond the near term,
the MAS should continue to adapt its supervisory and regulatory framework as lessons from
the crisis are learned.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Singapore’s exchange rate regime is floating. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
monitors its value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to
maintain this value within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention
currency.
Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore-dollar credit facilities to, and bond and equity
issuance by, nonresident financial institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained by
nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks, finance companies, and hedge
funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for equity listings or bond issuance
to finance activities outside Singapore have to be swapped or converted into foreign currency
upon draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar credit

3
facilities in excess of S$5 million to nonresident financial entities if there is reason to believe
that the Singapore-dollar proceeds may be used for Singapore-dollar currency speculation.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Singapore is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions
were held during May 5−12, 2008, the Executive Board discussed the staff report (IMF Country
Report No. 08/280) and concluded the consultation on July 16, 2008.
IX.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

The FSAP was undertaken in conjunction with the 2003 Article IV consultation. The FSSA was
published as IMF Country Report No. 04/104.
A fiscal ROSC remains a priority for the authorities, and the exact timing is likely to be
considered in 2010. A data ROSC could also be considered at that time.

ANNEX II: SINGAPORE––STATISTICAL ISSUES
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and meets all the SDDS specifications. These
include the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data; and the dissemination of
advance release calendars; quarterly certification of the metadata posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board; and provision of information to allow users to
assess data quality.
While the authorities have continued to improve the quality of data, dissemination of more
disaggregated data would enhance the basis for macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly
in the external and fiscal areas.


In early 2006, the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) completed rebasing the
reference year for the Singapore System of National Accounts from 1995 to 2000.
The DOS also made improvements in data sources and methodology. The
reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted, resulting in
lower statistical discrepancies. Work on further improvements, particularly with
respect to changes in inventories, is ongoing.



The authorities have released the full set of statistics on merchandise trade including
trade with Indonesia since January 2006. Prior to this, merchandise trade statistics did
not fully include trade with Indonesia, although trade transactions with Indonesia are
captured elsewhere in the current account of the balance of payments (BOP).



Information on government assets held abroad is neither published nor provided to
the Fund. Interest and dividend on these assets and debt service payments on
domestic debt made from the extra budgetary Government Securities Fund are
published on an annual basis. Data on the financial position of the consolidated public
sector are not published.



Data on the international investment position (IIP) are not provided on a
disaggregated level as suggested by the Balance of Payments Manual (5th edition).
Also, the IIP position does not include the net foreign assets held by Singapore’s
Government Investment Corporation, although the associated flows are included in
the balance of payments data. The authorities have committed to improve over time
the reporting of the international investment position to the IMF.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting
data to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Singapore
July 29, 2009
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.

Recent Data



Activity rebounded strongly in the second quarter. On advanced estimates, GDP
growth (q/q saar) jumped to 20.4 percent, after 4 quarters of output contraction. On a
year-on-year basis, GDP fell 3.7 percent, a slower rate of decline than that in Q1 2009
(9.6 percent) and Q4 2008 (4.2 percent). However, June industrial production (down
9.3 percent reflecting a sharp slowdown in biomedical manufacturing) and export
data (showing inter alia electronics exports still falling at about 20 percent y/y)
suggest that the Q2 outturn might have been partly driven by one-off factors.



Singapore’s CPI declined y/y by 0.5 percent in June (compared to 0.3 percent in
May). Mild temporary deflation in the first half of the year is consistent with the
staff’s projection of inflation at about ¼ percent for the year as a whole.

2.

Policies



On July 22, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank Negara Malaysia, and the
Monetary Authority of Singapore announced the establishment of a working group to
coordinate the exit from full deposit guarantees in their respective jurisdictions.



Employment growth in the public sector remains on track. Of the 18,000 new jobs in
the public sector and government-supported areas such health and education
envisaged under the 2009 budget, 13,000 have been created so far.

3.
Outlook. On the whole, the latest data releases support the staff’s view that the
Singaporean economy is likely to experience slow and uneven growth in the period ahead.
Nonetheless, the Q2 outturn and an upward revision in Q1 growth mechanically lift the GDP
numbers for 2009. Accordingly, GDP growth for the year is likely to be revised from
−7¾ percent to around −4⅓ percent in the upcoming WEO round. The revised staff estimate
would be on the strong side of the latest official growth forecast, a range of −6 percent to
−4 percent.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 31, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Singapore
On July 29, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Singapore.1
Background
Singapore has been severely affected by the global downturn. It was among the first countries
in Asia to enter a recession and is now set for its worst economic contraction since
independence. Nonetheless, economic fundamentals remain strong and provide an important
buffer against the external shocks.
As elsewhere in the region, Singapore’s financial markets experienced considerable turbulence
in the fall of 2008, but the impact of the crisis has been felt mainly through the trade channel.
The collapse in external demand has led to a sharp contraction in GDP, which fell by almost
13 percent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate) in the first quarter of 2009.
Although export-oriented sectors have been hit the hardest, services, including in the financial
sector, have also suffered. Unemployment has risen and wage growth has decelerated.
However, employment of residents has fallen less than in previous downturns as the corporate
sector entered the recession in a stronger position.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The current account surplus has shrunk markedly as a result of the slump in exports. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows have also fallen because of the deteriorating growth
outlook and rising risk aversion. However, the decline has been more than offset by lower
capital outflows owing to weaker corporate profits and concerns about asset quality in advanced
economies. Outflows have also been mitigated by Singapore’s status as a safe haven.
Singapore is a major funding center for South-East Asia and its financial market conditions are
highly influenced by developments abroad. The equity market fell by almost 24 percent in
October 2008, the biggest month-on-month decline in more than twenty years, and money and
credit markets experienced considerable liquidity pressures. However, as concerns about the
severity of the global downturn have eased in recent months, and risk appetite has improved,
equity prices have rebounded, and the liquidity situation has also improved.
The policy response to the crisis has been forceful and has included a large fiscal stimulus
package, an easing of monetary policy, and a range of measures aimed at stabilizing the
financial sector. The overarching strategy has been to lessen the impact of the external shocks,
while ensuring that Singapore is well positioned to rebound once the global economy recovers.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, given the openness of its economy, Singapore was among the
first countries in Asia to enter a recession following the collapse of external demand.
Nevertheless, strong economic fundamentals, coupled with the authorities’ skillful
implementation of a broad range of policy instruments, have helped lessen the impact of the
shocks. The focus now is to preserve financial stability and to ensure that Singapore is well
positioned to rebound once the global economy recovers, taking advantage of the ample room
for maneuver at the authorities’ disposal.
Directors considered monetary policy settings to be broadly appropriate, supporting domestic
demand without undermining exchange rate stability. They agreed that, barring a significant
deterioration of the outlook for growth or inflation, monetary policy should stay the course until a
recovery is clearly established. Further along the recovery path, a tightening stance would be
warranted to safeguard price stability, through targeting a trend appreciation of the nominal
effective exchange rate.
Directors observed that the floating exchange rate regime has served Singapore well, and that
the exchange-rate centered monetary policy framework has been an important source of
stability in times of turbulence. They noted the staff’s assessment, though subject to
considerable uncertainty, that the Singapore dollar in real effective terms appears to be
somewhat weaker than its medium-term equilibrium level. The real effective exchange rate
would likely strengthen, in line with fundamentals, once a global recovery takes hold.

3

Directors agreed that the fiscal policy response, most recently the Resilience Package
contained in the 2009 budget, should go a long way toward mitigating the impact of the
recession on households and businesses, while also fostering the country’s long-term growth
potential. They welcomed the authorities’ readiness to take further measures if the economy’s
trajectory proves more fragile than currently expected. Directors emphasized that, over the
medium term, fiscal policy will need to play a part in preparing the economy for shifts in the
pattern of global demand. Higher public investment in physical and social infrastructure, along
with flexible labor and product markets, would create an enabling environment in which
Singapore could seize new economic opportunities. Consideration could be given also to
strengthening the role of automatic stabilizers.
Directors noted that Singapore’s financial sector has shown remarkable resilience and should
be able to withstand an even deeper and more prolonged global downturn. They commended
the authorities for proactively implementing a series of measures to safeguard the stability of the
financial system. Directors stressed that, in the period ahead, priority should continue to be
given to rigorous stress-testing as asset quality is likely to deteriorate, upgrading contingency
planning, and strengthening cooperation with supervisors abroad. They welcomed the decision
of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Bank
Negara Malaysia to coordinate the unwinding of deposit guarantees in their respective
jurisdictions. Directors encouraged the MAS to continue to adapt its supervisory and regulatory
framework as lessons from the crisis are learned.
Given all members’ obligations to provide accurate data to the Fund, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to improve over time the currently incomplete reporting of the international
investment position of Singapore.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also
issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the
Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this
pdf file) for the 2009 Article IV Consultation with Singapore is also available.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for the 2009 Article IV
Consultation. The focus of the Consultation, on policy responses to cushion the domestic
economy from the adverse impact of the current global recession and to ensure it is well
positioned for the eventual recovery, was appropriate and constructive. The discussions at
this year’s Consultation were among the most engaging in recent years.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

2.1
Singapore is one of the most open economies in the world. Given its deep and
extensive integration with international markets, the economy could not be insulated from the
unfolding global recession which gathered momentum towards the end of last year. In Q1
2009, domestic economic activity experienced its second consecutive quarter of double-digit
contraction on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised rate (q-o-q SAAR) basis,
with the GDP level falling to 10% below its Q1 2008 peak. Industries with a high degree of
external orientation, such as manufacturing and trade-related services, bore the brunt of the
downturn.
2.2
More recent data, including the Advance Estimates released by the Ministry of Trade
of Industry, showed that the domestic economy has likely reached a trough. The Singapore
economy rebounded strongly by 20% q-o-q SAAR in Q2 2009, regaining some of the
previous output losses. This recovery has to be seen in the context of the sharp retraction in
economic activity which took place during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009. Businesses have started to
rebuild inventories to levels that are more sustainable and consistent with underlying
demand, which has stabilised somewhat amidst easing financial conditions. In the domestic
financial sector, several segments posted gains in the second quarter. Notably, stock market
turnover was supported by improved investor sentiment, while domestic non-bank loans
remained firm.
2.3
Nevertheless, the Singapore economy is unlikely to witness a sharp and decisive
recovery this year, as that would be contingent on a sustained recovery of final demand in the
G3. Given continued stresses in the global financial system and sluggishness in labour
market conditions in the major economies, domestic GDP growth is thus likely to be
concomitantly slow and uneven in the near term. Indeed, Singapore is facing the most
challenging external environment in recent history. GDP growth in eight out of our top ten
trading partners is expected to be negative this year, compared with five in ten during the
Asian Financial Crisis. Against this backdrop, the domestic economy is forecast to contract
by 4-6% in 2009, and continue to register below-trend growth in 2010.
2.4
Domestic CPI inflation has been on a downward trend since hitting a peak of 7.5%
y-o-y in Q2 2008. It fell sharply to 2.1% in Q1 this year before turning slightly negative in
Q2 (-0.5%). The steep falloff in inflation is attributed first to the dissipation of the impact of

2
the Goods and Services Tax hike in Q3 2008 and, subsequently, to the collapse in global oil
prices. Other drivers of inflation in 2008, such as escalating global food prices and elevated
domestic business costs, have also moderated. More recently, administrative measures from
the government’s FY2009 Budget have also lowered inflation through reductions in public
housing maintenance costs.
2.5
CPI inflation is likely to remain slightly negative for the rest of the year, due largely
to the drag from oil-related items. While global oil prices have recovered from the trough
reached in February, they are expected to remain significantly lower this year compared to
2008. The slack in demand and easing domestic costs would also cap increases in consumer
prices. This period of disinflation is characteristic of the adjustment process taking place
during an economic downturn, although exaggerated by the sharp run-up in prices a year ago.
For the whole of 2009, CPI inflation is likely to average between -0.5% and 0.5%.

Policy Responses

3.1
Amidst the rapidly evolving economic conditions over the past few quarters, the
responses of monetary policy have been deliberately graduated, underpinned by its core
objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term. In October 2008, MAS eased
monetary policy by shifting to a 0% appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective
exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band in light of the weak economic environment and easing
inflationary pressures. This was followed by a re-centring of the policy band to the prevailing
level of the S$NEER in April this year, while keeping the 0% appreciation path.
Notwithstanding the sharp economic rebound in Q2 2009, growth remains below trend and
inflationary pressures continue to be muted. At this juncture, the current policy stance
remains appropriate to support the economic recovery and ensure medium-term price
stability. The Singapore dollar continues to play the anchor of stability role for our small and
open economy.
3.2
At the same time, fiscal policy has contributed in a significant way to the required
adjustments in the overall macroeconomic stance. The FY2009 Budget was announced about
one month earlier than usual in response to the economic crisis. The $20.5 billion (8.2% of
GDP) Resilience Package comprised measures that targeted the multiple stress points
confronting businesses and households, such as supplementing their cash flows in the short
term, while providing resources for building long-term capabilities. This objective was
carefully balanced against the need to ensure that the measures would not distort the market
incentives for companies and workers to take the necessary steps to adjust to the new realities
in the global economy. The Resilience Package is estimated to result in a deficit in the Basic
Balance1 of 6.0% of GDP, and an overall budget deficit of 3.5% of GDP.2 However,
1

The Basic Balance is the Budget Balance before accounting for Net Investment Income/Returns and transfers
to endowment and trust funds.

2

This is significantly more expansionary than previous off-Budget packages. In the downturns of 1998 and
2001, the off-Budget packages resulted in a surplus in the Basic Balance of 0.7% of GDP in FY1998, and a
deficit in the Basic Balance of 1.5% of GDP in FY2001.

3
Singapore will not need to borrow to finance this deficit. The authorities remain vigilant to
the continuing risks in the external environment and their ability to implement fiscal policy
measures quickly will ensure a timely response as the situation requires.
3.3
The authorities noted the IMF staff’s suggestion to strengthen the automatic
stabilisers by assessing taxes on the basis of current rather than previous year’s income. The
authorities will continue to review this, bearing in mind the higher administrative and
compliance costs that come with a current year basis of assessment. In the meantime, the
authorities have implemented various counter-cyclical measures to mitigate the tax impact on
individuals and companies, including personal income tax rebate, enhanced loss carry-back,
and deferred installment payments for taxpayers with short-term financial difficulties.
3.4
Singapore’s financial system has weathered the crisis well. The banking system and
insurance sector had low exposures to toxic assets and remained profitable, liquid and wellcapitalised. There were no disruptions to inter-bank funding markets in domestic currency
and credit flows to the economy. Going forward, MAS’ continuing efforts to strengthen
financial stability include focusing financial institutions’ attention on managing risks and
safeguarding the robustness of their liquidity, earnings and capital. MAS is also shaping and
adapting new international regulatory standards, strengthening the corporate governance of
financial institutions, and improving safety net arrangements in Singapore such as the deposit
insurance fund and the policy-owners protection fund.
3.5
Aside from cyclical policy responses, the authorities have embarked on a review of
Singapore’s medium-term economic growth strategies amidst the structural changes
occurring in the global landscape. Moreover, as the economy transits to a more developed
phase, growth would have to be increasingly underpinned by improvements in productivity.
Against this, the Prime Minister has tasked a newly-established Economic Strategies
Committee (ESC) to develop strategies for Singapore to build capabilities and maximise
opportunities as a global city in a new world environment. Chaired by the Minister for
Finance and comprising representatives from both the public and private sectors, the
Committee will focus its work on five broad areas: seizing growth opportunities,
strengthening corporate capabilities, growing human and knowledge capital, creating quality
jobs and real wage growth for Singaporeans, and optimising the use of scarce resources. To
facilitate this, eight sub-committees have been formed to undertake in-depth reviews of the
various issues.3 The ESC aims to put forward its key recommendations in January 2010,
while the full report is expected to be released by mid-2010.

Final Remarks

4.1
The global economy is going through an unprecedented downturn. Accordingly, an
ultra-open economy like Singapore has had to confront an extreme deterioration in external
conditions. While domestic GDP growth has taken a sharp hit, the solid fundamentals of the

economy have ensured that cyclical adjustments have not derailed macroeconomic and
financial stability. As the global economy is restored to health, the recovery in the Singapore
economy will also pick up in pace, although the authorities recognise that this could be a
slow and extended process. Appropriate macroeconomic policy settings have and will be
formulated with these prospects in mind. The authorities remain fully committed to
engagement in global markets and are confident that Singapore will continue to reap the full
benefits of its outward-oriented development strategy.
4.2
The Singapore authorities are pleased to inform the Board that they are agreeable to
the publication of the Staff Report associated with the 2009 Article IV consultation and will
be releasing the Buff Statement at the same time.
