EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

El Salvador has adopted a wide range of reforms since the early 1990s. The
government that took office in June 2004 has continued the reform effort, with
actions to strengthen tax revenue, improve debt management, and adopt CAFTA-DR
(the free-trade agreement of Central America and Dominican Republic with the
United States) to deepen integration with the global and regional economy.

•

The near-term outlook has strengthened, although challenges remain. After
several years of sluggish growth, economic activity has picked up and growth is
expected to reach 3½ percent this year, supported by the authorities’ policies and
favorable global conditions. Strengthening medium-term growth prospects requires
reforms to improve the debt dynamics, address banking fragilities, and bolster private
investment and exports through improved competitiveness and higher savings.

•

The authorities are planning further policy actions. They intend to limit tax
exemptions and subsidies, raise priority spending, and obtain passage of banking
reforms this year. Their fiscal framework would keep public debt steady through
2008 (42 percent of GDP) and bring it down thereafter.

Key issues and staff recommendations
•

Discussions focused on policies to enhance growth and social progress within the
framework of formal dollarization. Staff supported plans to strengthen the
economy’s resiliency to shocks and improve competitiveness, and encouraged the
authorities to reinforce the fiscal framework. Supportive global conditions provide a
good opportunity to advance the reform process.

•

Fiscal policy. The staff recommended placing the public debt on a firm downward
path, while protecting priority spending. It supported the authorities’ medium-term
strategy to strengthen tax revenue and contain pension costs to provide more room for
investment and social spending. To achieve these objectives, the staff recommended
more fundamental tax and pension reforms.

•

Banking reform. The staff supported plans to consolidate financial stability through
steps to strengthen the prudential and supervisory framework, deepen intermediation,
and improve the safety net. To solidify the dollarization regime, the staff encouraged
the authorities to strengthen the lender-of-last-resort function and restructure the
central bank’s balance sheet, as provided by the dollarization law of 2001.

•

Competitiveness. Improving competitiveness is key to boosting productivity and
investment. The staff supported the authorities’ strategy to boost infrastructure and
human capital, reduce red tape, tackle crime, and create new trade opportunities,
which would help lower the cost of doing business in El Salvador.

5

I. OVERVIEW
1.
El Salvador has made major strides on several fronts since the peace accords
of 1992. Political stability and democracy have become firmly rooted. Social conditions have
improved, with a substantial decline in poverty. Wide-ranging reforms have been adopted,
which were capped by formal dollarization in 2001 (Table 1). As a result, El Salvador
maintains macroeconomic stability, has an investment grade rating (the only such country in
Central America), and is often considered to be the second-best performer on reforms in
Latin America, after Chile.
2.
Building upon this progress, President Saca has pursued an outward-oriented
policy strategy to enhance growth and social prospects. Mr. Saca, who began his 5-year
term in June 2004, has focused economic policies on developing new sources of growth and
reducing poverty through greater integration with the global and regional economy,
investment and social reforms, consolidation of financial stability, and stabilization of the
public debt level. Thus far, the government has put into effect CAFTA-DR, increased tax
revenue, and improved debt management.
3.
Supported by this policy strategy and broadly favorable global conditions, the
Salvadoran economy has strengthened somewhat since the last Article IV consultation.
Output growth has picked up. Inflation has slowed despite the pass-through of a sharp
increase in oil prices. Sovereign spreads have remained among the lowest in Latin America.
The coverage of bank deposits with short-term foreign assets has remained at a comfortable
level (Figures 1–2 and Table 2).
4.
The main policy challenge is to place the economy on a path of faster growth and
social progress. Despite strong reforms, per capita income has stagnated since 2000, while
poverty stands at 35 percent (60 percent in 1992). The growth performance has also been
disappointing partly because the economy has been hit by adverse shocks (external factors,
natural disasters, and the political cycle), and structural weaknesses have limited the growth
potential. Factors behind the weak growth record also include:
•

Low investment. Low investment and productivity growth reflect low national
savings and the constraints on infrastructure and human capital, high crime, and
weaknesses in governance (IMF country report 05/270).

•

Fiscal weaknesses. Fiscal pressures arise from large pension outlays, rising interest
payments, and the need to boost priority spending. Lowering the public debt would
reduce the vulnerability to financing risks, while providing more room to respond to
shocks and help catalyze private investment.

•

Vulnerable external position. With exports concentrated in coffee and textiles, high
dependence on workers’ remittances, a large oil import bill, and low FDI, the high
gross external financing needs (17 percent of GDP) make the economy susceptible to
changes in the terms of trade, foreign competition, migration patterns, and investor
sentiment.

•

Banking system fragilities. While the banking system is among the strongest in the
region, it still has some weaknesses. Its capacity to withstand shocks would be

6
bolstered by efforts to improve prudential and supervision norms, enhance the
financial safety net, and strengthen the lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) function.
5.
The policies needed to remove obstacles to growth will require the support of
Congress. The March 2006 legislative election resulted in a divided congress, as the
governing party ARENA and the left-wing FMLN each won 40 percent of seats. President
Saca has created a blue-ribbon committee to help build consensus on fiscal reforms and is
seeking to broaden the policy dialogue with the FMLN. Passage of proposed constitutional
amendments to reform the political framework and strengthen policy making will need
approval by a qualified majority.1 The next presidential and legislative elections are due in
March 2009.
6.
Over the years, the authorities’ policy thrust has been in line with Fund advice.
Since the last Article IV consultation, the authorities have drawn on Fund advice to reduce
vulnerability by strengthening tax policy, deepening banking reform, and improving
statistics. While the authorities agreed on the need to improve the public debt dynamics, they
have emphasized the importance of boosting investment and social spending, and noted the
challenge of approving difficult reforms in a fragmented congress.
7.
The 2006 consultation discussions focused on how best to achieve the
government’s growth and social objectives, taking advantage of the stability brought by
dollarization and the opportunities offered by CAFTA-DR. A key theme was how to
reinforce the fiscal framework to improve the debt dynamics further while providing room
for priority spending. A second focus was on policies to enhance the resiliency of the
dollarized economy against shocks and to improve competitiveness.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
8.
The economy has benefited from favorable global conditions and has weathered
well the adverse oil price shock and last year’s tropical storm Stan.
•

Growth has picked up moderately while inflation slowed. Output grew by
2¾ percent in 2005, spurred by private consumption. So far in 2006, growth is
running at 3½ percent, led by investment and exports. After a brief increase to
6 percent in October 2005, largely due to temporary food price hikes caused by
tropical storm Stan, year-on-year inflation fell to 3½ percent in May 2006, the lowest
level in the region.

•

The external current account deficit widened slightly during this period, to
4½ percent of GDP. Strong remittances, favorable commodity export prices (mainly
coffee), and a recent surge in nontraditional exports have mostly offset rising oil
imports and higher interest payments (Table 3). El Salvador’s real exchange rate has
remained broadly stable in recent years. However, low FDI, intensified global textile

The amendments would extend the tenure of congress from 3 to 5 years (same as the president) starting with
the 2009 election, and shift from qualified to simple majority the approval by congress of the budget financing.

7
competition, and declining terms of trade suggest that external competitiveness needs
to be strengthened to fully reap the benefits from CAFTA-DR (Box 1).
•

Bank credit growth has supported the economic expansion. Credit to the private
sector grew by 4 percent in real terms in 2005 and picked up to 7 percent in May
2006 (year-on-year). An increase in bank deposits has supported the credit expansion
and led to a build up of short-term foreign assets, while keeping foreign liabilities
broadly unchanged. Domestic interest rates have risen at a slower pace than those
abroad, with the average lending rate at 8¾ percent and the deposit rate at 4 percent
in May 2006 (Figure 3 and Table 4).

•

Access to international capital markets remains solid, supported by high global
liquidity and an investment grade rating. 2 In April 2006, the government reopened
the 30-year sovereign bond issued in 2005, placing US$400 million (over 2 percent of
GDP) with a yield of 7.6 percent (same level as in 2005). Spreads have remained
stable, hovering at around 200 basis points in recent weeks, among the lowest in
Latin America.

9.

The government’s policy strategy has been implemented as planned.

•

The public debt has been stabilized at 42 percent of GDP.3 Fiscal performance has
been consistent with a budgeted fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP for 2006 and a
primary deficit of 0.7 percent (same level as in 2005). The effect of earlier revenue
actions and recent steps to broaden the taxpayer base have boosted tax revenue by
0.5 percent of GDP through June 2006.4 As budgeted, this gain has been offset by
higher energy subsidies, wages, interest payments, and pension outlays.5 The 2006
budget envisages maintaining capital spending at the level attained in 2005 (Figure 4
and Tables 5–6).

•

Debt management has strengthened. The authorities continued to lengthen debt
maturities (17 years on average), diversify financing sources, and lower costs with the
above-mentioned issue of 30-year bonds and greater use of multilateral loans.6 A
relatively low share of floating-rate debt (one-third of total debt) has also helped

2

Moody’s rated El Salvador investment grade in 1997. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch IBCD rate El Salvador one
notch below investment grade, as the country’s sluggish growth, public debt, and poverty levels are considered
important sources of vulnerability.

3

Nonfinancial public sector debt, which excludes the central bank’s net liabilities, stabilized at 40 percent of
GDP.
4

In 2005, the authorities broadened the income and value-added tax bases, raised excise taxes, and reinforced
the tax office. As a result, tax revenue rose by 1 percent of GDP, to 12½ percent in 2005.
5

Subsidies on energy, public transportation, water, and nontraditional exports amounted to 0.8 percent of GDP
in 2005. The budgeted wage increase (6 percent on average) granted for 2006 is the first increase since 1999.
6

The World Bank approved policy loans for US$200 million (1¼ percent of GDP) in 2005 to support the
authorities’ growth strategy. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) also approved a policy loan
(US$100 million) for basic education in 2005.

8
mitigate the impact of higher interest rates. However, sizable gross financing needs
(6 percent of GDP) still make public finances vulnerable to refinancing risks.
•

Banking regulations improved, while banks’ liquidity remained comfortable.
The authorities issued stricter prudential norms and improved bank resolution
practices, although some aspects of the dollarization regime have not been completed
yet due to fiscal constraints (¶21 and ¶23). Banks’ net foreign assets currently cover
30 percent of deposits (above the statutory level of 26 percent), although slightly
below the level observed in other fully and partially dollarized economies in the
region.

•

CAFTA-DR came into effect in March 2006. As prior steps, congress improved the
regulatory framework to enhance competition (mainly in government procurement
and telecommunications) and to strengthen protection of intellectual property rights.
It also passed anti-trust legislation, upgraded customs procedures, and stiffened
penalties for corruption by public officers.
III. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Near-term Outlook

10.
Growth is projected to reach to 3½ percent in 2006. The pick up would continue to
be led by investment and exports. Inflation would stay at 4 percent, reflecting high oil prices,
and the external current account deficit at around 4½ percent of GDP. The economy appears
well positioned to manage the risks from the global external environment (mainly, volatile
oil prices and interest rates), given that the government’s financing needs for 2006 have been
already covered and the strong foreign asset position of the banking system. 7
B. Medium-Term Outlook
11.
Full implementation of the authorities’ policy framework would strengthen the
medium-term outlook, but would nevertheless leave important vulnerabilities.
•

•

7

The policy framework should support
growth of 3½ percent over the medium
term, aided by the favorable impact of
CAFTA-DR and related reforms efforts on
exports and investment. The envisaged
primary surplus would keep the public
debt ratio at current levels until 2008,
followed by a gradual decline thereafter.
(Tables 7 and 8).

(Appendix I). For instance, should the primary balance remain at the same level as in
2005 (a “no policy change” scenario), public debt would rise to 45 percent of GDP
by 2011. Stress tests also show that the debt dynamics is sensitive to an adverse
combined shock to the primary balance, the real interest rate, and economic growth.
•

The economy’s external financing needs would remain high. The economy would
be susceptible to sudden changes in remittances, terms of trade, and investor
sentiment. For instance, a reduction of one standard deviation in remittances would
increase external financing needs by nearly 2 percent of GDP per year.

An alternative scenario with stronger up-front fiscal consolidation and
continued reforms illustrates the benefits of additional policy efforts (Table 9 and 10).
Under this scenario, more front-loaded progress toward the medium-term primary surplus
target of 1 percent of GDP by 2009, together with growth-oriented reforms, would lower the
public debt ratio to under 36 percent by 2011 and help sustain growth rates of at least
4 percent (the authorities’ medium-term objective). A stronger fiscal stance would also
increase national savings to support higher private investment while strengthening the
external position (Box 2). With improved debt management, this effort would also help
contain the economy’s external financing needs.

C. Improving Growth and Social Prospects
Fiscal policy: improving debt dynamics and supporting priority spending
13.
The authorities plan to keep the public debt ratio stable through 2008 and bring
it down thereafter, while raising priority spending. This would involve achieving primary
balance in 2007–08 and a surplus of 1 percent of GDP starting in 2009. Key envisaged fiscal
policies are as follows:
•

Raising tax revenue, limiting subsidies, and containing pension outlays. Given
substantial progress on expenditure reform in the past, the authorities have set a tax
revenue target of 14½ percent of GDP for 2009 (12½ percent in 2005), which they
expect to attain by reducing tax evasion. They also plan to improve the targeting of
subsidies to the poor and are exploring options to reduce/spread out costs of the 1998
pension reform.

•

Improving infrastructure and alleviating poverty. The investment plan focuses on
developing social infrastructure, especially in the northern region (the poorest in the
country), completion of a seaport (Cutuco), and major electricity projects, with a cost
of nearly 2 percent of GDP per year over the next five years (¶25–26).

•

Financing. The bulk of the government’s gross financing needs would be covered
through sovereign bond issues and multilateral borrowing. The investment plan
would be financed mostly with grants (including from the U.S. millennium challenge
account), concessional loans, and public-private partnerships (PPP).

14.
Consistent with these plans, the authorities intend to introduce fiscal measures
in the coming months. With assistance from the Fund, they plan to limit income tax
exemptions on export regimes and energy subsidies, including for transportation, with an
expected annual yield of 1 percent of GDP.8 On this basis, the fiscal deficit is projected at
2¾ percent of GDP for 2006, with a primary deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP (keeping the
public debt/GDP ratio at around 42 percent).
15.
To achieve the target for tax revenue, the authorities also plan to further reduce
tax evasion and bring informal activities into the tax base. Besides the planned reduction
of tax exemptions on export regimes, they will implement tax code reforms approved in 2004
to raise penalties for tax delinquency, use bank records to enforce taxation, and fight
smuggling. These actions are expected to strengthen an action plan initiated last year to
tighten control over larger taxpayers and VAT rebates to exporters, and improve crosschecking of tax payments. The authorities estimate that this strategy would lead to revenue
gains of some 0.5 percent of GDP per year in 2006–09.
16.
The staff recommended a more ambitious approach to lowering public debt,
while protecting priority spending. The staff noted that achieving a primary surplus of
8

Export regimes are subject to abuse and fraud, including by nonexporting firms. Limiting tax exemptions
should have no effect on export performance. The electricity subsidy is to be limited to consumption of up to
100 kilowatts hours (kwh) per month, instead of granting the subsidy regardless of total consumption.

11
0.5 percent of GDP in 2007 would set a strong basis to reach the medium-term primary
surplus target, and improve the debt dynamics starting in 2007. The authorities explained that
the fiscal priorities were still consistent with a primary balance for 2007–08. On the basis of
their reform agenda, they also felt that some factors could have a positive impact on the debt
dynamics in 2007–08, such as faster growth than projected in the staff’s baseline scenario,
which would help achieve a stronger fiscal consolidation.
17.
The staff agreed that the fiscal effort should focus first on reducing subsidies, tax
exemptions, and tax evasion, although it also encouraged the authorities to consider
additional measures. In particular, the staff noted the following options: increasing the VAT
rate (currently at 13 percent, compared to an average of 14 percent in Latin America),
introducing a property tax, and raising gradually excise taxes on petroleum products to levels
elsewhere in the region (as oil market conditions permit). The authorities noted that they
preferred to intensify the fight against tax evasion before considering further tax measures.
They saw a large revenue potential in this area, given that evasion on income tax and VAT is
estimated at 1½ to 2 percent of GDP.
18.
The staff supported actions to contain nonpriority spending and saw additional
room to further reorient spending to foster the authorities’ priorities. The staff
welcomed plans to improve the targeting of energy subsidies in 2006, maintain the wage
bill/GDP stable at the 2006 level, and limit local governments’ borrowing. The staff also
proposed removing subsidies on water (except for the poor) and nontraditional exports
(6 percent of value) this year. In line with the 2004 fiscal ROSC, the staff advised the
authorities to (i) further improve budgeting and control of the local governments, which are
taking up a growing role in implementing priority spending, and (ii) enhance the PPP
framework to ensure proper selection of projects and recording in the fiscal accounts, and to
minimize contingency fiscal costs, as the use of PPP for investment projects increases over
the medium term.
19.
The staff noted that parametric pension reforms could contribute to fiscal
consolidation. 9 The staff suggested addressing the issue of generous pension benefits and
advised against actions that would increase the present value of unfunded pension liabilities
for the government. This could be done through (i) raising the retirement age and
contribution period; (ii) lowering replacement rates; (iii) applying income tax on pension
benefits at upper income levels; and (iv) limiting future pension increases. The authorities
noted that political support for parametric pension reforms would be difficult to achieve.
They saw a need to foster a broad public debate over pension costs and their implications for
taxation, priority spending, and debt dynamics. As noted, the authorities are also looking at
ways to spread out the pension reform costs over time, which they plan to discuss with staff
once these options have been developed.

9

The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system was replaced by a fully-funded system of individual pension accounts in
1998. Net pension costs to the government are projected at 2 percent of GDP per year during 2006–11, mainly
due to generous pension benefits and the shift of contributors to the new system. The SIP provides a fuller
description of the main features of the pension reform.

12

20.
Skillful debt management is vital to reduce vulnerability to financing risks. The
authorities plan further issuance of 30-year sovereign bonds (shifting from bullet to
amortized bonds), develop the domestic bond market, and seek support on softer terms
(grants, concessional loans, and debt swaps) for their social agenda.10 The staff concurred
that this debt strategy, combined with further fiscal consolidation, would significantly lower
the government’s financing needs over the medium term.
Central bank operations: strengthening liquidity buffers
21.
The staff encouraged the implementation of remaining aspects of the
dollarization law (2000), with a view to enhancing financial stability and firming up the
monetary regime. Strengthening the LOLR function and shifting the central bank’s net
liabilities to the government (2½ percent of GDP) would provide added flexibility to deal
with systemic liquidity shocks and remove the central bank’s exposure to liquidity
mismatches.11
•

Strengthening the LOLR function. The authorities agreed to keep the central
bank’s disposable foreign reserves at current levels (2 percent of deposits) and
consider using a small portion of the current liquidity requirement (3 percent of
deposits) to add to the cushion of liquid foreign assets, available for potential
systemic liquidity operations. Such a cushion, together with the remaining liquidity
requirement (23 percent), would protect banks adequately against liquidity shocks.

•

Restructuring the balance sheet. The central bank plans to issue long-term bills to
reduce liquidity mismatches to under 2 percent of GDP and to net out operations with
the public sector to contract its balance sheet gradually, before seeking approval by
congress to shift remaining liabilities to the government. The staff suggested
eliminating liquidity mismatches as much as possible, and noted that the assumption
of these liabilities by the government would permanently remove central bank
liquidity risks and enhance fiscal transparency, without changing the overall fiscal
position.

Financial system: improving risk management, deepening intermediation
22.
The banking system has been strengthened, although there is room for further
improvement. Since 2000, banks’ capital adequacy has improved and the bank resolution
framework has been strengthened. Banks appear well positioned to withstand temporary

10

The World Bank has provided assistance to strengthen debt management and the local bond market. The
authorities are also discussing IDB policy loans for US$300 million (1.7 percent of GDP) for 2007–09 in
support of their social agenda.

11

Disposable foreign reserves of the central bank currently cover one-third of its short-term nonmonetary
liabilities. Conversely, the excess of these liabilities over disposable reserves amounts to 2 percent of GDP.

liquidity shocks. However, the quality of bank
assets may be overstated, while stress tests show
vulnerability to credit risk. The system also faces
pockets of weakness in supervision and limited
reserves in the deposit insurance system.
23.
The staff supported the authorities’
banking reform plans. Along the lines of the
2004 FSSA, the authorities have framed reforms
to address remaining fragilities and consolidate
financial stability. Priorities are as follows:

•

Prudential norms. New norms to tighten
provisioning rules and loan classification aim to strengthen asset quality and lower
credit risk. The rules introduce a generic provision (1 percent of loans) and shift to
provisioning on the basis of net loans (after collateral). They provide banks a grace
period to adjust accounting systems to the new rules and assess related provision
shortfalls. The authorities plan to announce a 5-year schedule in December 2006 to
phase in the new rules.

•

Supervision. The authorities plan to submit a draft bill to congress this year to:
(i) enhance the autonomy of the superintendency of banks, including by providing
legal protection to its staff in discharging tasks; (ii) strengthen consolidated
supervision by reducing equity participation from 50 to 20 percent for consolidation
of accounts into a financial group; and (iii) merge the superintendencies of banks,
securities, and pensions, with the central bank in charge of regulating the financial
system.

•

Financial deepening. With a view to fostering private investment through deeper
intermediation, the authorities intend to secure passage by congress of a framework
for securitization and investment funds this year. Their objective is to broaden the
access of small-and medium-size enterprises to financial services and promote a more
efficient allocation of credit risk among borrowers, intermediaries, and investors.

•

Safety net. The authorities are taking steps to strengthen the financial safety net. New
bank resolution guidelines issued recently clarify the roles of the central bank, the
deposit insurance fund, and the superintendency of banks in resolving failed banks.
To strengthen the reserves of the deposit insurance fund, the authorities will propose
to congress this year to raise the ceiling on the fund’s reserves from 1 to 5 percent of
deposits. The staff recommended raising gradually banks’ deposit insurance premia to
achieve the proposed new ceiling over the medium term.

Competitiveness: Removing Impediments To Investment
24.
The authorities and staff agreed on the need to strengthen external
competitiveness. Given the dollarized regime, the goal is to improve productivity and lower
the cost of doing business to foster investment. Supported by the World Bank and the IDB,
the authorities seek to improve infrastructure, enhance skilled labor, lower red tape, and
reduce crime.

14

25.
The staff supported the envisaged actions to improve the investment climate
(Box 3).
•

Infrastructure and human capital. The plan is to alleviate infrastructure constraints
(electricity, ports, water, and roads) and upgrade human capital. The authorities
agreed on the need to foster private participation in these areas to avoid placing an
undue burden on the public finances and protect other social spending.

•

Red tape and crime. The authorities are taking steps to lower transaction costs and
reduce crime (related costs are estimated at 6 percent of GDP per year by the United
Nations). The staff encouraged the authorities to enhance as well the legal basis for
commercial dispute resolution, corporate insolvency, and creditor rights.

•

Integration. The authorities seek to reach new free-trade agreements (including with
the European Union, Canada, and Colombia) to create additional trade opportunities,
a steping stone toward multilateral trade liberalization. They plan to abolish subsidies
to nontraditional exports by end-2007 and export regimes by end-2009, in line with
WTO obligations. The staff noted that pursuing multilateral trade negotiations would
avoid a multiplication of free-trade agreements that could generate complexity in
trade. The authorities also support the development of a regional code to avoid
excessive tax competition in attracting foreign investment, and are moving to
strengthen cross-border supervision and harmonize regulatory practices to facilitate
financial integration within the region.

Poverty-reduction strategy
26.
Poverty alleviation remains on top of the authorities’ agenda. Consistent with the
social objectives of the MDGs, the authorities aim to reduce poverty to 29 percent and rural
extreme poverty to 15 percent by 2015.12 Based on a poverty map, the authorities are
targeting priority areas to develop social infrastructure. Key programs are as follows:
•

Solidarity network (“Red Solidaria”). The network provides social infrastructure
(education, health, water, electricity, and rural roads) to the poorest municipalities;
and extends cash transfers to families who meet basic education and healthcare
requirements. The program now covers 16 out of 36 targeted municipalities and is
partly financed by multilateral and bilateral agencies.

•

Development of the northern region. The program seeks to integrate the northern
region with the rest of the economy and provide development opportunities (about
one-half of the poor are located in this region). It entails construction of a transnational
highway, feeding roads, and social infrastructure over the period 2007–11. It has an
estimated cost of US$1 billion (over 5 percent of GDP), and is expected to be mostly
financed with grants.

12

Presently, extreme poverty stands at 15 percent (31 percent in 1992). While the MDG for extreme poverty on
urban areas has been met, rural poverty stands at about 20 percent.

15

Statistics
27.
El Salvador’s macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
As recommended by the 2004 data ROSC, the authorities are conducting economic censuses
and surveys to improve source data and the quality of statistics. With STA assistance, they
are improving the national accounts and short-term economic indicators, and plan to
strengthen the quality of private external debt data.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Salvadoran authorities have made further progress in the implementation
of their outward-oriented growth strategy. They should be particularly commended for
their strenuous efforts to secure the entry into force of CAFTA-DR in a timely manner and
for their success in raising tax revenue significantly, which is making it possible to increase
investment and social spending.
29.
Thanks to this strategy and to generally favorable global conditions, growth
started to pick up in 2005 and is expected to strengthen further in 2006. A good
performance of exports, a rise in investment, and strong workers’ remittances helped the
economy weather well the sharp rise in oil prices and the impact of last year’s tropical storm
Stan. The economy appears well positioned to absorb potential shifts in global market
sentiment, given the present full coverage of the government’s financing needs for 2006 and
the strong foreign asset position of the banking system.
30.
Building on these achievements, the fundamental policy challenge is to place the
economy on a path of high sustainable growth and faster social progress, taking
advantage of the opportunities opened up by CAFTA-DR and the stability brought by
dollarization. To meet this challenge, policy priorities include additional fiscal
consolidation, financial sector reform, and measures to enhance competitiveness.
Implementation of these policies will enhance the resiliency of the dollarized economy to
adverse shocks and remove existing obstacles to growth. Staff also notes that current global
conditions and a favorable election calendar provide a good opportunity to move this agenda
forward.
31.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy aims to keep the public debt steady through 2008
and bring it down thereafter, while raising priority spending. The staff supports the
authorities’ medium-term target of a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP (from a deficit of
0.7 percent in 2005). The staff welcome plans to limit tax exemptions to export regimes and
subsidies in 2006, and supports the goal of increasing tax revenue by 2 percentage points
GDP by 2009, which would be achieved through further reduction in tax evasion. The staff
also welcome the authorities’ support to a regional code of conduct to limit tax competition
in attracting investment. With planned increases in investment and social spending, however,
the primary balance would improve only modestly during 2007–08. In turn, the public debt
ratio would stabilize at current levels, leaving the public finances vulnerable to shocks and
slippages in policy implementation.

16

32.
The staff recommends a more ambitious approach to reducing public debt, while
protecting priority spending. In particular, the staff suggests a more up-front fiscal
consolidation. Efforts to reduce tax evasion and subsidies envisaged by the authorities should
be reinforced by further fiscal measures, which could include an increase in the VAT rate,
parametric pension reforms, removal of subsidies on nontraditional exports and water, and
improved control over local government spending. The staff notes the importance of
fostering a broad public debate over the need to strengthen the fiscal policy framework, with
focus on the trade offs among taxation, priority spending, pension costs, and debt dynamics.
It also supports the authorities’ debt management objectives of lengthening maturities and
reducing costs, which combined with the proposed fiscal effort, should help reduce the
vulnerability from large gross financing needs.
33.
The staff supports the planned financial sector reforms to underpin financial
stability and strengthen the system’s capacity to withstand shocks. Envisaged reforms
include tightening provisioning rules, strengthening supervisory capacity, enhancing the
safety net, and deepening financial intermediation. The staff also recommends to strengthen
the lender-of-last-resort function, through the creation of a pool of liquid assets, and to
complete the restructuring of the balance sheet of the central bank. These actions would
provide additional liquidity buffers to absorb system-wide shocks or to minimize the risks of
contagion.
34.
Given the need to strengthen competitiveness over the medium term, the
authorities are appropriately focusing on improving productivity and reducing costs in
the dollarized economy. The staff endorses the authorities’ plans to upgrade infrastructure
and human capital, lower red tape, tackle crime, and create new trade opportunities. To avoid
fiscal pressures and further improve the investment climate, the staff encourages the
authorities to bolster private sector participation in infrastructure projects, and improve
procedures for corporate insolvency, business dispute resolution, and creditor’s rights.
35.
El Salvador’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
staff supports ongoing efforts to improve the quality of national accounts and short-term
economic indicators.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

17

Box 1. External Competitiveness
External competitiveness needs to be strengthened in light of the importance of continued growth of
nontraditional exports, low foreign direct investment, intensified foreign textile competition, and
declining terms of trade.

•

El Salvador’s REER appreciated in
the 1990s and has been stable this decade.
The real appreciation partly reflected the
sharp increase in workers’ remittances.
Since 2000, El Salvador’s external
competitiveness position has evolved in
parallel to that of other countries in the
region.

•

The rise in nontraditional exports in
the last few years mainly reflected favorable
prices, although volumes have also picked
up since 2005.

•

Foreign textile competition from China has intensified since 2000, leading to a decline in maquila
exports. After rapid growth in the 1990s, maquila exports (mostly textile) to the United States have
declined to 2½ percent of GDP in 2005. The 10 Maquila and nontraditional exports

•

The terms of trade have declined steadily by 10 percent since 1998, mostly reflecting weakening
traditional export prices (mainly, coffee and sugar) through 2002 and rising oil prices since that year.

•

Sizable workers’ remittances have
affected external competitiveness. The
related expansion in domestic demand has
raised the relative price of nontradable
relative to tradable goods and put upward
pressure on wages. This trend has
encouraged consumption of tradables and
dampened their production, resulting in a
widening of the trade balance.

Box 2. Savings and Growth
Supported by CAFTA-DR, the authorities seek to bolster new areas of growth and make
investment and exports the leading sources of higher growth. Achieving this goal would
require a substantial increase in national savings.
The authorities foresee comparative advantage and growth potential in the following areas:
(i) Agro-business: there is potential in food processing and pharmaceuticals; (ii) Call centers:
government programs are providing training in English; (iii) Textiles: incoming firms are to
produce higher value-added and promote vertical integration; (iv) Tourism: a new tourism
framework facilitates expansion of convention tourism and spending by returning nationals; and
(v) Regional distribution: the new port (Cutuco) is to provide a logistical and distribution center
for the region.
For years, consumption has been the driving force for growth. Over the last 5 years, growth
has averaged 2¼ percent per year. The contribution of consumption to growth was 3 percentage
points, while the combined contribution of investment and net exports was negative (see
Figure 1). Relative to GDP, consumption reached over 100 percent, supported by strong worker
remittances (16 percent). Domestic investment amounted to only 16½ percent while national
savings averaged 13 percent.
Raising growth would require a substantial increase in national savings and investment,
while maintaining external balance. Assuming a constant incremental capital output ratio
ICOR and stable external debt dynamics, a sensitivity analysis shows the following:

•

Sustaining growth at 3½ percent. Domestic investment would need to rise to 17½ percent
of GDP (from 15½ percent in 2005) while national savings would need to increase to
13½ percent (nearly 11 percent in 2005); and

•

Sustaining growth of at least 4 percent (the authorities’ forecast). Domestic investment
would need to rise to at least 20 percent of GDP while national savings would need to
increase to 16 percent, well above historical levels.

19

Box 3. Reforms to the Investment Climate
While some competitiveness indicators are strong in El Salvador by regional standards,
the authorities’ reforms seek to remove key obstacles to investment and take advantage of
the new opportunities opened up by CAFTA-DR (Figure 6).
What is good about the Salvadorean business climate? El Salvador ranks 56 out of
117 countries, close to Costa Rica and Mexico, in the global competitiveness indicators
prepared by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Strengths include the macroeconomic
environment, public institutions, and competition in information technology. The labor
market is one of the most flexible, especially in hiring/dismissal practices (13) and hiring of
foreign labor (38).
What areas could be improved to foster investment? Main weaknesses are in basic
infrastructure, human capital, and crime.
The implementation of CAFTA-DR has helped improve the business climate. CAFTA-DR
has provided incentives for customs reform, enforcement of important norms (anticorruption, labor, environment, intellectual property rights, and e-commerce), and
competition (telecoms and government procurement). The 2004 anti-trust law has also
strengthened competition practices.
The authorities’ reform agenda to improve the investment climate includes:

•

Easing infrastructure constraints. Priority areas are electricity, highways, and ports.
The authorities will review this year the electricity regulatory framework to improve
pricing rules and allow for long-term contracts for investors. This should help alleviate
supply constraints in power generation, which have become tighter in recent years.

•

Enhancing skilled labor. Education Plan 2021, launched in 2005 and supported by the
IDB, aims to achieve full enrollment in schools up to 9th grade, make students fluent in
English, and broaden 2-year programs for specialized training. The plan is designed to
support investment in technology activities over the next few years.

•

Reducing crime. With World Bank assistance, the authorities are developing special
(preventive and corrective) programs targeting poor municipalities and youths at risk.

•

Lowering transaction costs. Competitiveness programs, including “El Salvador
Eficiente”, seek to reduce red tape and support small firms. So far, these programs have
centralized customs procedures, lowered the time to open new businesses through a
one-stop window, and provided market intelligence for small exporters.

•

New trade opportunities. Following the adoption of CAFTA-DR, the authorities are
seeking free-trade arrangements with Canada and the European Union by 2007 and
with CARICOM, Colombia, and Taiwan, Province of China by 2009. The ultimate
objective is to move toward multilateral trade liberalization.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

FIN completed the off-site safeguards assessment of the central reserve bank
(BCR) in 2002. The BCR’s safeguards were generally adequate, and a stage two
(on-site) assessment was not needed. Based on the recommendations of the
safeguards assessment, the BCR (i) has agreed to publish the audited general
balance sheet, income statement, and the opinion on the financial statements;
(ii) is adopting International Accounting Standards (IAS), with the expectation
that the 2004 financial statements will be fully compliant with IAS; and
(iii) restructured its audit committee in January 2003 to have a majority
representation of independent directors to ensure objectivity on the audit process.

Exchange Arrangement:
Effective January 1, 2001, the dollar became legal tender and circulates freely.
The dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange, with no
limitations. All payments may be made in either dollars or colones. The BCR has

43

APPENDIX II

the obligation to exchange colones in circulation for dollars upon request from
banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar. As a
result, El Salvador has an exchange rate arrangement with no separate legal
tender category.
El Salvador has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

APPENDIX III

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR
RECENT AND PLANNED IBRD ACTIVITIES

A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering the period (FY 05–08) was approved by the
Board in January 2005. The CAS proposed a strategic program of lending and nonlending
services to support the three main pillars of the government’s development plan, “Safe
Country 2004–2009: (i) accelerate broad-based, equitable economic growth and increase
employment; (ii) improve equity through building human capital and expanding access to
socioeconomic infrastructure, assets and markets; and (iii) enhance security and reduce
vulnerability.
The Bank Group’s assistance over the period FY 05–FY 08 include: support for
implementation of the existing loan portfolio; new IBRD lending, including a program of
Development Policy Loans (DPLs) of up to US$400 million (high lending scenario) and
investment operations in selective areas for US$185 million; analytical and advisory work;
technical assistance and capacity development programs; and targeted private sector
assistance provided by IFC and MIGA. The DPLs would provide quick-disbursing budget
support in line with policy performance and would allow the Government to reduce its
external financing costs by partially replacing higher cost bonds issued in the international
capital markets.
The DPLs are intended to contribute to the Government's objectives of reigniting growth,
reinforcing macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability, and increasing the efficiency
and transparency of public sector management. Following the medium term framework laid
out in DPL1 (US$100 million disbursed in September 2005), the design of key prior actions,
triggers and indicators for the subsequent loans will support actions in each of the areas.
While the second DPL focuses mostly on addressing fiscal issues and strengthening the
international trade and business environment, the third DPL will focus on actions to
strengthen the financial system, improve the investment climate, address infrastructure
investment and services, promote innovation and technology and further progress in the
modernization of public financial management.
The Bank’s current lending portfolio in El Salvador includes the first DPL (US$100 million)
and six investment projects (US$424 million), totaling US$524 million, of which
US$114.1 million has been disbursed as of March 30, 2006. The Second Broad-Based
Growth DPL (US$100 million) was approved by the Board in December 2005 and is waiting
for the approval of Salvadorean Assembly prior to signing and disbursement. The Education
Project on Excellence and Innovation in Secondary Education (US$83 million); the Land
Administration and Protected Areas loan (US$40.2 million); the Social Protection and Local
Development loan (US$21 million); and the Environmental Services (US5 million) have
been approved by the Board in 2005 and are scheduled to be signed by September 2006.
During FY 05 the Bank completed four core diagnostic studies for El Salvador: (i) A poverty
assessment (PA) focusing on recent poverty and inequality trends; (ii) a public expenditure
review (PER) focusing on fiscal trends and sustainability, the public expenditure

45

APPENDIX III

management system, and social sector expenditures; (iii) a country financial accountability
assessment (CFAA) that addresses the public expenditure management framework and offers
recommendations for a more efficient use of the public funds; and (iv) a country procurement
assessment (CPAR). This analytic work has underpinned the design of the Development
Policy Loan program.
Finally, in support of accelerating broad-based equitable economic growth, the Bank is
giving technical assistance to develop and implement a debt management strategy. In
July 2005 the Bank completed the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), and in
January 2006 finalized a Recent Economic Developments in Infrastructure Report (REDI),
which focuses on assessing El Salvador’s electricity, telecommunications, transport, and
water and sanitation sectors.

APPENDIX V

El Salvador: Statistical Issues
El Salvador is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination Standards. While
macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, a number of weaknesses remain.
The Central Bank (CB) makes data available to the public through regular official
publications and its website (http://www.bcr.gob.sv/).
VIII. MONEY AND BANKING STATISTICS
Several financial institutions have yet to distinguish transactions using the residency
criterion. With Salvadoran banks actively lending in the region, the lack of reliable
information on transactions by residency status and on foreign branch activity is
complicating interpretation of the monetary and credit aggregates. Following the
adoption of the U.S. dollars as legal tender, the use of the principle of residence acquired
more relevance, since all accounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, there is a
need to improve estimates of M1 by incorporating a reliable measure of dollars
circulating in the economy, and of broad money by including all financial intermediaries
in the financial system.
IX. PUBLIC SECTOR STATISTICS
The principal outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable data on the operations of the
local governments. The ministry of finance conducts a quarterly survey of 50 local
governments, including the largest municipalities. However the reporting of the survey is
not consistent, as some local governments provide information with a lag or do not report
at all.
Real sector and prices statistics
The CB produces both current and constant price (base 1990) annual national accounts
following the 1968 SNA, with a lag of around nine months. Also, it produces quarterly
national accounts, using the production approach and disseminates these data three
months after the end of the reference period. Recognizing the efforts to improve source
data, the 2003 ROSC mission stressed the need for modernizing the statistical system.
The Central Bureau of Statistics and Census conducted during August–November 2005
various surveys to improve data sources on industry, trade and services.
The consumer price index has a sound methodological basis and its coverage is confined
to the San Salvador metropolitan area and the three largest departmental capitals
representing 85 percent of the urban population. The weights were derived from the
National Urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey of 1991/92 and require
updating. The authorities also compile a producer price index (January 1998=100), which

48

APPENDIX V

is confined to the San Salvador metropolitan area and the departments of La Libertad and
Santa Ana and uses weights from the 1992 economic census.
External sector statistics
The compilation of external trade statistics follows the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5), but does not include estimates of informal/illegal
transactions.
There has been a significant improvement in the coverage and timeliness of balance of
payments data in recent years. In particular, the CB has made significant progress in
obtaining information on services, foreign direct investment, private external debt, and
goods for processing, as well as for the international investment position statistics. There
is scope for improving the quality and consistency of the customs declaration, processed
electronically. Also, a few weaknesses remain in the measurement of cross-border capital
flows. El Salvador compiles the data template on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity.
External vulnerability indicators
The central bank compiles information about the external indebtedness of the nonbank
private sector.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
El Salvador
On July, 24, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with El Salvador.1
Background
Since taking office in 2004 the government has pursued an outward-oriented strategy to
boost growth and improve social conditions. The policy agenda focuses on developing
new sources of growth and reducing poverty through further integration with the global
and regional economy, investment and social reforms, and stabilization of the public
debt level. Early achievements of this strategy include an increase in tax revenue,
improved debt management, and the CAFTA-DR.
Since the last Article IV consultation, the economy has strengthened. Growth has picked
up and is running at 3½ percent thus far in 2006 (2 percent per year in 2000–05),
spurred by investment and exports. Despite the full pass-through of higher oil prices,
year-on-year inflation fell to 3½ percent in May 2006, the lowest level in the region.
The external current account deficit widened slightly to 4½ percent of GDP in 2005.
Sovereign spreads have remained among the lowest in the Latin America region.
Fiscal policy has aimed at stabilizing the public debt/GDP ratio and strengthening debt
management. The 2006 budget limits the deficit to 3 percent of GDP, which implies a
primary deficit of some 0.7 percent and will maintain public debt at around 42 percent of
GDP, with the nonfinancial public sector debt at 40 percent. Tax revenue has been
strengthened by tax measures approved in late 2004/early 2005, as well as recent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

efforts to broaden the taxpayer base. As budgeted, this revenue gain is largely offset by
higher energy subsidies, wages, interest, and pension outlays. The increase in capital
spending achieved in 2005 has been maintained in the 2006 budget.
The banking system has been strengthened and appears well positioned to withstand
temporary liquidity shocks. Banks’ capital adequacy has improved and their net foreign
asset position has remained at a comfortable level, covering 30 percent of deposits
(above the statutory level of 26 percent). Meanwhile, stricter prudential norms and
improved bank resolution practices have been issued, although some aspects of the
dollarization regime are yet to be adopted.
To secure the implementation of CAFTA-DR in March 2006, congress approved
legislation to enhance competition (mainly in government procurement and telecoms),
upgrade customs procedures, and protect intellectual property rights. Congress also
passed anti-trust legislation and stiffened penalties for corruption by public officers.
Looking ahead, the authorities plan to strengthen the fiscal stance in 2006 by limiting
income tax exemptions and subsidies; as well as secure passage of banking reforms to
underpin financial stability and deepen intermediation. Over the medium term, the
strategy is to keep the public debt/GDP ratio stable through 2008 and reduce it gradually
thereafter. This would be achieved by increasing the revenue effort through further
reductions in tax evasion and controlling pension costs, while creating space for priority
infrastructure and social spending.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the continued progress made by the Salvadorian
authorities in implementing their outward-oriented growth strategy, which has already
helped bring about strong growth based on a solid export performance, rising
investment, and robust workers’ remittances. Looking ahead, Directors observed that
the main policy challenge for El Salvador is to place the economy on a path of sustained
rapid growth and social progress, that will help the country achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. This will involve continued progress on the fiscal sector, financial
system, and structural reform agendas. Directors urged the authorities to take
advantage of current global conditions and the benefits of the liberalized trade regime
under the recently implemented CAFTA-DR, and noted that a national dialogue will be
important to obtain broad-based consensus on the reforms.
Directors supported the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy based on an increase in
tax revenue, an improved targeting of tax exemptions and subsidies, and planned
increases in investment and social spending. In the near term, however, these policies
imply only a modest improvement in the primary balance and, as a result, the public
debt ratio would remain roughly unchanged in the next few years. In light of this,
Directors encouraged the authorities to build consensus in favor of a more front-loaded
fiscal effort, while protecting priority spending. In this context, they recommended
additional measures, which could include tightening pension parameters, reducing
subsidies, including on nontraditional exports, and improving control over local

-3-

government spending. To complement the authorities’ efforts to reduce tax evasion,
many Directors also encouraged consideration of additional tax measures, such as
raising the VAT rate. Directors welcomed the authorities’ support for a regional code of
conduct to limit tax competition in attracting investment.
Directors commended the authorities for already securing the government’s financing
needs for 2006. They also supported the authorities’ debt management objective of
lengthening maturities and seeking external support on concessional terms.
Directors noted the strong foreign asset position of commercial banks, which limits the
economy’s vulnerability to potential shifts in global market sentiment. They supported
the planned financial system reforms, which will underpin financial stability and
strengthen the system’s resilience to shocks. Directors endorsed the authorities’ focus
on implementing the recently issued stricter prudential norms, enhancing consolidated
supervision, fostering intermediation with the passage of a securitization framework,
and reinforcing the financial safety net. They also supported the authorities’ regional
strategy to enhance financial sector stability. Directors recommended implementing
pending elements of the dollarization law of 2001 by restructuring the balance sheet of
the central bank and strengthening its lender-of-last-resort function to provide an
additional cushion against system-wide shocks and minimize contagion risks.
Directors supported the authorities’ medium-term agenda to strengthen the economy’s
competitiveness through improvements in productivity and cost reductions in the
dollarized economy. They endorsed the authorities’ plans to upgrade basic infrastructure
and human capital, eliminate red tape, tackle crime, and create new trade opportunities.
To limit fiscal pressures and further improve the investment climate, Directors
encouraged the authorities to enhance the framework for private sector participation in
infrastructure projects, and to improve procedures for corporate insolvency, business
dispute resolution, and creditor’s rights.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
El Salvador may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for El Salvador
and Nina Conrado, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 24, 2006

On behalf of the authorities of El Salvador, we would like to thank staff for their valuable
policy advice and for the constructive discussions in the framework of the Article IV
consultation. The authorities broadly agree with the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The economic and social performance of El Salvador during the last decade has been
outstanding, supported by a prudent policy management and a solid forward looking strategy.
The process of consolidating macroeconomic stability has advanced, and major structural
reforms in a broad array of sectors, including pension reform, the adoption of official
dollarization and trade liberalization have taken place, making the country a leading reformer
in the region and in Latin America.
Despite the important progress in macroeconomic stability and in reducing poverty,
challenges in the short and medium-term include the need to promote economic growth, to
make the economy more resilient to shocks, and to mitigate risks associated with natural
disasters. To advance towards these objectives, the government strategy has included the
consolidation of the fiscal stance, efforts to improve the business climate and continue
opening the economy towards globalization.
Macroeconomic performance during 2005 and the first half of 2006 has been strong. GDP
growth has started to accelerate, reaching 3.2 percent during the first quarter of 2006,
consistent with the annual projection of 3.5 percent. The export sector is being more
dynamic, and is expected to continue with this trend, especially as the economic agents seize
the opportunities of the CAFTA-DR, which began its implementation in March, being El
Salvador the first country in the region to do so. Growth has also reflected an increase in
investment, which in a context of acceleration of credit growth, favorable commodity prices
and strong remittances, may reflect positive signs in the economy’s medium-term resilience
towards shocks and better growth perspectives. Additionally, even in the context of high and
volatile international oil prices, the annual inflation rate as of June 2006 was 4.4 percent, one
of the lowest in the region, mainly supported by the dollarization framework.
Fiscal policy has included an integral approach, strengthening revenues, improving the
quality of public expenditures and making efforts to improve debt management. In terms of
tax policy, in 2005 the government undertook probably the most comprehensive reform of
the last decade. Important progress was made in terms of strengthening tax administration
and raising selected excise taxes; however, the authorities are aware that more needs to be
done, and are planning to continue improving tax administration and broadening the taxpayer
base, through limiting tax exemptions and fighting tax evasion. In the area of improving the

2
quality of public expenditures, efforts are being made in maintaining a stable wage bill,
prioritizing public investment projects, expanding the solidarity network and rationalizing
subsidies to better target the poor. In this last area, for example, a subsidy given to the
transport sector was eliminated in June.
The stabilization of public debt is a high priority in the government’s agenda and has become
an issue of discussion at the national level. The authorities are aware of the importance of
further reducing the deficit to improve debt dynamics, especially considering the mediumterm challenge of financing the pension reform. They are making efforts to reconcile this
objective with the need to increase public expenditure to continue reducing poverty, to reach
the MDG’s and improve infrastructure to support long term growth. The authorities agree
with the staff’s recommendation for a stronger up front fiscal consolidation and the need to
increase national saving, nevertheless, they think that a similar debt reduction path could be
obtained through the promotion of economic growth and a 2 percent of GDP increase in
revenues through the reduction in tax evasion.
El Salvador’s debt management strategy has included the lengthening of debt maturity, the
diversification of the investor’s base, and contracting debt at fixed interest rates during the
period of lowest rates in the USA. As part of these efforts, the country has continued to
successfully issue long term bonds, benefiting from its access to international capital markets
and investment grade rating. As of July 2006 the government has completed the year’s
financing needs, with the placement of Eurobonds. In April the government raised US$400
millions through a bond due in 2035, with the lowest yield since the bonds were first issued,
and in July it raised an additional US$ 225 millions at a slightly higher spread, in a context
of market volatility and expectations of further increases in international interest rates.
With regard to the financial sector, important efforts have been made in consolidating the
prudential and supervisory framework. Further steps are planned. The government is drafting
proposal bills aimed at enhancing the autonomy of superitendency of banks, strengthening
consolidated supervision, merging supervisory agencies and fostering financial deepening. It
is important to mention that some of these efforts are being discussed with neighboring
countries, as part of a regional strategy intended at strengthening cross border supervision
and harmonizing regulatory practices. Additionally, the authorities are planning to press
forward with measures to protect banks against liquidity shocks and to advance in the
complete implementation of the Monetary Integration Law, including the needed
restructuring of the central bank’s balance sheet and improving the function of the lender of
last resort. For this last point, the authorities have solicited technical assistance to the IMF.
The authorities agree with staff on the importance of improving competitiveness, and to
obtain this goal, an integral strategy is being carried out. In terms of commercial strategy, the
main policy is to improve access to the world’s most important markets, for which the
government plans to continue with its integration efforts, and is now in negotiation of other

3
free trade agreements. Additionally, the government is conscious of the importance of
investment in physical and in human capital. In terms of public investment, as part of the
prioritization efforts, the government has prepared an important project geared to the
development of the northern region of the country, and is actively seeking financing from the
Millennium Challenge Corporation. In relation to human capital, for example, this year the
government launched for the period 2006-009 a program called “Triennium of
Alphabetization”, aimed at doubling the goal of reducing analphabetism. The authorities are
also making progress in improving other aspects of the business climate, for example, the
government launched the program “El Salvador Eficiente”, as an alliance between the
government and the private sector to streamline procedures, it also launched a new web page
containing a Guide of Public Services, and is making important efforts to increase security.
The authorities welcomed the analyzes included as Selected Issues, which covered important
benchmarks in terms of structural reforms in El Salvador, and are thankful to the IMF´s Staff
for their hard work and accurate advice.
