EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Indonesia’s sustained economic growth during the decades before the Asian crisis lifted
millions out of poverty. The crisis had more severe ramifications in Indonesia than in other
countries in the region. The previous government (2001-2004) restored macroeconomic and
financial stability and also initiated structural reforms needed to boost investment and
growth. While tackling the challenges posed by the tsunami disaster, the new government led
by President Yudhoyono, which took office in October 2004, has continued and deepened
these policies, notably by maintaining a restrained budget stance, replacing managements in
state banks in a bid to improve governance, and taking steps to enhance the investment
environment. The economic strategy has produced positive results over time; economic
growth has gained momentum year by year, inflation has been substantially reduced
(although underlying inflation has edged up during the last year), and the external position
has remained sound. In spite of these achievements, considering Indonesia’s widespread
poverty and unemployment, the key policy challenge is to further deepen the reforms in order
to place the economy on an even higher growth path. Moreover, financial markets have
experienced pressures in early 2005, underscoring the need to protect the stabilization gains.
Key Issues and Staff Recommendations
The staff report fully supports the new government’s economic strategy for 2005–09, which
has the potential to realize Indonesia’s growth potential and gradually reduce vulnerabilities.
With determined implementation of this strategy, Indonesia could see real GDP growth
increase to 7 percent per annum over the medium term. At the same time, uncertainties in the
international environment pose risks to this economic outlook, putting a premium on sound
economic policies. Concerning specific policy areas, the report:
•

Welcomes the new government’s focus on fiscal prudence and reduction in the debt
burden, and advises that the government move ahead on fiscal-structural reforms and
re-prioritize spending to improve the quality of fiscal policy.

•

Supports Bank Indonesia’s plans to move to formal inflation targeting and its focus
on putting inflation on a downward path through further interest rates increases as
necessary, while maintaining the flexible exchange rate system. In this context, the
report notes the importance of strong credibility in monetary policy.

•

Advises further improvements in banking sector performance, especially state banks,
and in financial sector supervision and governance. The report also notes the
importance of establishing the financial sector safety net.

•

Notes the plans to enhance the investment climate through improvements in the
judiciary, infrastructure, governance and sectoral regulations, while stressing that
sustained efforts will be needed to address deep-seated issues in these areas.

2.
In a regional perspective, the
Asian crisis had relatively severe ramifications for Indonesia, and in the subsequent
years the country has benefited less than others from the buoyant growth in the region.
The shock of the crisis was larger in Indonesia in part because the corporate and banking
sectors had built up large foreign exchange exposures before the crisis, and were relatively
more vulnerable to the exchange rate correction that followed. The subsequent recovery was
slower than in other countries in the region, and also differed in that investment and export
growth played a lesser role;

appear to have suffered from the lack of investment, with Indonesia’s exports—including
exports to China—falling behind that of its peers (text charts). This was evident not only in
manufacturing but also in the petroleum sector, where production has been on a steady
decline, Indonesia’s considerable petroleum resources notwithstanding. The relatively weak
export performance also led to a slower build-up of official international reserves in
Indonesia than among its peers (text chart).

The previous government―in power from July 2001 to October 2004—restored
macroeconomic and financial stability and also initiated structural reforms needed to
boost investment and growth.1 Macroeconomic stability was aided by a reduction in the
fiscal deficit, from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2004 (Tables 1
and 2). Fiscal consolidation helped to bolster confidence and lower interest rates, laying a
basis for the economic recovery. These developments combined to reduce public debt from
76 percent of GDP at end-2001 to 54 percent of GDP at end-2004. Meanwhile, important
strides were made to stabilize and re-privatize intervened banks and strengthen bank
profitability. Also, reform legislation was adopted in a number of structural policy areas.
Against this background, Bank Indonesia was able to reduce interest rates gradually. These
considerable achievements notwithstanding, the previous government left important reforms
to be completed, notably with regard to the banking sector and the investment environment.
4.
The new government led by President Yudhoyono took office in October 2004
with a strong emphasis on reducing unemployment and poverty. Indonesia's first direct
presidential elections were held in 2004, giving the new government a solid mandate to carry
1

During 2000–03, Indonesia’s economic program was supported by the Fund under an EFF
arrangement. See the staff report (IMF Country Report, 04/188)) and Selected Economic
Issues paper (IMF Country Report, 04/189) for the 2004 Article IV consultation for a
retrospective on Indonesia’s achievements under the Fund-supported program. The staff
report for the second PPM discussions (IMF Country Report, 05/108) provides a detailed
discussion of developments in 2004.

-7-

forward the necessary economic reforms. Upon assuming office, the government drew up a
medium-term program designed to sustain and deepen the economic policy reforms carried
out by its predecessor. The program, which was adopted in January, seeks to spur sustainable
economic growth through a continuation of fiscal consolidation aimed at lowering the debt
burden, a monetary policy geared toward low and stable inflation, and a strengthening of the
financial sector, combined with an intensified drive to improve the investment climate by
rebuilding infrastructure, bolstering the legal framework, and enhancing governance. Besides
deepening economic reforms, the new government has faced the formidable challenge of
managing emergency assistance and reconstruction in the aftermath of the earthquake and
tsunami disasters in late 2004 and early 2005. In that regard, the government rapidly
formulated a blueprint for reconstruction in the affected regions, although implementation
has subsequently faced bottlenecks.2 In spite of these challenges, eight months into its term,
the new government has carried the economic agenda forward. In particular, it has:
•

Continued conservative budget management. On March 1 this year, the
government implemented a politically difficult increase in administered fuel prices, of
almost 30 percent on average, to reduce the budgetary burden of poorly targeted fuel
subsidies. Preliminary data for the first four months of 2005 show a better fiscal
performance than expected caused by strong revenues and a marked slowdown in
spending. On the revenue side, VAT and income tax receipts received a boost from
domestic demand. The low expenditures mainly reflected postponement of capital
spending owing to implementation problems and delays caused by new disbursement
guidelines.3

•

Replaced management in state bank Mandiri in a bid to improve governance.
The management of Indonesia’s largest bank, state-owned Bank Mandiri, was
replaced in May, amidst a corruption inquiry, and three top officers were detained.
There were management changes also in the second and third largest state banks.

•

Taken steps to enhance the investment environment. The government’s
Infrastructure Summit in January attracted considerable investor interest, and the
government is reforming the regulatory framework in the relevant sectors. Also, the
government has published a new petroleum sector strategy designed to revitalize the
sector. A new investment law aimed at reducing substantially the number of days
needed to start a business is being prepared. Finally, various government agencies are
investigating cases of irregularities and corruption, in state banks as well as in stateowned enterprises.

Box 1 provides an overview of the economic implications of the natural disasters, including
the financial support and rebuilding efforts.

New budget implementation documents allocating appropriations to spending units are now
part of the central government budget process. The spending delays occurred as the Ministry
of Finance awaited clarification of authority before signing appropriations.

-8Box 1. Macroeconomic Effects of the Natural Disasters
The December 26, 2004 earthquake and tsunamis—and the earthquake that hit in March 2005—inflicted
a huge toll on Indonesia in terms of loss of life and damage to infrastructure and homes in the province
of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (Aceh). However, the macroeconomic impact has been modest. This
reflects the fact that Aceh accounts for only 2 percent of national GDP, and that the oil and gas sector,
accounting for almost half of the region’s GDP, remains intact. Moreover, the negative supply side
impact, in terms of reduced agricultural production in the region, is expected to be largely offset by
reconstruction spending.
The Ministry of Development Planning has developed a blueprint for the reconstruction of Aceh based
on a sector-by-sector study done for the Consultative Group meeting in January. This study puts the total
cost of reconstruction at US$4.5 billion. These estimates may be further adjusted once the actual
reconstruction begins.
The financing needs arising from the reconstruction will be met largely through international financial
assistance. At the Consultative Group meeting, donors pledged nearly US$4 billion to finance
reconstruction over the period 2005–09. Of this total, US$1.7 billion was pledged for 2005, with
US$1 billion expected to be on-budget and the remainder disbursed directly or through NGOs. One third
of the budget support in 2005 is expected to be in the form of grants and the rest in concessional loans.
In addition, the Indonesian authorities have accepted the Paris Club offer of a moratorium on debt
service due in 2005. They

The institutional framework for managing the reconstruction process is being set up. A special treasury
field office, responsible for making disbursements and recording expenditures, has been created. A
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency was established in May to coordinate, supervise and prevent
duplication and inefficiency in the rehabilitation and reconstruction process. The Agency is expected to
start using private donor aid immediately (including US$600 million from the International Red
Cross/Red Crescent Society). A multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) has also been established so as to
maximize transparency, efficiency, and accountability. Four project concepts of about US$250 million,
including housing for about 1,000 villages, have so far been approved by the MDTF; the start of
disbursements is expected in July. In the meantime, some donor spending has been done directly by
donors and has not been recorded. Aid organizations based in the United States have reported a spending
rate of about 17 percent of private funds raised for all tsunami-affected countries.
With Aceh reconstruction spending largely financed by donor flows, the government should be able to
maintain the budget deficit at about 1 percent of GDP. Donor flows will also help ease the pressure on
the balance of payments, by providing financing for reconstruction-related imports. Moreover, with the
additional financing for Aceh amounting to some 1–1½ percent of GDP over five years and with
creditors offering to provide this financing on highly concessional terms, the associated debt service is
not expected to put pressure on the balance of payments nor threaten medium-term debt sustainability.

5.
The economic strategy pursued by the previous government, and now being
built on and deepened by the current government, has produced positive results. In
developing this strategy the authorities have remained engaged in a close policy dialogue
with the Fund, initially in the context of the EFF arrangement and subsequently in the context
of Article IV consultation and Post-Program Monitoring discussions (see text table).4
Economic developments have overall been favorable:
•

Economic growth has gained momentum year by year, increasing from
3.8 percent in 2001 to 5.1 percent in 2004 (Figure 2). After several sluggish years,
investment grew by as much as 15¾ percent in 2004, up sharply from previous years.
In the meantime, private consumption has been buoyant. Growth strengthened further
in the first quarter of 2005, when real GDP increased by almost 6½ percent (y/y).

•

Inflation has been substantially reduced over the last several years, although
underlying inflation has edged up during the last year. Inflation declined from
12.5 percent (y/y) at end-2001 to 6.4 percent at end-2004. Underlying inflation has
been on an upward trend since mid-2004 reflecting robust domestic demand, ample
liquidity and, in early 2005, a weaker exchange rate. Headline inflation peaked at
8.8 percent (y/y) in March, in the wake of the increase in administered fuel prices,
and has since declined, reaching 7.4 percent in May.

•

On the external front, the current account surplus has been on a downward
trend in relation to GDP (Table 3). A decline in both oil and non-oil export volumes
has been offset by higher commodity and oil prices, and export values have been
increasing steadily. Increasing demand for imports of capital goods and raw
materials, as the economy has been picking up, as well as a rising oil import bill, have
nevertheless led to a decline in the trade surplus. Meanwhile, the services account has
deteriorated, reflecting higher transport charges associated with strong imports and
lower tourism receipts. All told, the current account surplus fell from 4¼ percent of
GDP in 2001 to 1¼ percent of GDP in 2004. The net outflows on the capital account
(including errors and omissions) have been more moderate, allowing a build-up of
international reserves. Indeed, until early 2005, the international reserves position
gradually strengthened, with reserves reaching US$36 billion (4.8 months of imports,
or 195.7 percent of short-term external debt) at end-2004.

The Authorities’ Response to Recent Fund Policy Advice
Advice in the Context of 2004 Article IV
Consultation and PPM Discussions
I. Fiscal and monetary policy

Actions Taken in 2004–05

Maintain fiscal restraint to reduce the debt burden.

Fiscal deficit reduced from 1.9 percent of GDP in
2003 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2004. As a result,
public debt fell from 59 percent of GDP in 2003 to
54 percent of GDP in 2004. Further deficit reduction
planned for 2005 and 2006.

Address identified weaknesses in non-oil tax revenue
collections.

Taxpayer registration and arrears collection improved,
although few new tax compliance initiatives were
undertaken.

Ensure that any revisions to the decentralization
framework do not weaken the government's fiscal
position.

While revisions to decentralization laws have been
adopted, key regulations relating to the subnational
borrowing framework have yet to be drafted.

Continue to prepare for formal inflation targeting.

Preparations ongoing; BI to adopt interest rate
targeting from mid-2005.

II. Banking and structural reforms
Pursue medium-term privatization plan for state
banks.

Little progress made.

Further strengthen state banks’ management and
operations.

Business plans have been put in place. New
management has been appointed at state bank
Mandiri.

Take early and decisive action to resolve investor
disputes to help bolster investor confidence.

Efforts being made, although progress slower than
expected.

Improve governance in the public sector.

Three top managers at the largest state bank replaced
following corruption charges; other corruption cases
being investigated.

Allow temporary trade restrictions to expire as
scheduled, and refrain from implementing new
restrictive measures.

No new restrictive trade measures implemented; the
temporary trade restrictions imposed on imports of
rice and sugar have been renewed.

Ensure flexible labor market.

Limited progress made.

•

External competitiveness nevertheless appears adequate. Following some
appreciation through mid-2003, the real effective exchange rate has since depreciated,
easing emerging concerns about external competitiveness. While the evidence is

- 11 -

mixed, on balance, the staff’s assessment is that the current level of the exchange rate
does not pose a threat to Indonesia's external competitiveness.5
6.
Against this generally favorable background, financial markets have all the
same experienced some pressures in early 2005. After the initial market rally in the wake
of the elections last year, market sentiment may have adjusted to the reality that dealing with
the deep-seated impediments to growth in the Indonesian economy inevitably will take time.
In early April, government bond markets came under pressure, owing to a sell-off by mutual
funds, as redemptions from fixed-income funds picked up on the back of interest rate
increases. Bank Indonesia responded by purchasing bonds, and the markets have since been
relatively stable. Moreover, the strong imports, a softer international sentiment toward
emerging markets, and accommodating monetary conditions have recently put pressure on
the exchange rate (Table 4 and Figure 3). In response, Bank Indonesia has increased interest
rates gradually, introduced higher frequency open market operations, undertaken substantial
foreign exchange market interventions, tightened the net foreign exchange open position
regulation for banks, and placed limitations on foreign exchange swaps. These measures have
helped stabilize the exchange rate since mid-May, although pressures remain evident.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
7.
The authorities and the staff agreed that, despite the achievements of the last
several years, the central policy challenge facing Indonesia remains to deepen the
reforms in order to place the economy on an even higher growth path. While poverty
indicators have improved since the immediate period following the crisis (text table),

Box 2. External Competitiveness
Indicators of Indonesia’s external competitiveness
paint a mixed picture. Real exchange rate measures
(e.g., based on relative CPI or Unit Labor Costs)
suggest that Indonesia’s competitive position has
improved gradually since mid-2003. This is largely
due to nominal depreciation against the U.S. dollar.
Econometric estimates of the equilibrium real
exchange rate suggest there is some room for
appreciation before the currency becomes overvalued. Other macroeconomic indicators, such as the
current account (still in surplus, albeit declining),
stock of external debt (steady in nominal terms, but
falling as a share of GDP), private capital inflows,
and country risk premia have all exhibited favorable
dynamics, providing little evidence of any
fundamental misalignment of the exchange rate.

Trade performance measures provide a less
optimistic picture, showing a modest deterioration in
the share of Indonesia’s exports in its largest markets
and for the world market as a whole. Indonesia’s
share of its top 15 export markets (accounting for
over 80 percent of exports) has declined since 2000,
at a time when other countries in the region have
expanded their trade shares considerably.
Indonesia’s share of world exports has also fallen in
7 out of 10 SITC export categories since 2000, as
well as for total world exports, suggesting a loss of
competitiveness across a wide range of exports.
The deteriorating export performance reflects a
number of factors, including inadequate investment
and a heavy reliance on primary exports, particularly
due to higher oil prices. FDI, which in the past
tended to generate exports of manufactured goods,
has fallen by almost half in the post-crisis period.
The increased attractiveness of other investment
destinations, with lower wage costs and less policy
uncertainty, may have further contributed to
Indonesia’s loss of FDI and hence export
competitiveness.

To meet this challenge, the

9.9
new government has adopted a
medium-term economic strategy
aimed at achieving higher growth
on a sustained basis. The mission endorsed the government’s emphasis on continued fiscal
and monetary prudence and further strengthening of the financial sector, combined with an
intensified drive to make Indonesia’s investment climate more attractive. Indeed, the staff
considered that this strategy has the potential to bring Indonesia to a sustained higher growth
path and further reduce vulnerabilities. The government is preparing annual work plans under
the medium-term program, setting out more detailed policy plans for each year. Against this
background, the discussions focused on the economic outlook and on the concrete policy
issues facing the government as it implements its overall economic program, specifically:

•

The medium-term budget strategy and the supporting fiscal-structural reforms,
including the budget targets and actions planned for 2005 and 2006;

•

The planned transition to a formal inflation targeting framework for monetary policy
and, as an immediate issue, the monetary policy stance consistent with putting
inflation on a downward path;

•

The priority reforms in the banking sector, aimed to address remaining
vulnerabilities;

•

The specific plans of the government to enhance the investment environment.
A. Economic Outlook: Growth Prospects and Vulnerabilities

9.
The government’s economic strategy for 2005–09 is well designed to realize
Indonesia’s growth potential and gradually reduce vulnerabilities. Indeed, determined
implementation of this strategy would lay the basis for higher sustained growth, which in
turn would allow important progress toward reducing unemployment and poverty. Under this
“strong–policy scenario” planned by the new government, there is good likelihood that:
•

Real GDP growth would increase further to 6 percent in 2005 and 6–7 percent per
annum over the medium term, as productivity growth increases towards pre-crisis
levels and investment picks up in response to economic reforms (Table 5).
Specifically, investment is projected to increase to some 26 percent of GDP over the
medium term, boosted by new infrastructure investment as well as a favorable
response of private investment more generally to the improved investment climate.

- 14 -

•

The planned structural reforms are expected to contribute to growth also by
improving the quality of institutions and governance and by increasing productivity.6

•

Inflation would be contained to 8 percent (end-period) or less in 2005, somewhat
higher than earlier expected, reflecting the pass-through from the fuel price increase
and the recent exchange rate depreciation. Inflation would resume its downward
trend, reaching some 6 percent in 2006 followed by a further decline toward 3 percent
over the medium term, in line with trading partners. Restrained monetary policy in
the context of a formal inflation targeting framework will play the central role in
anchoring expectations and achieving low and stable inflation.

•

A gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit would reduce public debt to some 30 percent
of GDP by 2010 which, together with a strengthening of tax and expenditure
management, would significantly reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.

•

On the balance of payments side, the current account would move into deficit as
strong domestic demand leads to higher imports. Meanwhile, higher capital inflows
reflecting improvements in the investment climate could more than cover the current
account deficits, allowing some increase in international reserves. External
competitiveness is maintained through a steady growth in productivity brought about
by structural reforms and investment in new productive capacity.

10.
Uncertainties in the international environment pose risks to this economic
outlook, putting a premium on sound economic policies. The possibility of a growth
slowdown in Asia as well as globally, rising international interest rates, and increased
competition within Asia all underscore the need for robust economic policies. The staff has
developed two alternative scenarios: one with lower growth among Indonesia’s trading
partners combined with higher international interest rates; and one with lower productivity
growth (exemplifying a situation of delays in improving the investment climate) and smaller
government primary surpluses (Annex V). In both cases, growth would be below the strongpolicy scenario based on the government’s medium-term strategy, and unemployment would
remain high (Figure 4). Moreover, with public debt levels being higher and international
reserves lower, the economy would be more vulnerable to shocks.7

6

The growth projections are based on staff analysis of growth determinants in Indonesia; see
Box 3 and Chapter II of the Selected Issues paper.

7

Changes in international oil prices could also affect the medium-term outlook: (i) the
growth effects would be modest, as the impulse through petroleum exports would be partly
offset by changes in global economic growth; (ii) the impact on inflation would depend on
the pass-through to domestic prices; staff analysis suggests that inflation would increase by
0.5 percentage points for each 10 percent increase in domestic fuel prices; (iii) on the
budgetary side, higher international petroleum prices would result in a higher deficit in the
(continued)

- 15 -

11.
The staff’s analysis of debt sustainability underscores that strong policies will be
needed to continue the move toward a more robust economy.8 The staff’s updated debt
sustainability analysis suggests that fluctuations in interest and exchange rates would have a
substantial effect on debt ratios. Specifically, the standard shocks to the real interest rate and
the exchange rate would increase projected public debt in 2010 by 19 percent of GDP and
14 percent of GDP, respectively. External debt sustainability is most susceptible to the
exchange rate shock, which would increase projected external debt in 2010 by 12 percent of
GDP. The authorities acknowledged these risks, noting that their economic strategy is in fact
designed to reduce vulnerabilities over time. By the same token they believed that there were
upsides to the outlook, including the possibility of even higher economic growth over the
medium term.
B. Maintaining Macroeconomic and Financial Stability
Budget policies: fiscal prudence and improved quality of policies
Overall targets: reducing the public debt burden and limiting crowding out
12.
The government’s plan emphasizes further fiscal consolidation and debt
reduction over the medium term. Recognizing that the current high level of public debt is a
source of vulnerability and may have adverse effects on longer-term economic growth, the
government’s medium-term program envisages a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over
time, to a little more than 30 percent by 2009.9 In the staff’s analysis, achieving such a debt
target would require central government primary surpluses in the order of 1½–2 percent of
GDP annually over the medium term. Given the likely decline in oil revenues and pressing
spending needs in social sectors and infrastructure, maintaining primary surpluses in this
range would in turn require increases in non-oil revenue and improvements in the efficiency
of public expenditure. Within this overall framework, the government aims to further reduce
the fiscal deficit to about 1 percent of GDP in 200510 and below 1 percent of GDP in 2006.
short term, assuming no change in fuel subsidy policy, but could substantially improve the
fiscal position in the medium term; and (iv) a one-dollar increase in international oil prices
would increase the current account balance modestly (by US$200 million, or 0.1 percent of
GDP, in 2006).
8

Table 6 provides summary vulnerability indicators.

9

The staff’s research suggests that an appropriate public debt level for Indonesia may be in
the range of 35–42 percent of GDP. Box 4 and Chapter III of the Selected Economic Issues
paper explore the appropriate public debt level for Indonesia in light of the implications for
vulnerability and growth.
10

This would correspond to a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in the government’s
classification, which treats interest deferred by the Paris Club on a cash basis.

- 16 -

Box 3. Indonesia’s Growth Experience
Indonesia’s weaker growth performance since the economic crisis has been associated with a slower
growth in productivity and potential output. Indeed, the recent improvement in growth performance has
been led by robust domestic demand, primarily private consumption, and with private investment
demand making a significant contribution since 2004. The most recent data for 2005Q1 suggest that
investment and consumption demand continue to be strong, with real GDP growth accelerating further to
almost 6½ percent (y/y).
For growth to increase to the 7 percent range on a sustained basis, as envisaged under the medium-term
scenario, would however require

under the staff’s baseline macroeconomic

the economy would grow in the range of 7–7½ percent annually over the medium term.
Growth would be further enhanced through
improvements in the quality of institutions. A crosscountry analysis of growth over the period 19612000 indicates that relative growth performance
across a large sample of countries is positively
correlated with the quality of institutions.
“Institutional quality” is measured by the
International Country Risk Guide Index, which is
based on 22 risk components, including
enforcement of property rights, quality of economic
management, and extent of corruption. Moreover,
once institutional quality is included, most other
variables lose some explanatory power, suggesting
a dominant role for institutions in explaining cross
country variations in growth performance.
Together, these results support the government’s
emphasis on improving the investment climate to
boost productivity, combined with a strong reform
agenda aimed at improving the quality of
institutions, including by addressing corruption.

Box 4. Public Debt Target for Indonesia
A central question for Indonesia is how to define an appropriate medium-term debt
target. While Indonesia’s public debt

has declined since its peak in 2000, it
100
remains relatively high. In an attempt

to answer the question of what would

be an appropriate debt target, three
methods were used to evaluate what
60
would constitute a sustainable debt
level and one that would not
40
substantially undermine medium-term
growth. The analysis indicates that a
20
debt level in the range of 35–
42 percent of GDP would be an
0
appropriate goal. This range was
1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004
derived by assessing the public debt
level from three angles:

•

Vulnerability to financial crisis: Looking at a sample of fourteen emerging market
countries for the past twenty years and using the early warning signals approach, the
analysis indicates that Indonesia’s debt/GDP threshold for being “safe” from a
currency crisis is about 42 percent of GDP. This is close to thresholds found for some
of its Asian neighbors but lower than in some other emerging market countries.

•

Debt overhang: The theoretical rationale implies that a higher debt ratio would lead to
higher future tax burden and lower investor expectations for net returns, which in turn
would lead to lower investment and growth. A panel regression of growth on the debtto-GDP ratio after controlling for other factors affecting growth suggest that an
increase in the debt ratio above 38 percent of GDP would lead to a lower growth rate.

•

Stochastic debt sustainability: This approach assumes that public debt is sustainable
if the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain constant or decline in the medium term,
assuming a certain path of key variables such as primary surplus, growth, exchange
rate, and interest rates. The results indicate that Indonesia’s debt would have to be
35 percent of GDP or less in the medium term in the baseline scenario in order to keep
debt at or below 2005 levels under standard sensitivity shocks.

While it is not possible to be precise about the appropriate public debt level, and drawbacks
exist for each method utilized, not the least of which is the short time series available for the
evolution of public debt in Indonesia, the analysis summarized above suggests that
Indonesia’s current public debt ratio is on the high side. The government’s medium-term
target of bringing the public debt ratio toward 30 percent of GDP would bring the debt ratio to
a “safe” level.

- 18 At the time of the mission, the government was in the process of further revising the 2005
budget, and was just getting underway with the 2006 budget preparations with a view to
presenting the budget to Parliament in August. The mission supported the government’s 2005
and 2006 deficit targets, which would entail a decline in the public debt ratio by some
10 percent of GDP over the two years.
13.
Additional measures may be needed to achieve the 2005 budget targets. The
mission noted the desirability of reflecting appropriately recent developments in inflation, the
exchange rate, interest rates, and oil prices, as well as savings from the Paris Club
moratorium. Its analysis indicated that, on the basis of updated assumptions, including higher
interest rates, higher oil prices, more depreciated exchange rates and lower oil production,
additional measures of up to ½ percent of GDP might be required to ensure that the 2005
deficit target is achieved.11 The government representatives, while mindful of the need for
further measures, stressed that the strong budget performance so far this year had provided
some breathing space, albeit partly of a temporary nature. Also, limited absorptive capacity
might reduce reconstruction spending for tsunami-ravaged regions. Nevertheless, the
government is committed to meeting its deficit target through additional measures if need be,
as shown by its recent announcement to raise the retail prices for tobacco, in effect increasing
ad valorem tobacco excise yields.
14.
Looking to 2006, the mission encouraged the government to further enhance
non-oil tax revenue and rationalize low-priority spending. This would be especially
important given the expected decline in oil revenues (as a percent of GDP) and the planned
wage increases. In particular, the mission recommended that the government consider
carefully the revenue implications of the tax policy package that was under preparation (see
next paragraph). The mission also welcomed the government’s general intention to continue
lowering the poorly targeted fuel subsidies and to channel some of the savings toward social
programs, and to better target non-oil subsidies. An acceleration of the privatization program
would also help ease the pressure on government borrowing, while improving efficiency.
Structural fiscal reforms: strengthening the underpinnings of fiscal policy 12
15.
The government has for some time been preparing a tax policy package aimed at
improving revenue collections while providing incentives for private investment. Key
measures envisaged in the draft legislation are a reduction in the standard corporate income

11

Possible measures discussed by the mission included (i) tax arrears collection from the
state-owned oil company, (ii) further increases in excise rates, (iii) revitalization of the shortterm tax administration revenue generation program, (iv) increases in non tax revenues, and
(v) reductions in non-priority spending.

12

See Box 5 for a summary overview of recent reforms in the fiscal-structural area and of
priority reforms for the future.

- 19 Box 5. Fiscal Structural Reforms
Key fiscal structural reforms have been implemented in the last several years, although important
issues still need to be addressed:
Revenue. Progress has been made in modernizing tax administration and implementing short-term tax
administration revenue generation measures (registering additional tax payers; ensuring timely filing of
tax returns; recovering tax arrears; and expanding audit coverage). The tax system, however, remains
marred by low non-oil revenue collection caused by large VAT exemptions, low excise tax levels, as
well as poor enforcement and widespread corruption.
Expenditure. Good progress has been made on improving the institutional, legal, and regulatory
environment for budget management by restructuring the Ministry of Finance and adopting new laws on
state finances, treasury and audit. However, even after the March 2005 increase in domestic fuel prices,
large untargeted fuel subsidies continue to crowd out higher-priority spending, including on social
programs. Meanwhile, the proliferation of extra budgetary funds, weak cash and debt management, and
shortcomings in the decentralization framework continue to hamper fiscal management.
High-priority reforms for the medium term could include:
Revenue
Income Tax: Unifying the CIT rate to a single 30 percent rate to be gradually reduced to 25 percent over
a 5 year period, allowing a preferential rate for small businesses (defined by turnover and profits), and
removing exemptions on interest earned by mutual funds.*/
Excise tax: Increase excise on a number of products, especially on tobacco, which are low by international standards.*/ Introduce excises on petroleum products, provided that subsidies are phased out.
Luxury sales tax: Remove luxury sales taxes currently applied to a large list of goods, as they
complicate tax administration and provide incentives for tax avoidance. The revenue loss from this
removal could be offset by increasing excise tax rates for selected goods and introducing a higher VAT
rate.
VAT exemptions: Remove exemptions on VAT from capital goods, mining sector, and hotel and
restaurant services. Limit new exemptions granted.
Stamp duties and fees. Abolish stamp duties to simplify the tax system.
Tax administration: Formulate a new short-term revenue generation program focused on the same areas
as the earlier programs, and modernize the administration by: (i) amending law on tax administration
procedures; (ii) simplifying compliance requirements; (iii) revamping the tax agency’s audit program;
and (iv) extending the pilot offices for medium and small taxpayers to additional regions. */
Expenditure
Subsidies: Scale back the untargeted fuel subsidies and strengthen targeting of non-oil subsidies.*/
Social spending: Increase spending and utilization of budget appropriations in the areas of health and
education by improving procurement procedures and coordination among spending agencies.*/
Provinces: Improve the framework for transferring resources to regions to achieve more equalization,
and establish appropriate safeguards for local government borrowing.*/
Efficiency of government operations: Simplify budget execution procedures, rationalize banking
arrangements, consolidate off-budgetary funds, establish a single treasury account, strengthen oversight
of public enterprises, and establish a double entry accounting framework.*/
*/ Measures currently being implemented or under consideration by the authorities.

- 20 tax (CIT) rate of 5 percentage points (to 25 percent) over as many years, a lower CIT rate for
SMEs, and accelerated depreciation allowances for capital investments. Also, the
government was considering an expansion of VAT exemptions in specific sectors. Estimates
suggested that the net revenue loss from the set of measures under consideration would be in
the order of ⅓ percent of GDP or more next year. The mission recommended that, to protect
the non-oil revenue base, such losses be offset by other tax policy measures, which could
include a broadening of the VAT tax base by eliminating exemptions for capital goods and
mining, strengthening property tax assessment, and increasing excise tax rates. The
government representatives were mindful of the possible loss from the tax policy measures
being considered. They indicated that a final assessment would be made once the entire
package had been formulated, and would be factored into the 2006 budget.
16.
A meaningful strengthening of tax administration would help provide funds for
high-priority spending while maintaining the prudent fiscal stance. The mission
recommended that, as a first priority, the revenue generation plan which was formulated in
2001 be revitalized, focusing on increasing the number of registered taxpayers, collecting tax
arrears, and broadening tax audits. Looking further ahead, strengthening the governance
framework, amending the laws to provide greater balance between tax collectors and tax
payers, and modernizing tax and customs administration would be important. The authorities
agreed on the need for reinforced measures in these areas. As for the tax amnesty that has
been under consideration since late last year, while it was not imminent, the government was
still considering the modalities. The mission reiterated its concerns about the moral hazard
aspects of such a measure, and stressed that in the event the government goes ahead, it should
improve tax administration ahead of time, set a past cut-off date, and prepare a transparent
and non-discretionary law, in order not to undermine ongoing tax collection.
17.
The government is moving ahead with treasury and debt management reforms.
Good progress has been achieved in making the Treasury fully operational, with the
reorganization of the Ministry of Finance leading to the consolidation of treasury
management functions and all Ministry of Finance top-level officials appointed. The
immediate focus as regards implementation has been on improving government banking
arrangements.13 In that regard, regulations to accompany the new Treasury Law are currently
under preparation. Meanwhile, the government is conducting an inventory of government
bank accounts with a view to rationalizing them, as a first step before consolidating them into
a single treasury account. To further improve the management of public resources and limit
fiscal risks, the government is developing guidelines for debt management. In this context,
the mission suggested that the eventual establishment of a debt unit at the Ministry of
Finance accompanied by close monitoring and strict limits on contingent liabilities be key
elements of the debt management strategy. The authorities agreed that contingent liabilities
relating to public enterprises and infrastructure projects should be closely monitored,
although work has yet to start on consolidating and assessing fiscal implications of the
numerous extra-budgetary funds. Finally, the authorities are mindful that the implementing
regulations for the new Social Security Bill, passed last October, should avoid the creation of
unfunded liabilities.
13

The Fund is providing technical assistance in support of this effort.

- 21 18.
The authorities are aware of the need to ensure consistent rules across different
levels of government and maintain fiscal control as decentralization is being
implemented. They noted that, while decentralization of functions is well advanced,
supporting safeguards still need strengthening. In this connection, implementing regulations,
to be drafted by August, would aim to limit the scope for local regulations in conflict with
national goals, including on taxation. These regulations would also seek to ensure that
appropriate safeguards are in place following the lifting of the ban on sub-national
government borrowing; such safeguards could include the adoption of a debt service
coverage ratio, fiscal rules, and bankruptcy provisions and sanctions on non-compliant
governments. In support of these efforts, the government intends to improve fiscal reporting
at the local government level.
Monetary policy: anchoring low and stable inflation
19.
Bank Indonesia reconfirmed its intention to adopt a formal inflation targeting
regime. Noting that a strong and coordinated commitment by the authorities to price stability
is a prerequisite for sustainable growth, the mission supported such a move, and the
discussions focused on the preparations for the transition. In that regard, BI indicated that it
plans to switch from base money to the one-month SBI interest rate as the intermediate
monetary policy target in mid-2005. The mission welcomed this step, as the targeting of a
single interest rate will help send a clearer signal about BI’s monetary stance in the context of
inflation targeting. More generally, the mission noted the importance of ensuring that the
conditions and operational requirements for meeting the inflation target are in place before
the move to inflation targeting. In that regard, the authorities noted that BI is working to
enhance the effectiveness of its monetary policy instruments14 and to strengthen its external
communications, including through a periodic inflation report. To support the internal
decision making process at BI, a Monetary Policy Committee is being established. The
authorities also acknowledged the importance of conducive economic policies more
generally—notably a sound budget position and banking system—in ensuring that BI can
credibly meet the inflation target.
20.
As for the near-term monetary stance, the Bank Indonesia Governor indicated
that further interest rate increases may be needed to reduce inflation, and viewed a
measured pace of monetary tightening as being appropriate. The mission thought that
higher interest rates were now warranted in order to counter inflationary pressures and limit
any second-round effects of the fuel price increase. The aim would be to substantially catch
up with global interest rate movements, and send a signal that BI will convincingly address
inflationary pressures, including through the exchange rate channel. BI officials expressed
concerns about the adverse growth implications of an excessive monetary tightening, and
also pointed to their experience last year, when pressures on the exchange rate turned out to
be temporary and a cautious monetary policy response proved warranted. With these
considerations in mind, they suggested that a more gradual monetary tightening was called
for. They noted that BI had already increased the frequency of open market operations and

- 22 allowed interest rates to edge up to absorb idle liquidity in the banking system, and stressed
that BI is monitoring inflation closely, standing ready to take additional measures as needed.
21.
A continuation of the flexible exchange rate system will help insulate the
economy against shocks and facilitate the transition to formal inflation targeting. The
authorities agreed with the mission that a flexible exchange rate will act as a useful shock
absorber for the economy and be integral to successful inflation targeting. With this in mind,
the mission advised BI to limit any foreign exchange interventions in response to pressures
on the rupiah to those needed to dampen short-term volatility. It also noted that, while the
various technical measures introduced recently to limit exchange rate volatility (see
paragraph 6) might help stabilize the exchange rate in the short run, they come at the
potential cost of hampering development of the foreign exchange market and do not address
the underlying imbalances causing exchange rate pressures. If the pressures on the exchange
rate were to persist, with attendant implications for inflation, a monetary policy response
entailing further interest rate increases would be called for. The authorities concurred, but
saw the technical measures as a useful supplement to a regular monetary policy response in
limiting short-run disturbances in the foreign exchange market.

inter alia to facilitate infrastructure lending, reinforce this concern. More broadly, BI’s
intervention in three smaller banks last year and the recent turmoil in the government
securities market, stemming in part from the sell-off by mutual funds, are reminders that the
financial sector needs continued attention.

15
16

The Fund is providing technical assistance in banking issues, including supervision.

See Chapter IV of the Selected Issues paper for an analysis of banking sector
developments, including the recent credit growth, and their implications for bank soundness
and prudential supervision. See also Table 6 for summary indicators of bank vulnerabilities.

- 23 23.
Against this background, the mission welcomed the authorities’ continued
commitment to address vulnerabilities in the financial system. Indeed, further efforts are
needed toward a financial sector that can efficiently perform financial intermediation and
withstand disturbances. The specific policy issues that arise relate to:
•

State bank governance. The recent shakeup in the management team at the largest
state bank may help bring about improvements in governance. The mission stressed
that moral suasion to lend to particular sectors or projects, including infrastructure,
should be avoided as it could compromise the soundness of the banking system. Over
the medium term, private-sector ownership control, through sale of voting shares,
would help improve efficiency in the sector.

•

Bank consolidation. Recognizing that the banking system needs strengthening and
further rationalization, BI has developed a strategy centered on raising capital
requirements and creating incentives for “strong banks,” which could serve as core
banks in the case of mergers. The central bank stressed that it will allow the
consolidation process to be market driven once it has announced the criteria for a
“strong bank” in mid-2005. In this connection it will be important to ensure that the
legal framework for consolidation is in place, that there will be appropriate vertical
and horizontal integration of the management of the institutions that will be merged,
that proper valuation and due diligence will be conducted by the institutions, and that
the additional capital raised will be efficiently deployed.

•

Prudential supervision. BI is making encouraging strides towards risk-based
supervision and continued upgrading of banking regulations in line with international
standards, and is progressing with preparations for Basel II. Notably, BI has recently
introduced new asset classification rules. Looking beyond the banking sector, the
mission welcomed the efforts being made to bolster the supervision of nonbank
financial institutions, such as insurance companies, finance companies, and mutual
funds. These efforts include the strengthening of supervision of insurance companies
toward international standards, including introduction of risk-based supervision,
tightening of investment regulations and greater transparency in the investment
activities of pension funds, enhanced supervision of finance companies through better
reporting of their operations, and enforcement of mark-to-market valuation for mutual
funds.

•

Financial sector safety net. As the gradual elimination of the blanket guarantee has
commenced, the authorities are expediting actions needed to ensure a smooth
transition to regular, limited deposit insurance. These actions include the issuance of
regulations on emergency lending, adoption of joint Ministry of Finance/BI workout
procedures for troubled banks, and appointment of staff and approval of the budget
and operating procedures for the new deposit insurance fund. With these steps
completed, the deposit insurance fund could be made operational by September 2005
and the financial sector safety net made fully operational by end-2005, as planned.

C. Structural Reforms: Encouraging Private Investment
24.
A central objective of the government’s medium-term program is to improve
the investment environment. In this regard, the authorities stressed the ongoing efforts to
simplify the regulatory framework, reduce corruption, strengthen the legal system, and
encourage infrastructure investment. The discussions focused on the following areas:
•

The efforts to reduce corruption. The Supreme Audit Agency, the Corruption
Eradication Commission (which became operational in 2004), and the Attorney
General have sought to address governance problems at various institutions, including
banks. The corruption charges brought against top officials of Bank Mandiri have
sent an important signal about the government’s expectations from state bank
officers, and civil servants more generally. The mission welcomed the government’s
commitment to address corruption, and suggested that better coordination of the
activities of the various agencies and improved budget allocations could help the
effectiveness of their efforts.17

•

The new energy policy, aimed at better utilizing Indonesia’s considerable energy
resources.18 The new policy seeks to attract investment in the oil and gas sectors by
offering concessions in the form of enhanced production sharing agreements and
accelerated depreciation for capital investment. Expediting VAT reimbursements for
capital imports and completing the regulatory framework for the sector would act as
catalysts for new investment. The mission welcomed these efforts, and at the same
time noted the importance of resolving outstanding issues in the sector with foreign
investors as a means of attracting new investor interest.

•

Improvements in labor market flexibility. A well-functioning labor market will
help translate new investment and growth into job creation.19 In this context, the
mission supported the recently established regional tripartite councils, which bring
together employers, employees, and the government, and are designed to address
concerns of both labor and employers and set the minimum wage. The mission
encouraged the use of this framework to resolve other labor-related issues, such as
severance pay levels and outsourcing, with a view to making the labor market more
flexible and increase competitiveness vis-à-vis the region.

•

The drive to improve infrastructure. Following the encouraging interest in the
Infrastructure Summit in January, the government has invited tenders to private

17

The management of technical assistance for judicial reforms was transferred from the Fund
to the World Bank at end-2004.

18

Chapter VI of the Selected Issues paper reviews the role of the oil and gas sectors in
Indonesia’s economy, including policies to better utilize the available resources.

19

Chapter VII of the Selected Issues paper provides an overview of labor market issues and
policies from this perspective.

- 25 investors for several projects. The government also intends to play a role in this
sector, including through public-private partnerships (PPPs). To ensure that these
efforts have the intended effects, the government is working to develop selection
mechanisms that prioritize projects with a high social rate of return, and to establish
procedures to limit contingent liabilities, including for government schemes relating
to PPPs. The government is also developing complementary reforms of the regulatory
framework in sectors where private investment is sought, and in this regard pointed to
the recent change in land acquisition regulations as an important step toward
facilitating road construction.
•

Trade policy. The new government is committed to maintaining Indonesia’s open
trade regime. While the overall level of import tariffs has been gradually lowered (the
average unweighted tariff rate is around 7 percent), the government has extended the
existing import bans on sugar and rice, with the objective of promoting domestic
production through higher farm prices. The mission encouraged the government to
consider phasing out such import restrictions, because of their effects on the prices on
foods important for the poor, and suggested their replacement with more transparent
and less distortionary mechanisms for regulating imports and promoting domestic
production. The mission was encouraged by the recent review of existing restrictions
on trade and the decisions to ease export restrictions on selected commodities. In
regard to trade liberalization more broadly, the Indonesian authorities have been
pursuing a series of bilateral and multilateral free trade and investment agreements
with major trading partners, while supporting an ambitious conclusion to the Doha
Round in multilateral fora. On the bilateral side, negotiations have begun with
ASEAN and its partner countries, including Australia, China, and Japan, while
discussions with several other countries are at a more preliminary stage.
III. OTHER ISSUES
A. Capacity to Repay the Fund

25.
With the strong set of economic policies envisaged under the government’s
medium-term economic program, debt service payments to the Fund are expected to be
readily manageable. Scheduled repayments to the Fund peak in 2008 at US$2 billion,
projected to be equivalent to about 2 percent exports of goods and services, 5 percent of
international reserve assets, and one fifth of nonfinancial public sector debt service (Table 7).
B. Data and Standards
26.
The authorities have demonstrated their strong interest in benefiting from the
Fund’s various transparency and standards initiatives. In particular:
•

Indonesia subscribes to the SDDS, although a number of data weaknesses remain. A
statistics ROSC conducted in March identified several shortcomings in the national
accounts and government finance statistics, and to a lesser degree in the balance of
payments statistics. These shortcomings may have implications for the scope for
effective monitoring of economic developments and policy formulation. In that
regard, staff would support the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance in

- 26 addressing shortcomings identified under the data ROSC, especially in government
finance statistics.
•

The government has requested that the Fund conduct a fiscal ROSC, and expressed
interest in having the work done in late 2005.

•

While the authorities remain interested in an FSAP, they indicated that more time
would be needed before going ahead, in order to coordinate among related institutions
and monitor the outcome of the ongoing efforts to strengthen and consolidate the
banking system.

27.
In February, Indonesia was removed from the list of Non-Cooperative Countries
and Territories maintained by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This step
followed considerable progress in the implementation of an effective anti-money laundering
regime.20 Indonesia will be subject to strict monitoring for further progress in the
implementation of AML measures on a quarterly basis and possibly another on-site visit by
the FATF to review progress.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
In the years since the Asian crisis, Indonesia has come a long way toward
establishing the basis for sustained economic growth. With macroeconomic stability
restored and the condition of the banking system improved, the economy has registered
increasing growth rates over the last several years. By the same token, Indonesia’s rapid
labor force growth and widespread poverty call for even higher economic growth.
Meanwhile, the recent pressure in financial markets is evidence that Indonesia remains
vulnerable to shocks and a reminder that maintaining macro stability continues to be a
priority.
29.
Building on this progress, the new government’s economic program is well
designed to realize Indonesia’s growth potential and further reduce vulnerabilities. The
government that took office in late 2004 faces a historical opportunity and has a strong
political mandate to put Indonesia on a higher sustainable growth path. To that end, its focus
on continued fiscal and monetary restraint combined with reinforced structural reforms is
appropriate. Indeed, provided that the government follows through on its economic strategy,
the outlook for the economy is favorable, with real GDP expected to grow by 6–7 percent
annually over the medium term boosted by higher investment and productivity. Public debt
ratios would improve and international reserves coverage remain healthy.
30.
The government’s intention to continue a prudent fiscal policy is welcome.
Achievement of the government’s aim to reduce the budget deficit to 1 percent of GDP or
below this year and next would help further reduce government debt ratios. In revising the
2005 budget, the government would be well advised to take account of the budgetary
implications of the changed economic environment, which will in all likelihood require
additional measures to meet the 2005 deficit target. Looking to next year, achievement of the
20

The Fund is providing technical assistance in this area, in coordination with donors.

- 27 government’s deficit target calls for a careful consideration of the revenue implications of the
tax policy package underway—including any plans to introduce further exemptions—and
domestic fuel price policy. In moving forward in both areas, care is needed to ensure that
resources are available for high-priority spending and that the government borrowing
requirement is kept at a manageable level. Looking to the medium term, the staff supports the
government’s objective of reducing the public debt ratio toward 30–35 percent of GDP.
Achieving this objective will require the maintenance of primary surpluses in the range of
1½–2 percent of GDP.
31.
Moving ahead on a range of fiscal structural reforms as planned will improve
the durability and quality of fiscal adjustment. On the revenue side, the government’s
goal to broaden the tax base through strengthened tax administration is welcome.
Revitalizing the short-term revenue generation plan, focused on ensuring that all taxpayers
contribute as intended through increased registration and better auditing, would potentially
make an important contribution. Beyond these short-term measures, a strengthening of
governance and modernization of tax and customs administration would be important
objectives. On the spending side, reorientation of outlays toward capital and social
expenditure would bring tangible results in terms of creating jobs and improving productive
capacity. Careful management of government liabilities, including the adoption of a debt
management strategy and a framework for limiting contingent liabilities, is a high priority.
Staff would encourage the authorities to ensure consistency of regulations at different levels
of government and to maintain fiscal control while implementing the decentralization
framework.
32.
Bank Indonesia’s focus on putting inflation on a downward path is salutary.
Recent pressures on inflation and the exchange rate underscore the need to use monetary
policy convincingly to maintain stability. From that perspective, Bank Indonesia’s stated
commitment to adjust interest rates as needed is welcome. By demonstrating Bank
Indonesia’s commitment to using interest rate policy actively to respond to inflationary
pressures, this would also help achieve a successful move to formal inflation targeting and
facilitate the lowering of inflation on a sustained basis. In this regard, Bank Indonesia’s
switch to an interest rate as its intermediate target in the middle of this year will be an
important move in the right direction, which will enhance the transparency of monetary
policy and support the move to inflation targeting. Moreover, ensuring that other conditions
for making the transition to inflation targeting a success are in place will be key, and the
central bank’s efforts to improve its monetary instruments and communication strategy are
encouraging in this regard. The maintenance of the flexible exchange rate system would
protect the economy against shocks and help the functioning of the new monetary
framework. In that connection, it will be important that Bank Indonesia limit interventions in
the foreign exchange market to those needed to counter short-term volatility. The staff’s
analysis does not suggest that the current level of the exchange rate represents a threat to
external competitiveness.
33.
While the banking system’s performance has improved, important challenges
remain. As banks may be moving into a more difficult period, with higher interest rates
putting pressure on margins, even more care is needed to ensure close supervision of the
financial sector. In that regard, the authorities’ efforts to further enhance financial sector
supervision, promote a strengthening and consolidation of the banking system, and improve

- 28 governance are encouraging. Ultimately, a transfer of ownership in state banks to the private
sector would help strengthen governance and performance. Finally, the staff supports the
ongoing work to establish the deposit insurance fund and other elements of the financial
sector safety net, as this will be important to maintain confidence in the banking system as
the blanket guarantee is phased out. The staff would recommend that Indonesia undertake an
FSAP at an early date.
34.
The staff welcomes the government’s efforts to improve the investment climate.
With macroeconomic stability largely restored, improving the investment environment holds
the key to unlocking growth in investment and production. From that perspective, the recent
steps to address corruption, attract investment in the oil and gas sector, and put in place a
new investment law are commendable. The government faces further challenges in
improving the functioning of the legal system, strengthening infrastructure, improving labor
market flexibility, and bolstering tax administration. While by their very nature these
elements of the private investment environment will take time to address, the government has
made a solid start.
35.
The authorities’ attention to improving economic statistics is welcome. While
available date are adequate for surveillance purposes, the staff supports the authorities'
intentions to further enhance data quality, including with technical assistance from the Fund.
36.
All told, the new government’s commitment to sustain and to deepen the
economic reforms of the past several years should help Indonesia reach its full
economic potential. Indonesia is still facing risks associated with an uncertain international
environment, as well as its government debt level and weaknesses in the banking system,
which put a premium on sound economic policies. Going forward, the government’s strategy,
provided that it is implemented with determination, will help achieve sustainable growth in
incomes and meaningful reductions in unemployment and poverty in the context of a more
robust economy. The government’s track record during its first eight months holds out hope
that the reforms will come to fruition and its economic goals be achieved.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

2/ The introduction of a 9-digit system of accounts at BI in May 2004 resulted in a reclassification of some
government accounts from other items net to net claims on government.
3/ As part of the BLBI resolution, BI's net claims on government were reduced by Rp 20.2 trillion (reflected
in the figure for 2003). BI's capital reserves (under other items net) have been reduced by a corresponding amount.

Exchange Arrangements

The rupiah has floated since August 14, 1997. The market exchange rate was Rp 9,495 per
U.S. dollar on May 31, 2005. Indonesia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

The last Article IV consultation report (EBS/04/54) was discussed by the Executive Board on
May 3, 2004.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Extended Arrangement, Bank Indonesia (BI) was subject to the transitional
procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy. This required a review of BI’s
external audit mechanism, which was completed on March 15, 2002. The assessment
recommended remedial actions to address a number of vulnerabilities. The main
recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an independent audit
committee at BI and the publication of BI’s audited financial statements.

- 42 -

ANNEX II

INDONESIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES21
1.
Indonesia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
September 1996. Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics and statistical base are broadly
adequate to conduct effective surveillance at this time.
Real Sector
2.
Annual national accounts data are based on a 2000 base year. Quarterly GDP data are
published in a timely manner. The estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators
of uncertain quality. Although some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality,
seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not published, and no survey of nonfinancial
services is conducted. An economic census of businesses is undertaken every 10 years, but
not updated in the intervening periods. The household budget survey does not cover higher
income households. The staff have recommended: (i) development of a system to
continuously update the census of businesses; (ii) introduction of comprehensive annual
establishment surveys for nonfinancial services industries; (iii) publication of annual GDP
estimates, including a time series of at least 20 years; (iv) development of a set of annual
supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from 2000; and (v) expedited conversion to the 1993
System of National Accounts.
3.
Labor market data, including wages and employment, are available, albeit reported
with some delay, through the annual labor market survey (Sakernas) published by the Bureau
of Statistics. Data are also available on minimum and maximum wages for the formal sector.
Quarterly data are available on industrial wages, again with some delay.
Public Finance
4.
Comprehensive public finance data are generally not available, and the data that are
available are of questionable quality in terms of definition, coverage and timeliness.
Subnational government fiscal data are available with a lag of two years, and the quality is
variable. Data on the central government budget become available with a two months lag.
5.
Discrepancies between financing and elements above the line are evident for some
years. The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics is generally adequate; however,
only limited information on contingent liabilities is available. There are a large number of
quasi-government entities (such as utility platform includes Domestic Gas Project which
aims at expanding the use of natural gas in the West Java market. This project, which is

21

The section is based on a Detailed Assessment of Indonesia’s observance of the IMF’s
Data Quality Assessment Framework, prepared by STA in March 2005.

- 43 -

negotiated now and will be committed in July 2005, involves expansion of the gas
distribution system in West Java and capacity building activities for PGN. foundations) and
extra-budgetary funds, resulting in non-transparent and unaccountable off-budget activities.
A new expenditure classification has been introduced in the 2005 budget and the authorities
are considering the adoption of the GFS standards as their general reporting framework by
2008
6.
In this context, the Fund staff have recommended: (i) establishment of a register of all
central government public sector units, classified by sector; (ii) amendment of accounting
regulations to ensure that general government units report all transactions and balances over
which they exert control; (iii) establishment of arrangements to obtain timely preliminary
data for local government statistics; and (iv) development of Government Financial Statistic
Manual 2001 operating statements, statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial
balance sheets, all of which should be published on the MOF websites. Further TA from the
Fund is likely to be requested in this area.
Monetary Accounts
7.
Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by the BI on a timely basis. With STA
assistance BI has developed an integrated database from which alternative presentations of
monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund. Further work,
however, is needed to expand the coverage of depository corporations to include mutual
funds (REKSA DANA), which report data to BAPEPAM—a supervisory agency located in
the Ministry of Finance. To this end, BI is currently developing institutional data-sharing
arrangements that would enable it to access the register of—and data on—mutual funds.
8.
In order to strengthen monetary statistics Fund TA missions have recommended to:
(i) collect source data on mutual funds in a format that meets statistical requirements;
(ii) expand the coverage of the monetary statistics to include mutual funds; and
(iii) harmonize reported interbank positions between the BI and commercial banks.
Balance of Payments
9.
Indonesia’s balance of payments statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective
surveillance, but certain weaknesses remain. In general, there are some deficiencies in the
recording of financial transactions of the private sector.
10.
With respect to merchandise trade data, while customs sources utilized by BI are
considered generally reliable, there is believed to be under-coverage in selected areas. When
the online reporting system for exports and imports was introduced in 2004, the historical
series were reconstructed only as far back as 2003. Therefore, prior to 2003, balance of
payments statistics are not entirely consistent with the national accounts estimates. Data on
services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodologies. BI adjusts the customs data
to cover exports and imports of Batam and other bonded zones. Adjustments are also made to

- 44 -

data on compensation of employees and workers remittances to cover professional workers,
legal workers not reported to the Ministry of Manpower, and illegal workers.
11.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of
FDI data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan
disbursements to FDI companies and the application of a fixed ratio to the loan
disbursements data to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data
have a low response rate and the directory of enterprises requires enhancement in terms of its
coverage. Other areas that need improvement include the recording of trade credits and the
assets data for portfolio investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the
errors and omissions item has been significant and appears to be related to the methodology
used, for instance, for unrecorded assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data
have not been reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP).
12.
BI has proposed a range of measures to address these weaknesses. On trade-related
data, a working group has been established to reconcile differences between BI and customs
data. BI is planning to collect and publish data on goods imported for processing, goods
procured in ports by carriers, and transactions with the oil and gas sector. On the financial
account, the BI is planning to collect and publish data on direct investment abroad, portfolio
investment assets, other investment assets, and trade credits, to help address some of the
identified shortcomings in the recording of private financial flows.
13.
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably
for FDI. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of a
External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002. The system records external debt of
government and over 800 other entities that report to the BI on a monthly basis. The data that
this system generates for public sector external debt and debt service, as well as those for
private banks, are considered reliable. However, improvements are still needed with respect
to components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between
scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector
payments arrears, and in estimating rescheduling and debt reductions being received by the
private sector from external creditors.

ANNEX III

INDONESIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
For questions relating to this annex, contact Mona Haddad (phone: 202-473-6127) at the
World Bank.
The World Bank is engaged in a wide-ranging policy dialogue focusing on improving the
climate for high quality investment, making service delivery responsive to the needs of the
poor, and addressing the core issue of governance. This focus is developed in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) of October 2003 and is based on the fact that progress in reducing
poverty is prevented by two major factors—low investment and weak service provision—
which in turn are caused primarily by governance problems.
World Bank Policy Dialogue—Selected Highlights
Poverty reduction. Continued macroeconomic stability and growth have reduced measured
income poverty to pre-crisis levels. However the provision of basic services, non-income
dimensions of poverty, including such indicators as the maternal mortality rate, continue to
be weak relative to other countries in the region. The newly elected Government has made a
strong commitment to poverty reduction in its Medium-Term Plan, targeting a halving of the
poverty and unemployment rates in five years. The Medium-Term Plan (PJM), which draws
on the Government’s draft poverty reduction strategy (SNPK), is based on three agendas: (i)
creating an Indonesia that is safe and peaceful; (ii) establishing democracy and justice for all;
and (iii) improving prosperity. In April 2005, the World Bank assisted the Government in
hosting a major National Poverty Conference, opened by the Vice President, and focusing on
improving service delivery to the poor. Over the next fiscal year, the Bank will undertake a
Poverty Assessment and continue to provide the Government advice on policy issues related
to poverty reduction.
Fuel Subsidies. In March 2005 the Government reduced regressive fuel subsidies increasing
average fuel prices by close to 30 percent. Some US$1 billion of the increase was reallocated
to spending on health, education, and village infrastructure, with advice and input from the
Bank and Fund.
Aceh. The government’s challenge in reducing poverty and enhancing prosperity was
severely tested by the tsunami and earthquake that struck Aceh and Northern Sumatra on
December 26, 2004. The natural disaster, which is expected to have a modest overall macroeconomic impact, had a devastating impact on local livelihoods. The World Bank led a joint
Government-donor team, including the Fund, that prepared two key reports for the January
2005 Consultative Group Meeting: “Indonesia: Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment”
and “Indonesia: Notes on Reconstruction”. The Bank has continued to play an important role
in support of the government’s response to the crisis; notably through assistance with the
development of the government’s “blue-print for reconstruction” and through technical
assistance in setting up and operation of the Aceh Reconstruction Agency. Finally, the World
Bank is managing a US$500 million multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) in support of the

- 47 -

reconstruction effort. In its initial meeting, the MDTF approved four projects; land titling,
housing support, community development and urban poverty reduction.
Fiscal Issues. The Bank works closely with the Fund on fiscal policy, with the Bank taking
the lead on: the development budget and sectoral allocation, fiscal decentralization, and civil
service reform. The Bank also plays a significant role in public financial management and
capacity building for long-term debt management.
Initiative for Public Expenditure Analysis. Insufficient and poorly allocated public
investment is a key concern. In order to address these public expenditure issues, the Bank
with the support of the Dutch Trust Fund, put in place IPEA in April 2004. IPEA is a multiyear program that focuses on (i) fiscal space and public investment needs, (ii) sectoral
expenditure reviews, (iii) decentralization and intergovernmental fiscal relations, (iv)
regional public expenditure reviews and (v) public financial management. IPEA focuses on
ownership and capacity building. For example, public finance days are regularly held with
participation by the authorities, the donor community and Indonesian academics.
Public Financial Management. There has been a great deal of progress in this area. Three
key laws (the State Finance Law, the State Treasury Law and the State Audit Law) provide a
comprehensive framework for Indonesia’s public financial management. Implementing
regulations for these laws are under development with Bank and Fund assistance. The
Ministry of Finance completed a major reorganization in early 2005. At the request of the
Ministry of Finance, the Bank approved a Government Financial Management and Revenue
Administration Project (GFMRAP). The GFMRAP project supports public finance reforms
in three major areas: public financial management (including budget preparation and treasury
modernization), tax administration and customs administration. The Ministry of Finance is in
the process of adopting a results-oriented modernization strategy and plan for tax and a
modernization action plan of customs. The Bank is working closely with the Fund on all
aspects.
Long-term Debt Management Capacity Building. The government is making good progress
on debt management. Under the new organization of the Ministry of Finance, domestic and
external government debt is now managed within the Treasury. Currently, the Ministry of
Finance with other stakeholders (e.g. Bank Indonesia) is developing a comprehensive debt
management strategy with Bank technical assistance and advice. The program of assistance
includes establishing a debt and risk management strategy, integrated debt reporting and
improved capacity. This will allow the government to assesses vulnerability (risks and costs)
in the sovereign liabilities portfolio, improve the “front, back and middle-office” function,
and monitor fiscal risks associated with the government’s contingent liabilities.
Decentralization. The passage of Law 32/2004 (revised Law 22/1999) and Law 33/2004
(revised Law 25/1999), revised the two main pillars of decentralization. The government is
now working on finalizing revisions to the legal framework governing sub-national taxation
(Law 34/2000). The modified legislation generally moves the decentralization process in the
right direction, although the progress of reform is uneven. The World Bank supports the

- 48 -

government’s decentralization program with economic, fiscal, and financial analyses. This is
done in collaboration with government; by providing policy advice on expenditure and tax
assignments, intergovernmental transfers, and sub-national borrowing; and through the
implementation of projects at the local level. The World Bank receives support in carrying
out these activities from trust funds made available by the Dutch and the British aid agencies.
Financial and Private Sector. The Bank’s overall financial sector program is focused on
medium- and longer-term development of the financial sector aiming at improving the
climate for investment. In the banking sector, the Bank continues its policy-dialogue with
Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of State owned Enterprises as well
as with the State Asset Management Company (PPA). The Bank is working closely with the
government to create a more diversified financial sector through the development of the
capital markets and non-bank financial institutions, especially on industry structure and
product development in NBFIs. A second ASEM grant for capacity building, knowledge
transfer and sharing of best practices in the areas of equities, bonds, mutual funds, insurance,
pensions, leasing and venture capital has been provided. Recently in April 2005, the Bank
co-hosted an international conference on NBFIs with the Ministry of Finance and AusAID. A
series of conferences in specific areas of the NBFI sector are expected to follow in 2005 –
2006. The Bank is also expanding its financial sector program with the support from Dutch
Trust Fund to assist the Government in the area of infrastructure finance. In addition, the
Bank together with the Fund continues its AML-CFT program.
In the corporate sector, the Bank had completed the Reports on the Observation of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) on corporate governance and is undertaking another on accounting and
auditing. The Bank will continue the quarterly debt survey previously carried out by the
Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF); this institution designed to facilitate corporate
restructuring post crisis has now been closed.
Trade. The Bank prepared a comprehensive Diagnostics for Trade Integration Study
(published in November 2004). The study shows that in order to increase income growth and
renew job creation in Indonesia the government should focus on measures that reduce costs
for exporters, increase access to markets and revamp investment in export industries. Making
use of Indonesia's abundant labor, 40 percent of the labor-force work in agriculture, and 70
percent in the informal sector, suggest that labor-intensive goods will remain Indonesia's
strength for some time to come. In the medium-term, the government needs a comprehensive
trade strategy to allow a gradual upgrading into higher value goods.
The new government has signaled its intent to maintain an open trade regime and on cutting
the cost of doing business to improve competitiveness. Efforts are being made at simplifying
or removing non-tariff barriers. Indonesia has recently made an initial offer on services at the
WTO--an important step to becoming more pro-active in the multilateral negotiations. The
Bank is working with the Ministry of Trade to assist in the development of an international
and domestic trade strategy and associated capacity building.

- 49 -

Investment climate. Results from the World Bank-Asian Development Bank Private
Investment Climate Survey (PICS) show that the main concerns of investors are
macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, corruption, labor regulation and infrastructure.
The government has recognized the importance of improving the investment climate.
Measures include a continuing focus on fiscal and monetary stability, anti-corruption
initiatives, policies to increase private infrastructure investment, and streamlining business
registration. The World Bank and IFC-Pensa have worked closely with the government team
drafting a new investment law including streamlining investment procedures. The Bank has
completed and published the results of the PICS (Raising Investment in Indonesia: A Second
Generation of Reforms in February 2005). New initiatives include a bi-annual investment
climate monitor to assess progress and identify remaining weaknesses in the investment and
business environment with the first results due in June 2005. The Bank is also launching a
rural investment climate survey to identify constraints to the growth of non-farm income.
IFC-Pensa is initiating a sub-national deregulation program to address business registration,
licensing and permits at the local level.
Civil service reform. The World Bank has been providing support to administrative and
civil service reform including a policy dialogue with key decision makers at the central level
and support to regional governments.
The civil service is not large by regional standards but performance and governance are key
issues and management is poor. Decentralization in 2001 did not solve the issue of poor
service delivery, inefficiency and corruption. Central entities with responsibilities for civil
service policy have overlapping mandates. There are unclear post-decentralization mandates.
An opaque compensation regime, loose establishment controls and weak integrity systems
govern civil service behavior.
The understanding and demand for civil service reform is high on the reform agenda in key
agencies and some regional governments. The Bank’s country assistance strategy allocates
activities based on the scope to achieve, demonstrate, and leverage governance
improvements. Governance and anti-corruption are central to all aspects of the Bank’s
program designed to foster transparency and accountability through two complementary
approaches: (i) enhance the demand for good governance through greater public participation
in policy-making and policy-monitoring processes, and (ii) by strengthening the institutions
that are accountable for implementing the impressive body of laws to improve governance
passed during the Reformasi period. The Bank has two projects; one in support of the Anti
Corruption Commission and the second in support of Justice Sector and Legal Institutions
reform more broadly.
The goal of the Bank’s governance program is to help Indonesia with the structural progress
needed to reduce corruption and restore integrity in the public sector. The new government
has made governance a priority and a number of high profile cases are in process, but there
continue to be concerns with the structural nature of corruption and measures needed to
combat it.

- 50 -

The Bank issued a report on Combating Corruption in Indonesia in October 2003, and since
then has assisted the anti-corruption effort notably through a grant to the Corruption
Eradication Commission.
Lending Operations
During the CAS period (FY2004-2007), the Bank Group program is focused on areas most
crucial to poverty reduction: (i) inadequate productive employment opportunities resulting
from a weak investment climate; and (ii) the lack of quality service delivery especially to the
poor. Progress in these two areas, is compromised by weak governance. The World Bank
Group’s strategy is to address the objectives of strengthening the investment climate and
service delivery including, critically, the issue of governance. To do this there are four broad
client areas: the national government, communities, local governments (district and
province), and public utilities. To deliver its program the bank has developed a platform
approach at each level.
By end May of the Bank’s FY2005 (July 2004-June 2005), US$917 million had been
committed including:


Central government platform lending includes the first Development Policy Loan
(DPL) which disbursed US$300 million in December 2004 with Japanese co-financing
disbursing US$100 million in March 2005. The DPL is designed to sustain
macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic policy reform recognizing the
country’s progress in achieving the targets from the 2003 “White Paper”, Indonesia’s
own reform package with time-bound targets. At the same time, the loan supports the
comprehensive agenda of economic and governance reforms of the new government,
as expressed in the 100-day plan, and other key policy statements. Also at the request
of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank approved a US$60 million Government Financial
Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP). The GFMRAP project
supports public finance reforms in public financial management (including budget
preparation and treasury modernization), as well as, tax and customs administration.
The Higher Education projects provide support to the government’s long-term strategy
by creating an enabling environment for the evolution of autonomous and accountable
public higher education institutions.



Community based platform projects include the third Kecamatan Development Project
(KDP, the third Urban Poverty Program (UPP) and a new Social and Economic
Revitalization Project (SERP) focused on conflict areas. These projects feature a
transparent "bottom-up" approach to decentralized participatory project identification
and are designed to promote good governance, transparency, and increased
accountability.



Local government platform projects include: The Urban Sector Development Reform
Project (USDRP) supports the establishment of accountable governments in Indonesia
through the implementation of municipal governance reforms, institutional
development and finances priority urban investments at the local level. The Initiative

- 51 -

for Local Governance Reform (ILGR) supports "reform-minded districts to enhance
governance quality" by improving public accountability, the preparation of local
regulations that ensure public access to information and decision-making processes.


Public utility platform includes Domestic Gas Project which aims at expanding the use
of natural gas in the West Java market. This project, which is negotiated now and will
be committed in July 2005, involves expansion of the gas distribution system in West
Java and capacity building activities for PGN.

ANNEX IV

INDONESIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
Asian Development Bank (AsDB) cumulative loans to Indonesia reached over $19.6 billion
at end-December 2004. Technical assistance projects amounted to $231 million as of December
31, 2004. In 2004, the AsDB approved a total of $225 million which consisted of two loans for
one project focused on enhancing governance in the public sector, with targeted support for State
audit reforms. The AsDB is working closely with government agencies to develop and implement
reforms in other areas including decentralization, social infrastructure, natural resources, trade
and industry, financial sector reform, corporate governance and power sector restructuring. AsDB
is pursuing its earlier efforts to implement anti-corruption reforms in line with an action plan
agreed with the government.
In response to the December 26, 2004 earthquake and tsunami disaster, AsDB has reached
agreement with the government in early 2005 to reallocate ongoing projects to mobilize support
in the amount of $64.6 million. In addition, AsDB established the Asian Tsunami Fund with its
own initial contribution of $600 million on a grant basis. Out of this Fund, AsDB has approved an
emergency grant project to provide $300 million support for Aceh and Nias, including
$10 million contribution the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Cofinancing support has been mobilized
for $20 million targeting support for community water and sanitation services, and fiduciary
governance. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will provide various grants totaling
$10 million.

ANNEX V

INDONESIA: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
This annex compares the medium-term outlook under the baseline scenario discussed in the staff
report text with two alternative scenarios based on different assumptions about global growth
and interest rates and about domestic productivity growth. It also analyzes the impact of several
exogenous shocks on the sustainability of public sector debt and external debt under the baseline
scenario.
I. Alternative Scenarios
1.
The staff has developed two alternative scenarios to analyze the medium-term
outlook. The first alternative scenario looks at the implications of downside risks in the global
environment, represented by lower growth in Indonesia’s trading partner countries combined
with higher international interest rates. The second alternative scenario assumes lower
productivity growth due to delays in improving the investment climate and lower government
surpluses. In both cases, growth is affected adversely, albeit for different reasons.
2.
In the first alternative scenario, lower growth reflects lower demand for Indonesia’s
exports and lower investment. Growth is expected to average about 5 percent over the medium
term compared with the baseline of 6–7 percent. Moreover, higher interest rates will raise
government spending on the interest bill compared to the baseline and reduce capital spending,
further exacerbating the slowdown. Public debt is about 5 percentage points higher than in the
baseline scenario in 2010. Lower capital inflows combined with lower export growth also result
in lower international reserves accumulation.
3.
In the second alternative scenario, lack of progress in improving the investment
climate and less ambitious follow through on fiscal policy deters investors and slows down
growth to an average of 3–4 percent over the medium term due to deteriorating trends in
investment and slowing productivity, including in the oil sector. Macroeconomic policy
implementation also weakens, as both monetary and fiscal policy are relaxed. On the fiscal side,
the overall fiscal deficit ranges between 2–2½ percent of GDP as the government relaxes
spending to stimulate growth. This will increase the public debt ratio in the medium term by
about 10 percentage points of GDP over the baseline by 2010.
II. Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Baseline Scenario
A. Public debt
4.
The public sector debt ratio has steadily declined from 76 percent of GDP at end2001 to an estimated 54 percent of GDP at end-2004 (Annex V, Table 1). This reflects the
government’s prudent fiscal policy, declining interest rates, and a sustained growth in real GDP.
About half of the total outstanding public debt is owed to foreign creditors, mainly multilateral
institutions.

- 54 -

100

5.
Under the projected baseline
Public Sector Debt
scenario, the public sector debt ratio is
(in percent of GDP)
expected to decline gradually to less than
80
80
30 percent of GDP by end-2010. In terms
of public sector revenues, public debt will
60
60
decline from 273 percent to 181 percent
over this period. These results are based on
the assumptions underlying the baseline
40
40
medium-term scenario in the staff report,
specifically that: (1) real GDP growth
20
20
rebounds to 6–7 percent over the medium

term; (2) central government primary
surpluses average 1½–2 percent of GDP; and (3) average nominal interest rates on public debt
remain in the 5–6 percent range. The debt projections would be affected if contingent liabilities
materialize, for example, if new banking sector bailouts are necessary or if the government
decides to provide guarantees on investment projects which are subsequently executed.

One-time exchange rate shock

Real interest rate shock

Primary balance shock

6.
The standard sensitivity analysis shows that the trajectory of the debt ratio is
particularly sensitive to changes in real interest rates and exchange rates (Annex V, Table 1,
panel B). A temporary upward shock in 2006 and 2007, equivalent to two standard deviations in
the real interest above its historical average raises the debt ratio by about 10 percent of GDP in
2006 above the baseline, jumping to about 19 percent of GDP over the baseline during the
remainder of the projection period. A one-time 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate
raises the debt ratio by about 14 percentage points.
External debt
7.
Indonesia’s external debt has also
declined steadily since the crisis, from
over 81 percent of GDP in 2001 to around
53 percent in 2004 (Annex V, Table 2).
External debt as a percent of exports has
also declined from over 212 percent in 2001
to 156 percent in 2004.

under 30 percent by 2010. However, the
favorable trend in the external debt burden
could be reversed if the envisaged foreign direct investment and equity inflows fail to
materialize, or if the associated investment does not generate growing export receipts.

External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to shocks to the exchange rate. A
one-time shock of a 30 percent depreciation of the exchange rate in 2006 raises the debt ratio

immediately by about 17 percent of GDP with the impact declining gradually over the medium
term to 12 percentage points by 2010.

INDONESIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
and Third Post-Program Monitoring Discussions
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Carlo Cottarelli
July 14, 2005
This supplement provides an update on developments since the issuance of the staff report.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged. In the staff’s view, a continuation of
exchange rate pressures, at the time of Bank Indonesia’s adoption of interest rate targeting
as part of its move toward formal inflation targeting, reinforces the staff report’s emphasis
on pursuing a firm interest rate policy .

Consumer Price Inflation
(12-month percent change)

The increase in headline CPI was
7.4 percent (y/y) in June, the same as in
May. Meanwhile, underlying inflation edged
up slightly, to some 8 percent.

2.
The exchange rate resumed its
depreciating trend, touching a three-year
low against the U.S. dollar in early July.
The rupiah exchange rate reached
Rp/US$9,900 on July 5, but has since
recovered slightly to Rp/US$9,805 on
July 14. Bank Indonesia (BI) has continued to
intervene in the foreign exchange market,
while also increasing the one-month interest
rate from just under 8 percent at the
beginning of June to 8½ percent currently.
The foreign exchange sales have contributed
to a decline in BI’s gross international
reserves to about US$32½ billion at present,
down from a peak of about US$37 billion in
early April. The reserves level remains
relatively comfortable, however, at some

140 percent of short-term external debt. Effective July 14, Bank Indonesia announced a set of
measures designed to limit short-term capital flows and the scope for exchange rate
volatility; these measures included: (i) a reduction in the limit on sell swaps with
nonresidents from US$3 million to US$1 million; (ii) a new limit of US$1 million on buy
swaps; and (iii) a new requirement that hedging activities with nonresidents for underlying
financial investments must be of a maturity of 3 months or longer.
Budgetary developments
3.
Parliament approved the revised budget for 2005 based on updated assumptions
on June 28. The budget now assumes real GDP growth of 6 percent and consumer price
inflation of 7½ percent (Dec/Dec) this year, and
Table. Indonesia: Budgetary Aggregates, 2005
also incorporates new assumptions for the

reflecting buoyant oil and gas revenues and a low
expenditure execution rate associated with new disbursement guidelines. While revenues
could weaken in the period ahead, the expenditure delays are not likely to be fully reversed,
facilitating the achievement of the overall budget deficit target, albeit at the risk of lower
reconstruction activity in tsunami-affected areas. Also, the possibility of higher international
oil prices remains a risk to the budget, although the ultimate impact will depend on domestic
fuel pricing policies.
4.
The estimated total costs of reconstruction in the earthquake and tsunamiaffected areas have been increased from US$4½ billion to about US$5 billion. In addition
to costs relating to Aceh and North Sumatra, the new estimate includes reconstruction costs
in Nias, hit by the March 2005 earthquake. The amount of funds allocated for reconstruction
and development activities has now reached about US$3 billion, of which US$1.2 billion is
from NGOs. The revised 2005 budget includes allocations for reconstruction, partly financed
by Paris Club rescheduling and partly covered under ongoing government-financed projects.
The progress on the ground has been constrained by (i) the emphasis on checks and balances,
which has slowed down budget implementation, (ii) the authorization process for donor
pledges by some national governments, that in certain cases have been awaiting
parliamentary approval, and (iii) sluggish capital and reconstruction spending at the local
government level, in part due to delays in completing budget approval processes of lower-

-3-

level authorities. However, it is expected that funds for on-budget projects will flow within
one month, following the approval of the revised 2005 budget.
Monetary policy

At end-June, Bank Indonesia announced, as expected, that it will henceforth use
interest rates as its intermediate target for monetary policy. The central bank will use a
one-month interest rate, dubbed the “BI rate,” as its intermediate target in lieu of base money,

Banking and private investment environment

Bank Indonesia announced as anticipated new regulations to guide the
strengthening and consolidation of the banking system, at end-June. The regulations set
the minimum tier-1 capital level for banks at Rp 80 billion by end-2007 and Rp 100 billion
by end-2010. Banks that do not meet the criteria have an option to merge with other banks;
failing this, the scope of their operations would be curtailed. By the same token, banks with
strong performance would be permitted to act as “anchor banks” allowed to acquire other
banks. Criteria for qualifying as an “anchor bank” are inter alia that for at least the preceding
three years, a bank has registered (i) a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 12 percent, with a
tier-1 capital ratio of 6 percent, (ii) a healthy performance as reflected in a minimum return
on assets of 1.5 percent, and (iii) stipulated minimum levels of credit growth or loan-todeposit ratios. The authorities have noted that, while the “anchor bank” criteria emphasize
credit expansion and growth potential, they are primarily designed to ensure that the balance
sheets of such banks are sound.
7.
An agreement in principle has been announced between Exxon Mobil and the stateowned petroleum company Pertamina concerning the Cepu oil field. The two parties had
been negotiating an extension of Exxon Mobil’s contract, which was set to expire in 2010,
following the discovery of large oil reserves at Cepu. While full agreement is yet to be
reached, the announcement has been welcomed by observers, as the case has been considered
an important test of the investment environment under the new government.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation and
Third Post-Program Monitoring with Indonesia
On July 18, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2005 Article IV consultation and third post-program monitoring
discussions with Indonesia.1
Background
Since the last Article IV consultation, Indonesia has undergone a historical political
transition. In 2004, the country held parliamentary elections as well as its first direct
presidential election, and a new government took office in October. The elections gave
the government a strong mandate to carry forward the economic reforms initiated by its
predecessor, aimed at placing Indonesia on a high and sustained growth path in order
to reduce unemployment and poverty. To this end, the new government’s medium-term
economic strategy focuses on a continuation of macroeconomic stability combined with
a deepening of structural reforms. Since the new government assumed office, it has
continued the conservative budget stance, and taken important first steps toward
strengthening the financial sector and enhancing the investment climate. At the same
time, the government’s Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency has started
reconstruction in the tsunami-affected regions, with the support of the international
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with all member countries, usually every year. Post-Program Monitoring provides for
frequent consultations between the Fund and members whose Fund arrangements have
expired but who continue to have substantial Fund credit outstanding. Particular focus is
placed on policies that have a bearing on external viability. For both purposes, a staff
team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

community. Monetary policy is aiming to anchor inflation at a low and stable level;
in June, Bank Indonesia announced a switch to a one-month interest rate as its
intermediate target in a move toward fully-fledged formal inflation targeting.
Economic growth has gained momentum, with real GDP increasing by 5.1 percent in
2004 and 6½ percent in the first quarter of 2005, driven by private investment and
consumption. Inflation has edged up, reaching 7.4 percent (y/y) in June this year
reflecting partly the increase in domestic fuel prices in March, but also the vigorous
domestic demand and a depreciation of the exchange rate. Following a reduction in the
fiscal deficit to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2004, the fiscal accounts registered a
surplus in the first half of 2005, largely reflecting underspending compared with
allocations. The external current account surplus has been on a downward trend in
relation to GDP, as demand for imports of capital goods and raw materials has picked
up alongside the overall economy, while the oil import bill has risen.
Against this generally favorable background, financial markets have come under some
pressure in early 2005. The exchange rate has been on a depreciating trend and has
recently been trading at three-year lows against the U.S. dollar. Responding to these
pressures, Bank Indonesia has intervened in the foreign exchange market, increased
interest rates, and taken measures to limit the scope for short-term capital flows.
In order to strengthen the financial sector, Bank Indonesia has made encouraging
strides in risk-based supervision and upgrading of banking regulations toward
international standards, and has introduced new asset classification rules. Moreover,
recent management changes at top state-owned banks are expected to help improve
governance. The authorities have also started scaling back the blanket guarantee on
bank deposits introduced during the crisis, replacing it with a limited deposit insurance
scheme. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia in June announced new regulations to guide the
strengthening and consolidation of the banking system. At the same time, efforts are
being made to bolster the supervision of insurance companies, finance companies,
and mutual funds.
The new government is focused on improving the investment climate. The efforts in this
regard are centered on simplifying the regulatory framework, preparing a new
streamlined investment law, reducing corruption, strengthening the legal system,
and increasing infrastructure investment. The authorities have established a Corruption
Eradication Commission, and various government agencies are investigating cases of
irregularities and corruption, including in state banks and in local government offices.
Finally, agreement has been reached in principle between Exxon Mobil and Pertamina
with regard to the development of the large Cepu oilfield.
Economic growth is projected to reach 6 percent this year, before increasing further to
6-7 percent annually over the medium term, assuming that the government’s economic
policies are implemented as planned. Inflation would come down to around 6 percent
next year and converge to trading partner country rates over the medium term. Fiscal
consolidation is expected to continue, with the government debt ratio declining gradually
towards 30 percent of GDP, reducing debt-related vulnerabilities. While the external

-3-

current account is projected to turn into deficit as domestic demand remains strong, net
capital inflows would lead to an increase in international reserves, helping to maintain a
comfortable external position.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continuing improvement in the overall performance of
the Indonesian economy in recent years, which has been manifested in the considerable
progress toward achieving macroeconomic stability, lowering public debt, restoring the
health of the banking system, and reducing vulnerabilities. Going forward, Indonesia
nevertheless faces key policy challenges in placing the economy on an even stronger
footing for economic growth in order to create jobs and reduce widespread poverty.
Directors accordingly welcomed the adoption of the medium-term economic strategy,
which signals the new government’s determination to use its political mandate to place
Indonesia on a high and sustainable growth path, by pursuing sound macroeconomic
policies, reducing the still-present economic vulnerabilities, and strengthening and
completing the institutional and structural reforms required for a lasting improvement in
the investment climate.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts toward reconstruction in
Indonesia’s tsunami-affected areas. They noted the importance of rapid implementation
of reconstruction projects, while also emphasizing the need for donors to follow through
on the financing pledges they have made. In this context, Directors welcomed the
establishment of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund and the authorities’ commitment to
transparent allocation and effective use of international aid.
Further fiscal consolidation over the medium tem is a key priority in the authorities’
strategy to help further reduce the government debt burden and lay the basis for
sustained economic growth. Directors accordingly welcomed the revised 2005 budget,
which aims to further reduce the fiscal deficit. Achievement of this target will require
careful budget management. Achievement of the budgetary targets in 2006 will require
careful consideration of the revenue implications of the tax policy package under way.
In this context, Directors advised caution in expanding tax exemptions, and several saw
scope for reducing current tax exemptions. Directors also stressed the importance of
further steps to mobilize non-oil revenues. Directors noted that unexpected further rises
in international oil prices will call for continued budget vigilance. They commended the
steps taken by the authorities toward reducing domestic fuel subsidies, and the
allocation of these savings to spending for vulnerable population groups.
Several Directors recommended further progress toward market-based prices and away
from fuel subsidies, in view of their still significant strain on the budget, along with
continuing efforts to minimize the impact on vulnerable groups.
Directors noted the importance of continuing fiscal structural reforms in order to enhance
the quality and sustainability of fiscal adjustment. In this context, they welcomed the
authorities’ intention to improve tax administration and emphasized the need to
strengthen governance and modernize customs administration. Directors cautioned
against introducing a tax amnesty, which could undermine revenue performance. On the

-4-

spending side, Directors noted that the planned reorientation of spending toward capital
and social expenditure should bring tangible results in terms of creating jobs and
improving productive capacity. Key for reducing debt-related vulnerabilities will be
careful management of government liabilities, including the adoption of a debt
management strategy and a consolidated debt management unit; a framework for
limiting contingent liabilities; and the inclusion of the many extra-budgetary funds into
the budget. Directors applauded the authorities’ intention to strengthen fiscal soundness
at the regional level, and emphasized the importance of maintaining fiscal control as the
decentralization framework is implemented. In particular, Directors encouraged the
authorities to ensure the coherence of regulations at different levels of government,
and to make sub-national borrowing contingent upon the establishment of appropriate
safeguards and regular fiscal reporting.
Directors commended Bank Indonesia for its focus on anchoring inflation at a low level,
and the steps taken to tighten monetary policy to ensure that inflation is contained.
While recognizing the authorities’ concern that significantly higher interest rates might
affect economic growth, a number of Directors suggested that further tightening may still
be desirable in view of the recent pressures on inflation and the exchange rate.
Directors welcomed the recent announcement to use the interest rate as the
intermediate target for monetary policy as part of the move toward formal inflation
targeting. Convincing use of the new interest rate policy will help maintain stability and
enhance confidence. More generally, Directors recognized the importance of a credible
and transparent monetary policy for effective inflation targeting, and welcomed the steps
being taken to put in place the operational and institutional pre-requisites for this
monetary policy regime. Indonesia’s flexible exchange rate system has helped protect
the economy against shocks and will help the functioning of the new monetary
framework. Directors recommended that Bank Indonesia limit interventions in the foreign
exchange market to those needed to counter short-term volatility.
Directors noted the banking system’s improved performance in asset quality and
profitability, as well as the progress made in banking supervision. At the same time,
they stressed that it will be important to move forward with further improvements in
prudential regulations and strengthened risk management, especially against the
background of higher interest rates that may put pressure on margins going forward.
In this context, Directors welcomed the ongoing work toward introducing risk-based
supervision and improving governance Directors also supported the authorities’
objective of further bank consolidation, as well as their intention to allow the process to
be market based and ensure that the merged banks are sound. Several Directors noted
that the privatization of state banks over time would enhance the efficiency and
soundness of the banking sector. With respect to the financial sector safety net,
Directors welcomed the progress so far, and noted the importance of establishing the
deposit insurance fund and putting in place the remaining elements of the financial
sector safety net without delay. This will help maintain confidence in the banking system
as the blanket guarantee is phased out. Several Directors encouraged the authorities to
undertake a Financial Sector Assessment Program, which should help the authorities
improve their understanding of financial sector vulnerabilities and address them.
Directors welcomed the progress in enhancing the anti-money laundering regime in

-5-

Indonesia, which has led to its removal from the list of Non-Cooperative Countries and
Territories maintained by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and encouraged the
authorities to continue careful monitoring.
Directors underlined the importance of steps to improve the investment climate,
especially against the background of the recent declines in some of Indonesia’s export
market shares and the relative attractiveness of other investment destinations.
Accordingly, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to improve the investment
climate. They commended in particular the recent steps taken to address corruption,
to attract investment in the oil and gas sector, and to put in place a new investment law.
It is acknowledged that dealing with deep-seated structural impediments to investment
will take time. Directors nevertheless noted the importance of taking further decisive
steps to improve the functioning of the legal system, simplify the regulatory framework,
strengthen infrastructure, improve labor market flexibility, and bolster tax administration.
Actions in all these areas will be helpful for enhancing productivity, improving external
competitiveness, and boosting foreign direct investment flows. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to maintaining Indonesia’s open trade regime, while some
Directors suggested that the country phase out its import restrictions on sugar and rice.

Statement by Hooi Eng Phang, Executive Director for Indonesia
and Made Sukada, Alternate Executive Director
July 18, 2005

1.
On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we would like to thank the staff for a wellwritten and excellent set of reports. The selected issues paper is particularly useful since it
has provided in-depth analysis and policy recommendations on key areas of the
government’s growth strategy. The authorities are appreciative of the extensive technical
assistance and policy advice received from the Fund which has contributed to the favorable
economic performance and the success of structural reforms in recent years.
2.
The Indonesian authorities would like to take this opportunity to thank the members
of the Board for their longstanding support and constructive comments expressed during the
last Post Program Monitoring discussions held in February this year. They particularly took
note of the suggestion to reduce the fuel subsidies and to channel the savings to development
spending. The government has increased domestic fuel prices by an average of 30 percent,
effective March 1, 2005 and used the budget savings to support expenditure on education,
health, and rural development.
3.
The authorities are pleased to note in the staff report that the mission team fully
supports the Medium Term National Development Plan (RPJMN) for the period 2004-2009,
launched by the new administration as part of the government’s efforts to maintain
sustainable growth. One of the main objectives of the RPJMN is to reduce the incidence of
poverty from 16.6 percent to 8.2 percent and the unemployment rate from 9.7 percent to 5.1
percent over the period 2004-2009. The authorities are well aware that macroeconomic
stability and rigorous structural reforms are required for sustained growth. Improving the
investment climate and export competitiveness are also essential.
RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
4.
Growth in the Indonesian economy increased over the last three years, reaching 5.1
percent in 2004. The underlying components of growth also showed a more sustainable
trend, marked by the increasing role of private investment and exports. Investments
rebounded to 15.7 percent after three years of sluggish growth, exports increased by 8.5
percent while consumption growth remained robust at 4.6 percent.
5.
Inflation rose to 6.4 percent but was still within the authorities’ target range while the
exchange rate has remained stable in 2004. Indonesia’s current account balance remained in
surplus, albeit lower than last year, due primarily to substantial increases in imports of
capital goods and raw materials on the back of a pick-up in domestic production. Exports
reached a historic high of $72.2 billion last year, boosted by strong sales of palm oil,
electronics, clothing, coal, and tin but high world oil prices only had a slight impact on the
trade balance since Indonesia also imports oil for domestic consumption. Foreign exchange
reserves were $ 36.3 billion at end-2004, equivalent to a safe level of 4.8 months of imports
or 195 percent of short-term external debt. The forex reserves declined to about $33.9 billion

-2by end-June 2005, attributable mainly to debt service payments and the authorities’
intervention to smoothen exchange rate volatility.
6.
The fiscal position improved amidst increasing world oil prices which caused fuel
subsidies to increase since the government had not adjusted domestic fuel prices in 2004. The
banking sector performed favorably with loans increasing in line with the rebound in
business activity. More importantly, bank financing to the micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSME) increased. Overall, the loan to deposit ratio (LDR) rose to 50.0 percent
at end-2004 and 51.3 percent in April 2005 but it is still well below the level before the Asian
crisis.
7.
The prospects for the Indonesian economy are promising, driven by buoyant
investment and exports. The economy is projected to grow at 6 percent in 2005, which is a
conservative projection, given that the y-o-y GDP growth in the first quarter of 2005 was
already 6.4 percent. Growth is projected to increase by 6-6.5 percent in 2006 and 6 to 7
percent over the medium term. The growth performance in the first quarter of 2005 indicated
that investment, including FDI, and export growth were relatively high in 2005, underpinned
by improving business sentiments. The Jakarta Stock Exchange also reached a new high with
the index reaching 1080 at the end of the first quarter this year and stabilized towards end
June.
MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
8.
For 2005, upward pressure on inflation stemmed from the increase in domestic fuel
prices and the depreciation of the rupiah. In the first quarter of 2005, inflation rose to 8.81
percent (y-o-y) compared with 5.11 percent over the same period last year and declined in the
following months. The rupiah depreciated by 5.3 percent in the first semester 2005 as
demand for foreign exchange increased to service debt payments and imports, particularly
the imports of oil by PERTAMINA for domestic consumption. Bank Indonesia (BI) shifted
the monetary policy stance from an accommodative to a tightening bias beginning Q3, 2004.
Further monetary tightening ensued with several increases in the SBI rates from 7.43 percent
in February to 8.25 percent as at end June to contain the second-round effects of the increase
in domestic gasoline prices. Under the new monetary policy framework, the interest rate (the
BI rate) has been set by BI at 8.5 percent early this month for third quarter-2005.
9.
To support the effectiveness of monetary policy operations, a new monetary
instrument, Fine Tuning Operations (FTO), was introduced by BI in April 2005. Under the
FTO arrangement, BI can take the initiative to absorb liquidity with maturity up to 14 days.
BI also tightened prudential regulations to reduce volatility in the foreign exchange market
by temporarily adjusting the existing bank regulation on the Net Open Position from 30
percent to 20 percent, effective April 26, 2005. Foreign exchange intervention was also
carried out cautiously by the central bank and was limited only to smoothing short-term
exchange rate volatility. The government is considering changing the mechanism of
transferring the oil subsidy to PERTAMINA from rupiah into foreign exchange in order to
reduce the demand for foreign exchange in the market.

-310.
In consequence, inflation declined in the following months since March and stabilized
in June. The volatility of the rupiah exchange rate was subsequently reduced. Inflation is
estimated to reach 7.5 percent for 2005 and return to a declining path in 2006. BI is
monitoring monetary developments very closely and stands ready to further tighten monetary
policy to ensure that inflation is contained.
11.
Bank Indonesia has further strengthened the monetary policy framework by formally
shifting to interest rate targeting, as part of the steps to full inflation targeting (IT), effective
July of this year. IT has implications on the conduct of monetary policy, including the use of
the interest rate--called the BI-rate-- as the operational target, a forward looking decision
making process, a more transparent communications strategy, and strengthened policy
coordination with the government. It is expected that the new framework will enhance the
credibility of monetary policy and facilitate the achievement of the 3 percent inflation target
over the medium term.
12.
As the staff report underscores, the flexible exchange rate system has served the
economy well. The authorities are committed to maintaining the system since it will help to
protect the economy against shocks.
FISCAL POLICY
13.
The Indonesian authorities are fully committed to strengthening fiscal consolidation
and debt reduction while recognizing the need for public investment in key infrastructure and
social projects over the medium term. The overall budget deficit has declined from 3.2
percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2004, with the external debt to GDP ratio
falling from 81 percent to 53 percent over the same period. In light of domestic and external
developments, particularly high world oil prices, the revised 2005 Budget was approved by
the Parliament in June. The authorities are committed to containing the overall deficit at 0.8
percent of GDP for 2005. The deficit will be financed by domestic sources, primarily through
the issuance of government bonds, proceeds from privatization and asset recovery. The debt
to GDP ratio is expected to decline further from 53 percent in 2004 to 48 percent in 2005 and
fall below 35 percent by 2009.
14.
The government is mindful of the need for measures to meet its deficit target of 0.8
percent in 2005. Tax administration reforms ---including intensification and strict
enforcement of tax and customs compliance-- are already underway and are now being
accelerated in order to increase tax revenues. The measures are expected to increase tax
collections in 2005, including 0.2 percent of GDP from non oil & gas income tax and 0.1
percent each from property tax, and excise tax. As noted by staff, the authorities are
finalizing a package of tax reforms aimed at improving non-oil tax revenues while
providing incentives for private investment. On the expenditure side, the tsunami disaster and
increasing world oil prices have resulted in public expenditure increasing substantially by
Rp.67.5 trillion from the initial budget of 2005, of which Rp.57.5 trillion is for fuel subsidies.
On a net basis, high world oil prices have only a slight positive impact on the budget since
the fuel subsidies increase as well. Oil production is expected to increase in the near term
since the final deal on a new oil field with estimated capacity of 170,000 barrels/day has been
agreed by the government in June.

-4BANKING SECTOR POLICY
15.
The Indonesian banking sector has been on a steady recovery path since the Asian
crisis. Banks have gradually resumed their financial intermediary role with improving capital
bases. Banks are well-capitalized with capital asset ratios (CARs) far above 8 percent while
profitability has remained strong, reflecting strong loan growth and increased efficiency.
Gross NPLs declined from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 5.6 percent by April 2005. Banks are also
adequately capitalized, reflecting their improved capacity to mitigate market risk.
16.
Bank Indonesia is making progress in efforts to strengthen supervisory oversight of
the banking system. In 2004, BI launched the Indonesian Banking Architecture (API), a blueprint that maps the direction of the banking sector in the next 10 to 15 years. All banks are
required to meet a set of minimum performance criteria by 2010, including minimum CAR
of 10 percent and a capital base of at least Rp.100 billion. On June 30, BI unveiled plans to
accelerate bank consolidation and set eligibility criteria for key banks (called the anchor
banks) to acquire smaller banks. Under the new policies, an anchor bank must meet, at least
in the preceding three years, the following conditions: CAR of above 12 percent; tier-one
capital of a minimum 6 percent; loan-to- deposit ratio (LDR) of above 50 percent; minimum
annual credit growth of 22 percent; nonperforming loans of below 5 percent; and return on
assets (ROA)of a minimum 1.5 percent. The authorities emphasize that qualifying banks
should ensure sound credit expansion.
17.
Progress has also been achieved at the supervisory and regulatory level, paving the
way for more risk-based supervision. At the regulatory level, additional prudential
regulations have been introduced. These include:
•
•
•

incorporation of market risk in the calculation of CAR for banks with larger trading
portfolios;
new asset quality valuation rules that contain more stringent classification and provision
requirements for earning and non-earning assets; and
Higher statutory reserve requirements for banks with larger deposit bases.

Further reforms include the introduction of a financial safety net scheme while a gradual
phasing out of the blanket guarantee scheme will be fully implemented by March 2007. The
credit bureau commenced operations in April 2005, requiring all commercial banks and
credit card operators to update information on all borrowers on a regular basis.
18.
Steady progress has also been made in the implementation of the anti-money
laundering regime since Indonesia’s removal from the list of Non-Cooperative Countries and
Territories (NCCTs) by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in February 2005. With the
President signing the bill on the Mutual Legal Assistance Law, the legal framework for antimoney laundering will be improved. The bill has been submitted to the Parliament for
approval.

-5STRUCTURAL REFORMS
19.
The authorities recognize the importance of intensifying structural reforms in order to
encourage private investment and sustain growth. Structural reforms are ongoing in a wide
range of areas as elaborated in paragraph 24 of the staff report. Particular attention has been
given to eradicating corruption, enhancing labor market flexibility and improving
infrastructure through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Efficiency, transparency, and
accountability in public expenditure management are also being improved with the support of
the World Bank Program Loan.
20.
One of the first measures adopted by the new Government has been the requirement
that all cabinet ministers sign a contract committing themselves to maintaining high
standards of integrity. All ministers also have to submit their personal asset declarations with
the KPK (Commission for the Eradication of Corruption) for verification. New procedures
have already been put in place to suspend government officials if they are under investigation
for alleged corruption. Steady progress has been made in recent months by the Supreme
Audit Agency, the KPK (which became operational in 2004), and the Attorney General in
addressing governance problems through strict enforcement procedures in various
institutions. The corruption charges brought against top officials of government agencies and
a state related enterprise have sent an important signal to the public about the strong
commitment of the new government to the eradication of corruption.
21.
The selected issues paper (Chapter VII) has provided insights into Indonesia’s labor
market rigidities. The authorities recognize and fully agree with staff that labor market
inflexibility is one of the main causes of rising unemployment in recent years. A number of
measures are being undertaken in support of the government’s medium-term program to
halve the unemployment rate by 2009. In this context, the establishment of tripartite councils,
which bring together employers, labor unions and the government, acknowledges the
importance of labor productivity when considering minimum wage increases. The new
government is also strongly committed to reprioritizing public spending by redirecting poorly
targeted subsidies to health and education. This is essential for improving education levels
and labor force skills. In addition, the government has finalized the bill on the Social Security
system which would provide the basis for scaling back statutory severance payments.
22.
In an effort to support PPPs, the government has launched the Infrastructure Road
Map 2004-2009 outlining the regulatory framework of PPPs. Within the infrastructure
development framework, four important government regulations (PPs) have been issued on
electricity (PP 3/2005), toll road (PP 15/2005), water piping system (PP 16/2005), and most
recently the regulation on land acquisitions for public use (PP 36/2005). The main
components of the new regulations include clarifying and emphasizing the government’s role
only as a regulator; strengthening the legal framework for market determined price setting
based on cost recovery; establishment of governing bodies; and clear and transparent
procedures for land acquisition for public use. The authorities have indeed taken into account
the Fund’s advice during the last Board meeting, particularly on ensuring that the PPPs
strategy does not create unfunded liabilities.

-623.
The government has offered 20 projects through an open tender system during AprilJune, including 8 toll roads, 1 power generator, 1 railway, and 3 airports, among others.
Eighteen consortiums were shortlisted in the first prequalification selection. It is expected
that some projects will materialize this year and will facilitate employment creation.
24.
Structural reforms are also underway to address the complex issues of efficiency,
transparency, and accountability in public financial management (PFM). Significant
accomplishments have been achieved over the last two years through reforms supported by
the World Bank loan and technical assistance provided by the Fund. Political consensus has
been gained on a new legal framework leading to updated laws on State Finances, State
Treasury, State Planning and State Audit in 2003-2004. These laws now provide an adequate
architecture to modernize public resource management and oversight. The roles and
responsibilities of BAPPENAS (The National Planning Agency) and the Ministry of Finance
have also been clarified.
25.
A new budget preparation process has been introduced, beginning 2005, to enhance
budget transparency and good governance. Planning and budgeting have been integrated by
linking ministerial work plans with budgets. The government presented to Parliament a more
transparent 2005 fiscal budget with identifiable sectoral allocations. Furthermore, budget
execution is being rapidly modernized and efforts are being devoted to streamlining the
disbursement process. A new law on procurement is also being drafted while accounting and
reporting systems for public resource management are being improved and implemented in
phases. The government has presented to Parliament, for the first time, a consolidated
Government Balance Sheet for 2004, marking a significant achievement in accountability.
Other Issues
26.
The Government’s strong commitment to improving governance is also being
adopted in the program of rehabilitation and reconstruction of Aceh and Nias. A Master Plan
for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias was issued setting out the main
principles to address the social, economic, institutional and financial needs of both regions
while a special government unit, the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency (BRR), was
set-up to implement the rehabilitation process. In response to the government’s commitment
to good governance, several donor partners have, together with the government and civil
society, established a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). All activities of MDTF will be
consistent with and guided by the government’s master plan under the BRR’s oversight. The
authorities are thankful to donors for their financial support in the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias.
27.
The authorities’ efforts to strengthen multilateral and regional trade arrangements are
underway. Indonesia has also made a commitment, together with the ASEAN + 3 countries,
to reduce import tariffs in stages as part of its commitment to pursue an open trade policy.
28.
As noted by the staff, Indonesia’s economic data are considered adequate for
surveillance purposes. Nonetheless, the authorities have taken steps to further improve data
quality and to follow up on recent ROSC recommendations.

-729.
The Indonesian authorities remain committed to transparency and consent to the
publication of all staff reports.
