STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Background: Liberia recorded strong macroeconomic performance under a three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement—successfully completed in May 2012—but
poverty remains pervasive, further reforms are warranted to promote broad based
growth, and UN forces are still required to underpin social stability.
Article IV consultation and program: The last Article IV consultation was concluded
on December 8, 2010. The Executive Board completed the 8th and last review under
the Extended Credit Facility on May 9, 2012.
Outlook and risks: The short- to medium-term outlook remains favorable, although
subject to considerable risks. Following resumption of iron ore exports in 2011, real
GDP growth is estimated at close to 9 percent in 2012, supported by strong growth in
the mining sector and expansionary fiscal policy to accommodate a scaling up of
infrastructure investment. Adverse movements in the terms of trade and inflationary
pressures from international food and oil prices pose risks in the short term. The
authorities are requesting an Extended Credit Facility to buttress economic stability
while supporting their new poverty reduction and growth strategy.
Staff views: Staff recommends the conclusion of the 2012 Article IV consultation and
approval of the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility. The
authorities have consented to publication of this report following the completion of the
review.

THE CONTEXT
1.
Liberia made strong macroeconomic gains under a just-completed Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) Arrangement, but macroeconomic stability has been hard won, development
challenges are daunting, and poverty remains pervasive. Following an initial post-conflict
boost, economic growth has averaged 7 percent a year since 2009 (mostly from non-mining
activities before the resumption of iron ore exports in late 2011), while inflation has been largely
contained at or near single digits (Figure 1).1 Tax revenue has steadily increased as a share of
GDP, the economy has rapidly monetized, and external debt has been reduced significantly,
thanks to substantial debt relief. Nonetheless, Liberia remains a poor country, with massive
infrastructure gaps and large development needs. Poverty is pervasive (at 84 percent of the
population),2 and Liberia ranks near the bottom of the UN’s Human Development Index (HDI)3
and is unlikely to meet many of its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (Table 1 and Figure 2).
Job creation is slow, and the economy is unable to absorb the large number of youth and
ex-combatants. Private sector development is further constrained by limited access to financial
services and a weak credit environment. The economy also remains heavily dollarized (85 percent
of commercial bank deposits), and monetary policy plays a limited role in economic
management.4
2.
Liberia remains a fragile state, with weak institutions. The sociopolitical situation is
gradually improving in the wake of the second national elections in November 2011, but the
country remains dependent on UN troops and police (UNMIL) to underpin security. The
re-election of President Johnson Sirleaf has been endorsed by international elections observers
as transparent and fair, and the UN recently approved a gradual drawdown of its peacekeeping
operations (excluding UN police) from the current level of 8,000 troops to about 4,000 by 2015.
But building domestic security capacity to undertake some critical security functions transferred
from UNMIL is an ongoing challenge. Governance remains a serious concern, and Liberia still
ranks high (91 out of 164 countries) in Transparency International's (TI's) latest global corruption
barometer of the most corrupt nations.5

Liberia is ranked 182 out of 187 countries in the 2011 HDI.

Liberia has been heavily dollarized since its founding in 1847. Both the LD and the U.S. dollar are legal tender in
Liberia. The de jure exchange rate policy is a managed float.

Much more needs to be done to address Liberia’s significant post-conflict
development needs. The government has set an ambitious agenda to
MEFP ¶ 8
transform Liberia into a middle-income country by 2030, the underlying
theme of their second Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRS2)—the Agenda for
Transformation—and has requested a successor ECF arrangement to support its program
(Box 1).6 The strategy focuses on achieving accelerated broad-based growth through scaling up
investment in infrastructure and human capital, raising agricultural productivity, and fostering
food security, employment creation, and deepening financial markets—areas where progress fell
short under the first poverty reduction strategy (PRS1).
4.
Staff sees merit in a successor ECF arrangement. A successor program would help
safeguard macroeconomic stability while bolstering donor support for public investment and
social programs. The authorities’ have strengthened their policies, aligning them with advice
from the last Article IV consultation and subsequent discussions under the previous ECF
arrangement (Box 2). At the same time, there are several key administrative reforms on the
government’s reform agenda that would benefit from continued close IMF engagement. There is
also a medium-term need to build up reserve coverage to cope with global market uncertainties,
but policy space is limited given the need to direct resources toward infrastructure and priority
social spending.

Box 1. Liberia: The Agenda for Transformation (2012–17)
The Agenda for Transformation is a five-year development plan that underpins
Vision 2030 to achieve middle-income status by 2030. The plan focuses on investments in five
strategic pillars—at an estimated cost of $3.3 billion over the five-year period—to increase
productivity, boost economic growth, and improve social inclusion, particularly among youth.
The pillars are


Economic transformation, particularly rehabilitating the hydropower plant, roads, and
ports, and updating information and communications technology;



Human development especially education and health;



Peace, security, and the rule of law;



Governance and public institutions to modernize the public sector and enhance
transparency and accountability; and



Cross-cutting issues focussed on youth skills, child protection, gender equality, and
human rights.

Financing the investment program


The government plans to cover 12–15 percent of investments with its own resources and
is planning a pledging donors’ conference in late 2012 to secure loans and grants.

Box 2. Liberia: Performance Under the Previous ECF Arrangement and Lessons Learned
Performance under the first ECF arrangement (2008–12) was strong. All quantitative targets
were met since the second review, and most of the structural reform agenda was implemented.
Improved policies underlie this performance, aligned with advice from the 2010 Article IV
Consultation and the program discussions. Prudent fiscal policy and strengthened public
financial management contributed to a near doubling of government revenue, resumption of
direct budget support, and initiation of significant infrastructure development projects without
accumulation of expenditure arrears. Monetary policy focused on accumulating reserves, which
sizably outperformed expectations during the program. Financial policies focused on
strengthening the banking system and promoting intermediation.
Despite the progress, weaknesses remain in program implementation. These include
significant delays in budget passage and implementation; slow pace of execution of
donor-financed infrastructure projects; persistent weaknesses in the banking sector, including
access to credit; and little or no progress in reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or
tackling poor governance.
Key lessons from the first ECF arrangement have been incorporated in the successor ECF
arrangement. These include linking the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to
priorities in infrastructure development, security, and service delivery, in line with the PRS2, and
aligning the MTEF with donor support; linking resource revenue to priority investment spending;
focusing public investment initially on a few macro critical projects pending improved
implementation capacity; customizing technical assistance to support policy design and
program implementation; and implementing a more flexible debt management framework to
support multiyear investment programs.

food and fuel prices on consumption. Following spikes
in food and oil prices in 2011 and early 2012, U.S. dollar-denominated inflation declined to under
4 percent by end-June and is expected to remain in single digits through end-2012.
6.
Trade has expanded, but the overall external position remains stable (Table 3).7
The trade deficit has widened in 2012 because of higher concession-financed capital imports and
rising food and fuel import prices, offsetting the rise in iron ore exports. Reserve coverage has
remained relatively stable at about 2½ months of imports. The Liberian dollar (LD), which was
volatile in the first half of 2012, mirroring uncertainty on terms of trade and foreign inflows, has
stabilized since June.
7.
The overall fiscal deficit including grants for FY 2011/12
MEFP ¶ 7
(July–June), at 3.2 percent of GDP, was larger than expected (Table 4).
This reflects delays in collecting large one-off payments from iron ore concessions—which more
than offset strong performance in trade taxes—and overruns in current and capital spending
(including higher-than-budgeted spending on wages and salaries for new teachers).8 Capital
expenditure was higher than previously estimated, reflecting the execution of unbudgeted
projects including the dredging of a port and road rehabilitation. Expenditure overruns were
financed domestically through drawing down government deposits and direct borrowing from
the central bank.
8.
The expansion in the financial system is decelerating because credit to the private
sector has tightened on account of increasing bank fragilities. Broad money growth has
nearly halved on account of a slowdown in bank credit (Table 5 and Figure 4). The financial sector
has further weakened owing to high credit risk, increasingly high non-performing loans, and
still-weak bank profitability.9

7

Foreign inflow breakdown was revised significantly on account of re-classification of some financing to the iron
ore sector from foreign direct investment to borrowing consistent with concession agreements.

8

An anticipated decline in trade taxes resulting from adoption of GATT valuation and the first step of adopting
the regional common external tariff did not materialize.

MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF MAINTAINING
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY WHILE SCALING UP PUBLIC
INVESTMENT
9.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on policies to consolidate
macroeconomic stabilization and lay the basis for accelerated and diversified growth. The
authorities and staff agreed that achieving high, broad-based growth and job creation in the next
decade or so will require a significant increase in infrastructure and social investments, aligned

production capacity in the only currently operating

macroeconomic impact of higher mining production, especially on revenue and export receipts.
Following the one-off slow down in 2012, non-mining activity is projected to normalize and
increase steadily over the medium term driven primarily by construction and services. Inflation is
expected to moderate to 6–7 percent by end-2012. The external current account deficit is
expected to widen further in 2012–14 owing to investment-related imports, and then narrow
over the medium term as these imports unwind and exports rise. Reserve coverage would remain
stable—albeit low—at about 2½ months of imports (Box 3).11

Box 3. Liberia: Reserve Adequacy
International reserves are an important source of
self-insurance against external shocks. Liberia is
vulnerable to a variety of exogenous shocks stemming from
sharp swings in terms of trade, weakly diversified exports,
and reliance on international trade to import large quantities
of essential goods. In addition, as a largely dollarized
economy, reserves may also be needed to provide liquidity
to the banking sector in the event of capital flight.
Commonly used metrics that focus on import cover,
broad money, and model-based estimates provide some
limited guidance on reserve adequacy. Theoretical and
empirical analysis on determining the optimal or desired
level of precautionary reserves is limited, particularly for
dollarized economies. In Liberia, reserves remain below the
traditional rule of three months of imports, even when
UNMIL services and iron ore-related imports are taken into
account. They are also low compared to other low-income
dollarized countries, and other ECF arrangement countries in
the region. Broad money is a less firmly based indicator in
the literature, but can capture the risk of outflows by
domestic residents and the potential need for bank support
in or after a crisis. However, this vulnerability may be limited
in Liberia because of the foreign ownership of banks and the
non-systemic nature of the banking system. Using this
measure, reserve coverage of broad money in Liberia is close
to peer countries and above the 20 percent of broad money
rule of thumb.

in the probability and cost of a crisis, given country-specific
fundamentals and shocks. However, the methodology is particularly sensitive to the assumption
on the opportunity cost of holding reserves, which can range between two and six percent. Given
the large investment needs in Liberia, the opportunity cost of holding reserves is assumed to be
on the higher end of the estimates. On balance, this suggests that three months of imports is
adequate reserve coverage in the medium term and would align Liberia with peer countries.

11.
Liberia’s main risks are a protracted slow growing global economy and adverse
movements in terms of trade (Table 7). Sluggish global demand for commodity exports—
especially iron ore—poses risks to Liberian exports and may delay FDI, with negative impacts on
the economy, the current account, and the fiscal balance (Figure 6). Downside risks come from
weak public investment absorptive capacity. While Liberia will continue to fully pass through
increases in fuel prices and maintain reduced import tariffs to mitigate high food prices, coping
with further adverse external price movements could pose a challenge. In particular, Liberia is
vulnerable to further increases in the import price of rice—the staple food in Liberia—although
rice prices have so far not moved significantly in world markets. The authorities noted that
importers are encouraged to hold six months of rice in the country, although the monitoring
system relies on self-reporting by private agents. In an exogenous shock, the authorities would
seek additional rice grants from donors. They are also evaluating existing interventions, including
the school feeding program, and assessing new options to protect the most vulnerable while
minimizing potential fiscal costs. On the upside, a pickup in iron ore and forestry production,
positive developments in petroleum exploration, and high-return public investments present
significant opportunities.

12.
The authorities agreed to build reserves to three months of imports. They agreed
with staff’s assessment that this level of import coverage strikes a
MEFP ¶ 32
balance between building buffers to contain external risks and limiting
the high opportunity cost of accumulating reserves given the high yield
on public investment considering the massive infrastructure gaps. This level of reserves also
leaves a margin for foreign exchange market intervention to address excess exchange rate
volatility. Over the longer term, reserves accumulation beyond three months may be desireable,
because the opportunity costs of holding reserves declines once the large investments are
completed, and reserves will build confidence in the financial system as the economy continues
to monetize.
Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on the economic outlook,
although they are targeting stronger growth over the longer term. PRS2 calls for growth of
about 8½ percent a year over the longer term to achieve middle-income status by 2030.
Achieving and maintaining this high growth rate, however, is challenging and will require fully
securing the estimated $3 billion in financing needed to implement PRS2—some $2 billion above
the baseline projections—including a substantial crowding-in of the private sector. Staff and the
authorities discussed policies needed to remove bottlenecks to achieving higher growth,
including improvements in competitiveness, diversification of the economy, especially
agriculture, and execution of public investment projects.12 Staff analysis found improved
efficiency of public investments can have a significant impact on growth (Box 4).

12

Legal, institutional and managerial bottlenecks hamper selection and implementation of public investment
projects. These bottlenecks include weaknesses in prioritizing high-return projects, conducting feasibility and
pre-feasibility studies, monitoring the project investment cycle, and coordinating efforts of the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and implementing ministries. Project execution could also benefit from broadening the list of
construction companies to include non-resident firms and pre-qualifying them; limiting the number of projects
allocated to a single contractor; and pooling similar small projects.

executed. A dynamic economic model, calibrated to Liberia
specifics, was used to estimate the economic return from
higher public investment relative to steady-state trend growth, as well as the impact of improving
project efficiency.1 Starting from Liberia’s low base, an average increase of 5 percentage points of GDP
a year in investment in seven years contributes to an approximately 1 percentage point increase in the
annual growth rate of real per capita income on average over ten years. The growth effect peaks 3 to
4 years after the initial investment and then gradually declines over time returning to trend growth of
3 percent in per capita terms. The estimate assumes an efficiency rate of public investment of around
60 percent.2 Assuming an improvement in the efficiency rate to 80 percent, consistent with improved
project selection and strengthened execution capacity, real per capita income growth could
potentially increase by an additional half percentage point over the medium term. On the other hand,
the same amount of investment with a lower efficiency rate of 20 percent would result in lower
growth over the longer term. Getting to higher growth faster, in turn, improves Liberia’s debt
dynamics. This shows the critical need for stepped-up efforts to tackle bottlenecks to project
implementation. The exercise, however, has some caveats, and the estimates should be seen as an
approximation rather than as a forecast.

B. Challenges: Managing Liberia’s Natural Resource Wealth
14.
Over the longer term, proper management of revenue from natural resources will
be important to support the development agenda.13 While iron
ore-related revenue—estimated at around 1.1 percent of GDP or 4 percent of government
revenue in 2012—is not expected to have a significant fiscal or macroeconomic impact in the
near term, it is projected to rise over the medium term as more concessions begin production.14
There is also potential for one-off windfalls related to petroleum exploration. Considering the
potential for strong mining revenue, staff encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to
establish a fiscal framework for managing this windfall, including measures to (i) build buffers to
cope with export price volatility; (ii) smooth spending and avoid boom-bust cycles; and
(iii) channel resources toward high-return public investment and other priority spending aligned
with the PRS2.
15.
Liberia has an adequate tax
code for taxing the mining sector,
but concession agreements have
ad hoc terms. Staff estimates of the
impact of comparative fiscal terms on
the only currently producing iron ore
mine show that the revised Liberia
Revenue Code (LRC) yields returns
comparable to international
standards, but tax breaks in existing
iron ore concessions have limited
potential fiscal returns. If these
concessions come up for
renegotiation, the authorities should
aim to harmonize the terms with the LRC and avoid tax breaks. Moreover, the authorities need to
improve monitoring of production and financial statements of concessions to ensure that income
tax payments fully reflect operations.
16.
Concession agreements are transparent, but further actions are needed to improve
governance. Liberia complies with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI);
however, transparency and governance can still be improved in the petroleum sector. The
13

Three major iron ore concessions are yet to commence production. By 2015, iron ore is projected to account
for around 15 percent of GDP, exceeding all other commodity exports (rubber, palm oil, timber, other metals)
combined. Outside of iron ore, palm oil and forestry have significant potential to boost exports, revenue, and
growth although land disputes and capacity constraints are slowing implementation.

22 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

authorities need to put in place governance structures that would delineate the responsibilities
of regulation, oversight, and profit sharing in the petroleum sector, which are all currently held
by the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL). The authorities agreed with the staff’s
assessment and are planning to revise the Petroleum Act by mid-2013 to improve governance in
the sector. They will also update the fiscal regime to international best practices and have
requested IMF technical assistance.
17.
Some key concessions sectors have limited interaction with the non-concession
economy owing to the scarcity of skilled domestic labor. Rubber is the only concession sector
so far employing domestic labor on a significant scale. Improving education and training and
setting up local supply chains to serve the concessions may help make mineral sector growth
more broad based and inclusive. Activity in the palm oil sector has been bogged down by
sociopolitical challenges stemming from land disputes in the concession areas, but the sector
carries high potential for job creation because of labor-intensive production.

C. Boosting Competitiveness and Growth
18.
Continued strong reforms are needed to improve Liberia’s competitiveness and the
business environment. Given the high dollarization of the Liberian economy, the authorities
broadly agreed that public investment and structural reforms are needed to improve cost
competitiveness. The business climate remains constrained by continued high operating costs,
particularly related to energy and transportation, as well as weak administrative capacity, a
complicated and costly regulatory environment, uncertain property rights, and limited access to
domestic finance (Box 5 and Figure 7). Ongoing regional integration within the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS)15 and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession16
will help to reduce barriers to trade and improve competitiveness.

External Tariff (CET) remains stalled because of concerns from regional partners on compensatory measures to
cushion potential revenue losses.
16

Liberia requested membership in the WTO in 2007 and attended the first Working Party on WTO Accession in
July 2012. The authorities are seeking to achieve membership in five years and are pressing ahead on reforms,
particularly to reduce non-tariff barriers.

Box 5. Assessing External Stability and Competitiveness in Liberia
Liberia’s external sector remains stable, with current account developments dominated by
the activities in the concessions sector and aid flows. While the current account deficit is
expected to widen significantly over the next three years from capital imports related to the iron
ore sector, the expected acceleration of iron ore production and exports from 2015 will
contribute to a narrowing in the current account deficit over the longer term. Iron ore production
will also support a diversification of exports. (By 2015, iron ore exports are expected to rise to
more than 60 percent of total exports, replacing rubber as the main export). Although this may
help to offset idiosyncratic shocks in the rubber sector, commodity prices tend to move together
such that the export sector is still vulnerable to falls in commodity prices. Moreover, if
discovered, there is a potential for commercially viable oil which could have a significant impact
on exports. Nonetheless, the current account deficit remains high as a share of GDP over the
long term, especially given Liberia’s heavy dependence on imports to cover basic goods; and
there is need for ongoing adjustment,

The real effective exchange rate has
appreciated close to 25 percent since
mid-2008 reflecting higher domestic
inflation, particularly food and fuel prices.1
Given the high degree of dollarization in the
economy, the authorities broadly agreed with
the assessment that sustained policy measures
are needed to improve cost competitiveness.

Sources: Central Bank of Liberia and IMF staff calculations.

Structural bottlenecks are a key element holding back Liberia’s competitiveness. Liberia’s
overall rank in the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators improved four places in 2012, but
growth remains constrained by continued high operating costs of energy and transportation.
Electricity costs are the highest in sub-Saharan Africa because of reliance on batteries and
generators, while access to electricity is one of the lowest in the world at close to zero
compared with an average of 28.5 percent for sub-Saharan Africa. Sustained measures are also
needed to streamline the complicated and costly regulatory environment, harmonize
government business inspections, streamline payment of taxes, improve enforcement of
contracts, and improve access to finance.

1

Real exchange rate assessment in Liberia is limited by serious data limitations. Further, given the high degree of
dollarization, any real exchange rate overvaluation would need to be addressed by increasing productivity and
reducing domestic costs.

THE PILLARS OF AN ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
A. Three Key Pillars
19.
The proposed ECF arrangement would support the authorities’ program to
accelerate broad-based growth and poverty reduction, aligned with their PRS2, while
maintaining macroeconomic stability. Consistent with these objectives, discussions centered
on three key pillars


Creating fiscal space for higher capital spending by containing personnel costs and other
current transfers;



Strengthening the financial sector through reducing vulnerabilities and improving access
to credit; and



Underpinning growth with structural reforms to further improve public financial
management, governance, and the business environment.

B. Creating Fiscal Space for Scaling Up Investment
20.

The authorities agreed on the importance of
MEFP ¶s 12-13
streamlining current spending—particularly the wage bill—
and reallocating savings toward capital outlays. Liberia’s
wage bill, which is among the highest in the region both
Cross-country Public Sector Wage Bill Comparisson
as a percentage of GDP and of total spending, is
expected to decline by about 1 percent of GDP over the
medium term. The FY 2012/13 wage policy thus has no
salary increases and minimal net new hires. The
authorities are working to clean up the payroll by
eliminating ghost workers and duplicates—with an
estimated savings of 1.5 percent of GDP. Staff urged the
authorities to use such savings and any other unspent current allocations to pay for capital
spending, particularly given uncertainties surrounding the timing of external financing. However,
given political constraints, the authorities indicated that, if realized, the savings will be allocated
to increase salaries for all public servants. The authorities also introduced fiscal rules—starting in
the FY 2012/13 budget—that limit the share of the budget allocated to personnel costs (to no
more than 34 percent of the budget) and limit transfers of unspent investment allocations to
recurrent spending. Staff recommended more ambitious rules, in particular, by bringing
personnel costs to around 31 percent of the budget and reducing transfers from capital to
current spending to zero. The authorities plan to assess savings during the first half of the
2012/13 fiscal year to tighten the rules in subsequent budgets. Staff indicated that additional
savings could also be achieved during the current fiscal year by reducing discretionary spending
on food, travel, transportation, communications, and other special allowances.

C. Improving Monetary Policy and Deepening the Financial Sector
23.
In the dollarized economy, monetary policy will continue to
MEFP ¶31
play a limited role focused on containing Liberian dollar-denominated
inflation through the exchange rate. Liberian dollars remain important to the
vulnerable poor, and any sudden depreciation can have a severe impact on their purchasing
power and welfare. Thus, monetary policy will continue to aim at containing excessive volatility in
the exchange rate while aiming for a modest increase in the foreign exchange position.
24.
The absence of an anchor for monetary policy, however, remains a challenge. There
is no target or band for exchange rate policy or monetary interventions to anchor market
expectations on Liberian dollar inflation. At the same time, given the already high reserve
requirement (22 percent), the CBL’s monetary tool to mop up excess liquidity is limited to the
weekly foreign exchange auctions, but the use of this instrument is limited by reserve
accumulation objectives. While the planned launch of the local currency treasury bill market will
add a new liquidity management instrument, the authorities did not concur that an announced
monetary target would anchor expectations given the volatility in the shallow foreign exchange
market. They also see a need to maintain policy flexibility in addressing liquidity demands and
external shocks. The CBL will continue to improve its liquidity forecasting to strengthen policy
effectiveness though capacity constraints remain an obstacle. Staff reiterated the need for
improved collaboration and information sharing between the CBL and the Ministry of Finance
(MoF).
25.
The authorities expressed commitment to de-dollarization and plan to take steps to
strengthen demand for the LD. These include improving the quality and
MEFP ¶32
increasing the denomination of LD notes and de-dollarizing civil servant
wages and tax payments. The issuance of LD denominated treasury bills should
also help absorb excess Liberian dollar liquidity while increasing incentives for banks to hold
Liberian dollar deposits. Staff emphasized that strengthening the monetary framework including
through establishing a transparent anchor will help support confidence in the LD and potentially
de-dollarization. The authorities agreed that policies to strengthen the demand for the Liberian
dollar should be market based and serve to enhance the credibility of economic policy and
develop the financial market.

remains capitalized and liquid, but risks
are elevated stemming from high

profitability. System-wide capitalization
remains high though it has been eroded by

compliance with regulatory requirements by end-2012. The authorities introduced a commercial
court in 2012 to improve asset recovery from defaulting borrowers, but loans predating the court
are outside of the court’s purview; and it is not a court of final appeals, which limits its
effectiveness. Moreover, the CBL’s roll out of risk-based supervision—which is now in its second
round of bank inspections—is progressing and plans to allow greater adaptability to the
multitude of risks and vulnerabilities in the system.
27.
Deepening the financial sector
remains a high priority. Despite rapid
monetization and growth in private sector
credit, access to credit remains weak and
limited to a few borrowers. Small- and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs)—and rural
borrowers in particular—have difficulties
accessing credit. Banks are reluctant to extend
credit to the sector given weaknesses in the
legal and judicial framework, weak property
rights, limited collateral and credit reference
systems, and weak capacity of commercial
banks to appraise SMEs and rural farmers.
Moreover, interest rate rigidity and the short
maturities of bank liabilities and credit impede
lending to productive sectors (Box 6). To
improve access to credit, especially for small
borrowers, the CBL is strengthening the
commercial court, expanding the credit
reference system, and establishing a collateral
registry.

Box 6. Liberia: Interest Rate Rigidities and Short-Maturity of Deposits and Credit
Despite poor bank returns, lending and
deposit rates have remained rigid. CBL moral
suasion, absence of a money market, and
banks’ capacity constraints in analyzing market
liquidity and credit demand all serve to contain
lending rates.1 The low net interest margins by
regional comparison lead banks to rely on noninterest income, which accounts for nearly 60
percent of revenue.
Long-term financing sources are scarce. The
supply of time and savings deposits to meet the
high demand for long-term financing from
sectors such as agriculture, construction, and
manufacturing is limited in the current term
structure. Most commercial bank deposits are
demand deposits, and most of the loans are
short-term or overdrafts.
The authorities are using ad hoc methods to
boost credit to small borrowers. The CBL has
undertaken a few initiatives to stimulate
long-term lending to SMEs and agriculture by
placing long-term U.S. dollar deposits at commercial banks. This approach carries potential
reputational risks to the CBL while exposing their balance sheet to possible credit risk should
they be pressured to share losses.

D. Attaching Priority to Improving Governance and Transparency
28.
Improving governance and transparency also remains a high priority. The authorities
will draw on a recently completed Public Expenditure and Financial
Assessment (PEFA) to further improve public financial management
MEFP ¶20-30
(PFM) (Box 7). Staff urged the authorities to step up efforts to strengthen
financial oversight and reporting of SOEs—an outstanding issue from the last ECF arrangement—
and further roll out the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) especially
to include the civil service payroll; strengthen government cash management; streamline
procurement procedures and improve project execution; and establish a natural resource

LIBERIA

revenue unit in the MoF to improve monitoring of concessions. The authorities are also
advancing reforms to strengthen debt and aid management capacity, especially proper recording
and monitoring of all public debt, including off-budget financing. The authorities’ anti-corruption
strategy is also advancing through enforcement of a recently introduced Code of Conduct for
public sector employees.
29.
Financial structural reforms to alleviate risks and streamline regulation and
payments are also important. The CBL plans to submit to the legislature a revised Insurance Act
to streamline regulations in the sector and establish the central bank as the sole regulator. A
national payments law—recently submitted to the legislature—and capacity building at the CBL
should help improve bank settlements and reduce overhead for transactions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33

LIBERIA

Box 7. Liberia: Public Financial Management—Achievements and Challenges
The 2012 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment showed
improvements in public financial management (PFM) but important challenges remain
(21 out of 30 PEFA indicators were rated C or lower). The main challenges are


Comprehensiveness and transparency of budget documents has improved slightly;
but financial reporting remains below standard, and timely publication is lacking.
State-owned enterprise (SOE) reporting is incomplete and reports on externally financed
projects are not available.



Policy-based budgeting has improved and is aligned with the 2009 PFM Act. Nonetheless,
the budget is not approved on time which limits cash planning, procurement, and budget
execution.



Predictability and controls in the budget execution have improved; but payroll controls and
cash planning remain weak.



Budget credibility remains to be fully established. Although arrears have been controlled
and fiscal stability maintained, credibility in revenue and expenditure estimates is weak.



External audit remains weak. Despite the significant efforts to strengthen the General Audit
Commission, none of its audits has lead to remedial actions.



Bringing donor support on-budget has not advanced.

E. Maintaining Debt Sustainability and Strengthening Management
Capacity
30.
Liberia continues to have a low risk of debt distress—as confirmed by the debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) (EBS/12/139, Supplement 3). Staff and
MEFP ¶36-41
the authorities agreed to raise the foreign currency borrowing ceiling
(including concessional and nonconcessional borrowing) to 4 percent of
GDP in net present value (NPV) terms on average in 2012–15, monitored by an indicative target.19
The larger borrowing amount (equivalent to about $300–400 million depending on the level of
concessionality) averaged over three years would provide increased flexibility to accommodate
higher capital expenditure over the period—taking account of capacity constraints and “lumpy”
investments—while maintaining low debt vulnerabilities. In the event that sufficient concessional
financing cannot be secured, the government has expressed interest in commercial borrowing
for some of their strategic high-yielding infrastructure projects, assessed by a credible third
party. Staff urged the authorities to carefully assess their financing options and take advantage of
19

The debt ceilings would include SOEs.

34 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

available grants and highly concessional financing to the maximum amount possible, but
indicated that limited nonconcessional financing could be considered, if requested, tied to
specific projects.
31.
HIPC Initiative debt restructuring negotiations are
MEFP ¶38
nearing completion, and discussions are advancing with
development partners on new financing commitments. Debt
restructuring negotiations with the Saudi Fund and the Arab Development Bank have concluded;
however discussions with Taiwan, Province of China, have not advanced, despite the authorities’
efforts. To finance part of the rehabilitation of the hydroelectric plant, the authorities are
discussing concessional loans with bilateral and multilateral partners.

F. Improving the Quality of Statistics for Economic Management
32.
Improving national account statistics remains a priority.
MEFP ¶45
National account data is very weak with real GDP being benchmarked
to 1992 owing to shortcomings in data for later years. The authorities
recently conducted an establishment survey (covering all registered business enterprises) to help
compile new national accounts. A household income and expenditure survey (HIES) is being
planned for 2013, but is yet to secure sufficient financing. Staff urged the authorities to mobilize
resources for the HIES and to seek donor financing. Better national account estimates may help
in the compilation of balance of payments statistics, which also need improvement.

ACCESS, PROGRAM MONITORING, AND RISKS
33.
Access is proposed at 40 percent of quota (SDR 51.68 million) phased in seven
equal disbursements (Table 8). This level of access would allow reserves to increase to
three months of import coverage over the course of the program. Although the proposed access
is lower than the norm for second-time ECF users (access varies widely between
40–120 percent of quota), it is aligned with comparable countries such as Sierra Leone
(30 percent of quota), Mali (32 percent), and Burundi (39 percent). The arrangement could be
augmented at a later date, if needed, to address external shocks.
34.
The program would monitor six quantitative performance criteria (PC), streamlined
from the previous ECF arrangement (MEFP Table 1). Proposed structural benchmarks for the
first year of the ECF arrangement—which include the measures pending from the last ECF
arrangement—are geared toward further enhancing budget control and monitoring, improving
execution of capital spending, controlling payroll growth, and further developing the financial
sector (MEFP Table 2).
35.
Liberia’s capacity to repay the IMF is strong (Table 9). Projected debt financing to the
Fund is low as a share of GDP, exports, and government revenue. Public external debt will remain
well below thresholds of debt distress over the medium term. Liberia’s IMF credit outstanding

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 35

LIBERIA

will peak at 68 percent of quota, far below the norm for ECF countries. The ECF arrangement is
expected to be fully financed (Table 10). The mission followed up on outstanding
recommendations of the 2011 safeguards assessment update, and a draft Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the CBL and the MoF on repayment of the IMF’s credit will be
finalized by end-2012.
36.
Although the authorities are firmly committed to reform, considerable risks exist.
The government faces substantial political pressure to reduce poverty and accelerate public
investments—areas where progress was slow in the past. Lack of policy coordination and
weaknesses in technical capacity, institutions, and governance, however, will continue to test the
government’s ability to implement its ambitious development plans. Nonetheless, the
government has demonstrated a solid track record of program implementation under the
previous ECF arrangement and is benefiting from continued large-scale technical assistance,
including from the IMF. Liberia also remains vulnerable to external shocks, particularly volatility in
commodity prices, food and fuel price increases, and a prolonged global slowdown in growth.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Liberia recorded strong macroeconomic gains under the recently completed
three-year ECF Arrangement, but development challenges remain with large infrastructure
gaps and poverty still at very high levels. Economic activity has picked up, inflation has been
contained, institutions have been partially rebuilt, and fiscal accounts have been consolidated,
including restoration of debt sustainability. However, much more needs to be done to ensure
that the benefits of rapid growth lead to job creation and poverty reduction.
38.
The economic outlook is favorable, but with challenges. The most immediate
challenge is to maintain the hard-won stabilization gains while creating fiscal space to boost
spending on infrastructure and human development, promote financial sector deepening and
access to credit, and create a favorable business climate to support broad-based growth and job
creation.
39.
The budget for FY2012/13 is appropriately aligned to PRS2 and envisages scaling
up public investment and investing in people and in institutions. While execution of capital
spending improved in FY 2012, the government’s effectiveness in substantially increasing
investment is still far from complete. Achieving higher investment levels is challenging and will
require addressing capacity constraints including political, institutional, and technical skills. The
planned measures to establish a Project Management Office are welcome.
40.
Scaling up infrastructure investment without jeopardizing hard-won
macroeconomic stability requires efforts to expand revenue collection and contain current
spending. The recent measures to contain current spending are welcome, especially cleaning up
the wage bill and introducing fiscal rules that limit the share of wages and salaries in total
spending and the share of capital spending that could be transferred to current spending.

36 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

However, a stronger commitment is required to tighten the fiscal rules and ensure that savings in
current spending are reallocated to capital expenditure. The authorities’ plan to strengthen
revenue collections by a combination of tax policy and administrative measures is welcome, but
more needs to be done to increase revenue over the longer term. Strengthening administrative
reforms is warranted to support growth and investment, and the recently completed PEFA is a
clear road map to strengthen public financial management.
41.
The monetary framework remains very basic. Significant scope remains to improve
monetary policy implementation by anchoring the framework to a transparent target and
introducing treasury bills to improve liquidity management.
42.
Over the longer term, proper management of revenue from natural resources will
be crucial to support the development agenda and maintain macroeconomic stability.
While current natural resource revenue accounts for less than 10 percent of government revenue,
it is expected to rise over the medium term as iron ore production picks up and the potential
windfalls related to petroleum exploration materialize.
43.
Liberia has a low risk of debt distress, which, together with improved debt
management skills, supports a higher external borrowing ceiling to accommodate the
scaling up of public investment. The DSA suggests there is room to accommodate higher
borrowing—on concessional and possibly nonconcessional terms—without worsening the risk of
debt distress. Any request for limited nonconcessional borrowing could be considered in future
program discussions as long as it remains within the overall borrowing ceiling and is tied to
specific projects that have been independently evaluated for high economic and social returns.
44.
The external payments position remains stable, but Liberia could benefit from
building reserves to cover three months of imports. Although the authorities’ view is that
reserves accumulation carries a high opportunity cost given the country’s development financing
needs, building reserves will support CBL’s foreign exchange market intervention to address
excess exchange rate volatility, and will be a buffer against domestic and external shocks. The
authorities should avoid direct borrowing from the CBL—with the exception of short-term bridge
delays in disbursement from external creditors—and rely on treasury bills to cover any domestic
financing needs, as well as to develop the domestic financial market.
45.
Financial sector reform is advancing, but promotion of financial sector deepening
and access to credit is needed to improve private sector development and boost economic
growth. The CBL is commended for introducing risk-based supervision. Given the high levels of
non-performing loans and the low bank profitability, expanding access to financial services will
require enhancing the collection and dissemination of credit information while strengthening
supervision, including improving the credit reference system, establishing a collateral registry,
and strengthening the asset recovery framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37

LIBERIA

46.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a successor arrangement under the ECF.
The ECF arrangement will allow Liberia to maintain an adequate level of international reserves to
cope with global market uncertainties, while bolstering donor support for public investment and
social programs. Liberia remains a fragile state and risks remain to program implementation from
ongoing capacity weaknesses. Nevertheless, the authorities’ commitment to strong fiscal
management and administrative reforms mitigate these risks.
It is proposed that during the ECF arrangement Liberia stay on a 24-month Article
IV cycle in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles.20

Table 7. Liberia: Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of Risks

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium

Liberia is particularly exposed to
increases in the import price of
rice—the staple food in Liberia.
Higher prices would affect the
most vulnerable in society,
putting pressure on additional
assistance from the government
and donors.

Medium

Primary channels of contagion
are lower demand for exports
and falling commodity prices
causing a deterioration in the
external position.

Medium

A protracted global slowdown
would lead to sharper
commodity price declines and
reduce prospects for ongoing
investment in Liberia’s
concessions sector. This risks
future fiscal revenue and growth
prospects.

Low

China is a key driver of demand
in commodity markets, where
Liberia’s exports are
concentrated, and has
investments in the mining
sector. A sharp slowdown in
China would lower exports and
risk the upside return of future
mining investments.2

Disorderly withdrawal of UNMIL

Low

Social and political instability
diverting resources from public
investment and additional
pressure on donor assistance.

Weak implementation of public
investment program or
insufficient financing

Medium

Lower growth and ongoing high
energy costs.

International food price
increases

Strong intensification of the
euro area crisis

A global economic slowdown

Sharp slowdown in China

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this
report (which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on
the source of risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
2

Only one iron ore concession is included in the baseline. Investment from China represents an upside risk to the
outlook.

The IMF Board extended the waiver of interest payments for concessional loans through December 31, 2012. For 2013, the interest rate will be 0 percent for ECF loans.
After 2013, projected interest charges are based on 0.25 percent a year for the ECF. The IMF will review the interest rates for all PRGT facilities by end-2013 and every two
years thereafter.

Appendix I. Summary Memo on GDP Revision for Liberia
The GDP for Liberia has been revised by IMF staff (AFR and STA) on account of uncertainty over
the previous estimates and evidence of underestimation (high tax revenue to GDP ratio relative
to peer countries, significantly higher monetization ratios than in peer countries).
Estimates of nominal contribution of non-services sectors are unchanged. For sectors such
as agriculture, mining, forestry and manufacturing, value added at market prices is calculated
based on output estimates derived from CBL monthly surveys on production and exports as well
as the Production Estimates of Major Crops and Animals 2008.1 Retail price data is not available
and so international price data from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) Global
Assumptions are used.
The revisions in the 2008 GDP are in the value added by the services sectors including:
construction, education, health, financial services, government services, and trade and hotels and
other services. Additionally, the revision includes rough estimates of imputed rents on occupied
dwellings (previously not incorporated due to lack of data). The revision took into consideration
results from the Supply and Use Tables (SUT) for 2008 and their limitations, as well as the share
of these sectors in the GDP of comparator countries such as Sierra Leone and Gambia.
Construction was revised upward based on deflating estimates from the SUT estimates, which
used an excessively high value added ratio to gross output. Government services are revised to
incorporate the wage bill plus 20 percent of capital expenditure. Financial services were revised
to include noncommercial bank activities including the CBL and rough estimates of activity in the
insurance sector. Trade, hotels and similar services (restaurants, haircuts, etc.) are revised based
on estimates from peer countries (about 30 percent of total services). Other services such as
private education and health are revised based on the report Appraisal of the 2010–20 education
sector plan2 and SUT outcomes.
The revised GDP estimates results in aggregate monetary indicators for 2008 (broad
money to GDP, private sector credit to GDP) comparable to neighboring Sierra Leone for
the same year. Revenue to GDP declined by around one-third, but remains somewhat elevated
relative to the region, which is mostly on account of higher tax revenue from international
trade—on account of heavy reliance on imports—and non-tax revenue related to concessions
and the Liberia Maritime Authority.
Table 1 shows a comparison between the break down for the nominal contribution of each
sector to 2008 GDP under the old and revised estimates, while Table 2 shows the share of each
sector. The revision shows a higher share for the services sector. Table 3 compares between old
and revised GDP series at the time of the rebasing following the eighth review under the
previous ECF arrangement for Liberia approved in 2008 and expired on May 31, 2012.

Appendix III. Letter of Intent

Monrovia, November 2, 2012
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Madame Lagarde,
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) summarizes
the economic and financial policies of the government of Liberia for the period July 2012–
June 2015. These policies are anchored in the government’s Agenda for Transformation—the
new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS2), which the government intends to formally launch in
November 2012.
2.
The government requests that the MEFP be supported by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) under a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and requests the first
disbursement under the ECF. We hereby request the approval by the Executive Board of a
three- year ECF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 51.68 million (40 percent of
Liberia’s quota). To monitor progress in implementing our reform agenda, the program
includes a set of quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural
benchmarks, outlined in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
3.
The previous ECF-supported program, approved in 2008, was successfully completed
on May 31, 2012. Over the last four years, Liberia made substantial progress:
macroeconomic and financial stability was achieved, key institutions were largely rebuilt,
external debt profile improved and a mechanism was put in place to ensure a sustainable
position going forward, and social conditions were improved. Nonetheless, important
challenges remain. This MEFP outlines our recent economic performance and economic and
social policies planned for FY 2012/13 (July–June).
4.
The outlook for the second half of 2012 and over the medium term remains favorable.
We expect the expansion of Government spending to provide additional employment and
increase household incomes. The global economic outlook still presents risks, especially with
the slowdown in China and continued economic problems in Europe. These factors largely
present risks to the continued growth in the export sector.

56 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

5.
Macroeconomic performance in 2011 and during the first half of 2012 has been
strong. Growth is estimated to have reached 8.2 percent in 2011, U.S. dollar-denominated
inflation closed at 10.2 percent. Gross official reserves rose to 3 months of imports at
end-2011. These positive results have carried over into the first half of 2012. Growth is
estimated at close to 9 percent this year due mainly to the resumption of iron ore exports.
Inflation has declined to 4 percent year-on-year at end-June 2012.
6.
Liberia’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy 2 (PRS2)–the Agenda for Transformation–
focuses on investment in human development, infrastructure and institutions. The focus of
PRS2 will be on laying the foundation for broad-based and inclusive growth; taking the
achievements we have made under the first PRS and using those as an opportunity to work
on reforms that will promote business activity, rebuilding educational institutions, enhancing
governance reforms and borrowing to invest in large capital projects that will open up Liberia
to industry. Developing the Liberian private sector is a priority goal of the Government’s
transformation agenda. The budget for FY 2013 focuses on this agenda, and there has been a
large expansion of capital investment to at least 25 percent of the budget. It has been
prepared in the context of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to maintain the
Government’s focus on critical investments in infrastructure and capacity building. This
year’s budget introduces a multi-year budgeting framework, and ensures resources are
aligned to the policy priorities in the Agenda for Transformation. It focuses on the main
fiscal challenges including containing recurrent spending and boosting capital spending.
7.
Monetary policy over the medium term will focus on containing inflation by
maintaining stability in the exchange rate. The CBL aims to build reserve coverage to about
three months of imports over the medium term to buttress the macroeconomic stability,
giving due consideration to the high opportunity cost of holding reserves in the face of strong
development needs and massive infrastructure gaps. The government also intends to
strengthen policies aimed at improving confidence and widespread use of the Liberian dollar.
8.
The Government of Liberia and the CBL believe that the economic and financial
policies set forth in the attached memorandum provide an adequate basis for achieving the
objectives and targets of our program, but we will take any additional measures that may
become necessary for this purpose. We will consult closely with the IMF staff on the
adoption of such measures, and in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in the
MEFP. We will provide the Fund with all information necessary to monitor implementation
of the program supported by the ECF in a timely manner as outlined in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding.

We remain committed to transparent policy-making and are willing to make the
contents of this letter and those of the attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of
Understandings (TMU), as well as the Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV consultation
discussions available to the public.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Government of Liberia remains committed to achieving poverty reduction through
sustained economic growth and inclusive development while maintaining broad macroeconomic
stability. The strategies to achieve these goals are set out in the Agenda for Transformation—
Poverty Reduction Strategy 2 (PRS2)—and the medium-term priorities set in the long term
national vision “Liberia Rising 2030”. The Government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
are cooperating on a second three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) to support prudent
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that underlie strategies in the PRS2 and Liberia
Rising 2030.
2.
This memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) reviews the main
achievements since 2008 under the previous ECF arrangement, recent developments during
2012, and describes policies and targets for 2012/13 (July-June) and the medium term (2014/15).

II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE BUTTRESSED UNDER
PREVIOUS EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY (ECF) ARRANGEMENT

3.
In 2011, economic growth continued its solid performance with an estimated growth of
8.2 percent. The growth forecast for 2012 is put at 8.7 percent, expected to be largely driven by
the restart of the iron ore and higher quantity of timber exports, as well as growth in the
construction and services sectors.
4.
The Government of Liberia continued on its path of commitment to sound
macroeconomic management underpinned by transparency and accountability. Performance
buttressed by the previous ECF arrangement was strong and very constructive. The Government
implemented an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), passed a new
PFM law, and set out rules for controlling debt. Also, bank regulation and supervision were
strengthened and efforts are in place to regulate and supervise the insurance companies and
microfinance institutions. Concrete steps were taken to improve the credit environment with the
passing into law of a commercial code and the subsequent establishment of a commercial court,
in addition to the credit reference system established at the CBL. These, inter alia, have led to
expansion in commercial deposits and credit. Exchange rate broadly stabilized and inflation
remained largely contained with strong growth continuing even during the global financial crisis.
The Government rebuilt internal audit capacity and strengthened the General Auditing
Commission (GAC) ability to conduct audits of all Government Ministries and Agencies. The
Automated System for Custom Data (ASYCUDA) system was rolled out at the major entry ports
and the Government increased the level of tax revenues coming from domestic sources. During

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

LIBERIA

the course of the last five years the overall budget increased from around US $185 million in
2007/08 to US $516 million in 2011/12. Despite Liberia’s progress so far, important challenges
remain. The largest of these remains the huge infrastructure deficit (i.e., electricity, roads, and sea
and air ports). The Mount Coffee Hydroelectric plant and much of the road system outside of
Monrovia are still incomplete, even though much progress has been made in expanding the road
and power networks. The Government has demonstrated commitment to improve the power
system; this is demonstrated by the US $45.3 million allocated to energy in the FY2013 budget.
Liberia has also joined the West African Power Pool scheme (WAPP). Despite the efforts that
have already been put in place to control recurrent spending and set a minimum level of capital
spending within the budget at 25 percent, the infrastructure funding needs far exceed the
available resources requiring external assistance.
5.
The Government introduced an interim policy measure, the 150 Day Action Plan with the
objective of making short-term, high impact policy interventions aimed at creating temporary
jobs at different entities in Government; expanding the service network of the national transit
authority, and developing the MTEF and the associated budget.
6.
The government is still in the process of reconciling GoL accounts for FY2011/12 using
the newly-installed Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). On the basis of
IFMIS data, revenue collection for 2011/12 is estimated at US $475.2 million, including a carry
forward (re-appropriation from unspent funds from previous fiscal year) of US $8.6 million from
FY2010/11 and US$ 7.5 million in borrowing from the CBL. Excluding these two items,1 revenue
for FY2011/12 amounted to about US $460 million, compared to the ECF 8th Review target of
US $470.2 million. According to IFMIS, government expenditures for FY2011/12 amounted to
US $488 million (including expenditures made during July–September in line with the 90-day rule
to cover commitments from the previous fiscal year).2 In addition, US $21 million was spent on
off-budget projects including road construction and rehabilitation financed by multilaterals.
There was also US $12 million spent on dredging the port which was not included in the budget
and executed off-budget, financed by direct borrowing from the central bank. These off-budget
expenditures are not included in IFMIS. Including the off-budget items, total expenditures
amounted to US $514 million, compared to the 8th review ECF target of US $473 million.3 The full
extent of the FY2011/12 budget outturn will be known once the on-going reconciliation of the
GoL accounts is finalized.

1

Carry-forward of re-appropriations and borrowing from CBL are recorded as domestic financing in ECF
macroeconomic framework.
2

Expenditures made during the 90 day period are not included in the ECF macro framework. IFMIS in 2011/12
(US $488) includes US $10 million in amortization and arrears payments that are recorded as financing in the ECF
macro framework, and does not include US$ 2 million in interest payments which are included as expenditures in
the ECF framework.

3

The 8th Review included the off-budget items in government expenditures.

III.

OBJECTIVES AND ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE THREE-YEAR ECF PERIOD

7.
Over the next three years, the successor ECF arrangement will help support our new
Poverty Reduction Strategy 2, the Agenda for Transformation (AfT), which builds on the gains
made from the previous PRS1. Under this AfT, investment will be made in infrastructure;
institutions and in people with efforts exerted at directing a significant portion of expenditure
towards capital projects, which is expected to double in the 2012/13 budget. The AfT aims to
consolidate the gains made at maintaining macroeconomic stability and building a foundation
for strong economic growth. The AfT sets out to ensure stable, strong economic growth with the
end objective of meeting middle income status by 2030. Our current estimates suggest that this
would require around 8 percent real growth annually. In the context of the Agenda for
Transformation (PRS2), the strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction is anchored in a
six-point strategy:


Investing in infrastructure, particularly in energy and roads. This is the key to the
economic renewal; transforming Liberia into a West African hub and a major trading
partner in the region.



Investing in people. An educated population is the key to innovation, growth, good
business, and good governance. There will be an expansion of vocational and technical
training, of business apprenticeship and university training.



Invest in agriculture. Investing in agriculture is the key to generating incomes for the
poorest households, stable and low-priced food and to controlling inflation and reducing
poverty. With investment in agriculture, we can build a consumer base amongst the
poorest, and we can reduce the insecurity that holds back investment.



Developing the private sector with emphasis on Liberian entrepreneurship. Steps will be
taken to remove impediments to private sector growth as well as to provide the
necessary investment incentives for small and medium businesses.



Prioritizing policies that facilitate job creation, especially for the young. This will promote
stability and the building of skills. This year the Government has set aside $15 million for
training and creating employment opportunities entirely focused on youth.



Reducing inequality. We must ensure that the proceeds of growth benefit all of society,
and that the abundance of natural resources is used wisely to create economic and
employment opportunities.

8.
The Government, under the AfT, aims to ensure that we target interventions that will
promote incomes among the poorest households. The key objectives of AfT as seen below are
set out in 4 main pillars and cross-cutting considered as the 5th pillar:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61

LIBERIA

Security and Rule of Law: the Government will invest in the security sector in preparation for
the UNMIL drawdown; this will include developing a strategy for the necessary areas of security
investment to meet the major areas of UNMIL activity. Together with the Ministry of Justice, we
will prepare by October 31, 2012 a proposed budget for FY 2014 which we will discuss with
UNMIL by November 30 to finance training needs and start assuming some non-peace keeping
and other related activities. Spending on security will be part of the MTEF starting with FY 2014.
Governance and Public Institutions: the Government will work to promote reforms to enhance
governance and economic management, including continuing the program-based MTEF budget
next year; and reforming the reporting mechanism to ensure that, prior to allotments being
disbursed, the Ministry of Finance is aware of performance and shortfalls by Ministries and
Agencies. The Government will continue to roll out reforms to our budget process, and our
expenditure management, support the work of LACC and the GAC in monitoring government
activities and continue to ensure we provide operational support to M&As.
Human Development: education and an expansion of vocational training will be funded and
free access to basic education for all children will be enhanced. The easiest way to lift people
from poverty is to provide the opportunity for growth; the Government will work on developing
work readiness training, and eradicate illiteracy.
Cross Cutting: funding has been put aside in this budget for youth schemes to promote youth
empowerment; the Government will support the Ministry of Gender Development in its efforts to
ensure workplace fairness. We will fund anti-HIV programs and implement the new Children’s
Law and establish National Council for Children’s’ Well-being.
9.
The cost of the AfT/PRS2 is estimated at around US $2.2 billion over the period of the
IMF program. This will be funded by the Government and donor partners with externally funded
donor efforts aligned with the PRS. The MTEF budget sets out the major priorities for funding of
the Government. This includes: the rebuilding of the Mount Coffee Hydroelectric plant (which will
be co-financed between Government and Donors); the construction of new roads and bridges in
line with the Transport Master Plan. Generally, however, the Government priorities are: rebuilding
power infrastructure and generation (and connecting to the West African Power Pool), rebuilding
roads, controlling recurrent spending and rebuilding educational institutions (and expanding the
role of vocational education).

IV.

THE POLICY AGENDA FOR 2012/13
A. Fiscal Policy

10.
The budget for FY 2013 has been prepared in the context of the recently introduced
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This year budget introduces multi-year budgeting
framework, and ensures resources are aligned to the policy priorities in the Agenda for

62 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

Transformation. It focuses on the main fiscal challenges including containing recurrent spending
and boosting capital spending.
11.
Over the medium term, we plan to continue to gradually increase capital spending as a
share of the budget through further reallocation from current spending. To support this
objective, already this fiscal year, we have put in place a current spending savings policy to
reduce spending on gasoline, foreign and domestic travel, as well as other non-priority spending.
Savings will be allocated to priority spending, particularly capital investment. For FY 2014 plans
are being made to collapse public sector employees’ basic salary with the current special
allowances to better control payroll spending. We will create a Liberia Development Fund in
FY 2013 to save the unspent investment appropriation ensuring that unfinished infrastructure
projects’ funding is not constrained in the upcoming fiscal years.
12.
The budget for FY 2013 was built around fiscal rules. These rules included efforts to
promote capital spending, reduce transfers between spending lines, and control recurrent
expenditures. The key rules (see details in the Budget Framework Paper) are as follows:
a.

No more than 34 percent of FY 2013 budget should be allocated to salaries and
wages. And we are committed to reducing it further down by FY 2015 as a way to
create the necessary fiscal space to increase capital spending.

b.

At least 25 percent of the budget must be capital spending, of which at least
10 percent must be on the energy sector.

c.

25 percent of GoL expenditure on goods and services will be spent on Liberian
businesses (25 percent of furniture spending must also be on Liberian sourced
products).

d.

no more than 15 percent of capital spending must be on administrative overheads.

e.

transfers from investment to recurrent must be no more than 5 percent of
investment appropriations.

13.
Revenue collection will be strengthened by a combination of additional tax policies and
tax administrative measures. These include the migration from General Sales Tax (GST) to
Common External Tariff (CET); taxation on inbound calls; strengthening tax enforcement and
compliance by conducting comprehensive audits of the largest 20 taxpayers including
commercial banks, logging and insurance companies, as well as by launching a robust
anti-smuggling campaign; and strengthening taxpayers services by establishing a one-stop
customer care center, with technical assistance from the IMF, which will include a special call
center to answer tax questions that would be accessible to all Liberians within and out of the
country. For FY 2012/13, total revenue collection (including grants) is projected at 27 percent of
GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63

LIBERIA

14.
There are also contingent revenues—where there are uncertainties in the timing of their
collection and are currently not included in the revenue projections. Among these, US $45 million
is expected from the sale of the contract for Block 13 and is dependent on the finalization of the
contract negotiation. If received, and assuming that total revenue collection is on track, these
resources will be aligned to specific expenditures under the PSIP.
15.
Some of the money in the grant revenue is ‘at risk’; this year the Government has
developed a measure of risk for the grant revenue, and has put in place a strategy to minimize
the risk of the grant revenue which is tied to specific deliverables. This will include regular
reporting from M&As responsible for the deliverable areas, and monthly follow up by the
Ministry of Finance Aid Management Unit to determine interventions required to meet targets.
16.
Total expenditure in FY 2013 are expected to increase to around 33 percent of GDP from
around 31 percent of GDP in the last fiscal year, reflecting a 3.7 percentage point increase in
capital spending. For FY 2013, all investment projects had to be justified, scored and aligned with
Government and Ministry priorities. Efforts will be exerted to improve the efficiency and
execution in the implementation of projects. To do this, we plan to set up the Project
Management Office (PMO) by end-December 2012 (structural benchmark) which will focus on
the evaluation (project costing and appraisal) and selection process of investment projects and
reviewing feasibility studies for projects. This Unit will monitor the implementation of the PSIP
and capital spending component of the Agenda for Transformation. Ministries and Agencies will
develop timelines for sector projects and itemized spending plans to ensure that allotments and
releases of funds occur in time for them to be useful for Ministries and Agencies, and itemized
plans will help with outturn reporting at the end of the fiscal year.
17.
Government treasury bills in Liberian Dollars will be launched by end-December 2012
(structural benchmark) to be used for cash management purposes and for the Government’s
domestic financing needs.
18.
Private investment promotion is a key aim of this Government’s agenda, fully recognizing
the importance of increasing the level of private investment as part of the effort to meet the
Vision 2030 objective of middle income status. This objective cannot be achieved by borrowing
and Government investment alone. With this in mind, there are planned interventions in the
short to medium term which include:
a.

Working with development financing institutions to provide SME guarantees: the
Government will work with development partners to set up a fund to offer
guarantees to small and medium size enterprises, to reduce their capital costs.

b.

Promoting SMEs representative organizations: the Government has taken steps
towards promoting the views of the business organizations within Liberia. This has
included setting up a communication between the Minister of Finance’s office and

64 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

the Liberian Chamber of Commerce to find out what they believe could encourage
business activity.
c.

Work to equalize fees for Liberian and Non-Liberian businesses, a commitment of
the Government under its WTO accession plans.
B. Governance and Public Financial Management

19.
We plan to introduce a Treasury Single Account approach by end-December 2012
(structural benchmark) as a tool to strengthen the central government’s cash management
capacity. Line ministries and agencies (M&As) accounts will be monitored on a monthly basis to
provide consolidated cash balances held by the GoL with the purpose of reducing idle balances
and inactive accounts to improve liquidity management. In line with the new cash flow planning
approach, line ministries have been asked to submit their rolling plans for the preparation of a
consolidated annual cash plan.
20.
As part of the PFM reform agenda, the introduction of IFMIS has been completed in
8 Ministries, including the 5 largest (Education, Health, Public Works, Finance, Foreign Affairs, and
Agriculture); and the General Auditing Commission (GAC) has also installed the IFMIS
infrastructure. The GAC should be fully connected to IFMIS, giving GAC full access to IFMIS, by
the end of December 2012 (structural benchmark). The GAC will then start conducting the
auditing of the FY 2011/12 budget by January 2013 using IFMIS, beginning with the 8 ministries
currently connected to IFMIS. Prior to this action, full testing of the system in the above
mentioned M&As will be completed by October 2012. The GAC will complete audits of the
FY2011/12 budget for the eight (8) big ministries and agencies using IFMIS by end-September
2013. We will continue to rollout IFMIS to an additional 8 M&As by the end of FY 2013.
21.
The Government will continue its effort to remove ghost names from the payroll system
and has started work in this regard including the introduction of biometric technology to
strengthen payroll controls. This will continue with all employees eventually expected to be
covered by the system by end-June 2014.
22.
The Government will introduce the Civil Service Management (CSM) module within IFMIS
and the Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS) sub-module within the
CSM, both by end-June 2013 (structural benchmark). Currently, 22 out of 29 M&As payrolls have
been cleaned up and the personnel records will be uploaded to IFMIS. Cleaning up of the
remaining 7 institutions4 will be completed by end-June 2013 (structural benchmark), including in
the Ministry of Education where an attendance monitoring system with TA support from USAID is
also being launched in January 2013. By end-June 2013, the payrolls of all M&As will be
uploaded to IFMIS and used for payroll payments.

Progress has been made at initially strengthening of internal audits of high spending
M&As, consistent with the Government’s internal audit strategy. Currently, 8 out of
16 institutions have their system (institutional and human capital) in place and we plan to
complete an additional 8 institutions by September 30, 2012 and fully rollout the process to all
M&As by June 30, 2013.
24.
The Code of Conduct Executive Order was signed by the President on the 9th of January
2012 and the Government has begun an effort to implement the Code, including having staff
throughout the Government, sign copies to signify their commitment to comply with this
Executive Order.
25.
The Civil Service Agency (CSA) and the General Auditing Commission carried out a joint
audit of the pension system to verify all people on the pension payroll. Schemes like this will
continue in the future including all other payrolls.
26.
The government is advancing on the introduction of the Public Expenditure Tracking
System (PETS), which is expected to be in place by end-2012. It links public resources to
outcomes; the framework would allow the Ministry of Finance and line ministries and agencies to
track spending levels and deliverables.
27.
In order to improve financial oversight of SOEs/public financial entities, an SOE unit
within the Ministry of Finance will be set up by end-December 2012 (structural benchmark) which
will be responsible for collecting quarterly financial reports from the 8 largest SOEs/public
financial entities5 and ensuring they are in line with the PFM law. By end-June 2013, the
8th largest SOEs will be required to report to the SOE unit within the Ministry of Finance their
financial performance for the quarter January–March 2013 (Structural Benchmark). Thereafter,
SOEs will regularly report their quarterly financial performance, three months after the end of
each quarter. In the meantime, the Government is improving governance of SOEs by ensuring
that SOEs which do not provide financial reports will not receive any subsidies. Steps will also be
taken to work with SOEs to build their reporting capacity. The SOE Unit will also strengthen
oversight of SOE performance to ensure timely and accurate transfer of revenues to the Ministry
of Finance. By end-December 2012, the Unit, working with other GoL stakeholders, will also
prepare a strategy to manage fiscal risks of SOEs and determine which SOEs should be privatized
and whether or not Government subsidies should remain for enterprises.
28.
Management of natural resource revenue: the Government notes the importance of
ensuring that natural resource revenues are properly managed. The Government will: (i) create a
resource revenue sub-unit in the large taxpayers unit of the Ministry of Finance by June 2013
(structural benchmark) to improve the monitoring of concessions to more accurately determine

the quality and quantity of natural resource production, and exports and estimate royalty
requirements; and (ii) begin reporting natural resources revenues separately in fiscal outturns
starting in FY 2014.
29.
The Government will prepare monthly reports (to form part of the consolidated monthly
fiscal report) by December 2012, on off-budget externally financed projects reconciling data with
the Budget and Expenditure offices at the Ministry of Finance.
C. Monetary Policy and Financial System
30.
Monetary policy over the medium term will focus on containing inflation in Liberian
dollar-denominated prices by maintaining stability in the exchange rate through the weekly
foreign exchange auctions. The CBL recognizes the need to build up foreign exchange reserves
to mitigate adverse shocks especially given the vulnerabilities to food and fuel price spikes and
sluggish global economic growth. However, the CBL is also taking into account the high
opportunity cost of holding reserves given the strong development needs and massive
infrastructure gaps. To this end, the CBL aims to maintain adequate reserve coverage of about
three months of imports over the medium term to buttress the macroeconomic stability while
creating some policy buffers. 6
31.
An orderly and market driven de-dollarization is a strategic objective of the Government.
The ongoing measures being taken to improve confidence and to promote widespread use of
the Liberian dollar, including improving the quality of notes and issuing higher denomination
bills, will be strengthened. Moreover, the Government will set a plan to de-dollarize public
expenditure including paying all public sector salaries in Liberian dollars over the medium term.
Additionally, the Government’s issuance of treasury bills by December 2012 will help mop up
excess Liberian dollar liquidity in the system and to encourage mobilization of Liberian dollar
deposits.
32.
The CBL is taking active measures aimed at strengthening the banking system and other
financial institutions. Specifically, the CBL is engaging banks below minimum capital
requirements to oversee recapitalization plans. As a result of this engagement, affected banks
received capital injections from their foreign parents in 2011 and 2012. The CBL will continue
working with banks remaining below minimum capital requirement to ensure full compliance
with the capital and provisioning regulations by end-2012. Moreover, the current risk-based
supervision regime of the CBL, whose first cycle of bank inspections successfully ended, will focus
on emerging credit risks, aggressive monitoring of banks to ensure that they remain healthy, and
improving banks’ risk management. In addition, the CBL will submit to legislature a revised
Insurance Act by end-June 2013 (structural benchmark) to streamline regulation in the insurance
sector and establish the central bank as the sole regulator of all insurance agencies.

Excluding UNMIL and iron ore related imports.

33.
In order to strengthen financial inclusion and promote lending to small borrowers, the
CBL will seek to improve the credit environment through: (i) strengthening the commercial court;
ii) enhancing the credit reference system by widening its database and improving its accessibility;
iii) establishing, by end-June 2013, a collateral registry to support execution of collateral on bad
loans and improve the credit culture (structural benchmark). The monetary authority will also
work together with donors to mobilize long-term financing of bank’s lending to agriculture and
small- and medium-sized enterprises and to improve financial literacy and business practices.
D. Debt Management, Resolution and External Policies
34.
The Government has put in place fiscal rules to guide borrowing, to ensure that we never
again have to ask the world for forgiveness from our debt. This Government has achieved in the
last six years remarkable write downs on our debt stock of around US $4.7 billion. We will ensure,
through sensible management of our finances and never again build up debt with nothing to
show for the cost. Our borrowing rules will ensure that:
a. We use borrowing to boost capital, and where the cost is borne by future
generations so will the benefit;
b. Total public sector borrowing (including public, publicly guaranteed debt and debt
of SOEs) in foreign currency (including concessional and nonconcessional
borrowing) will be limited to 4 percent of GDP in NPV terms averaged over three
years.
c.

The Government will seek nonconcessional borrowing, with agreement with the
Fund, for specific economic viable projects with high economic and social returns
and assessed by an independent entity, should the need arise.

d. Borrowing is managed sustainably and we never build a debt stock too high for
repayment; the Government has set as its fiscal rules for borrowing:
i.

All borrowing must be undertaken for the purposes of investment, consistent
with the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP)

ii.

Total debt stock must not exceed 60% of the previous year’s GDP as contained
in the PFM regulations.

iii.

Prior to new borrowing being undertaken a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
must be carried out and presented to the Debt Management Committee (DMC)
to ensure debt rules are not breached

35.
SOEs taking on debt will be conditional on SOEs providing full and accurate reports of
finances, as well as the presentation of an economically beneficial project with good loan terms.
SOE and SOE guarantees will be included within our debt stock, in line with the PFM law.

68 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

36.
The Debt Management Unit will develop a forward looking medium-term debt strategy
to identify specific borrowing plans and negotiate new debt in line with the fiscal rules to achieve
borrowing targets in the most cost effective way by the end of 2012. The three year strategy will
be refreshed in line with annual Budget preparations to enable timely execution of new
borrowing upon Budget approval.
37.
We will continue making progress on finalizing bilateral and multilateral debt
agreements. The debt rescheduling with BADEA has been signed, increasing the maturity of the
loan to 40 years with a 5-year grace period and zero percent interest rate. The debt with
Saudi Arabia has been finalized as the negotiation has been concluded and signed.
38.
We are making efforts to ensure timely and accurate reporting of debt and off-budget
project financing. The IDA credits have been incorporated into measures of debt accumulation in
the Budget Framework Paper and have been included in sustainable debt profiles produced by
the Ministry of Finance. Both IDA debt and the IMF reserves support are included in published
measures of debt stock.
39.
The Aid Management Unit within the Ministry of Finance will work to ensure better
management of grants and off-budget aid programs ongoing in Liberia. As part of this effort we
will:
a.

Introduce new aid management software to track aid projects; eventually this will be
rolled out to a public facing platform which will allow donors to log in and include
and edit their ongoing projects.

b.

Introduce a system by end-2012 to follow up on conditional grant aid: the grants
which are tied to specific conditions will be identified with responsible Ministries and
Agencies and will be required to provide monthly reports on progress and
correcting measures to reduce future deviations.

40.
We are making progress towards the WTO accession: we have submitted answers to
initial questions the WTO has sent in response to our memorandum on foreign trade; and have
begun technical meetings with the WTO. ECOWAS trade: the Government will work to implement
the Common External Tariff (CET) by early next year, and work to remove the final tariffs on
internal ECOWAS trade in line with the liberalization scheme. The CET will then form the basis for
the negotiations with the WTO.
41.
The CBL will implement the recommendations of a safeguards assessment that was
finalized in October 2011 and will undergo an update assessment in relation to the new
arrangement. In this context, we will finalize by December 2012, a Memorandum of
Understanding between the CBL and the government to clarify the rights and obligations for
Liberia’s accounts and transactions with the IMF. These formalized institutional arrangements will
be reflected in the CBL financial statements beginning with the 2012 annual accounts.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 69

LIBERIA

E. Other Structural Reforms
42.
Concessions: we will strengthen the role of the National Bureau of Concession within
negotiations and ensure it has the resources to operate effectively; and we will redraft the
Petroleum Act to separate responsibility for revenue collection, oversight and regulation; and
ensure that petroleum agreements are in line with the redraft. The revised Petroleum Act will be
submitted to Parliament in the first quarter of 2013.
43.
Risk analysis in the budget: the Government will begin producing a risk management
handbook, with details of likely risks to budget execution revenue collection and debt levels. The
Government will begin publishing regular reports of risk, and monitoring the risks presented to
the overall macro economy.
44.
Data collection and forecasting: we will expand the Government’s data collection. As we
recognize the importance of good data in the implementation of effective policies, measures we
will take to improve data gathering will include:
a.

Ensuring LISGIS has the required resources in FY 2013 to complete the planned
national accounts surveys, providing us with the data required for Government
policy development.

b.

Commencing the household income expenditure survey and compile and publish
the establishment survey (covering all registered business enterprises), both by
end-June 2013 (structural benchmarks) as this is an integral part of the efforts
towards better data collection and we will ensure that we work with donors to
complete this.

c.

Compiling national accounts for 2013 by June 2014 using the results of the
completed household income expenditure and enterprise surveys.
F. Program Monitoring

45.
Program implementation will be monitored with quantitative financial targets and
structural benchmarks (Tables 1 and 2 below), and semi-annual reviews. Definitions of key
concepts and indicators, as well as reporting requirements, are set out in the accompanying
Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The first review is scheduled to be completed by
May 15, 2013 based on the end-December 2012 PC and the second review by November 15,
2013 based on the end-June 2013 PC.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Liberian authorities and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative and structural
performance criteria and benchmarks for the three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF), as well as
the reporting requirements. The definitions are valid at the start of the program but may need to
be revisited during the program reviews to ensure that the memorandum continues to reflect the
best understanding of the Liberian authorities and the IMF staff in monitoring the program.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
A. Test Dates
1.
Quantitative performance criteria have been set for end-December 2012 and end-June
2013 and quantitative performance benchmarks have been set for end-March 2013 and
end-September 2013.
B. Definitions and Computation
2.
For the purposes of the program, the Government is defined as the Central
Government of Liberia (GoL). This definition excludes legally autonomous state-owned
enterprises whose budgets are not included in the central government budget. The operations of
the central government will be presented in U.S. dollars with all revenues and expenditures that
are denominated in Liberian dollars converted at the end of period exchange rate. The public
sector comprises the central government, the Central Bank of Liberia, and public enterprises
(enterprises and agencies in which the government holds a controlling stake—typically owns
more than 50 percent of the shares, but which are not consolidated in the budget).
3.
Total Central Government revenue collection includes all tax and nontax receipts
transferred into the U.S. dollar GoL accounts at the CBL, including income and transfers from
state-owned enterprises and public institutions (excluding external loans and grants). The GoL
accounts at the CBL include the GoL General Account No. 2, the GoL Special Rice Fund, and the
Liberian dollar account at the CBL comprising the GoL General Account. Any new accounts
opened by the GoL at the CBL or at any other local financial agency shall be reported to the IMF
as well. For the purposes of the program, the revenues of the GoL are measured on the basis of
cash deposits in the four accounts specified above converted to U.S. dollars using the end of
period exchange rate.
4.
For end-December 2012 and end-June 2013, social and other priority spending is
defined as education, health, social development services, and energy sector spending
from the FY2013 budget of the units listed below (payment vouchers approved by the Ministry
of Finance) excluding contingent expenditure. It is evaluated as a share of total budgeted
expenditure, where total budgeted expenditure excludes contingent expenditure and off budget
expenditure.

5.
Social and other priority spending will be adjusted downward by the undisbursed
amounts from budgeted external financing allocated to projects in the energy sector within the
public sector investment program.
6.
New domestic borrowing of the Central Government is defined as new domestic
claims on the central government since the start of the program. It will be measured by the
change in the stock of all outstanding claims on the central government (domestic loans,
advances, and any government debt instruments, such as long-term government securities
issued in the domestic market) by the banking system. The definition also includes the issuance
of debt instruments by the GoL to the nonbank sector. For the purposes of measurement, all
claims in Liberian dollars will be converted at the end of period exchange rate.

76 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

7.
Gross borrowing by the public sector in foreign currency is defined as cumulated
new external claims by residents and non-residents from July 1, 2012 on the public sector
excluding borrowing for reserve management purposes by the CBL.
8.
The definition of external debt by the public sector, for the purposes of the program,
applies not only to the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the "Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to External Debt" (Executive Board Decisions No. 6230-(79/140)
August 3, 1979, as amended and effective December 1, 2009 attached in Annex I), but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
9.
The concessional nature of debt will be determined on the basis of the commercial
interest reference rates published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). A debt is defined as concessional if, on the date of signature, the ratio
between the present value of debt computed on the basis of reference interest rates and the face
value of the debt is less than 65 percent (equivalent to a grant element of at least 35 percent).
10.
The ceiling for contracting and guaranteeing nonconcessional external debt by the
public sector will be set at zero continuously throughout the program period except as
agreed with Fund staff. The ceiling for contracting and guaranteeing nonconcessional debt
excludes short-term (debt contracted for the period less than one year) import-related credits,
rescheduling arrangements, and borrowing from the Fund.
11.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt that it
owes or guarantees, with the exception of external payments arrears arising from government
debt that is being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club creditors. Arrears on external
debt are defined as any unpaid obligation on the contractual due date. In cases where a creditor
has granted a grace period after the contractual due date, arrears are incurred following the
expiration of the grace period.
12.
New domestic arrears/payables of the government are calculated as the difference
between government payment commitments and the actual payments made on such
commitments, providing for a processing period of no more than 15 days from the date of
commitment. Actual payments are defined as having taken place on the date of issuance of the
checks by the Ministry of Finance. Government payment commitments include all expenditure for
which commitment vouchers have been approved by the Director of the Bureau of General
Accounting (BGA), and expenditure that are now automatically approved, namely, wages and
salaries, pensions, debt payments to the CBL and commercial banks, CBL bank charges, and
transfers of ECOWAS levies into the ECOWAS account.
13.
CBL gross direct credit to central government is defined as the sum of claims on
central government, including loans, advances, accounts receivable, and any government debt
instrument as defined in the monetary survey template excluding CBL purchases of treasury
bills in the secondary market and non-competitive purchases in the primary market. The gross

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 77

LIBERIA

credit to government is expressed in U.S. dollars. Claims denominated in Liberian dollars are
valued at end-of-period exchange rate.
14.
The net foreign exchange position of the CBL is defined as the difference between
(a) the CBL’s gross foreign reserves including SDR holdings, and (b) the sum of its gross foreign
liquid liabilities, ECF arrangement liabilities, and liquid liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. The
net foreign exchange position floor at end-December 2012 and end-June 2013 is US $15 million
below the projected net foreign exchange position. The net foreign exchange position of the CBL
is presented in the U.S. dollar. SDR holdings are valued at a fixed rate of the U.S. dollar against
SDR, 1.5844 as of June 30, 2012. Other currencies are valued at cross-rates against the U.S. dollar
as of June 30, 2012.
15.
The net domestic assets of the CBL are defined as base money minus the net foreign
assets of the CBL converted into United States dollars at program exchange rates as defined in
paragraph 14. Base money is defined as the stock of currency in circulation plus reserve deposits
of commercial banks at the CBL, plus sight deposits of commercial banks at the CBL and plus
vault cash of commercial banks. The net foreign assets of the CBL are defined as foreign assets
minus foreign liabilities of the CBL balance sheet.
16.
External financing adjustor. The program ceilings for CBL gross credit to government
and CBL net domestic assets will be adjusted upward and the program floor on the net foreign
exchange position of the CBL will be adjusted downward, by the amount of the difference
between actual and programmed external budget support and committed budgeted external
loan disbursements up to a maximum of US$20 million. The adjuster will be calculated on a
cumulative basis from the start of the financial year (July 1).

Annex 1. Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140) August 3, 1979, as amended in 2009
(a)

(b)

The term "debt" will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created
under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under
the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i)

loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);

(ii)

suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and

(iii)

leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than
the total expected service life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to the
property. The debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.

Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially

awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under
this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

MANAGING NATURAL RESOURCE REVENUE IN
LIBERIA: OPTIONS FOR A FISCAL FRAMEWORK

1

1.

With Liberia set to rejoin the group of countries with large mineral sectors, it is an

appropriate time to consider how the fiscal framework should manage these revenue inflows.
What principles should guide whether the revenues are spent or saved? How should spending be
allocated across consumption and investment? How will Liberia manage volatility and uncertainty
in its fiscal framework? Should savings and/or stabilization funds be created? How well have
other countries managed their resource revenues?
2.

This note aims to highlight the issues rather than provide definitive answers: there is no

“one-size fits all” in the design of fiscal frameworks which should be tailored to country
circumstances. The note is organized as follows. Section I summarizes the benefits and risks
resulting from large natural resource revenue inflows; Section II outlines the challenges to fiscal
policy posed by resource revenues. Section III discusses a menu of policies for managing
resource wealth including experiences from Ghana and Botswana and an application of the
permanent income approach.

I. CONTEXT
3.
Liberia should receive large natural resource revenue inflows over the
medium- to long-term. These will originate through exploitation of iron ore deposits and,
potentially, petroleum. Revenue inflows of this magnitude offer significant opportunities,
including accelerated reconstruction, development, and poverty reduction. Projections made at
the time of the 2010 Article IV consultation indicated that an optimistic extraction schedule for
four of the ratified iron ore projects could yield sufficient resources to finance Liberia’s transition
to middle income status by 2030.
4.
However, without proper management and preparation, there is a risk that the
economic benefits of mineral wealth would be undermined or even dissipated. Studies
indicate that several factors associated with dependence on mineral wealth such as loss of
competitiveness in agriculture and manufacturing, macroeconomic volatility, and diversion of
resources to rent-seeking (Box 1).

Box 1. The “Resource Curse”
The main negative aspects associated with natural resource wealth:


Dutch disease (loss of competitiveness): Large protracted foreign exchange
inflows enter the country, bidding up the price of non-traded goods and
appreciating the real exchange rate. Competitiveness declines, resources migrate to
the now more profitable non-traded services sector and away from non-mineral
tradable sectors.1 In the process, the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, the
mainstay of employment, decline.



Volatility: International resource prices are channeled via budget to the domestic
economy. If expenditure rises in years of high resource prices, then falls abruptly
when prices reverse, fiscal policy becomes pro-cyclical. The resulting cycle of “boom
and bust” can entail real macroeconomic and fiscal costs.



Governance and institutions: Abundant natural resource revenue may engender
institutionalized corruption. Capture of decision making by elite groups can lessen
the incentives—even create disincentives—for development of the institutions
needed for broad-based growth. Revenue institutions do not develop to their full
potential. Growth suffers further as resources are increasingly diverted from
productive purposes towards rent seeking.

II. CHALLENGES TO FISCAL POLICY IN RESOURCE-RICH
ECONOMIES
5.
The presence of significant resource revenue complicates fiscal management in
several respects: (i) revenue derives from depleting an asset unlike most other revenue which
has implications for the sharing of wealth between current and future generations; (ii) spending
resource revenue (from exports) pumps up domestic demand and may in turn generate inflation;
(iii) revenue windfalls may strain the capacity of public financial management leading to waste;
and (iv) revenue volatility can be damaging if there are not some savings to smooth changes to
budget spending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

6.
Conceptually, mineral wealth is an asset in an economic sense, rather than a
recurrent flow. Mineral wealth, when extracted, can be transformed into financial assets (saved),
tangible assets (investment), or fund current consumption (liquidation).
7.
Intergenerational equity. Recognition of resources as an asset raises intergenerational
equity issues. For example, arguments can be made that future generations would be better
provided for by leaving part of the resource in the ground, by building up financial assets, or by
transforming the resource into other growth enhancing assets such as infrastructure or human
capital. Choices made here will have important ramifications for the fiscal policy strategy and
stance going forward.
8.
Macroeconomic stabilization. Movements in resource revenues due to price
fluctuations affect the domestic economy primarily through public spending.2 If spending adjusts
to the variation in revenue, the overall fiscal balance will remain unchanged but the level of
domestic demand would clearly be altered.
9.
Scaling up spending with capacity constraints. In capital scarce economies, such as
Liberia, a good argument can be made to spend resource revenues on growth-enhancing
investments. However, a sudden influx of resource revenue can strain national capacity, making it
difficult to spend funds in an efficient, transparent manner. Systems, including PFM systems, may
not be able to handle the new revenue volumes. Wasteful and non-productive expenditure may
result unless capacity shortfalls are addressed in a prioritized manner. Where constraints are
binding, a more gradual scaling up of expenditure may be warranted.
10.
Revenue volatility. With weak access to international capital markets, fiscal buffers,
i.e., savings, would be necessary to allow expenditure smoothing when there are large changes in
resource revenues.

III. FISCAL FRAMEWORK OPTIONS
11.
The fiscal framework needs to take account of these abovementioned challenges with a
policy rule or guideline to anchor fiscal policy around an appropriate indicator (Box 2).
Importantly, the anchors used in resource intensive countries frequently differ from those
employed in countries lacking natural resources.

2

But other channels exist as well. For example, higher prices might call forth more accelerated extraction which
could affect domestic demand through greater economic activity at the mine site and through the value chain.
Wealth effects could also play a role.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

Box 2. Fiscal Indicators for Natural Resource Intensive Countries
The choice of fiscal indicator is critical for the adoption of a fiscal rule or guideline.
The overall balance is used in many countries without natural resources in fiscal rules or
guidelines to limit borrowing and assess fiscal vulnerability, including Liberia. However, in a
resource dependent country the overall balance can improve with a fiscal expansion if an
increase in spending is less than the increase in resource revenue,
i.e., it encourages or disguises pro-cyclical fiscal policy.
The non-resource balance (the overall balance minus net resource revenue) preferably
scaled to non-resource GDP is the key fiscal indicator in resource dependent economies. It
measures the government impact on domestic demand and the injection of exported
resource revenue into the economy.
The current balance excludes public investment from the overall balance. A practical
drawback is that it fails to provide a clear anchor for fiscal policy.
12.
The main practical challenge for Liberia is directing the income flows from
exhaustible natural resources towards investment (in both physical and human capital)
while building buffers to cushion against shortfalls in resource income. Countries with
different institutional capacities and economic structures have opted for varying policy
frameworks. These frameworks generally rely on fiscal rules or guidelines to finance development
while building up some savings in stabilization funds and sovereign wealth funds or reserve
funds. There are many frameworks in use and selected country experiences are considered next
(Appendix I summarizes some country examples).

A. Price Based Rules: Chile, Mongolia, Nigeria and Ghana
13.
Price-based rules aim to smooth the usage of resource revenues. They explicitly
tackle resource price volatility. They set commodity reference prices by using a formula (such as a
moving average as in Mongolia) or set by an independent panel (Chile). Revenues in excess of
those expected at the reference price are saved in a stabilization fund (e.g., the excess crude
account in Nigeria) and conditions are set to draw down in the case of shortfalls of revenues. By
setting the price conservatively, or by other supplementary rules, longer term savings could also
be incorporated into a price-based rule as is the intention in Ghana.
14.
Ghana’s petroleum revenue legislation directs most petroleum revenue towards
investment with some financial savings for future generations and for stabilization
purposes. Expected revenue is calculated using a 7 year average of the oil price (benchmark

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

price). All revenues are collected in a petroleum account which directs 70 percent of the oil
revenue calculated at the benchmark price to the budget and the remainder is split between a
stabilization fund and a heritage fund for intergenerational equity. Out of the funds directed to
the budget about 70 percent is allocated towards long-term public investment based on national
development plans and the remaining 30 percent is non-allocated spending. The petroleum act
defines the conditions for the government to tap into the stabilization fund for resources. The
stabilization fund covers up to 75 percent of budget shortfalls due to petroleum revenue
fluctuations.
15.
The emphasis on domestic investment is appropriate if channeled towards projects
with high return, but may raise efficiency issues. Targeting a fixed share of resource income in
capital spending can overwhelm administrative capacity and result in poor project execution
during resource booms. Moreover, the fixed share implies volatility in capital expenditure, which
may complicate accounting while making project budgets vulnerable to resource price shocks.
16.
There have been challenges in implementation. Under the Petroleum Revenue
Management Act (PRMA), the budget should be based on a crude oil reference price for each
year. In 2011, the crude oil reference price was set at US$/bbl 70. It was later revised in a
supplementary budget to US$/bbl 100: substantially reducing higher-than-expected petroleum
revenue to be placed in the petroleum funds (stabilization and heritage). Without political will to
resist such revisions, implementation can go astray.

B. Fiscal Rules on Expenditure: Botswana (since 1994)
17.
Botswana—a diamond exporter— utilizes a fiscal rule, known as the Sustainable
Budget Index (SBI). The SBI stipulates that the ratio of government expenditure, excluding
development spending and recurrent spending on health and education, to non-mineral
revenues should be less than one. This rule is meant to prevent the use of resource income to
directly boost wages and subsidies. It directs resource revenue towards development and human
capital spending (health and education) with the remainder directed to the Pula Fund, which acts
as both a sovereign wealth fund and a stabilization fund. In addition to SBI, Botswana has an
expenditure target equivalent to around 30 percent of GDP.
18.
Botswana’s adherence to the SBI fiscal rule has enjoyed mixed success. The SBI fell
below unity immediately after its introduction in 1994/95. The SBI exceeded unity in 2001/02,
when exceptionally high custom duty revenues during 1999/00–2000/01 came to an end. In
2003/04, however, measures to raise domestic revenue, coupled with across the board cuts in all
expenditures, resulted in a dramatic fall in the SBI.
19.
As in Ghana’s case, the combination of the SBI with the expenditure target has
some limitations. It can result in high volatility in capital expenditure and social spending, and
may result in inefficiencies when administrative and absorptive capacities are limited. At the same

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

LIBERIA

time, the Pula Fund has provided a buffer for the budget, notably during the 2009 financial crisis
when diamond production was halted temporarily.

C. Permanent Income (PI) Approach: Norway, Timor Leste, South Sudan
20.
While there are a number of variants of the permanent income approach, the basic
principle is that consumption is limited to the actual or imputed income from saving
current and future resource revenues. In the case of Norway, petroleum revenues are saved in
a sovereign wealth fund, and spending of these revenues is limited to 4 percent of the stock of
assets in the Fund, i.e., the assumed long term rate of return. A variant of the PI approach, known
as the annuity approach, is used in Timor Leste. The non-oil fiscal balance is set in line with
estimated sustainable income (ESI), which is calculated annually as 3 percent of the sum of the
petroleum fund balance and the present value of expected future petroleum receipts. Deficits
can exceed the ESI if properly justified and approved by Parliament. A more extended discussion
of the PI approach is contained in Annex II, while Annex III illustrates the application of the PI
approach in Liberia using the annuity approach.
21.
A permanent income approach would have some advantages over structural
budget rules including those applied in Ghana and Botswana:


it limits pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy;



it may be more difficult for governments and pressure groups to deviate from the
established rules for reasons of short-term expediency;



it may provide a sustainable long-term fiscal framework to support the development
strategy;



it may provide additional impetus and justification for forming budgets within a mediumterm framework, improving project identification and execution, and concession
monitoring.

22.

However, the PI approach also has some significant limitations:



The spending path in the annuity approach could change dramatically from year to year
if prices are volatile or new reserves identified (Annex III, Figure 3);



There is a limited focus on short term issues, such as the impact of fiscal policy on
demand, inflation and growth;



The PI approach is consumption-based and thus silent on how capital scarce countries
should allocate resources towards critical social spending and high-yielding projects,

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

especially when access to international capital markets is limited.3 For example, if the
return on domestic investment is higher than the return on foreign saving, then a better
economic outcome can be achieved by increasing the expenditure path above that
implied by the PI approach.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND POINTS FOR DISCUSSION
23.
Fiscal frameworks (rules and guidelines) need to change to meet the challenges of
large resource revenues. While resource revenues are not yet large in Liberia, there is a
reasonable argument that the institutional framework should be in place in advance so that the
revenues are used most productively. Another argument is that once revenue starts flowing,
vested interests would resist institutional change.
24.
The price-based or structural rules have an explicit focus on coping with volatility, which
may be useful in the Liberian context.
25.
The permanent income approach is useful in assessing the sustainability of fiscal policies
and elements of it, such as targeting the non-resource fiscal balance, can help sustain long term
fiscal viability. However, permanent income estimates are very sensitive to export price
projections and are thus too volatile to provide a tractable policy benchmark in the case of
Liberia. Moreover, given the massive infrastructure needs and the limited access to international
capital markets, Liberia is in need of policies that direct mineral wealth to public investment,
which lies outside the PI approach’s primary focus on consumption.

Description
A non-oil balance guideline (2004) consistent with constant
real consumption out of oil wealth. Never observed. More
recently reliance on ad-hoc balanced budget oil price.
Complemented by state oil fund.
Structural balance guideline (institutionalized in 2006 fiscal
responsibility law). Adjustment by long-term price of copper and
molybdenum (10-year forecast) as determined by an
independent committee. Targets can be changed over time.
Supported by two funds (stabilization and savings).
Various rules (e.g., non-oil balance, expenditure growth) over
time. More recent rule states that current spending can only be
financed by non-oil revenue (a sort of “non-oil golden rule”). Oil
funds abolished in 2008.
Guideline establishing that current expenditures should be
limited to non-oil revenue. CEMAC convergence criteria: include
various fiscal targets (e.g., a non-oil balance target). It has a fund
for future generations.
A petroleum revenue management framework built around a
stabilization fund and a heritage fund. Benchmark oil revenue is
calculated at a 7-year moving average, with 70 percent used to
finance the budget. Remaining revenue allocated in fixed
proportions to the funds. No fiscal anchor limiting budget deficit.
A ceiling on the structural deficit with structural mineral revenues
estimated using a 16-year moving average of mineral prices.
Combined with a ceiling on expenditure growth defined by the
non-mineral GDP growth rate (useful when structural revenue is
growing fast). The structural balance target can be changed
every four years. Flows to a stability fund linked to difference
between actual and structural revenues.
3 percent of GDP deficit ceiling for federal govt. computed at
budget oil price. Budget oil price set every year in political
negotiations, including with sub-national governments. Excess
crude account receives “windfall” revenues; ad-hoc withdrawals.
“Bird-in-hand” fiscal guideline: the cyclically adjusted non-oil
central government deficit as 4 percent (the expected long-run
real rate of return) of the SWF assets. Guidelines are flexible:
temporary deviations permitted over business cycle or if large
changes in SWF value.
5-year medium-term fiscal strategy that sets a ceiling to the nonmineral deficit in line with “normal” mineral revenue. A portion of
“windfall” mineral revenue (70 percent) can be spent up to a nonmineral deficit ceiling of 8 percent of GDP.
The budget code includes a long-term nonoil deficit target of 4.7
percent of GDP. Annual budgets underpinned by rolling threeyear medium-term fiscal frameworks. Two oil funds (stabilization
and savings).
Fiscal guideline based on PIH framework (constant in real
terms). Non-oil balance set in line with estimated sustainable
income (ESI), which is calculated annually as 3 percent of the
sum of the petroleum fund balance and the present value of
expected future petroleum receipts. Deficits can exceed the ESI
if properly justified and approved by Parliament.

1.
The majority of resource economies manage resource revenue in a less structured
manner through stabilization and savings funds. Both are essentially government accounts
with distinct operating procedures and varying degrees of integration with the budget process:


Stabilization funds seek to stabilize resource revenues over time, but are
non-accumulative as they seek to balance inflows and outflows over a cycle. A typical
methodology is to establish a benchmark price of output as an approximation of a
medium- to long-term average price. On the sale of output, the portion of the revenue
corresponding to the benchmark price is transferred to the budget for spending, with the
excess accruing to the fund. Should the actual price be less than the benchmark, the fund
would subsidize the budget by the amount of the shortfall. Under such a mechanism, the
fund remains solvent provided the benchmark price is not set above the actual average
price observed. The same stabilization function would be performed by funds based on
the permanent income approach, as these are designed to maintain a stable
non-resource fiscal balance.1 Country examples include Chile, Papua New Guinea, and
Venezuela.



Savings funds seek to establish a surplus justified usually on the concept of
intergenerational equity. These surpluses can be mandated in a variety of ways, for
example by the discretionary setting the benchmark price below the actual price or
saving a fixed percentage of receipts (Oman, Alberta), or through adherence to the
permanent income approach as discussed in Annex I.

2.
Funds vary in the degree they are integrated into the budget process. At one
extreme are the Norwegian, Timor-Leste, and South Sudan funds which are essentially
government accounts and institutional arrangements to fund the budget, accumulate savings,
and report on activity. At the other extreme, funds in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Iran and Kuwait
have discretionary authority to expend resources outside the budget process. In the middle
range, some funds are characterized by institutionalized mandates to support specified areas of
the economy. In general, with the exception of developed countries, integrated funds tend to be
more transparent and rules based. They also avoid the pitfalls of dual administrations, conflicting
macroeconomic and expenditure policies, and cumbersome earmarking that have led to a poor
track record of performance in many LICs and prevented conduct of a unified fiscal policy.2
3.
Legislation establishing a fund and defining its policy objectives, operational
objectives, and operational rules can provide strong legal support for the long term fiscal
strategy. Policy objectives include securing macroeconomic stability, ensuring that future
1

This latter stabilization method would be more relevant to Liberia as revenues from iron ore are less directly
linked to output levels than they are in oil sector production sharing agreements.

2

The argument has been advanced that giving a fund independent spending authority may create needed
centers of bureaucratic efficiency in some LICs, but there is little evidence excellence for this.

12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

generations benefit from the resource, enhancing transparency, and improving governance.
Operational objectives are the means by which these policy objectives are achieved and may
include smoothing the variation in resource revenues over time, building up financial assets, and
reporting on operations of the fund. Operational rules are the mechanisms by which these latter
objectives are affected, for example they could comprise rules on the division of resource
revenues between the budget and savings in a given year; rules governing when funds are to be
permanently sequestered for future generations; and rules specifying which reports need to be
produced and on what time frame.
4.
Many attempts at ad hoc stabilization and savings funds failed for reasons of
political economy and capacity constraints long before errors in measurement came into
play. There are numerous examples of resource producing countries being unable to resist
expenditure pressures in the short term, sometimes liquidating mineral wealth to fund current
spending (Venezuela, Nigeria). Moreover, with low capacity leading to poor expenditure
decisions, attempts to transform mineral wealth into tangible productive assets have frequently
led to inefficiency and waste (Ecuador, Nigeria).3
5.
Better management of natural resource revenue is correlated with good
governance, better capacity, and strong public financial management.4 The resource curse
appears most acutely in countries with underdeveloped capacity and poor systems of
governance—intuitively, large revenue inflows would do the least good in countries where they
are treated in a nontransparent manner, spent on wasteful projects or diverted to private use.
General policy implications are to institute measures and reforms aimed at correcting these
deficiencies, including through enhanced transparency and accountability, capacity development,
and institutionalization of the reforms, preferably through legislation.

The economic equivalence of mineral wealth, physical assets, and human capital presupposes government has
sufficient capacity to identify and execute projects efficiently. In the absence of this capacity, spending mineral
revenues can result in the destruction of wealth.

Annex II. Permanent Income Approach
1.
What would fiscal policy look like in a resource rich economy if, over the mediumto long-term, it promotes growth, maintains macroeconomic stability, and preserves
intergenerational equity? The permanent income approach presented below is capable of
accomplishing these three goals. However, there are sizable uncertainties involved that can
complicate practical application.
2.
In the presence of significant resource
revenue, macroeconomic stability is best attained by
having the fiscal target set on the non-resource
fiscal balance. This reflects the preferred treatment of
mineral wealth as an asset, similar in economic terms to
financial wealth.1 Use of the asset should, therefore, be
conceptualized as a financing item in the budget.

Revenue (excluding resource revenue)

Total expenditure
equals
Non-resource fiscal balance
_______________________
Financing:
Changes in net mineral wealth

Outflow of mineral revenue

3.
In a resource economy, it is changes in the
non-resource balance—not the overall balance—that
reflects the impact on domestic demand from fiscal
activity. Maintaining macroeconomic stability would,
therefore, generally require that governments avoid rapid changes in the non-resource fiscal
balance, unless the intention is to provide a well thought out fiscal impulse to the economy. A
transparent fiscal policy would, therefore, require that the budget and fiscal process provide
readily available information on the non-resource balance so that demand forces in the economy
and the underlying fiscal impulse can be clearly understood.
4.
The appropriate size of the non-resource fiscal deficit is linked to the issue of
intergenerational equity.


Intergenerational equity requires that the net present value (NPV) of government
wealth be preserved over time. Wealth is defined in an economic sense, where its
actual form is variable—wealth starts out as the NPV of minerals in the ground, and is
transformed through extraction and sale to financial wealth or human and physical
capital.2 Whatever the form, the value of wealth should theoretically be conserved so that
it can deliver the same real rate of return each year.



The implication is that the size of the non-resource deficit is limited over time to the
permanent income generated by the mineral wealth. This does not, however, preclude

1

In cases where resource revenue has resulted in a sizeable build-up of financial wealth, the appropriate fiscal
target would be the primary non-resource fiscal balance. Note that with resource wealth treated formally as a
financing item, the non-resource fiscal balances collapses to the overall fiscal balance.

Assuming it is not expended in current consumption or destroyed through unproductive investment.

LIBERIA

frontloading of expenditure for productive purposes—in capital-poor countries the
marginal product of capital is high, implying that well designed and efficiently executed
public investment may be the best use of funds. But the requirement of sustainability,
and appropriate institutional arrangements, should force governments to better justify
the front loading and to design fiscal policy that is sustainable within a longer term
framework.
5.
While the permanent income approach is conceptually simple and intuitive,
practical application can be complex and prone to error. Accurate measurement of the base
of the mineral wealth (the actual size and quality of the resource) is difficult. Technologies are
changing—which can affect the cost and profitability of extraction, alter competitive advantage,
and introduce a tail risk that advances in other areas may render the resource redundant. Future
prices are even more uncertain—they are volatile in the short term, with past performance being
a poor predictor of long-term trends. As overly optimistic estimates of mineral wealth can lead to
unsustainable fiscal and debt positions, the need for a relatively conservative approach to
estimation is indicated, with clear procedures in place to justify and alter them when necessary.
6.
There are only a few countries explicitly applying the permanent income approach to
resource revenue:


South Sudan and Timor-Leste estimate the NPV of mineral wealth, and then allow the
budget to use the estimated permanent income arising from this wealth in each year
(rate of return multiplied by NPV of mineral wealth). Essentially, the permanent income
from mineral wealth is set as the non-resource fiscal deficit.3 As exploitation of the
resource is a new phenomenon, this likely implies some front loading of expenditure, as
assets in the funds are as yet insufficient to generate this level of income.



Norway has taken a more conservative “bird in the hand” approach, in which the
non-resource deficit in any year is largely limited to the real return on monetized mineral
wealth already accumulated. As this calculation is not dependent on estimates of the
value of resources in the ground, rates of return, or future prices, it is subject to less
uncertainty, but at a cost of back loading expenditure in favor of future generations.

3

Legislation in Azerbaijan also limits the non-resource (oil) deficit to the permanent income from oil wealth, but
actual practice has deviated from this goal.

Annex III. Application of the Permanent Income Approach in Liberia
1.
Application of the permanent income approach in Liberia would require long term
adherence to a sustainable level of the non-resource deficit. This would not preclude
frontloading the transformation of mineral wealth into productive assets through debt-financed
investment. However, frontloading would need to be demonstrated to be consistent with
macroeconomic stability with safeguards to support efficient expenditure and a sustainable debt
position. Given current capacity constraints, in the short- to medium-term this would be best
provided by borrowing only for well designed donor-supported and designed projects.
2.
As an illustration, the permanent
income approach is applied to the
projected revenues of the existing
ArcelorMittal iron ore mine at Yekepa.
The present value (2011) of the future
stream of revenues is estimated to be
US $2.4 billion. The permanent income from
this is calculated to be US $20 million per
year at constant prices (in current prices the
income would rise by inflation). Permanent
income would be about 1.3 percent of 2011
GDP. As real GDP increases over time the
permanent income relative to GDP would
decline (Figure 1).

no spending in the hand-to-mouth approach, but spending equivalent to the permanent income

continues out of income from past saving in the permanent income approach. Given current
forecasts on iron ore prices, there is limited scope to frontload expenditure (the permanent
income is less than “hand-to-mouth” by the second year); however, the permanent income is
very highly sensitive to forecasts which highlights a key weakness of the methodology (Figure 3).

DRIVERS OF NET INTEREST MARGINS AND BANK
PROFITABILITY IN LIBERIA1
This note provides an analysis of regional drivers of net interest margins (NIMs)—the difference
between interest income acquired by banks and interest costs paid on interest bearing liabilities
such as deposits over total interest bearing assets. The analysis suggests that NIMs in Liberia are
low when considering the high bank operation costs relative to peer countries. This may explain
why indicators of profitability for Liberian banks are significantly lower than in the region.2 This
also suggests that the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) should be mindful of the low bank returns
when using moral suasion to lower bank lending rates as this may weaken the financial system
while pressuring smaller banks out of the credit market. The note presents background on the
Liberian banking system followed by an analysis of the determinants of net interest margins in the
region and implications for Liberia.

BACKGROUND
1.
Bank profitability has been weak in Liberia with returns on equity near zero or
negative during 2003–11 due to:


A weak credit environment with limited supporting infrastructure (the lack of a credit
reference system or credit bureau, no collateral registry, weak property rights, and limited
legal enforcement on debt repayment);



Capacity constraints at banks including poor internal controls and risk management;



High costs of operation;



Absence of a domestic fixed-income securities market to provide a secure investment
instrument;



Low returns on investment abroad or in foreign assets due to loose monetary policy in
advanced countries (Banks are only allowed to invest in foreign assets with very short
maturity and issued by top rated commercial banks and national authorities).

2.
Despite the anemic bank profitability bank lending and deposit rates have been
relatively rigid. While the increase in the number of banks may have played a role in containing
lending rates through competition, Liberia’s banking system is dominated by one bank holding
about 50 percent of commercial bank demand deposits and lends around 40 percent of private
sector credit.

Despite a rapid increase in bank lending, interest income continues to play only a
secondary role in bank revenue. Non-interest income as share of revenue has remained above
50 percent declining by less than 10 percent over 2008–2011, while private credit growth
averaged a brisk 34 percent per year over the same period.

The literature highlights high operational costs relative to assets and weak property
rights as two dominant factors behind relatively high lending margins in sub-Saharan
Africa. We examine the drivers of NIMs in a dynamic panel of 86 banks across six ECOWAS

countries.3 Property rights are generally and similarly weak within the region according to the
World Bank CPIA ratings, which allows us to focus on the impact of operational costs on NIMs
within the sample. We estimate the following two models using Generalized Method of Moments
(GMM) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
(1)




Δ

(2)

Δ

We estimate equation (1) using system GMM–Blundell and Bond (1998) in Table (1) and equation
(2) using system GMM–Arellano and Bond (1991) in Table (2), where NIEPA is non-interest
expense as percent of average interest bearing assets and and
are matrices of control
variables. We also include OLS estimates for each model for robustness.
5.
Both GMM and OLS estimates show that high NIEPA is associated with higher NIMs
across banks while lagged increases in NIEPA are associated with increasing NIMs within
banks (Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, decreasing lagged returns on assets (ROA) are strongly
associated with increasing NIMs (Table 2), which is likely due to banks raising lending rates and
cutting deposit rates when returns weaken.
6.
These results are difficult to reconcile with developments in net interest margins in
Liberia. Operational costs are high in Liberia with an average NIEPA for Liberian banks in the
sample at 21 percent, which is more than one standard deviation above the sample mean of
11 percent. Costs are high in Liberia due to poor infrastructure—with expensive electricity and
limited roads—and lack of human capital. Yet, the cumulative NIM for Liberian banks at
7 percent in 2011 is lower than the 8 percent average NIM for all banks in the sample. Also,
returns on assets and equity have been persistently very low in Liberia relative to the region. In
2011, despite a sharp increase in nonperforming loans, lending and deposit rates have remained
stable while net interest margins declined.

IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBERIA
7.
The analysis shows that overhead costs relative to assets drive net interest margins
across banks in the region, which implies that Liberian banks should be expected to earn
relatively high net interest margins. The Liberian financial system has expanded rapidly since
2006 with banks nearly doubling in number, but most banks remain very small with high
overhead cost and relatively few assets. Moreover, lending is highly concentrated, with two banks
out of a total of nine accounting for nearly 75 percent of demand deposits and private sector
credit, leaving a very small market for most banks. Additionally, poor lending controls and risk
management are raising bank operational risk. While some of these factors are mitigated by
most of the banks being subsidiaries of larger foreign banks that may be able to backstop
liquidity and capital needs if necessary, low profits make the banking environment less attractive
to potential entrants and hampers financial development.
8.
Consequently the analysis raises concerns on the repercussions of the CBL’s policy
to use moral suasion to lower commercial bank lending rates. Small Liberian banks with
higher operational costs relative to size are particularly vulnerable to this policy. Several of the
smaller banks are operating in niche markets such as agriculture and microfinance where credit
risks and operational costs are higher. The exercise of moral suasion on the small banks may risk
pressuring them out of the credit market and discourage them from expanding operations,
which would hamper competition. Additionally, this policy may exacerbate banking sector
fragilities stemming from the anemic returns.

LIBERIA: THE INVESTMENT-FINANCING-GROWTH
NEXUS1
INTRODUCTION
1.
The Government of Liberia has set an ambitious agenda to transform the Liberian
economy and to reach middle-income country status by 2030, the underlying goal of their
second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS2). The authorities’ strategy focuses on achieving
accelerated broad-based growth by scaling up investment in infrastructure and human capital.
As in other low-income countries, the question is how fast public investment should be scaled up
to address massive infrastructure gaps and developmental needs and the trade-offs and
potential risks associated with different financing options and the required changes in fiscal
policy.
2.
To address this question, we examine some preliminary results from simulations of
an inter-temporal macroeconomic model used to explore the nexus between public
investment, financing, and growth. The model is designed to capture the features of low
income countries (LICs) like Liberia and, where possible, has been calibrated using Liberian
economic data. The analysis presented here complements the standard IMF-World Bank debt
sustainability analysis.
3.
The model used in this note assumes that public investment has a high economic
and social rate of return and is highly complementary toward private sector investment. An
increase in public investment therefore provides both a direct and an indirect boost to GDP
growth. The model accommodates different methods of financing the investment buildup. The
government may increase taxes (or reduce transfer payment), borrow from domestic markets, or
borrow on international commercial markets. Concessional financing, which has so far been the
primary source for Liberia, is included as an exogenous input to the model. The model also
incorporates assumptions about efficiency of public expenditure (i.e. the rate at which executed
investment translates into productive capital). For different levels of public investment, and
assumptions about minimum available financing and efficiency of public investment, the model
generates different financing options, the size of the fiscal adjustment needed, and the trade-offs
on the long term path of public debt and growth.

4.
The exercise yields three main policy conclusions. First, the efficiency of public
investment is important for raising the growth dividend from higher investment spending.
Second, the rapid investment strategy (one in which investment is scaled up by an annual
average of 14 percent of GDP) will cause debt to rise to over 100 percent of GDP if the
government is not able to secure enough grants or to create enough fiscal space. Finally, a
moderate to high scaling up of investment (by an annual average of 9 percent of GDP) is feasible,
though it may still push debt to near its statutory limit and must be planned carefully.
5.
The note is organized as follows: the first section provides some background on
Liberia, focusing on the infrastructure and human capital needs and the government’s strategy to
address these needs. The second section provides a brief, non-technical overview of the model.
The third section discusses the simulations, their key results, and the tradeoffs involved in each.
The note ends with some concluding remarks.

I.

BACKGROUND

6.
Liberia’s infrastructure suffered major damage during a 17-year civil war. The
country’s hydropower plant was virtually destroyed leaving the country in darkness. Roads were
neglected, bringing trade to a complete halt while limiting the population’s access to public
services. Schools and health facilities were damaged and public institutions were abandoned,
greatly affecting the country’s standard of living. Along with a deteriorated infrastructure,
Liberia’s managerial capacity to execute infrastructure projects was completely undermined as
qualified staff fled the country.
7.
Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 2003, Liberia has recorded solid economic
growth averaging 7.4 percent over this nine-year period. While this result may well reflect an
initial boost associated with the recovery after the massive losses during civil war, since 2009 real
economic growth has averaged 7 percent driven mostly by non-mining activities. Going forward,
it is expected that the mining sector will become a more important source of growth, which is
estimated to stabilize at around 6 percent.

While public investment in Liberia reached

Liberia is a fragile state with massive infrastructure gaps and developmental needs:



Per capita income is very low with 84 percent of the population in poverty
($1.25 per day);



Employment creation has been low; according to the 2010 Liberia Labor Force Survey,
68 percent of employed Liberians work in the informal sector;



Child mortality rate, under five, is 103 per 1,000, while the maternal mortality rate is high
at 770 per 100,000 births, both of which are high compared to neighboring countries;



Pipe-borne water—the main source of drinking water—is low and water deficiency is
about 61 percent of the population. Improved sanitation (percent of population with
access) is very low at only 17 percent of the population;



Years of war affected the education system which needs to be rebuilt to deliver quality
practical and vocational training. The adult literacy rate (percent of people ages 15+) is
59 percent;



Liberia ranks at the bottom of the UN’s Human Development Index (182 out of
187 countries in 2011);



Infrastructure is weak. The country currently produces 23MW of electricity covering just
2–3 percent of the population and at the highest price in the world, access to electricity is
also a constraint to small-scale manufacturing and industrial enterprises; poor roads are
an impediment to trade (both domestic and cross-border) and a constraint to access
public services such as education and health, especially during the rainy season;



Aid flows are around 39 percent of GDP, including some 2 percent of GDP for budget
support.

10.
Liberia successfully reached the completion point under the HIPC initiative in June
2010, helping the country to bring down its external debt from close to 150 percent of
GDP to less than 9 percent. The government’s tax collections have increased substantially over
the last six years (from 11 percent of GDP in FY 2005/06 to 22 percent of GDP in 2011/12) which
together with the fiscal space created by the debt relief provides an important opportunity to
increase public investment.
11.
The government has laid out a five-year development plan in support of the
country’s goal to achieve middle income status by 2030 incorporated in its PRS2. The plan
focuses on five strategic pillars—at an estimated cost of $3.3 billion over FY 2012/13 to
FY 2016/17—to increase productivity, boost economic growth, and improve social inclusion—
particularly among youth. The pillars are


Economic transformation through investing in infrastructure, particularly rehabilitation of
the hydropower plant and related transmission and distribution networks destroyed
during the civil war, improvement of trunk roads, and rehabilitation and expansion of

27

LIBERIA

ports, and improvement in the information and communications technology. Total
infrastructure investment needed is estimated at $2.2 billion, including $1.4 billion for
roads and $0.5 billion in the energy sector, of which $0.2 billion is needed for the
hydropower plant.


Human development. The strategy aims to increase access and improve the quality of
education and health, provide social protection for vulnerable persons, and rehabilitate
and expand the infrastructure in water and sanitation. The estimated cost is $0.5 billion.



Peace, security, and the rule of law. The Government will need to invest in the security
sector to maintain a stable and peaceful environment as UN forces (UNMIL) drawdown.
The expected cost is $0.4 billion.



Governance and public institutions. The government plans to invest US $0.1 billion on the
public sector modernization and reform agenda, decentralization and local governance,
efforts and enhancing transparency and accountability.



Cross cutting issues. The government intends to invest some $0.1 billion to develop youth
skills and increase empowerment, child protection, gender equality, and human rights’
protection.

It is estimated that the government will contribute between 12–15 percent of the financing
required to fully implement the investment program. The remaining 85–88 percent is still
unfunded. The authorities are planning a pledging donors’ conference in late 2012 to secure
both loans and grants to fully execute its development strategy. The model below can be used to
assess the trade-offs of alternative financing options for PRS2.

II. THE MODEL
12.
The model is a small two-sector open economy framework. A complete technical
explanation of the model can be found in Buffie et al. (2012). What follows is an outline of the
key features of the model.
Consumers
13.
The economy is populated with two types of agents: savers, who have access to
capital markets and inter-temporally optimize consumption and labor, and non-savers, who
operate by a rule of thumb and simply consume what they earn each period.
Savers
14.
Each period, savers maximize the present discounted value of their lifetime utility
(which is just a function of consumption) by choosing how much to consume, how much to
invest, and how much debt to incur, all subject to a budget constraint.
15.
Savers receive income from: renting capital to firms (both traded- and non-traded
goods firms); wages earned on the labor market; remittances, which act as transfer payment from
the rest of the world; and net government transfers (other taxes net of current spending). They
pay for: a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) basket of consumption goods; a tax on
consumption; investment in new capital as well as the adjustment cost of changing the capital
stock; the cost of servicing debt (both domestic and foreign) and adjusting their debt portfolio;
and user fees on public infrastructure.
16.
The savers’ optimization problem yields standard results. The path of consumption
depends on the real interest rate and the level of the tax on consumption. There are also three
arbitrage conditions. The real interest rate on domestic bonds is equal to the real interest rate on
foreign bonds, adjusted by portfolio costs. Additionally, the return on capital in the traded and
non-traded sector, net of capital adjustment costs, must equal the real interest rate.
17.
The portfolio adjustment costs allow the model to capture an important feature of
the market for debt in LICs. Steep adjustment costs reflect the immobility of capital in LICs,
where the private sector has a limited ability to borrow overseas and the capital account is fairly
closed.
Non-Savers
18.
Savers are additionally constrained by an inability to access capital markets, and
thus they do not smooth consumption over time. Because there is no formal optimization
problem for non-savers, their labor supply is fixed in each period. Income comes from wages,
remittances, and government transfers. Each period, non-savers purchase a CES basket of goods
and consume it in its entirety.

LIBERIA

19.
We incorporate non-saving households to add an element of reality to the model,
given the high proportion of households in LICs that consume hand-to-mouth. The addition
of these rule-of-thumb consumers into the model allows for realistic non-Ricardian outcomes.
Firms
20.
The economy is divided into traded and non-traded goods sectors, each populated
by representative firms. These firms use Cobb-Douglas technology to produce output taking as
inputs labor, private capital, and effectively-produced public capital:
,

,

,

,

,

Here, q is the quantity of goods produced, A is aggregate factor productivity, z is public
investment, k is private capital, and L is labor. Each of these factors is sector-specific (denoted by
the subscript j).
21.
Inputs to production are bought in competitive markets, so profit-maximizing
firms pay the marginal products for each. Labor is inter-sectorally mobile, but capital is
sector-specific. In equilibrium, the rental rate for each type of capital is the same, though the
prices will not follow the same transition paths.
22.
The form of the production function captures the complementarities between
public and private capital. All else being equal, as the stock of effective public capital increases,
the return on private investment and labor both increase. For any investment scaling-up, then,
GDP rises by accounting identity logic, where government investment is an additive component
of output, but also by increasing the incentives for private investment and labor to rise as well.
The Government
Public Investment
23.
Public investment can be thought of as a two-step process. In the first step, the
government invests in public infrastructure according to a standard accumulation equation:
1

.

,

Here, δ is the depreciation rate of public capital, and i is the level of investment in capital. In the
second step, a portion of the public infrastructure is converted into effectively productive capital
that firms use as an input to production:
.
The bar denotes variables at initial steady state and s is a parameter that governs the portion of
infrastructure that is converted to effectively productive capital. Given that s lies on the unit
interval, this feature of the model implies that one dollar of additional public investment

30 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

translates to less than one dollar of effectively produced capital.2 Note that only effective public
capital increases the return on private investment by entering into the production function.
The Budget Constraint
24.
The government budget constraint requires that spending on transfers (current
spending), debt service, and infrastructure investment not exceed revenue collected from
a consumption tax and from user fees on infrastructure.3 When revenues do not meet
expenditures, the resulting fiscal gap is financed through domestic borrowing, external
concessional borrowing, or external commercial borrowing. External grants can also be used to
finance the budget. Below, we show simulations with realistic assumptions about grants to
explore their effect on the debt profile required for investment.
25.
The expenditure side of the budget constraint also contains a term meant to
capture cost overruns on public infrastructure investment. LICs have a shortage of skilled
administrators, leading to public projects that are slowed by poor planning, weak oversight, or
coordination problems.
26.
The interest rate on domestic debt is (quite obviously) the domestic interest rate.
The interest rate on concessional debt is assumed to be a constant negotiated rate. The interest
rate on external commercial debt varies proportionally to a risk premium, defined as the ratio of
the external public debt-to-GDP ratio to its initial steady state.
Fiscal Adjustment
27.
The difference between revenues and expenditures is the fiscal gap, which can be
financed in the short run by borrowing or by fiscal adjustment (i.e., taxes and transfers). In
the long run, though, the tax on consumption and transfer spending must adjust to cover the
entire gap.
28.
The core policy dilemma facing policymakers is the speed with which this fiscal gap
is covered. Sharp increases in the consumption tax or cuts in transfer payments are obviously
painful, and policymakers would like to avoid them. If the government does not react quickly
enough, or if tax increases or spending cuts are capped at restrictively low levels, interest
payments on the debt will rise faster than net government revenue, causing debt to increase
explosively.

2

Empirical analysis shows that the productivity of infrastructure is high while the return on public investment is
low, because not all infrastructure spending becomes public capital. See Hulten (1996) and Pritchett (2000) for
details.
3

User fees capture a fraction of the recurrent costs of maintaining public capital (i.e., maintenance and upkeep
caused by capital depreciation). This feature is not meant to represent a public-private partnership model where
user fees capture the cost of financing the infrastructure.

The table below shows the main variables for Liberia. Real per capita economic
growth is assumed to be 3 percent, which reflects the average for 2009–11, which was selected to
be representative as it includes two consecutive years of slow growth (2009–2010) and one year
with rapid growth (2011). Given information for Liberia is limited, the value added in the
non-tradable sector was set at 49.4 percent as suggested by the model.

III. MODEL SIMULATION AND RESULTS
30.
A set of twelve simulations (see attached charts) demonstrate the impact on
growth and debt levels of different assumptions regarding the investment path and its
financing. Starting from the steady state level of public investment of 4 percent of GDP, the
baseline assumes a moderate scaling up of public investment (by 5.5 percentage points of GDP
per year over seven years). We also tested for intermediate scaling up of public investment (by 9
percentage points of GDP per year) and a rapid scaling up (by an annual average of
14 percentage points of GDP per year). In turn, each of the three scaling up assumptions were
tested for different financing options and different assumed efficiency of public investment. The
twelve scenarios are as follows:
a. Baseline (moderate) scaling-up in which the public investment efficiency rate is
60 percent: the financing needs are closed with concessional borrowing.
b. Baseline (moderate) scaling-up in which the public investment efficiency rate is
60 percent: the financing needs are closed with concessional borrowing and some
domestic financing.
c.

Baseline (moderate) scaling-up in which the public investment efficiency rate
increases to 80 percent: the fiscal gap is still closed with concessional borrowing.

The table below shows the cumulative boost to real per capita GDP growth from
each of the scenarios relative to the assumed steady-state growth rate of 3 percent, as well
as the impact of the scenarios on public debt. For assessment purposes, we present here only
those scenarios which are most interesting for policy consideration and focus the analysis on the
investment-financing-growth nexus.

32.
The baseline scenario (moderate scaling up of public investment) assumes that
concessional borrowing is the main source of financing and there are no changes in tax
policies or changes in the current level of grants for budget support. Under this scenario, an
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

LIBERIA

average increase of 5.5 percentage points of GDP in investment per annum over a seven year
period contributes to an approximately 1 percentage point increase in the annual growth rate of
real per capita income on average over ten years. The growth effect peaks 3–4 years after the
initial investment and then gradually declines over time returning to trend growth. The
cumulative growth dividend to year-on-year per capita growth equals 9 percent over a 10-year
horizon with central government total debt estimated to reach approximately 42 percent of GDP
at the end of year 10 compared to 11.7 percent of GDP in FY2011/12.
33.
We tested for the impact on growth and the debt dynamics of including domestic
financing as a source of financing public investment (scenario b). In line with government
policies in Liberia, we assumed that the government is able to raise, on an annual basis, 1 percent
of GDP in funds in the domestic market. Under this scenario, the crowding out of private
investment limits the cumulative growth dividend over a 10 year period to 6.7 percent and
worsens the country’s debt dynamics.

We also ran scenarios on the baseline for changes in the efficiency of public

From an assumed efficiency rate of public investment of 60 percent in the baseline
scenario—the average for low income countries—we tested for higher efficiency rate of 80
percent (scenario c). If the government can increase the efficiency of its public investment, this

34 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

can further boost economic growth and moderately improve debt dynamics. Under the higher
efficiency scenario, real per capita income growth could potentially increase by an additional half
percentage point over the medium term. Getting to higher growth faster, in turn, would improve
Liberia’s debt dynamics. On the other hand, the same amount of investment with a lower
efficiency rate of 20 percent (scenario d) would result in lower per capita growth and moderately
weaker debt dynamics. These results point to the critical need for stepped up efforts to tackle
bottlenecks to project implementation in Liberia.

36.
The results of other scenarios are as follows. In scenario e (intermediate investment
strategy), the government is able to secure new grants for budget support equivalent to an
additional annual average of 2 percent of GDP to help finance the medium term investment plan.
Still, the government needs to continue relying on concessional borrowing within the limits set
by the Public Financial Management Act Regulations, which sets the ceiling on public debt to 60
percent of GDP. Under this scenario, the growth dividend to per capita GDP over a 10 year
period is 13.1 percent, very similar to the high efficiency rate simulation.
37.
Scenario f (intermediate investment strategy) assumes the financing gap is closed by
a combination of additional grants and changes in taxes. Under this strategy, the cumulative
boost to real per capita growth is approximately 10.5 percent, relatively close to the baseline
scenario a. In this case, the population has access to a larger infrastructure level, but the increase
in taxes required to close the financing gap constrains consumption, thus limiting the impact on
growth.
38.
Scenarios h and i represent the government’s rapid investment build-up strategy
with the financing gap closed entirely with either concessional or commercial borrowing,
respectively. Under these two scenarios, the increase in public investment contributes to a boost
in consumption and private investment to the highest possible levels in the medium term,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

LIBERIA

increasing the growth dividend between 19–21 percent. However, this strategy comes at the
expense of mounting total public debt to unsustainable levels (between 97–108 percent of GDP),
especially in the case of commercial borrowing, which, in the long run, will require large changes
in taxes and transfers to service such debt.
39.
Scenario k (rapid investment strategy) assumes the government is able to secure
2 percent of GDP in new grants for budget support, but not enough to close the estimated
financing gap. In this case, the government is required to adjust the consumption tax from the
start while still resorting to some additional concessional borrowing beyond what is assumed in
the baseline scaling up scenario. The growth dividend in real per capita GDP over a 10-year
period is approximately 15.6 percent with public debt peaking at 52 percent of GDP.
40.
The various scenarios have some caveats. For Liberia, several of the parameters were
borrowed from previous work on other LICs and Liberia-specific parameters should be treated
with caution due to limited data availability. In addition, the model abstracts away from reality
(e.g., only two types of consumers, agents with perfect foresight, etc.). Hence, the estimates
should be seen only as a first approximation as the model should not be seen as a forecasting
tool. Finally, other shocks not discussed here have the potential to change the estimates, either
positively or negatively depending on the nature of the shock (i.e., a global recession or a
productivity shock in Liberia).
41.
Previous work on the investment-growth nexus in Liberia points to a positive but
smaller impact from scaling up investment on growth. Yoon and Lane (2009), who focused on
the macroeconomic impact of scaling up aid, found that increasing aid would have a positive,
albeit limited, effect on the Liberian economy rate of growth. They estimated that increasing
foreign aid by 5 percentage points of GDP only contributed to an average increase of
0.16 percent per year in growth over a 10 year period. One factor that contributed to such a
lower impact compared to current work is that their analysis assumed that only 30 percent of aid
was allocated to investment while the rest was directed to cover current spending, in particular
for services paid abroad.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
42.
The simulations presented here capture some of the costs and benefits of the three
potential investment strategies. The model results provide background to support the
government’s objectives and expectations to scale up public investment to stimulate the
economy while flagging the risks related to debt sustainability.
43.
Some caution is required when interpreting the simulations presented here. Liberian
data is limited, the model relies on some average parameters calculated for other LICs, and, it
abstracts away from reality (e.g., only two types of consumers, agents with perfect foresight, etc.).
Thus the results should be interpreted with this in mind. All that being said, the model helps to
gauge the relative costs and benefits of various investment and financing scenarios.

36 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

44.
As expected, the more ambitious investment program yields the larger growth
dividend over the medium term, but it comes at the risk of unsustainable debt; hence
assessing other options is warranted. The intermediate scaling up option in which the
government is able to secure some 2 percentage points of GDP in new grants for budget support
results in stronger growth dividends and more stable debt dynamics.
45.
In addition to securing the ideal balance of financing options, there is a critical
need to increase the efficiency of public investment in Liberia. The government needs to
step up efforts to tackle bottlenecks to project implementation and even more importantly to
properly prioritize and select high return projects that effectively translate into productive capital.
46.
Adjustments in taxes or in current spending (net transfers) may be painful policies
which may have high political costs but may be required to successfully implement the
government’s PRS2. The authorities are rightly focusing on creating fiscal space to scale up
public investment, but further efforts to streamlining current spending are warranted.

Safeguards Assessment

A 2011 update assessment of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) found strengthened safeguards in
place, including through the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), independent external audits, and effective oversight of audit and control matters by the
Board of Governors and its Audit Committee. Continued progress and development of relevant
safeguards will be needed with the envisaged expansion of reserves and cash management
activities. Also, the respective rights and obligations of the government and the CBL regarding
IMF transactions need to be clarified and transparently disclosed in the CBL financial statements.
10.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Liberia maintains an exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on payments for current and
capital transfers. The currency of Liberia is the Liberian dollar. The U.S. dollar is also legal tender.
The exchange rate showed limited mobility for most of 2011 resulting in a short lived reclassification of the de facto exchange rate regime to ‘stabilized arrangement’ effective January
5, 2011. The de facto exchange rate regime was re-classified back to ‘other managed’ effective
November 7, 2011 as the Liberian dollar diverged from the 2 percent six months band. The de
jure exchange rate regime classification remains ‘managed floating’. The exchange rate between
the Liberian dollar and United States dollar at end-July 2012 was L$73.50=US$1 (mid-point
between buying and selling rates)

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of September 4, 2012)
The overarching aim of the Joint Country Assistance Strategy2 (JCAS) presented to the Board of
the World Bank Group on April 21, 2009 is to support Liberia’s transition from post conflict
recovery to long-term development. More specifically, the JCAS, which is fully aligned with the
Africa Regional Strategy and the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), focused on
three strategic objectives: (i) rebuilding core state functions and institutions; (ii) rehabilitating
infrastructure to sustain economic growth; and (iii) facilitating pro-poor growth. The World
Bank’s program under the JCAS involved a combination of development policy lending,
investment lending and analytical work in support of the three strategic objectives.
The World Bank’s indicative IDA financing for the JCAS (FY09–FY11) was US $298.0 million. With
the addition of some US $120 million under the Liberia Reconstruction Trust Funds managed by
the Bank, as well as other trust funds, the actual financing under the JCAS program is
approximately US $530 million. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) net commitment
under the JCAS was about US $16.4 million with a program focused on: improvement of the
investment climate; improving the dialogue between the government and the private sector;

strengthening the financial sector; supporting private participation in the economy by financing
selected private sector companies in identified priority sectors including agribusiness,
infrastructure, mining and manufacturing; and supporting the sustainable development of small
and medium-sized enterprises.
A progress report presented to the Board on July 7, 2011 extends the current Joint Country
Assistance Strategy to end FY12 to coincide with the launching of Liberia’s Agenda for
Transformation. The Liberia indicative allocation for the IDA16 period (July 2011–June 2014) is
SDR 117.5 million, an increase of 18 percent over the IDA 15 allocation. The preparation of the
new five-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13–17 is underway and it is expected that
the CPS will be presented to the World Bank’s Board in mid-December 2012.

A. Active Projects
There are currently twelve active3 IDA projects in Liberia, including three regional projects, with a
total commitment of approximately US$310.6 million of which US $145.6 million is undisbursed.
Five new operations (credits) were approved in FY12 (ending June 30, 2012) for a total
commitment of approximately US $191.5 million. The five new credits are summarized below:
The Liberia Smallholder Tree Crop Revitalization Support Project was approved on
June 15, 2012 for US $15 million. The objective of the project is to increase access to finance,
inputs, technologies and markets for smallholder tree crop farmers in Liberia, and to develop a
long term development program for the tree crops sector. The project has three primary
components, first of which focuses on the revitalizing the production and marketing of major
tree crops including cocoa, coffee, oil palm and rubber. The second component of the project
focuses on (i) institution building, including strengthening key public and private institutions
involved in project planning, implementation and coordination and (ii) the preparation and
validation of a master plan for targeted tree crops. The third component of the project is
concerned with project coordination, management and evaluation.
The West African Power Pool (WAPP)-Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea
Power Interconnection Project a regional energy project was approved in May 2012 for
US$144.5 million. The project’s development objectives are: (i) to reduce the cost of and increase

the electricity supply at utility level; and (ii) to increase the export capability of Cote d’Ivoire. The
project consists of two sub-projects which will be implemented independently. The first project
which focuses on the WAPP power interconnection has two major components. The first
component addresses the transmission infrastructure for the interconnection with Cote d’Ivoire,
Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea. Such infrastructure will include the overhead transmission line,
the substations, the supervisory control and data system, frequency control system as well as the
environmental and social management plan. The second component of the first sub-project
addresses institutional framework (including the establishment of a regional transmission
company) and project oversight. The second sub-project provides technical assistance to
support the integration of the WAPP network; for technical studies and to build implementation
capacity.
The Liberia Electricity System Enhancement Project (LESEP)-Additional Financing was
approved in January 2012 for US$22 million. The objective of the Additional Financing for the
Electricity System Enhancement Project is to improve and increase access to electricity in Liberia.
The additional financing will provide for additional or expanded activities to scale up project's
impact and development effectiveness in the following areas: 1) distribution network
reinforcement and extension; 2) enhancing options for power generation through the
procurement of a thermal power plant of approximately 10MW; and 3) providing modern
renewable energy services through a Global Environment Facility (GEF) financed lantern
exchange program.
Liberia Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project was approved in December
2011 for US $5 million of IDA resources and approximately US $23.5 million of cofinancing from
the African Development Bank, United States Agency for International Development, and
Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. The development objective of the
project is improved budget coverage, fiscal policy management, financial control, and oversight
of government finances of Liberia. The project has five components. The first component of the
project focuses on enhancing budget planning systems, coverage, and credibility. The second
component of the project is aimed at strengthening Project Financial Management (PFM) legal
framework, budget execution, accounting, and reporting. The third component of the project
focuses on revenue mobilization and administration. The fourth component of the project deals
with enhancing transparency and accountability. The fifth and final component of the project
addresses program governance and project management.

Liberia Fourth Reengagement and Reform Support Program was approved in October 2011
for US $5 million. The objectives of the operation are to support government-owned ongoing
reforms to strengthen governance and improve the environment for private sector-led inclusive
growth. More specifically, the RRSPIV focuses on: (i) improving the capacity for and transparency
of public procurement; (ii) improving internal control procedures and the capacity for internal
audit; (iii) improving revenue administration; and (iv) improving land administration to reduce
conflicts and enhance the investment climate.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The World Bank has completed a series of on-demand analytical studies to support the
preparation of the next Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)—Agenda for Transformation.
This PRS is the first strategy in the context of the Government long-term vision plan—Liberia
Rising 2030 which aims to take Liberia to middle income status by 2030. The analytical work
includes: (i) a policy note describing underlying assumptions and baseline outcomes generated
using a general equilibrium model (MAMS). The model was used to simulate the medium to long
term impact of various policy alternatives on key macro variables as well as MDGs; (ii) an
inclusive growth diagnostic study to assess binding constraints to economic activity in Liberia;
(iii) an analysis of the options for leveraging investment activities and rents from the extractive
sectors to support the development of the domestic private sector; (iv) an infrastructure
diagnostics intended to help answer two key policy concerns: (a) how to prioritize infrastructure
investments for economic diversification; and (b) how to leverage concessions contract for
infrastructure development in Liberia; (v) a preliminary diagnostic of the state of social protection
in Liberia and a comprehensive inventory on social protection interventions as a basis for debate
and discussion towards the formulation of an effective social protection policy and strategy; and
(vi) a Poverty Note to provide detailed analysis of some of the key determinants of poverty in
Liberia and how these interact, particularly at the household level. Second on the basis of the
analysis identified evidence-based policy options for reducing poverty. The World Bank is also
providing technical assistance for the preparation of the Agenda for Transformation and the
compilation of the national accounts in collaboration with the IMF.

smallholder farmers and rural entrepreneurs particularly women, youths and the physicallychallenged. SAPEC will be implemented in 12 of the 15 political subdivisions or counties of
Liberia over the 2012–2017 timeframe. The project seeks to scale-up the on-going Agricultural
Sector Rehabilitation Project (ASRP) by operating in 8 of the 12 counties where the ASRP is being
implemented. The 3 uncovered counties are programmed for similar interventions by the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), World Bank (WB) and other donors. The
project consists of four components, namely: (i) Sustainable Crop Production Intensification;
(ii) Value Addition and Marketing; (iii) Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening; and
(iv) Project Management.

The Labour-Based Public Works Project (LBPWP): The UA 20.24 million grant project

aims to contribute to the improvement of productive livelihoods and service delivery. The project
objective is to rehabilitate socio-economic infrastructure and improve capacities for
infrastructure maintenance. Its components are: i) Rehabilitation of Socio-Economic
Infrastructure; and ii) Capacity Development for Infrastructure Maintenance; and iii) Project
Management. In 2011 the Bank provided a UA 5.00 million supplementary grant from the Fragile
States Facility (FSF) to enable the financing of additional costs resulting from improved designs
of the project infrastructure.
10.

Liberia Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI): The project will involve a credit

facility by the ADB of up to US $5 million in the form of a subordinated debt. This will provide
LBDI with the required funding to meet the increasing demand for long-term financing from
certain key sectors of the Liberian economy including SMEs, services, construction, agribusiness
and light manufacturing. The loan is not yet effective for disbursement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of September 30, 2012)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings
are most serious in the areas of national accounts, government finance, and balance of
payments statistics.
National Accounts: Comprehensive national accounts data are not available. Fund staff estimate
GDP by activity using the production approach and primary source data provided by the Liberia
Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS). Estimates for GDP by expenditure
are not available. Liberia participates in the National Accounts Module of the UK Department for
International Development supported Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI), which aims
to strengthen annual national accounts, and to improve price statistics. The national business
register and national accounts questionnaires were established in December 2008. In 2009, the
LISGIS conducted the first post-war National Accounts Annual Survey (NAAS) and collected
information for the calendar year 2008. This survey had problems with low response rates and
the results from the survey have not been published yet. A second round of so-called National
Accounts Annual Survey (NAAS 2012) was conducted during July-August, 2012 and collected
information for the years 2010 and 2011. Following a request from the authorities, an STA
mission assisted the LISGIS in successfully conducting the field operations of the survey which
resulted in a response rate of around 98 percent. The World Bank has also appointed a
consultant to guide the LISGIS in various aspects of the survey. There are, however, challenges in
estimating informal sector activities. A Household Income and Expenditure (HIES) Survey
planned for 2012 will provide data from which such estimates may be developed. Supply and
use tables (SUT) for 2008 were independently developed by a World Bank consultant to provide
a benchmark estimate of GDP. The Liberian authorities requested STA to make an assessment of
the SUT estimates. After a desk-based review of the results, STA noted that the SUT estimates for
2008 are not sufficiently robust to be published as official statistics and should be considered as
experimental. The assessment took into account the lack of basic information and the use of
many imputations and adjustments in the compilation process. It was stressed that such research
results, however, serve to generate discussion with interested users and may, with appropriate
improvements to source data and methodology, develop into official estimates. Through its
technical assistance missions within the EDDI project, STA will continue to provide guidance on
the use of existing and new source data to compile national accounts estimates and to build
capacity in LISGIS to produce reliable national accounts statistics on an ongoing basis. With
improved data sources (especially NAAS 2012 and HIES), it is expected that reliable GDP
estimates should be available by 2014.
Price statistics: A consumer price index for Monrovia has been compiled since 2005. The
Harmonized Consumer Price Index providing national coverage was officially adopted in 2007.

Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance regularly provides the African
Department with monthly disaggregated data on budgetary central government revenue
recorded on a cash basis, and expenditure recorded on both cash and commitment bases. While
they are in the process of phasing-in the GFSM 2001 framework, there is still a number of areas
where the government finance statistics need to be improved: lack of legal framework to collect
statistics; limited data sharing and coordination among data producing agencies; inconsistent
institutional coverage of the statistics with other datasets (e.g., national accounts and monetary
statistics); omission of nonmonetary transactions; limited data on stocks of financial assets,
liabilities, and arrears; and incorrect reference exchange rate to convert data from Liberian
dollars to U.S. dollars.
Monetary statistics: The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) has made progress in adopting the
statistical methodology recommended by the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM). However, the reporting of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) has been suspended
since September 2010. STA missions in March 2010 and August 2011 assisted authorities in
advancing the introduction of standardized report forms (SRFs) and collecting data from
commercial banks in accordance with the methodology in the MFSM. The CBL agreed to start
reporting the SRFs for the central bank, other depository corporations, and monetary aggregates
by end-December 2011. However, no data in the format of SRFs have been received by STA.
Instead, in June 2012, the CBL renewed reporting of monetary data in the old format. The latest
available data are for July 2012.
Balance of payments: Reporting is not comprehensive, and Fund staff prepares provisional
balance of payments statistics for surveillance. Although some progress in collecting and
reporting data has been made with STA support, there still remain several areas that need
improvement particularly with regard to primary source data, methodology, compilation
practices, and frequency and timeliness in data dissemination. Additionally, coverage needs to
be improved, especially for: i) foreign direct investment, including direct investment in kind, that
is likely to become significant as plans are underway for foreign companies to invest in mining
activities; ii) technical assistance services, development aid, and compensation paid to locally
employed workers of international organizations, which have a very large presence in Liberia;
iii) banking sector transactions, as relevant monetary and financial statistics data are not used for
balance of payments and there is a lack of financial account entries for the banking sector; and
iv) other areas such as remittances, investment income, and the overall coverage of the financial
account.

ANALYSIS1

1

The Debt Sustainability Analysis which incorporates an
increase in borrowing and public investment indicates that
Liberia continues to have a low risk of debt distress. The
macroeconomic assumptions are underpinned by
developments in the iron ore sector. In the near term,
foreign financed investment provides a boost to growth
and leads to a widening of the current account deficit.
Going forward, an increase in iron ore exports and a
winding down of import-intensive investments support a
narrowing in the current account. Consistent with the
Government of Liberia’s debt management policy, the DSA
assumes a ceiling on annual foreign currency borrowing of
4 percent of GDP in present value terms to support public
investment, particularly in energy and transportation
infrastructure. The projected present value of the external
debt stock would remain low and sustainable with all debt
indicators below the policy-related thresholds.

The LIC-DSA incorporates the following general assumptions: (i) the discount rate is fixed at 4 percent; (ii) the

exchange rates are based on WEO assumptions; and (iii) the risk of debt distress based on country-specific
policy-dependent thresholds, based on the country’s CPIA index, which for Liberia is 3.0. All data refers to the
fiscal year which runs from July to June.

I. KEY ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO
1.

Liberia has recorded solid macroeconomic performance and is increasing external

borrowing for key public investment projects while maintaining low debt vulnerabilities.
Having achieved HIPC completion point in June 2010 and successful completion of the three-year
IMF Extended-Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement, the authorities are now focused on scaling-up
much needed public investment, especially in energy and transport infrastructure. Increasing foreign
currency borrowing to 4 percent of GDP in PV terms is in line with maintaining low debt
vulnerabilities while providing room for higher public investment. External debt would rise to
27 percent of GDP in 2014/15, from 10 percent of GDP in 2011/12. Central government domestic
debt at 17.6 percent of GDP in 2011/12, of which 95 percent is foreign currency denominated, is
expected to gradually fall to 12.8 percent by 2014/15.2
2.

The key change in the baseline scenario compared with the previous DSA is a revision

to the underlying level of GDP in line with new national accounts estimates (Box 1). Nominal
GDP has been revised upwards by close to one third based on survey data which takes better
account of the services sector. Growth rates between 2008 and 2012 have also been revised upward,
by an average of 1.5 percentage points, because the services sector is estimated to be significantly
faster growing than most non-service sectors. Overall, growth prospects in the medium-term are
1.4 percentage points higher on average than in the previous DSA, mostly related to faster than
expected growth in the services sector and higher public investment in line with the authorities’
draft second poverty reduction strategy (PRS2) (Boxes 2 and 3). This higher investment is financed
through external borrowing in line with the agreed debt limit resulting in larger fiscal deficits in the
near term. The current account is also expected to be larger than the previous DSA, by close to
5 percentage points of GDP on average in the medium term, related to lower export growth in the
commodities sector.

Liberia is a highly dollarized economy. The de jure exchange rate regime is classified as ‘managed float’. For more
information see Article IV Consultation and the new ECF Arrangement, Informational Annex (2012).

There are significant risks to the baseline scenario, particularly around developments

in the concessions sector and in commodity prices. The baseline scenario takes a cautious
approach on the prospects for the initiation in iron ore production and only includes operations for
one concession over the projection period. As a result economic growth, exports and fiscal revenues
are relatively conservative estimates. At the same time, a decline in commodity prices, particularly in
the iron ore sector, could have a significant impact on investment, the external position and
revenues.

Box 1. Key Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth in the non-mining sector is assumed to accelerate in the next few years, supported by the
public investment program and services sector. Real annual growth including the mining sector is expected
to average 7 percent between 2012/13 and 2015/16 as production capacity in the mining sector increases.
Growth then fluctuates around an average rate of 6 percent, ending at 5.5 percent at the end of the
projection period. There are potential upsides to the growth projection if additional iron ore concessions
begin production, ongoing petroleum exploration identifies commercially viable oil deposits, and the
government succeeds in securing financing for the more ambitious development program.
Inflation in local currency (GDP deflator index) is expected to be 6 percent on average in 2012/13 and then
averages 5 percent from 2014 onwards.
The merchandise trade deficit widens sharply over the next four years due to a strong increase miningrelated imports. However, the strong pick-up in iron ore production in 2015 supports a gradual decline in
the trade deficit.
Export growth in the near term is lower than in the previous DSA, due to lower commodity prices,
particularly for rubber and iron ore. From 2012/13 to FY2014/15 export growth accelerates to a peak of
23 percent due to the initiation of iron ore exports. Exports of goods and services then slow, growing at an
average of 4 percent from 2016/17 to 2029/30.
Import growth, largely driven by imports of capital goods related to the iron ore sector, is partially offset
by lower imports by UNMIL as a result of the expected drawdown. Between 2012/13 and 2015/16 import
growth in goods is 13 percent, while services imports fall by average of 10 percent. From 2018/19 onwards
these effects are phased out and the average annual growth in goods and services is expected to be
5 percent.
The current account deficit of the balance of payments widens to 64 percent of GDP in 2013/14 in line
with investment in the iron ore sector. Following this, the current account deficit narrows rapidly to 32
percent of GDP in 2015/16. Beyond this the current account narrows averaging 15 percent of GDP.
Tax revenues are projected to remain stable at around 19.5 percent of GDP during the projection period.
The external borrowing policy was agreed in the IMF ECF-supported program with annual external
borrowing up to 4 percent of GDP in NPV terms on average between 2012/13-2014/15. The Government’s
Agenda for Transformation (PRS2) places emphasis on addressing the large infrastructure needs, particularly
in the energy and transportation sectors. Part of this investment is expected to be financed through external
borrowing raising external debt to GDP from 8 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 22 percent of GDP in 2014/15.
Beyond this, borrowing is expected to gradually stabilize at 2 percent of GDP in 2022/23. All new external
borrowing is assumed to be on concessional (IDA) terms. Domestic borrowing, supplied through a planned
Treasury bill market, is assumed constant at 1 percent of GDP per year beginning in 2016/17.
External grants (excluding UNMIL) are expected to progressively decline from 21 percent of GDP in
2012/13 to about 17 percent in 2015/16. Beyond this, grants are projected to decline to 10 percent of GDP
by the end of the projection period.

Box 2. Liberia: Agenda for Transformation (2012–17)
The Agenda for Transformation is a five-year development plan that underpins Vision 2030 to achieve
middle-income status by 2030. The plan focuses on investments in five strategic pillars—at an estimated
cost of $3.3 billion over the five-year period—to increase productivity, boost economic growth, and improve
social inclusion, particularly among youth. The pillars are
•

Economic transformation, particularly rehabilitating the hydropower plant, roads, and ports, and
updating information and communications technology;

•

Human development especially education and health;

•

Peace, security, and the rule of law;

•

Governance and public institutions to modernize the public sector and enhance transparency and
accountability; and

•

Cross-cutting issues focussed on youth skills, child protection, gender equality, and human rights.

Financing the investment program
•

The government plans to cover 12–15 percent of investments with its own resources and is planning a
pledging donors’ conference in late 2012 to secure loans and grants.

Box 3. Liberia: Assessing the impact from scaling up investment
A dynamic economic model, calibrated to Liberia specifics, was used to simulate the
macroeconomic impact of scaling up infrastructure investment and improving project efficiency.1
As the model focuses on identifying the return from public investment relative to a stable
long-term trend and other modeling differences, the estimates are not directly comparable to the
underlying macroeconomic framework used in the DSA. Starting from Liberia’s low base of
investment of close to 3 percent of GDP, a 5 percentage point of GDP increase in investment over
a seven year period was modeled.

Estimates suggest public investment would contribute an additional 1 percentage point each year
to real GDP per capita over ten years. The growth effect peaks 3–4 years after the initial
investment and then gradually declines over time. The estimate assumes an efficiency rate of
public investment of around 60 percent. Assuming an improvement in the efficiency rate to
80 percent, consistent with improved project selection and strengthened execution capacity, real
per capita income growth could potentially increase by an additional half percentage point over
the medium term. Given the caveats associated with this exercise, the simulation should be seen
as an approximation rather than a forecast.

II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
4.

Following HIPC debt relief, Liberia’s external debt is forecast to rise steadily, due to

increased new concessional borrowing to fund infrastructure development. (Tables 1 and
Figure 1). In the medium term, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise steadily from
10.7 percent in 2012/13 to 16.1 percent by 2014/15, reaching 19.8 percent by 2018/17 and gradually
declining thereafter. Debt service increases moderately over time, peaking in 2021/22. Due to the
concessional nature of debt together with rising exports and revenues from iron ore production,
debt and debt service indicators remain well below the country-specific debt burden thresholds.
These thresholds are based on an assessment of country policies and institutions compiled annually
by the World Bank (CPIA).3
5.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the debt indicators remain within sustainable limits

(Figure 1 and Tables 2a and 2b).


PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio. Under the alternative scenario of less favorable
borrowing terms the PV of external debt-to-GDP rises close to, but remains below, the 30
percent threshold. Given that the majority of debt is expected to be contracted on fixed
interest rates, the impact of this scenario is likely to be more limited. The historical scenario
shows that if key macroeconomic variables return to their average between 2004/05 to
2011/12 debt reaches close to the threshold of 30 percent of GDP towards the end of the
projection period. However, as noted in the previous DSA the risk associated with this
scenario is low due to very unreliable historical data following the end of an extensive period
of political and social instability.4 In addition, the historical scenario is relatively less severe
than the previous DSA due to the revision to GDP data and higher private external financing
flows.



PV of external debt and debt service-to-exports ratio. The PV of external debt-to-exports
ratio is most sensitive to the historical scenario, interest rate shock and export growth shock
but remains below the threshold of 100 percent. The debt service ratio remains well below
the threshold of 15 percent in all scenarios.

3

See Classification of Low-Income Countries for the Purpose of Debt Limits in Fund-Supported Programs: 2011
Update (IMF, 2011). With a CPIA rating below 3.25 on average for the past three years, Liberia is classified as a “weak”
policy performer. This implies debt burden thresholds of 30 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for debt service-toexports ratio, and 18 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

The historical scenario relies on averages between 2004/05 to 2011/12.



PV of external debt and debt service-to-revenue ratio. The PV of external debt-torevenue ratio is slightly sensitive under alternative and stress scenarios showing some
sensitivity to exports and less favorable borrowing terms. Both the debt and debt service-torevenue ratios are well below the policy thresholds in all scenarios throughout the projection
period.

III. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.

Following the resumption of new borrowing after debt relief, the baseline scenario of

all public debt indicators will rise moderately (Figure 2, Table 3). Under the baseline scenario the
PV of public debt-to-GDP rises slightly to 25 percent of GDP and remains broadly stable. The PV of
debt-to-revenue ratio rises to a peak of close to 90 percent of GDP and then follows a slight
downward path towards the end of the projection period. The PV of debt service-to-revenue ratio
follows a similar trajectory, rising to 5 percent of GDP over the projection period.
7.

Alternative and shock scenarios highlight the potential risks associated with a lower

GDP growth (Table 4). Under the alternative scenario of a shock to GDP growth in 2013/14 and
2014/155 the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio will increase from 10.8 percent in 2010/11 to about 90
percent by the end of the projection period. The PV of the public debt-to-revenue ratio also
deteriorates under the growth shock scenario, reaching close to 300 percent by the end of the
projection period. However, the debt service-to-revenue ratio will remain reach around 15 percent
under an alternative scenario of lower GDP growth.

IV. CONCLUSION
8.

The increase in debt in Liberia to finance much needed public infrastructure

investments is consistent with maintaining low debt vulnerabilities. The authorities are
committed to borrow only for investment and to maintain debt sustainability. The underlying
macroeconomic assumptions and DSA results were discussed with the authorities. In the baseline
scenario, which assumes new foreign currency borrowing of 4 percent of GDP on concessional
terms, increased investment, and moderate rates of growth, all external debt burden indicators
remain below their policy-dependent thresholds. While there are risks to the baseline, particularly
from adverse changes in commodity markets, the key debt and debt service indicators remain below
the indicative thresholds.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Liberia
On November 19, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Liberia.1
Background
Since the last Article IV consultation concluded in December 2010, prudent fiscal policy and
strengthened public financial management have contributed to a near doubling of government
revenue, resumption of direct budget support, and initiation of significant infrastructure
development projects without accumulation of expenditure arrears. Monetary policy has focused
on accumulating reserves, which sizably outperformed expectations during the period. Financial
policies focused on strengthening the banking system and promoting intermediation.
Economic activity remains robust in 2012, with inflation moderating at or near single digits and
the exchange rate is stable. Following resumption of iron ore exports in 2011—for the first time
since the end of the civil war—real GDP growth is estimated at close to 9 percent in 2012,
driven by mining, construction, and services albeit growth in agriculture and forestry remains
sluggish. Foreign direct investment is increasing. Following spikes in food and fuel prices in
2011 and early 2012, U.S. dollar-denominated inflation declined to under 4 percent by end-June
and is expected to remain in single digits through end-2012. The trade deficit has widened since
2010 reflecting concession-financed capital imports and rising food and fuel import prices which
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

more than offset the increase in iron ore exports. Reserve coverage has remained relatively
stable at about 2½ months of imports.
While medium-term prospects are bright, notably in the commodity export sectors,
broad-based growth is necessary to reduce high levels of underemployment and widespread
poverty. To this end, the authorities’ draft second poverty reduction strategy focuses on
achieving accelerated broad-based growth through scaling up of investment in infrastructure
and human capital, raising agricultural productivity, employment creation, especially youth
employment, and deepening financial markets. To support this strategy, efforts are needed to
create fiscal space for higher capital spending by containing personnel costs and other current
transfers, while future commodity revenues would need to be channeled to infrastructure
financing and capacity building to enhance competitiveness. Financial sector development and
improving access to credit would help support the private sector. Further reforms are necessary
to improve public financial management, governance, and the business environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Liberia’s progress in improving macroeconomic and social
conditions under the recently concluded Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. Directors
noted that the economic outlook is favorable, but that daunting policy challenges remain,
including safeguarding macroeconomic stability and strengthening the foundation for broadbased and lasting growth.
Directors emphasized the need to expand fiscal space for infrastructure and social spending.
They considered that the FY2012/13 budget is appropriately focused on increasing public
investment, but called for additional efforts to contain current spending beyond the recently
adopted rule for public sector wages.
More broadly, Directors highlighted the need to strengthen public financial management and
address capacity constraints that hamper capital spending. They stressed the importance of
keeping external borrowing within sustainable levels, seeking external concessional financing,
and strengthening the management of foreign aid. Directors also recommended putting in place
a framework for managing natural resource revenue, which would bolster Liberia’s ability to
cope with export price volatility and improve governance.
Directors supported efforts to strengthen the implementation of monetary policy. They
welcomed the authorities’ pursuit of de-dollarization and their plans to improve liquidity
management through the issuance of treasury bills. Directors also saw merit in increasing
official foreign exchange reserves as a buffer against shocks.

3
Welcoming the authorities’ progress in implementing risk-based supervision and improving the
payments system, Directors highlighted the importance of further promoting financial
intermediation. Directors expressed concerns, however, about elevated non-performing loans in
the banking system, and called for heightened vigilance by the authorities.
Directors agreed that accelerated structural reforms on a broad front remain essential to raise
Liberia’s growth path and reduce poverty. Steps to improve the business climate and lay the
groundwork for private sector development and employment remain a top policy priority.

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year, US$78.9Million ECF Arrangement for
Liberia
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF)1 Arrangement for Liberia in an amount equivalent to
SDR 51.68 million (about US$78.9 million). The overall amount of the program represents
40 percent of Liberia’s quota in the IMF and approval enables the immediate disbursement of
SDR 7.382 million (about US$11.3 million). The Executive Board also concluded the 2012
Article IV consultations with Liberia, which will be detailed in a Public Information Notice in
due course.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Liberia, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, made the following statement.
“Liberia made strong macroeconomic gains under the recent Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement supported by the Fund. Economic growth has been robust; inflation has been largely
contained; international reserves have been built up; and external debt has been reduced through
substantial debt relief. However, further reforms are needed to promote broad-based growth,
reduce poverty, and create jobs, particularly for the youth.
“The new ECF arrangement aims to support the authorities’ second poverty reduction strategy.
The policy priorities focus on safeguarding macroeconomic stability and laying the basis for
faster and diversified growth through a substantial scaling up of infrastructure and social
investments.
“Growth will be underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies, higher investment, and
vigorous implementation of structural reforms. Fiscal reforms focus on containing current
spending, particularly the wage bill, and strengthening budget execution and controls, through
improvements in public financial management. An increase in external debt limits will allow a
scaling up of critical growth-enhancing investments while maintaining debt sustainability.
Measures are also planned to further improve governance and transparency, including financial

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as the IMF’s
main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries. It provides for a higher level of access to
financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design, and more focused, streamlined
conditionality. Financing under ECF currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5½ years, and a
final maturity of 10 years.

oversight of state-owned enterprises, streamlining procurement procedures, improving project
execution, and establishing a natural resource revenue unit at the Ministry of Finance. Financial
sector reforms focus on reducing vulnerabilities and improving access to credit.”
Recent Economic Developments
Liberia made strong macroeconomic gains under a successful ECF program initially approved in
2008 for three years and later extended to May 2012 (see Press Release No. 12/165). The shortto medium-term outlook remains favorable, although subject to considerable risks. Following an
initial post-conflict boost, economic growth has averaged 7 percent a year since 2009 (mostly
from non-mining activities before the resumption of iron ore exports in late 2011), while
inflation has been largely contained at or near single digits. With the resumption of iron ore
exports in 2011, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated at close to 9 percent in
2012, supported by strong growth in the mining sector and expansionary fiscal policy to
accommodate a scaling up of infrastructure investment.
Foreign direct investment is increasing. Following spikes in food and fuel prices in 2011 and
early 2012, U.S. dollar-denominated inflation declined to under 4 percent by end-June and is
expected to remain in single digits through end-2012. The trade deficit has widened since 2010
reflecting concession-financed capital imports and rising food and fuel import prices which more
than offset the increase in iron ore exports. Reserve coverage has remained relatively stable at
about 2½ months of imports.
Nevertheless, Liberia’s macroeconomic stability has been hard won and its development
challenges are daunting. It remains a poor country, with massive infrastructure gaps and large
development needs. Poverty remains pervasive (at 84 percent of the population), and Liberia
ranks near the bottom of the UN’s Human Development Index (HDI) and is unlikely to meet
many of its Millennium Development Goals.
Program Summary
The ECF arrangement will support the authorities’ program to accelerate broad-based growth
and poverty reduction, aligned with their Poverty Reduction Strategy, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Consistent with these objectives, the program has three central
objectives:


Creating fiscal space for higher capital spending by containing personnel costs and other
current transfers;



Strengthening the financial sector through reducing vulnerabilities and improving access
to credit; and



Underpinning growth with structural reforms to further improve public financial
management, governance, and the business environment.

Statement by Mr. Momodou Bamba Saho, Executive Director for Liberia
November 19, 2012
Introduction
My Liberian authorities thank the Executive Board, Management and staff for their continued
support, particularly since the end of the civil conflict. They appreciate staff input in identifying
the policy opportunities and challenges as well as presenting options for the structural
transformation of the economy. While significant progress has been achieved in transitioning
from post-conflict reconstruction to the path of macroeconomic stability, underpinned by a
credible medium-term fiscal framework and sound policies, more remains to be done in the areas
of infrastructure and social development to spur robust inclusive growth.
Against this backdrop, my authorities have clearly articulated a comprehensive medium-term
strategy to help toward the end goal of reaching middle income status by 2030 in their second
generation Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRS-II), referred to as the “Agenda for
Transformation”. The authorities’ ambitious agenda focuses on investments in infrastructure,
human development and institutions to accelerate broad-based growth and attain middle income
status. However, the implementation of my authorities’ development agenda is severely
challenged by inadequate fiscal space and dwindling external financing. It is in this regard that
they are asking for the Executive Board’s approval of their request for a successor Extended
Credit Facility to consolidate macroeconomic stability and boost growth while supporting their
Agenda for Transformation.
Recent economic developments
Supported by a strong medium-term fiscal framework and sound macroeconomic policies,
economic performance during 2008-2010 was impressive, with real GDP growth averaging 5.9
percent. Inflationary pressures however heightened, due largely to the spike in global food and
fuel prices while gross international reserves increased substantially over the period. The
external current account deficit widened, reflecting the broad-based expansion in imports to meet
the increased domestic demand as the economy expanded. During this period, the country
received HIPC debt relief resulting in a large reduction in external debt.
Macroeconomic performance in 2011 continued to be robust with real GDP growth estimated at
8.2 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2010, reflecting increased activity in agriculture and the
resumption of iron ore exports. Inflation increased to 11.4 percent in 2011, largely because of the
surge in global food and fuel prices, which also contributed to the widening of the external trade
deficit. The exchange rate of the Liberian dollar remained stable and gross international reserves
stood at 3.0 months of import cover at the end of 2011.
Outlook
My authorities’ overriding policy objective over the near to medium term is to restructure the
economy so that it will grow faster, create more jobs, spread the benefits of growth more widely
and thereby reduce inequality. As a result, they are determined to invest in key infrastructure and

2
sectors that have high economic and social returns as well as expansionary economic benefits.
To this end, real output growth is projected to rise to 8.9 percent in 2012. The major risk to
maintaining single-digit inflation in 2012 remains the high global food and energy prices.
My authorities’ Agenda for Transformation prioritizes increased allocation of resources to the
development of roads, ports, power and water infrastructure as well as human capital.
Accordingly, they seek to gradually increase real output growth in the outer years as investment
in basic infrastructure and agricultural productivity are realized. The medium-term outlook
envisions single digit inflation, decelerating from 11.4 percent in 2011 to 6.6 percent in 2012.
With the volatility in the Liberian dollar subsiding, the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) is
expected to rebuild gross international reserves over the medium term.
Fiscal policy
My authorities are committed to maintaining fiscal sustainability over the medium term by
pursuing prudent fiscal management, while creating much needed fiscal space to support their
Agenda for Transformation. In this context, the overarching objective of fiscal policy is to
maintain a sustainable fiscal position consistent with the Public Financial Management Law of
2009. To meet these objectives, a Budget Framework Paper has been prepared outlining some of
the macroeconomic assumptions and funding plans for the national budget.
Cognizant of the need to intensify revenue mobilization, my authorities plan to introduce new
taxes on inbound telephone calls. They also intend to strengthen the large tax payer unit. In this
regard, they plan to establish a natural resource unit in the large taxpayers unit, which will help
to monitor prices and ensure that government receives the optimal amount of tax from the sector.
In addition, the authorities are working on a new petroleum policy to maximize future revenue
windfalls from the oil sector. In this regard, a draft petroleum policy has been prepared and
national consultations are ongoing. The draft policy will inform the new petroleum law and
management of petroleum revenue. The authorities are working with FAD in these efforts. In the
area of tax administration, my authorities are addressing revenue leakages. They plan to launch a
robust anti-smuggling campaign and comprehensive audits starting with the largest 20 tax
payers, including banks, logging and insurance companies. In addition to these new measures,
my authorities plan to maintain the tax reforms introduced last fiscal year.
On expenditure, my authorities are creating fiscal space to boost public investment. This year,
the budget allocates sufficient resources to capital projects in order to meet the government’s
infrastructure investment program. Special attention is given to the restoration of power,
rebuilding of roads and ports as well as investing in youth empowerment while augmenting
capacity for national development. In the medium term, the authorities intend to complete the
Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant and link it to the West African Power Pool to provide cheaper
electricity. In this respect, my authorities introduced key fiscal rules. They intend to spend no
more than 34 percent of the budget on personnel costs and no more than 15 percent of capital
expenditures on administrative overheads, among other things.

Monetary policy
The thrust of monetary policy in 2012 and over the medium term is to maintain price stability in
order to support the government’s objective of achieving sustainable economic growth and
broad-based development. At the moment, efforts are being made to widen the scope of
monetary policy instruments available to the CBL to enhance the potency of monetary policy,
including the introduction of a Treasury-bill market.
Financial sector policy
In the recent past, the CBL has endeavored to transform the Liberian financial landscape and
enhance the soundness of the financial system. This has involved improving access to financial
services and taking steps to ensure a relatively stable exchange rate, while strengthening the
reserve position of the CBL. Going forward, financial sector policy will continue on the path of
reform to promote viability of the banking system, with emphasis on further improving the credit
environment and reducing the level of non-performing loans. Furthermore, work will focus on
deepening the financial system, increasing private sector access to credit, strengthening
consumer protection and consolidating the renewed confidence in the banking system.
The monetary authorities will continue to strengthen the capacity of the regulation and
supervision department in critical skills such as risk-based supervision, information technologybased examinations and international financial reporting standards. Already work is in progress
to develop a framework for stress testing and conducting macro-prudential analysis of the
banking sector as part of efforts to strengthen early warning tools and addressing issues of
systemic risk on a more proactive and timely basis.
In promoting financial inclusion, the CBL is committed to supporting the establishment of
specialized rural community financial institutions in partnership with interested banks. These
institutions will be owned by the local communities and would assist in mobilizing local savings
while providing the much needed financial services to the respective communities. In addition,
the CBL has been working with credit union movements in Liberia, leading to the hosting of a
national congress for credit unions in April 2012 where the internal governance policies and
procedures of the Liberian Credit Union National Association were revised and adopted.
Debt management policy
In spite of the post HIPC low risk of debt distress, improved public debt management remains a
priority to the authorities. They remain committed to observing the rules governing debt and to
never again accumulate an unsustainable debt burden. To meet the required levels of investment
in order to fully implement the Agenda for Transformation and position Liberia on a trajectory to
a middle income country by 2030, the government intends to pursue opportunities to borrow
within sustainable levels. The borrowing will be done responsibly in accordance with the
following fiscal rules:


All borrowing must be undertaken for the purposes of investment, consistent with the
public sector investment plan;

4


Total cumulative outstanding debt stock, including domestic debt, must not exceed 60
percent of previous calendar year’s GDP as contained in the PFM Regulation; and



Prior to new borrowing being undertaken a debt sustainability analysis must be carried
out and presented to the debt management committee to ensure debt rules are not
breached.

Meanwhile, all efforts will be made to ensure that all borrowing is done on concessional terms
consistent with the Fund’s concessional threshold. However, non-concessional financing for
certain projects may be considered in consultation with the Fund.
Conclusion
My Liberian authorities remain mindful of the challenges ahead and are committed to proceed
with their five-year medium term development plan, the Agenda for Transformation and the long
term strategy, Liberia Rising 2030 to attain middle income status. In this regard, they are resolute
in their commitment to implement appropriate revenue enhancing measures to mobilize
substantial resources to complement external funding to finance their development plan.
However, given the large financing gap and the need for implementing sound macroeconomic
policies, my authorities consider the Fund’s and other development partners’ support essential to
achieving their post-conflict development needs.
