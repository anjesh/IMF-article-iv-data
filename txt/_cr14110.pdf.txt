KEY ISSUES
Context. After two years of strong performance, growth slowed down in FY2013 due to
declines in construction and tourism, while inflation moderated thanks to stable
international food and fuel prices. The outlook points to a modest recovery, but Palau’s
heavy reliance on tourism, grants, and food and fuel imports carries downside risks.
Without substantial fiscal consolidation over the medium term, Palau’s fiscal position will
be unsustainable when the Compact grants expire in 2024. Discussions focused on:
Managing fiscal adjustments to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability.


In the near term, replenish the fiscal buffers that were allocated for typhoon-related
expenses by containing current spending and saving any additional revenue gains
that are expected from recent revenue efforts.



Strengthen fiscal consolidation over the medium term through comprehensive tax
reform and expenditure reform to achieve fiscal self sufficiency when the Compact
grants expire.



Improve public finance management to strengthen the budget framework and
ensure debt sustainability. Continue reforming public entities to contain fiscal risks
and reduce government subsidies.

Promoting private sector development and financial stability to sustain growth.


Intensify efforts to diversify the economy, improve the investment climate, and
address infrastructure bottlenecks in order to enhance economic resilience and
growth potential.



Preserve financial stability by strengthening and broadening financial regulation and
supervision.

OUTLOOK AND RISK
1.
Growth. After two years of strong expansion, growth is estimated at around zero in FY2013,
lower than other Pacific Island Countries (PICs), owing to declines in construction and tourism
(Figures 1 and 4, Table 1). Construction activities slowed down due to delayed capital grants and
lower capital spending during the change in administration in early FY2013. Contributing factors to
the decline in tourism include the cessation of some flights from Asia, the increase in tourism-related
fees, and the U.S. dollar appreciation. Typhoon Haiyan last November had minimal impact on
growth, which is projected to increase to 1¾ percent in FY2014 and to 2¼–2½ percent over the
medium term. The sources of growth include the recovery in tourism driven by new hotel
developments and resumption of direct flights, and infrastructure developments financed by foreign
loans and grants (Table 2).1
2.
Inflation and credit growth. Inflation declined to 2¾ percent (annual average) in FY2013
thanks to stable international food and fuel prices, and it is expected to stay around 3 percent in
FY2014 and increase slightly during FY2015–16 due to the expected implementation of a valueadded tax (VAT). Bank credit increased 11½ percent in 2013, while the nonperforming loan ratio
remained broadly flat at 3¾ percent.
3.
External stability. The current account deficit deteriorated slightly last fiscal year due to
lower tourist arrivals and large reconstruction imports associated with typhoon Bopha, but tourism
recovery and moderating food and fuel prices are expected to reduce the deficit in FY2014–15
(Figure 2, Table 3). After worsening slightly in FY2016–18 due to imports related to infrastructure
projects, the deficit would narrow to 5½ percent of GDP over the medium term and remain fully
funded by grants, loans, and FDI. Palau’s food and fuel imports partly depend on tourism receipts,

provides little evidence of
fundamental misalignment. However, heavy reliance on tourists from a few economies would remain
a vulnerability, and weaknesses in infrastructure and investment climate could hinder development
of tourism-related businesses. Therefore, strengthening fiscal consolidation and improving
competitiveness by improving infrastructure and the business climate are essential for maintaining

external stability going forward. The use of the U.S. dollar as Palau’s legal tender remains
appropriate.2
4.
Risks, spillovers, and policy responses. Palau’s modest outlook is subject to downside risks.
Financial market volatility and growth slowdown in Asia, U.S. dollar appreciation, and natural
disasters, including those related to climate change, could hurt tourism and growth, weakening
external and fiscal positions (Annex I). Palau’s heavy reliance on food and fuel imports also makes it
susceptible to commodity price volatility. Given the absence of monetary and exchange rate policies,
Palau will continue to rely on fiscal measures and structural reforms to address these risks. Successful
fiscal consolidation is needed to build adequate fiscal buffers and ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability and external stability. Improving investment and business climate would help diversify
the economy, reduce economic vulnerability, and support growth.
5.
The authorities’ views. The authorities shared the staff’s views on the economic outlook,
risks, and policy responses. They indicated that the decline in construction played a more important
role than tourism in explaining last year’s growth slowdown. They noted that the priority is not
increasing the quantity but the quality of tourists in order to preserve Palau’s pristine environment,
while at the same time raise tourist spending. The authorities considered that natural disasters
constitute the main risk, pointing to the recent typhoons.

ENSURING FISCAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
Context. Without substantial consolidation, Palau’s fiscal position will become unsustainable
after the Compact grants expire in FY2024.3 Revenue collection relies heavily on tourism, contributing
to volatility and vulnerability, and the disbursement of infrastructure loans in the next few years
would raise the debt burden.
7.
Developments and near-term outlook. Fiscal consolidation slowed in FY2013 partly due to
natural disasters, but the authorities intend to put the fiscal adjustment back on track this year.
The current fiscal deficit excluding grants (fiscal anchor) is estimated to have remained
unchanged at 12¼ percent of GDP in FY2013 (Figure 3, Table 4). Despite the slowdown in
tourism, tax revenue continued rising thanks to increases in tourism-related taxes, higher prices
in the tourism industry, as well as improvements in tax compliance. However, current spending
was also larger than budgeted due to typhoon Bopha in December 2012. The cash buffers,

and, as a small state, has limited capacity to conduct its own monetary and exchange rate policy.

during 2011-24 is pending ratification by the U.S. congress, but Palau has continued to receive advances and to withdraw from the
Compact Trust Fund (CTF).

the CTF, increased to 5 percent of GDP and the domestic accounts payables declined to
11 percent of GDP. 4
The FY2014 budget reflects the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation by maintaining
prudent spending and creating a reserve fund to build fiscal buffers. After typhoon Haiyan hit the
country in November 2013, the authorities reallocated the planned savings of about ½ percent
of GDP for reconstruction expenses. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to replenish the
reserve fund by containing spending and saving additional revenue gains that are expected with
the adoption of a new IT system in customs, the recent increase in the tobacco tax, and the
recovery of tourism. In view of these, the current fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is projected to
narrow by 1½ percent of GDP, putting the fiscal consolidation back on track.

8.
Medium-term fiscal framework. Moving ahead, continued fiscal consolidation is needed to
build non-CTF deposits and ensure fiscal self-sufficiency, as otherwise domestic revenue and
withdrawals from the CTF will not be

the authorities would have additional five
years, before the Compact grants expire in FY2024, to put the fiscal consolidation back on track. In
view of this, a slower fiscal consolidation that spreads the adjustment until FY2023 is not
recommended because it would be more sensitive to risks of slippages and adverse shocks. In
addition, a longer adjustment period would lead to a lower level of sustainable government’s net
worth and, thus, a lower fiscal deficit that can be financed. The recommended gradual fiscal
adjustment would require efforts to reduce spending in terms of GDP, in addition to the revenue
measures envisaged in the baseline scenario.
4

The stock of domestic account payables—mostly trade credits and late payment to contractors and suppliers—has been reduced

from its peak of 15 percent of GDP in FY2010 but remains above the average of 7 percent of GDP observed before the global
financial crisis. The prospective disbursement of US$10 million under the Compact’s fiscal consolidation fund is expected to be used
to further reduce these liabilities.
5

Since withdrawals from the CTF will be capped at US$15 million annually during FY2024-44, Palau will have to rely on other revenue

sources and/or expenditure reduction to prevent any financing gap.
6

By reducing the current deficit excluding grants to 4¼ percent of GDP by FY2019 and keeping it constant into the long run, the

overall balance will continue in surplus until FY2025, allowing the government to build up deposits during this period. Beyond
FY2025, as the Compact grants expire, the overall balance will switch into a deficit, which will gradually reach a sustainable level of
2¼ percent of GDP in FY2043 and will be financed by the deposits (and their returns) accumulated during the surplus years.

9.
Comprehensive tax reform. The authorities are committed to a comprehensive tax reform
aimed at simplifying the tax framework, increasing its fairness, and raising revenue capacity over the
medium term. They have conducted intensive public consultations in all states, and expect to pass
the tax reform bill in congress by April/May 2014 and have it implemented over the subsequent year.
Implementing all components as recommended by IMF/PFTAC technical assistance (TA) is critical:
(1) move to c.i.f. (cost, insurance and freight) valuation for imports for tax purposes; (2) replace the
gross revenue tax (GRT) with a single rate VAT with no exemptions except for exports; (3) reduce the
wage and salary tax rates for low income household to offset any price increases from VAT adoption;
and (4) raise the net income tax (NIT) for financial institutions, and expand it to all VAT-registered
business. If the passage of tax reform bill is delayed, staff recommended adopting c.i.f. valuation,
removing import tax exemptions, broadening excise taxes, and raising the NIT for financial
institutions as intermediate actions. Staff also noted the importance of communicating all aspects of
the reform package to engage stakeholders and improving revenue administration capacity to
support this major reform. In view of the authorities’ strong commitment to implement the
comprehensive tax reform, domestic revenue is projected to increase by about 4 ppt of GDP during
FY2014–19 under the baseline scenario.7
10.
Expenditure reform. Medium-term fiscal adjustment also requires containing current
spending while ensuring adequate public services. Since the wage bill represents about half of
current spending, controlling its

11.
Public finance management. Given the disbursement of new infrastructure loans, sound
management of public debt and strong governance of loan-funded infrastructure projects would
help ensure debt sustainability and minimize fiscal risks. The debt sustainability analysis indicates
that Palau’s public debt risk remains low after the disbursement of Asian Development Bank (AsDB)
water and sanitation loans. However, continued fiscal consolidation is needed to place the debt on
a downward path (Annex III). Staff advised the authorities to continue directing external loans and

grants to infrastructure projects that will promote tourism and growth. Staff also encouraged the
authorities to implement the medium-term budget framework, supported by AsDB TA, and continue
improving budget execution and planning and strengthening cash management. Prudent
management of the newly established reserve fund would also help safeguard fiscal buffers.
12.
Reforming public entities. Staff welcomed recent reforms to make the Civil Service Pension
Fund (CSPF) and Social Security Fund (SSF) more sustainable, including by replacing the 30-year
service mandatory retirement with a mandatory retirement age for civil servants, increasing the social
security entitlement age, and adjusting benefit structures. The authorities made further progress in
clearing government arrears to these funds and improving contribution compliance. The upcoming
actuarial valuations should assess the impact of the recent measures on the funds’ financial
positions.9 The merger of Palau Public Utilities Company and Palau Water and Sewer Corporation
was completed in June 2013. The new public utility company is mandated to improve water and
sewer services and raise tariffs accordingly in order to reach full cost recovery of water and sewer
operations in 2016. Nonetheless, electricity operation will continue to rely on subsidies, grants,
and/or loans to finance capital spending. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue reforming the
utility company to achieve full cost recovery in all operations.
13.
The authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal consolidation
and prudent debt management, and confirmed that staff’s recommendations are broadly in line with
their medium-term budget framework. They appreciated the IMF/PFTAC TA in designing the tax
reform, and remained cautiously optimistic that the tax reform bill, including a value added tax,
would be passed. The reform is also expected to raise the NIT for financial institutions and expand its
coverage to all-VAT registered business, but the authorities indicated that this would be done in
stages given capacity consideration and the need to build ownership among stakeholders to support
the reform. The authorities agreed with staff’s advice to contain the wage bill growth but noted that
the priority at this stage is to pass the tax reform bill. Looking forward, potential measures for civil
service reforms could include enforcing mandatory retirement, upgrading the work ladder to attract
better qualified candidates, aligning salaries with performance, reducing temporary workers, and
retraining of public servant to prevent new hiring. The authorities plan to further strengthen the CSPF
by switching it from a defined-benefit to a defined-contribution framework and expanding it to
include the private sector. They also shared staff’s assessment that the risk of debt distress remains
low, but it is sensitive to fiscal slippages and a growth slowdown.

RAISING GROWTH POTENTIAL

Context. Palau faces a number of structural constraints common to small islands: a narrow
economic base, remote location, small population, insufficient infrastructure, and weaknesses in
investment climate. The banking system remains sound, but the National Development Bank of Palau

The CSPF and SSF are not part of Palau’s central government. The 2011 actuarial estimates, calculated as the difference between

the present values of accrued liabilities and trust assets, are US$104 million in CSPF and US$91 million in SSF. A large part of CSPF’s
unfunded liabilities are the result of the 30-year service mandatory retirement that was abolished recently.

(NDBP) remains outside the Financial Institution Commission’s (FIC) supervision.10 Commercial banks
continue to provide limited credit and place most of their assets abroad due to credit risks and
narrow domestic investment opportunities.
15.
Private sector development. Fiscal adjustment to preserve macroeconomic stability should
work jointly with structural reforms to raise competitiveness, promote private sector development,
and sustain growth. In this context, diversifying the economy, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks,
and improving business and investment climate remain key priorities.


Diversifying the sources of growth. Since tourism will remain the main source of growth,
promoting diversification within and outside the tourism industry could improve economic
resilience (Box 1).



Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. Expansion of basic infrastructure, such as water and
sanitation system, is needed to promote development of new hotels and raise tourism growth.
Although Palau compares favorably to peers, further improvements in the road network, aviation
connectivity, and telecommunication infrastructure would support economic diversification and
enhance growth potential.



Improving business and investment climates. Adopting a new foreign investment regime to
simplify investment approval and open all business activities to foreign investment through joint
ventures, continue to be the priorities.11 The recent establishment of the Economic Advisory
Group comprising representatives of the government, congress, and the private sector would
strengthen coordination between the private and public sectors and improve policy formulation
and planning. The authorities’ plan to pass labor reforms aimed at guaranteeing fair
compensations, safer working conditions, and steadfast resolution of labor disputes, should help
protect employees and improve business climate. The initiative to improve foreign workers’
flexibility to switch jobs would also improve productivity and promote inclusive growth.

10

The NDBP is a development finance organization, 100 percent government owned. Its loan portfolio amounts to about

US$25 million (10 percent of FY2013 GDP) and it is directed mainly to commercial (tourism, retail stores, etc.) and housing loans, and
a small amount to agriculture and fishing. Audited financial statements are publicly available, but the bank is exempt from FIC’s
regulation and oversight.
11

Palau’s rank in the 2014 World Bank’s doing business indicators improved from 114 to 100, but there is ample room to strengthen

investor protection, contract enforcement, and business-startup procedures.

Box 1. Palau: Promoting Tourism and Growth
Tourism plays an important role in Palau’s economy. As a world class diving destination, Palau receives tourists
more than five times of its population every year. In the recent years, tourism has contributed about three quarters
of GDP growth, more than 80 percent of exports of goods and services, 15 percent of total tax revenue, and 40
percent of total employment. Cross-country data indicate that Palau fares well compared to its peers in terms of
tourism’s contribution to the economy, although the availability of hotel rooms is more limited.
Palau’s heavy reliance on tourism contributes to economic volatility and vulnerability. Tourism is susceptible
to global economic and financial conditions, and the reliance on tourists and direct flights from only a few Asian
economies leads to tourism volatility. In addition, a limited number of hotel rooms, partly due to infrastructure
bottlenecks, hamper tourism and GDP growth. Meanwhile, spending per tourist has remained flat for the past
decade, suggesting limited increase in higher-income tourists. In addition, heavy reliance on food and fuel imports
makes Palau vulnerable to sharp fluctuations in global commodity prices.
Developing the private sector by promoting economic diversification would strengthen economic resilience
and enhance growth potential. Diversification within the tourism industry includes developing new tourist
attractions (for example, golf courses, aquatic sports), increasing flight connectivity with more countries, and
attracting a larger number of higher-income tourists to increase tourists’ spending. Diversification outside the
tourism industry could entail developing agriculture and aquaculture (for example, fish or clam farming) to supply
the tourism industry with domestic products and expanding the service industry. Moreover, the domestic value
added would be greater if a larger share of the supply chain of tourism-related operations such as production and
marketing of products and services was based in Palau instead of overseas. In this context, Palau’s efforts to
diversify the economy and promote private sector development should be underpinned by structural reforms that
open up the restrictive foreign investment regime and solve pressing infrastructure bottlenecks, such as deficient
water and sewer system and limited internet connectivity.

Financial sector developments. Financial indicators suggest that the commercial banks
remain sound, reflected by ample liquidity, strong earnings with large interest rate spreads, a stable
return-on-assets ratio, and a low nonperforming loans ratio.12 Banks’ balance sheets have improved
thanks to FIC’s increased monitoring and banks’ loan write-offs, and as a result, private credit growth
rebounded to 11½ percent in 2013. Banks’ ample liquidity reflects the fact that deposits have been
growing faster than loans, and banks continue to invest their excess liquidity in the United States.
Although bank officials have expressed their willingness and capacity to expand their domestic loan
portfolios, they indicated several factors that inhibit further expansion, including the small market
size, the lack of secured lending for real estate, and customers’ limited capacity to present business

17.
Preserving financial stability. Ensuring that the overall financial sector remains sound and
stable is essential to promote credit growth and support private sector development. With the
support of TAs by IMF/PFTAC and the U.S. FDIC, the FIC has made good progress in conducting bank
examinations of all banks, strengthening data collection and reporting, and publishing quarterly and
annual reports. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) was established in 2012, previously within the FIC
but now operating as an independent body, and has continued developing capacity to investigate
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) issues. Staff reiterated
the importance of broadening financial supervision to include the NDBP and other non-bank
financial institutions in order to minimize potential risks, particularly in view of the plan to allow
NDBP become a deposit-taker institution. Staff also welcomed recent progress in amending
AML/CFT legislation and urged its prompt passage in order to address most of the deficiencies
12

The FIC supervises five banks: three branches of U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured banks that hold more

than 95 percent of total commercial banks’ assets, and two locally-chartered and uninsured banks. The capital adequacy ratios of the
two uninsured banks stood at 98 percent (tier 1 risk-based) and 101 percent (total risk-based) in 2012.

identified by the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Strengthening the FIU’s capacity is also
important to implement its mandate.
18.
Statistics. Better data statistics would facilitate policy formulation and decision making by
the private sector. Data statistics are now broadly adequate for surveillance thanks to substantial
improvements over the past two years as a result of effective TA provided by IMF/PFTAC and other
donors as well as hiring of new staff in the Office of Planning and Statistics (OPS). Further areas for
improvement include broadening the coverage and providing more frequent reporting. Continued
efforts to strengthen OPS’s capacity also remain critical in order to continue implementing TA
recommendations going forward and reduce reliance on external assistance.
19.
The authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that promoting private sector development
and diversifying the economy are essential to support growth. They emphasized the importance of
preserving a pristine environment in order to promote sustainable development. The establishment
of the Bureau of Tourism, whose mandate is to ensure compliance with regulations, maintain and set
standards in the tourism industry, and safeguard the quality of services, is expected to improve the
quality of tourism. The authorities also indicated that the expansion of the water and sanitation
systems would help address infrastructure bottlenecks which are hampering the development of new
hotels. They are also making efforts to promote aquaculture and agriculture, which are outside the
tourism industry, but could form part of its supply chain. The authorities agreed with the inclusion of
NDBP under the FIC’s oversight and indicated the importance of improving NDBP’s capacity to
comply with FIC’s requirements, including through undertaking a preliminary on-site examination
before the bank becomes a deposit-taker institution.

STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
Economic outlook. Growth is projected to rebound driven by tourism recovery and
infrastructure developments over the medium term, and inflation is expected to remain low thanks to
moderating international food and fuel prices. The external balance is stable as the current account
deficit would be fully financed by official grants, loans, and FDI, and the real effective exchange rate
is broadly in line with fundamentals.
21.
Risks and policy responses. Palau’s modest outlook is subject to downside risks from
financial market volatility and growth slowdown in Asia, a U.S. dollar appreciation, natural disasters,
and the heavy reliance on food and fuel imports. In the absence of monetary and exchange rate
polices, Palau will continue to depend on fiscal measures to preserve macroeconomic stability and
on structural reforms to diversify the economy and promote private sector development.
22.
Fiscal consolidation. The authorities’ commitment to substantial fiscal adjustment over the
medium term and passing a comprehensive tax reform bill this year are welcome. Staff emphasize
that all components of the tax reform are critical and improvements in revenue administration
capacity is needed to support this major reform. Since tax reform alone is not sufficient to ensure
long-term fiscal sustainability, staff also recommend expenditure reform to contain current spending
growth and support the fiscal consolidation.

23.
Structural fiscal reforms. Strengthening public financial management would support fiscal
consolidation and improve fiscal discipline and transparency. Sound management of public debt and
strong governance of loan-funded infrastructure projects would ensure debt sustainability and
minimize fiscal risks. Staff encourage the authorities to continue strengthening the pension and
social security systems and reforming the public utility company to achieve full cost recovery.
24.
Private sector development. Promoting diversification within and outside the tourism
industry would improve economic resilience. Further improvements in infrastructure and structural
reforms to strengthen investment climate, including by reforming the foreign investment regime,
would support economic diversification, enhance growth potential, and promote inclusive growth.
25.
Financial sector. The financial sector remains sound, and continued progress in
strengthening financial supervision is welcome. Broadening financial supervision to include the NDBP
and other non-bank financial institutions is crucial to preserve the sector’s stability going forward.
26.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month
consultation cycle. Staff support the authorities’ request that Fund surveillance missions take place
during the budget preparation in the second half of the fiscal year.

Despite the decline in tourism in FY2013, revenue collection
continued to increase thanks to higher tax rates and
improved tax compliance.

However, current spending in FY2013 was larger-thanbudgeted mainly due to reconstruction expenses caused by
typhoon Bopha.

Annex II. Long-term Fiscal Sustainability Analysis1
This analysis updates the estimates from the 2012 Article IV consultation. The results suggest that
reducing the current deficit excluding grants by about 8 percentage point (ppt) of GDP during FY2014–
19 would ensure Palau’s long-term self sufficiency after the Compact grants expire in FY2024.
The analytical framework is based on the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. This
framework requires that the government’s net worth plus the net present value (NPV) of future
revenue streams equals the NPV of future expenditure streams. This is expressed in the following
equation:
W+G+R=C+K
where the government’s net worth (W) and the NPVs of grants (G) and domestic revenue (R) are
balanced against the NPVs of fiscal expense (C) and net acquisition of non-financial assets (K).
The current balance excluding grants (R-C) is set as the policy variable to balance the budget
constraint. The government’s initial net worth (W), grants (G), and capital spending (K) are
exogenous. The government’s initial net worth (W) is inherited and comprises the Compact Trust
Fund (CTF) and government domestic deposits, less the government’s domestic accounts payable
and external debt. Grants (G) are to a large extent determined by development partners. Capital
spending (K) should be maintained at a level that ensures growth. In contrast to these three
variables, domestic revenue (R) and current spending (C) can be influenced by policy makers, leaving
the current deficit excluding grants as the policy variable to satisfy the above equation.
The government’s initial net worth is estimated at 60½ percent of GDP at end FY2013. The
CTF is estimated at 77 percent of GDP, government domestic deposits at 5 percent of GDP,
domestic accounts payable at 11, and government external debt at 10½ percent of GDP.
The following assumptions are made:


Nominal GDP growth: 4 percent (real GDP growth: 2 percent).



CTF nominal rate of return: 6 percent (real rate of return: 4 percent). The average annual
return was 5¾ percent during FY2000–12 and 8 percent since the CTF’s inception in 1995.



U.S. Compact grants: US$146.2 million over FY2014–24 (total direct assistance of
US$229 million minus the advances of US$52.5 million received during FY2010–13 and
US$30.25 million in contributions to the CTF which are not part of the government’s
budget).



Annual drawdown from the CTF: gradual increase from US$5 million to US$13 million
during FY2014–23, US$15 million during FY2024–44, and 1¾ percent of GDP thereafter.



Other U.S. grants: US$170 million over FY2014–24, and 4½ percent of GDP thereafter.



Other country grants: 4½ percent of GDP.



Acquisition of non-financial assets: ranges between 6¾–9¾ percent of GDP in FY2014–25,
and 9 percent of GDP thereafter.

The results show that reducing the current deficit excluding grants by 7¾–8½ ppt of GDP
would ensure Palau’s fiscal sustainability. This adjustment should take place between FY2014 and
FY2023, and it would increase the government’s net worth to a level that will generate sufficient
income to finance a sustainable deficit over the long term. However, there is a trade-off between the
speed of adjustment and the level of net worth that can be achieved: the longer the adjustment
period, the lower the net worth that can be achieved (hence, the lower the sustainable deficit that
can be financed).
A gradual reduction of the current deficit excluding grants by 8.1 ppt of GDP during FY2014–
19 is recommended. Three

by an immediate adjustment in
one year. On the other hand, the minimum adjustment that spreads the adjustment until FY2023,
just before the Compact grants expire, would be more sensitive to risks of slippages and adverse
shocks like typhoon Bopha in early FY2013, which prevented Palau from continuing on the needed
adjustment path. Therefore, gradually reducing the current balance excluding grants by 8.1 ppt of
GDP during 2014–19 (1.35 ppt annually on average) is more appropriate. This gradual approach will
leave the government with extra years in case the needed consolidation is not achieved as planned.
Since the fiscal adjustment in FY2014 is projected to be 1½ ppt of GDP, the adjustment in FY2015–
19 should be about 1¼ ppt a year on average. The path of medium-term fiscal consolidation and
long-term fiscal sustainability is illustrated in Annex 2 Figure 1.
The above result is fairly robust to different parameter assumptions. Lower rates of return and
lower valuations of the government’s initial net worth (for example, to reflect new external debt
and/or to include public enterprise debt) increase the required annual fiscal adjustment. Higher real
GDP growth rates and inflation also increase the needed adjustment. Overall, however, reasonable
variations in these parameters have fairly small impacts on the estimated annual adjustment of 1.35.

1/ The results under the constant primary balance scenario are unrealistic as the FY2014 primary fiscal balance is projected to swing to a surplus due
to frontloaded disbursements of Compact capital grants. Instead, a no fiscal adjustment scenario is included to show the potential debt trajectory
under a scenario where revenue and expenditure reforms are not implemented, thereby leaving both revenue and expenditure almost flat in terms of
GDP. The debt trajectory under the adjustment scenario that incorporates both revenue and expenditure reforms as recommended is also presented.

IMF–WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(February 2014)
The World Bank and IMF teams for the Republic of Palau led by Mr. Robert Utz (Lead Economist,
EASPN) and Mr. Tubagus Feridhanusetyawan (IMF Mission Chief for Palau) maintain a close working
relationship and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues.
The teams agreed that Palau’s key macroeconomic challenges are to achieve fiscal self-sufficiency
and to enhance growth potential in view of declining external assistance in the future. Based on this
shared assessment, the teams identified key areas for reforms as follows:
Fiscal reforms


Continued fiscal consolidation over the medium term is critical to achieve fiscal self-sufficiency
when the Compact grants expire in 2024. The implementation of the authorities’ comprehensive
tax reform could raise revenue collection over the medium term. This would need to be
complemented by spending reduction, particularly in the wage bill, to ensure long-term
sustainability.



Strengthening public financial management by implementing a medium-term budget
framework, sound management of the newly-established budget reserve fund, prudent fiscal and
debt management, and better budget execution and cash management. Continue reforming the
pension and social security systems is important to address longstanding unfunded future
liabilities.



Continued progress in reforming the public utility company would also improve public services
and reduce government subsidies. A key challenge will be to balance commercial viability,
including by raising utility tariffs, with the need to ensure access to vulnerable groups.

Enhancing growth potential


Given Palau’s unique context, improving the investment climate and diversifying the economy
are critical to promote private sector development and growth. This includes promoting tourist
arrivals from new countries and developing business activities outside the tourism sector.
Strengthening and broadening financial regulation and supervision are also needed to preserve
financial sector stability.

The teams agreed on close cooperation going forward.


The World Bank is currently supporting the government of Palau in undertaking reforms and
investments aimed at improving access to Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
A Technical Assistance Grant, signed in September 2013, provides advisory support and capacitybuilding needed to support ICT sector reform and liberalization in Palau. Furthermore, under
Phase II of the Pacific Regional Connectivity Program, an investment in telecommunications
infrastructure is under preparation. This could entail support for a fiber-optic submarine cable in
order to increase the availability and reduce the cost of international bandwidth and hence
facilitate the rollout of faster-cheaper broadband Internet. The two operations are expected to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

increase the availability and quality of ICT infrastructure and enable more widespread application
of ICT services. Improved availability and affordability of broadband is expected to contribute to
economic and social development and improved service delivery in Palau.


The IMF will continue discussing economic and financial policies in surveillance context and
providing technical assistance, including through PFTAC, in various areas.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(February 2014)
Palau joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on December 29, 2003, as its sixty-third member.
While admitted as a regional country, its country classification was to be determined. AsDB prepared
a Country Economic Report for Palau and the Development Status and Country Classification of the
Republic of Palau, which served as the basis for a determination of Palau’s development status. On
December 16, 2005, Palau was re-classified as a Pacific developing member country.
To date, Palau has received three loans for a total of US$51.0 million and five technical assistance
projects for US$3.3 million.
Palau and the AsDB entered into a new 5-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009–13. The
strategy aligns AsDB's program with that of Palau's Medium Term Development Strategy.
AsDB will continue to support the implementation of Palau’s priority development strategy.
Improving public sector effectiveness and private sector development opportunities are likely to
remain key elements of AsDB’s future support, along with support for key infrastructure investments
that provide social benefits. Technical support, provided through AsDB’s country and regional
programs, will remain a core contributor to AsDB’s program in Palau. Regional activities will support
reforms in public sector management, the promotion of access to renewable resources and
improvements in energy efficiency, responses to the impact of climate change, and advice on
economic policy and private sector development.
The Palau country operations business plan (COBP) includes a pipeline for 2014–16 of
US$45.0 million in loans and US$1.5 million in technical assistance. Bilateral and regional technical
assistance grants scheduled during the strategy are in the attached tables.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(January 2014)
Palau has been a heavy user of PFTAC technical assistance (TA) in recent years. In phase III
(FY2009–11) there were 21 missions, spread across all sectors, with the largest concentration in public
financial management (PFM), where the focus was on strengthening cash management and laying the
groundwork for the development of medium-term budgeting. Other results achieved in phase III
included revenue compliance strategies and strengthened bank supervision through the adoption of
regulations, improved bank reporting, and the establishment of an on-site supervision program.
Methodologies for producing a broader range of national income and balance of payments statistics
were also developed.
Strategy 2011–13
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC (Phase IV) FY2011–16 funding cycle.2
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and strengthen the
financial sector. Priorities will be strengthening revenue administration and, in close coordination
with AsDB, improving PFM. Continued strengthening of financial sector supervision will also be
required.
In the public financial management area, the focus will be on continuing to support AsDB’s project
on developing medium-term budgeting. PFTAC will support Palau in undertaking a formal PEFA
assessment in early 2015 if requested, following on its Self-Assessment in early 2013. Follow up
support on accounting and cash management may also be required.
In the tax revenue policy and administration area, PFTAC will follow up on Palau’s recent decision
to introduce a tax reform bill in Congress by providing technical assistance to ensure that the bill is
consistent with international policy and administrative practices. If necessary, PFTAC will provide
assistance to redraft the legislation and provide recommendations on tax policy and administrative
reforms that may be necessary to successfully implement a VAT. The capacity of the revenue division
to administer the existing tax laws is not strong and it is likely that should Palau proceed with tax
reform, there will be a need for ongoing PFTAC technical assistance. Given the scope of work
required to uplift administrative capacity and implement a new tax regime, it is probable that this
assistance alone will be insufficient and PFTAC will work with aid agencies to identify funding for

PFTAC is a regional technical assistance institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB, Australia, Japan, Korea and
New Zealand. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national and regional level. Member countries are Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. It is based in Suva, Fiji.

a resident tax adviser. PFTAC has previously provided assistance to develop an IT strategic plan and,
if tax reform proceeds, the implementation of this plan and identification of donors to fund the IT
development will also be a priority.
In the financial sector supervision area, prudential returns are now implemented, and Palau is in
line for the integration of the Financial Sector Information System (FSIS) developed by the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand to be performed in late 2014. A regional on-site examination training
workshop will be held for the staff in mid 2014. Capacity building in risk based banking supervision
will continue including workshops for management on how to manage in a risk based environment.
In economic statistics, PFTAC will continue to provide technical assistance for the development of
GDP estimates by expenditure and will assist with capacity building in national accounts statistics
(RBM code 4.1). IMF HQ will provide resources to produce better current and capital accounts of the
balance of payments (RBM codes 4.6-4.8) and government finance statistics.
In the macroeconomic analysis and frameworks area, PFTAC will provide TA on developing the
methodology used to forecast revenues focusing on planned tax reform measures. In addition, TA
will also be provided to develop capacity to assess alternative fiscal consolidation options for
preserving fiscal / debt sustainability when the Compact grants expire in 2023.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
REPUBLIC OF PALAU – STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of March 31, 2014
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Palau’s statistics have improved during the past two years and are now broadly adequate
for surveillance despite some remaining shortcomings. With the support of technical assistance
(TA) including from IMF/PFTAC and the Graduate School USA, the Office of Planning and Statistics
(OPS) has compiled and published macroeconomic data. The 2012 Palau Statistical Yearbook that
provides comprehensive data on macroeconomic indicators, population, employment, housing,
education, health, investment, tourism, and other economic indicators has been published on
Palau’s website (http://palaugov.org/bureau-of-budget-planning/). Further areas for improvement
include broadening the coverage and providing more frequent reporting, particularly of fiscal and
external sector data. The OPS has recruited more staff but continues to rely heavily on external
consultants and TA. Further improvements in capacity and additional TA are needed to strengthen
the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic data.
National Accounts: Since 2012, GDP estimates by production have been compiled and published,
and the methodology has improved. Further areas of improvement include incorporating the
recent business surveys and compiling GDP estimates by expenditure.
Price Statistics: Data quality has improved and the Consumer Price Index has been regularly
published on a quarterly basis on Palau’s website (http://palaugov.org/consumer-price-index-cpi/).
Government Finance Statistics (GFS): Fiscal data are compiled using GFSM2001 classification
and published in the 2012 Palau Statistical Yearbook. Further improvements include broadening
the coverage beyond the central government and improving the frequency and timeliness of
reporting, including of the audited accounts. Palau is participating in the Japan Administered
Account (JSA)-funded GFS capacity-building project that would provide further TA in the coming
year. The authorities recruited new staff in early 2013 to compile GFS data and to participate in
regional training and remote TA from STA. Annual GFS data have not been reported to STA.
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS): The monetary survey is unavailable since there is no
central bank. Moving ahead, an MFS TA could assist the authorities in developing the standardized
report forms for the depository corporations and strengthening data reporting.
Financial sector surveillance: Banks have submitted quarterly financial statements, including
balance sheets and profit and loss statements, to the Financial Institutions Commission (FIC)
since 2009. The FIC publishes some financial soundness indicators (FSIs) on a quarterly basis
(http://www.ropfic.org/). However, the FSIs do not include data from the National
Development Bank of Palau as it remains outside the FIC’s supervision.
External sector statistics: The balance of payments and international investment position are
reported according to BPM6 and published in the 2012 Palau Statistical Yearbook. The new
Business Enterprise Survey and the Hotel Accommodation Survey and Tourist Expenditure Survey
are expected to improve data quality, particularly tourism-related data. The financial accounts data
have also improved, resulting in a reduction of errors and omissions.
Data Standards and Quality
Palau began participating in the General Data Dissemination System in
August 2013, and comprehensive information on Palau’s statistical
production and dissemination practices are available on the IMF website.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Palau

On April 23, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Palau.1
After two years of strong expansion, growth is estimated at around zero in fiscal year 2013
(FY2013, ending in September) owing to declines in construction and tourism. Inflation
moderated to 2¾ percent (annual average) in FY2013 thanks to stable international food and fuel
prices, and it is expected to stay around 3 percent in FY2014. Growth is projected to increase to
1¾ percent in FY2014 and to 2¼–2½ percent over the medium term driven by the recovery in
tourism and infrastructure developments. This modest outlook is subject to downside risks from
financial market volatility and growth slowdown in Asia, a U.S. dollar appreciation, natural
disasters, and the heavy reliance on food and fuel imports.
The current account deficit deteriorated slightly in FY2013 due to lower tourist arrivals and large
reconstruction imports associated with typhoon Bopha, but tourism recovery and moderating
food and fuel prices are expected to reduce the deficit in FY2014–15. After worsening slightly in
FY2016–18 due to imports related to infrastructure projects, the deficit would narrow to
5½ percent of GDP over the medium term and remain fully funded by grants, loans, and FDI.
The current fiscal deficit excluding grants (fiscal anchor) is estimated to have remained
unchanged at 12¼ percent of GDP in FY2013. Tax revenue continued to rise thanks to increases
in tourism-related taxes, higher prices in the tourism industry, and improvement in tax
compliance, but current spending was larger than budgeted due to natural disasters. In view of
the authorities’ intention to contain spending and save additional revenue gains from the recent
revenue measures, the current fiscal deficit excluding grants is projected to narrow by 1½ percent
of GDP in FY2014, putting the fiscal consolidation back on track. In view of the expiration of
Compact grants in FY2024, substantial fiscal adjustment over the medium term is needed to
build adequate government deposits and to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Palau’s near-term outlook is generally favorable but exposed to
the risks inherent to the geography and narrow production base of a small island economy. With
full dollarization ruling out recourse to monetary and exchange rate policies against adverse
shocks, Directors encouraged the authorities to build up fiscal buffers and step up reforms to
diversify the economy and develop the private sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a sustained fiscal adjustment to secure sound
public finances once grants under the Compact of Free Association expire in 2024. They
supported plans to enact soon a comprehensive tax reform bill which, if complemented by
improvements in revenue administration, promises a significant increase in budgetary resources
over the medium term. Directors also recommended reforms to contain the growth of current
spending as a key element of the consolidation strategy. More broadly, Directors agreed that
fiscal adjustment should be accompanied by further steps to improve public financial
management, strengthen the pension and social security systems, and ensure that the public
utility company achieves full cost recovery in its operations.
Directors considered that promoting private sector development and economic diversification
would bolster Palau’s resilience to shocks. Additional improvements in infrastructure, and
reforms to strengthen the investment climate, including a more flexible foreign investment
regime, would also lift long-term prospects and promote more inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed progress in strengthening financial supervision and preserving the
soundness of the financial sector. They noted that broadening financial supervision to include the
national development bank and other non-bank financial institutions is essential to preserve the
sector’s stability. Directors also encouraged the authorities to further improve their regime
against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for the Republic of Palau,
and TJ Oscar I. Remengesau III, Advisor to the Executive Director
April 23, 2014

Our Palauan authorities wish to express their utmost appreciation to the Fund and its
Staff for the constructive engagements and concise report. The authorities broadly
concur with the staff views expressed in the 2014 Article IV report which effectively
highlighted the current economic status as well as the remaining challenges to preserve
macroeconomic stability and ensure long term growth.
Palau, as a small island nation in the remote North Pacific, has a narrow production and
export base and remains highly vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters. To
ensure macroeconomic stability, the government is determined to build adequate buffers to
mitigate downside risks, address structural impediments to growth and to maintain prudent
macroeconomic policies. Given the inherent challenges including resource constraints, my
authorities are very grateful for the continued assistance from the international community, in
particular, the United States, who has been providing financial support through the Compact
of Free Association.1
Economic Development and Outlook
Growth slowed down in FY2013 mainly due to the decline in construction and tourism.
The recent typhoon Haiyan had a small adverse effect on GDP, with reconstruction activity
offsetting some of the impact. Inflation has moderated to 2¾ percent, thanks to stable
international food and fuel prices. However, growth is seen recovering in the near-term as
tourism recovers.
There are promising signs that economic activity has picked up in the first few months of
2014, thanks to a strong recovery in tourism. Over the medium-term, growth is expected to
gain momentum as tourism recovers and the benefits of recent reforms begin to materialize.
Real GDP is forecast to grow at around 1¾ percent in FY2014 and 2¼ - 2½ percent over the
medium-term.
While the outlook is positive for 2014 and favorable in the medium-term, important risks to
the forecasts remain. Risks remain weighted to the downside if a severe downturn emerges
in Asia, Palau’s main source of tourists. A sharp rise in food and fuel prices would also have
a negative impact on the economy, given Palau’s heavy reliance on imports. Furthermore, the
absence of monetary and exchange rate policies (the economy is using dollar as a legal
tender), limit policy space to counter the risks.

1

The Compact of Free Association, which was ratified in 1994 and was then renewed and amended in 2010.
The new agreement will last until FY2024 totaling US$229 million, a substantial decrease from the initial
US$580 million compact funding in FY1994-FY2009, of which passage, however, has been delayed in US
Congress due to lack of offsets to the proposed budget.

2
The authorities are fully aware of Palau’s daunting fiscal challenges from the expiration of
the Compact grants in 2024. They indicated that along with current fiscal adjustments,
strengthened private sector development is crucial in the near term as the Compact of Free
Association with the United States winds down.
Given the anticipated increase in the number of tourists coming to Palau, the authorities have
focused on development initiatives that would positively improve the tourism sector. New
hotels are being constructed in order to accommodate increased tourist volumes. The
authorities have negotiated an increase in the number of scheduled and chartered flights in
response to the demand from Asia, particularly China. They have also revamped tourismrelated activities and continue to identify ways to diversify the tourism industry, Palau’s
bread and butter.
Fiscal Sustainability
The authorities agree that continued fiscal consolidation is needed to build nonCompact Trust Fund (CTF) savings and ensure fiscal self-sufficiency in the future.
Given the burden of adjustment, the authorities are looking to embark on a comprehensive
revenue and expenditure reforms, which are essential to resolve long-standing fiscal
imbalances. The mid-term priority is to pass the tax reform bill, followed by expenditure
reforms to be done gradually at a later stage. While current spending was larger than
budgeted due to typhoon Bopha in December 2012, the cash buffers, excluding the Compact
Trust Fund (CTF), increased to 5 percent of GDP due to stronger revenue and the domestic
accounts payables fall to 11 percent of GDP.
The authorities credit the slowed fiscal consolidation in FY2013 as a result of two natural
disasters. After typhoon Haiyan hit the country in November 2013, the authorities
reallocated the planned savings of about ½ percent of GDP for reconstruction expenses. The
authorities intend to replenish the reserve fund by containing spending and saving additional
revenue gains that are expected with the adoption of a new IT system in customs, the recent
increase in the tobacco tax, and the recovery of tourism.
Despite the slowdown in tourism in FY2013, tax revenue continued rising thanks to increases
in tourism-related taxes, higher prices in the tourism industry, as well as improvements in tax
compliance. The current fiscal deficit excluding grants is estimated to have remained
unchanged at 12¼ percent of GDP in FY2013. The FY2014 budget reflects the authorities’
commitment to fiscal consolidation by maintaining prudent spending and creating a reserve
fund to build fiscal buffers.
Reform Agenda
The current economic recovery has allowed an opportunity for the authorities to begin
the consolidation of the fiscal position. Immediate steps have been taken to strengthen
revenue collection. They have continued to embark on several measures to implement
structural, as well as revenue and expenditure reforms.

3
Palau’s economy is in the midst of a period of extensive reform that has broad implications
for the wider population. Comprehensive reforms are being pursued along many fronts, and
the authorities are aware that the social safety net for the most vulnerable must be protected
to compensate for the social impact of reforms.
Comprehensive Tax Reform
The authorities are committed to a comprehensive tax reform aimed at simplifying the
tax framework, increasing its fairness, and raising revenue capacity over the medium
term. The authorities expressed that comprehensive tax reform will strengthen their effort to
re-build the fiscal position. The authorities’ are pushing forwarding with the tax reform bill
which is expected to pass in Congress by May 2014.
In line with the IMF/PFTAC technical assistance (TA) recommendations, the authorities
emphasized the need to replace the gross revenue tax with a single rate VAT with no
exemptions except for exports, moving to c.i.f. valuation for imports, raising net income tax
(NIT) for financial institutions from the current 4 percent to 20 percent in gradual stages, and
expanding it to all VAT registered business. Furthermore, as staff noted, the wage and salary
tax rates for low income household could be reduced to offset a potential adverse impact of
price increases due to VAT adoption. The authorities also stressed the need to improve
revenue administration capacity to support this major reform. This comprehensive tax
reform package will bring revenue gain by about 4 percent of GDP during FY2014-19.
Medium-term Fiscal Framework
Sizable adjustment is required in order to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. As
staff projected, a gradual reduction in the current fiscal deficit by about 8 percent of GDP
through FY2019 will provide a sustainable source of financing and offer an adequate fiscal
buffer. The authorities recognize the task that lies ahead but are also trying to balance the
adjustment with the need for political support for the required reforms. This is particularly
important with the expiration of Compact grants in FY2024, which have averaged more than
20 percent of GDP over the past decade.
The authorities have taken steps to implement a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) in
order to ensure a structured, comprehensive, and realistic approach that is consistent with a
sound fiscal policy strategy. An added benefit from this approach would be enhancing
budget credibility and governance. With the MTBF, the authorities hope to exert better
control over budget execution which is based upon cash availability, cash planning, and
spending.
Financial Sector
The banking system remains profitable and well capitalized. The authorities are
committed to ensuring that the banking system is stable and safe for depositors. The
Financial Institutions Commission (FIC) has been proactive in its mandate and has increased
monitoring of the banks’ loan write-offs. Private credit growth rebounded to 11½ percent in

4
2013. The authorities agree with the need to include the development bank under the FIC’s
oversight.
The authorities are committed to continue their effort against money laundering and in
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The Financial Intelligence Unit in
collaboration with the FIC has the mandate to investigate any criminal activities within the
financial sector and has strengthened its capacity to conduct AML/CFT examinations.
Private Sector Development
The authorities will continue to undertake critical growth enhancing investment and
implement strong structural reforms that will support growth. In their efforts to
strengthen economic development the authorities are seeking to develop a vibrant private
sector as evidenced by the recent establishment of the Economic Advisory Group. They are
of the view that private sector development is a key complement to the planned fiscal
consolidation.
The authorities have taken critical steps to create a business environment that would allow
businesses, both foreign and domestic, to operate successfully through regulatory
improvements to the FDI regime and simplification of the regulations on land-use and the
labor market. To this end, our authorities are committed to improving the business
environment and reducing bottlenecks to improve investor confidence and to lift potential
growth.
Finally, our Palauan authorities would like to express their gratitude to Management,
the IMF mission chief and his team, and the TA mission teams for their continued
efforts and dedication.
