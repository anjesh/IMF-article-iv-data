IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Pakistan
On December 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with Pakistan.1
Starting from a difficult position in 2013, Pakistan has made substantial progress in reducing
near-term economic vulnerabilities. Economic growth gradually increased from 3.7 percent
in fiscal year (FY) 2012/13 to 4.2 percent in FY2014/15. During the same period, efforts to
reduce power subsidies and raise tax revenue have lowered the budget deficit from 8.4 to
5.4 percent of GDP, although part of this adjustment reflected clearance of quasi-fiscal
liabilities in the energy sector in 2013. Monetary and financial sector policies have remained
prudent in recent years, and the banking system remains sound. Inflation has declined
significantly, helped in part by low international commodity prices.
The external position has recently strengthened although medium-term vulnerabilities
remain. Helped by low oil prices and strong remittances, the external current account deficit
narrowed to one percent of GDP in FY2014/15 and foreign exchange reserves of the SBP
have been rebuilt from 1.5 months of imports in FY2012/13 to 3.8 months of imports in
September 2015. However, foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by a half in FY2014/15,
albeit with some recovery since, and exports have declined. The economy’s competitiveness
has been hampered by security issues, a business climate that lags regional peers and a real
effective exchange rate appreciation of 17 percent over the past two years.
Long-standing structural impediments and a difficult security setting remain key obstacles to
growth and investment. Pervasive tax evasion combined with still prevalent tax exemptions
and loss-making state-owned enterprises constrain the fiscal space for public investment and
social spending. The resulting reliance on domestic financing risks to reduce access to credit
and investment by the private sector. Despite recent improvements, the energy sector still
accumulates payment arrears and is unable to meet growing demand. Several growthsupporting structural reforms are in various stages of preparation or implementation,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

including in the energy sector, privatization/ restructuring of public enterprises, tax
administration, as well as monetary and financial sector policies.
Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook is favorable, contingent on sustained implementation of
key reforms, amid downside risks emanating from a more challenging external environment.
In the medium term, growth is expected to reach about 5.5 percent, and inflation is expected
to gradually rebound to the SBP’s target of mid-single digits.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors welcomed Pakistan’s continued improvement in economic activity and the fiscal and
external positions, on the back of low oil prices and strong remittances. They commended the
authorities for significantly reducing near-term vulnerabilities in recent years. Directors noted
nevertheless that longstanding structural weaknesses and security concerns continue to hold
back growth prospects. They emphasized the need to boost potential growth and enhance the
economy’s resilience and competitiveness. Achieving these objectives will require sustained
fiscal consolidation, swift execution of the economic reform program, and a further build-up
of international reserves.
Directors stressed the importance of further reducing public debt to more sustainable levels,
while preserving room for higher spending on critical infrastructure, educational, and social
programs. They welcomed the additional measures taken to close the revenue shortfall and
encouraged comprehensive, front-loaded reforms to mobilize revenue, including by
base-broadening, streamlining concessions and exemptions, improving tax compliance, and
enhancing coordination with provincial tax authorities. At the same time, Directors saw a
need to continue strengthening frameworks for public debt and financial management,
further reducing energy subsidies, and restructuring or privatizing loss-making public
enterprises.
Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain prudent and focused on price stability.
They supported targeting positive real interest rates and keeping inflation expectations well
anchored. Directors commended the authorities for progress in improving the monetary
policy framework, notably the establishment of an independent monetary policy committee.
They encouraged further steps to enhance monetary policy transmission and prepare for a
shift toward inf lation targeting over the medium term, as circumstances permit. Directors
encouraged the authorities to implement the remaining recommendations of the 2013
safeguards assessment, aimed at enhancing central bank independence and reducing fiscal
dominance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors observed that the banking sector remains sound and profitable, and good progress
has been made with bank capitalization. They supported ongoing efforts to bolster
regulatory and supervisory frameworks, set up a deposit insurance scheme, and improve
access to finance. Directors also stressed the need to continue strengthening the framework
against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, including by widening the coverage
of tax crimes.
Directors underlined the importance of advancing critical structural reforms to restore
competitiveness and foster medium-term, inclusive growth. They called for continued effort
in the areas of energy sector reform, privatization, the business climate, and trade integration.
Greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb exogenous shocks and complement a
comprehensive strategy for improving export performance. Directors also encouraged
initiatives to promote gender equality and expand targeted social protection.

IMF Executive Board Completes Ninth Review Under the Extended Fund Facility for
Pakistan
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on December 18, 2015
completed the ninth review of Pakistan’s economic performance under a 36-month program
supported by an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The Executive Board’s decision
enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 360 million (about
US$498.1 million), bringing total disbursements to SDR 3.6 billion (about US$ 4.98 billion).
On September 4, 2013, the Executive Board approved the three-year extended arrangement
under the EFF in the amount of SDR 4.393 billion (about U$S6.64 billion at the time of
approval of the arrangement, or 425 percent of Pakistan’s quota at the IMF). (See Press
Release No. 13/322).
In completing the review, the Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for
waivers of non-observance of the end-September 2015 performance criteria on the ceiling on
overall budget deficit and the ceiling on net domestic assets of the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP), as well as modification of the end-December 2015 performance criterion on net
domestic assets of the SBP.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Pakistan, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Economic growth remains robust and near-term vulnerabilities have receded. The Pakistani
authorities have taken corrective measures to foster the achievement of program objectives.
Prudent macroeconomic policies and sustained implementation of the reform agenda are
important to reinforce gains in economic stability and generate a strong and sustainable
growth.
“The authorities’ commitment to further strengthening the fiscal position and lowering public
debt is welcome. The focus is appropriately placed on revenue mobilization, including
broadening the tax base and improving tax collection and compliance, with a view to creating
fiscal space for pro-growth spending and greater social protection. Efforts are underway to
strengthen coordination with the provinces and improve public financial management to
reduce fiscal risks.

2

“Low oil prices present a unique opportunity to strengthen external stability. Further
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves would help enhance the economy’s resilience.
The establishment of an independent monetary policy committee is a major welcome step.
Sustained efforts are needed to further improve the monetary policy framework, reduce fiscal
dominance, and strengthen central bank independence.
“The authorities remain committed to safeguarding financial stability. Priorities include
reinforcing the supervisory framework, boosting bank capitalization, and improving access to
finance. Preparatory work has progressed well for the introduction of credit bureaus and a
deposit insurance scheme. It will be important to continue to strengthen corporate
restructuring, insolvency, and collateral frameworks, as well as Pakistan’s regime against
money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
“The momentum of structural reforms must be maintained to achieve higher, sustainable, and
more inclusive growth. Critical priorities include reducing arrears and increasing supply in
the energy sector, restructuring and privatizing loss-making public enterprises, improving the
business climate and competitiveness, further strengthening social protection, and increasing
female labor force participation.”

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
NINTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT,
REQUEST FOR WAIVERS OF NONOBSERVANCE OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND REQUEST FOR
MODIFICATION OF A PERFORMANCE CRITERION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic context: Emerging from a near-crisis in 2013, the authorities have
substantially reduced near-term vulnerabilities. Helped by supportive policies, low oil
prices and strong remittances, the budget deficit and inflation have declined while
foreign exchange buffers have strengthened considerably. The near-term economic
outlook is broadly favorable although structural bottlenecks still impede higher
potential growth.
An ambitious policy agenda: The main challenges are to reinforce the recent gains in
economic stability and generate a strong and sustainable growth momentum by
accelerating structural reforms. Key priorities include continued reserve accumulation
and fiscal consolidation, widening the tax net to enable higher infrastructure investment
and social assistance, fixing the energy sector, restructuring or privatizing loss-making
public enterprises, improving the business climate for higher and more inclusive growth,
and continuing the policy agenda to foster financial sector development and stability.
Program implementation has been mixed: Most end-September 2015 Performance
Criteria (PCs) and indicative targets were met. However, the PCs on net domestic assets
(NDA) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the general government deficit were
missed, as was the indicative target on federal tax revenue. The authorities have put in
place additional revenue measures to stay on course with respect to the fiscal targets.
The end-December PC for NDA is proposed for modification to ensure adequate
reserve money growth, and corrective measures have been taken to meet the revised
target. Most structural benchmarks (SBs) for this review were met. The SB on the AntiMoney Laundering (AML) Act amendments is proposed to be modified and the missed
end-November SB on multi-year power tariffs is proposed to be replaced by two new
SBs to facilitate completion within the timeline of privatization. In addition, five new SBs
in the areas of tax administration, AML, energy sector and business climate reforms are
proposed.
A purchase under the extended arrangement for Pakistan, in an amount
equivalent to SDR 360 million, will be available upon completion of this review.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
1.
Emerging from near-crisis conditions in 2013, substantial progress has been made in
addressing economic vulnerabilities. Efforts to reduce power subsidies and raise tax revenue have
lowered the budget deficit from 8.4 percent of GDP in FY2012/13 to 5.4 percent of GDP in
FY2014/15, although part of this adjustment reflects clearance of quasi-fiscal liabilities in the energy
sector in 2012/13. Helped by low oil prices and strong remittances, foreign exchange reserves of the
SBP have been rebuilt from 1.5 months of imports in FY2012/13 to 3.8 months of imports in
September 2015.
2.
Nonetheless, long-standing structural impediments and a difficult security setting
remain key obstacles to growth. Pervasive tax evasion combined with still wide-ranging tax
exemptions and loss-making state-owned enterprises constrain the fiscal space for public
investment and social spending. The resulting reliance on domestic financing—more than
60 percent of banking credit as of end-FY2014/15—constrains access to credit and investment by
the private sector. The cash-strapped energy sector has been accumulating payment arrears (also
called “circular debt”) and is unable to meet growing demand, resulting in power outages still
averaging 6–8 hours a day. The economy’s competitiveness is further hampered by a business
climate that lags regional peers and, despite relative stability of the rupee vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar,
a real effective exchange rate appreciation of 17 percent over the past two years. Foreign direct
investment has also been held back by a difficult security situation.

Pakistan’s main policy priorities are to reinforce gains in economic stability and
generate a strong and sustainable growth momentum. Helped by strengthened macroeconomic
stability and improved terms of trade, economic growth already gradually increased from
3.7 percent in 2012/13 to 4.2 percent in FY2014/15. Nonetheless, with population growth estimated
at over 1.9 percent, GDP per capita posted only a moderate increase relative to regional peers and
other emerging economies (Figure 1, top right panel). Substantial acceleration of growth will be
needed to absorb a growing number of entrants into the labor market and raise living standards.
The authorities’ policies have been generally in line with staff’s policy recommendations (Box 1).
Several growth-supporting structural reforms are in various stages of preparation or
implementation, including in the energy sector, privatization/restructuring of public enterprises, tax
administration, as well as monetary and financial sector policies. Completing this agenda will be
critical for Pakistan to strengthen its external position (Box 2) and achieve its broader economic
objectives.

Box 1. Authorities’ Policies Have Been Generally Consistent with Policy Recommendations in the
Previous Article IV Consultation
Fiscal policy has achieved a substantial consolidation and needs to solidify these gains. The budget deficit
(excluding grants) declined by 3.1 percentage points of GDP from 8.5 percent in FY2012/13 to 5.4 percent in
FY2014/15, on account of notable progress with reducing energy subsidies, improving the amount and targeting
of social assistance, and increasing tax revenues, especially by eliminating tax concessions and exemptions. The
underlying fiscal adjustment after accounting for clearance of circular debt in the energy sector (1.4 percent of GDP
in FY2012/13) was 1.7 percentage points of GDP over the same period. In the meantime, despite a sustained
improvement over the past three years, tax revenue is still very low (at 11 percent of GDP) and widening of the tax
net remains a challenge. Little progress has been made in reforming the fiscal federalism system.
Monetary policy has improved and foreign exchange reserves have been rebuilt, and some progress has
been made in enhancing central bank independence, though further progress is needed. Monetary policy has
remained prudent in recent years and, helped by low oil prices and strong remittances, reserve buffers
strengthened to 3.8 months of imports in September 2015. The improved interest corridor promises to strengthen
the effectiveness of monetary policy. However, progress with enhancing central bank independence and
strengthening the anti-money laundering (AML) framework has been partial. While several important aspects of
central bank independence still need to be addressed, the recently passed amendments to the SBP law, including
the legal formation of an independent monetary policy committee, were a major step forward. Legal amendments
strengthening the AML framework have been passed, and further progress is needed to allow for appropriate
coverage of tax crimes under the AML framework.
Structural reforms advanced but remain incomplete in critical areas. Achievements were made in removing tax
exemptions and concessions, launching an ambitious privatization agenda, and improving the functioning of the
power sector and reducing power outages. At the same time, quasi-fiscal losses in the power sector, which have
accumulated to a stock of about 2 percent of GDP, and in large public enterprises continue, calling for accelerated
implementation of the privatization/restructuring agenda for loss-making public enterprises and completing the
energy sector reform. In addition, there is a need to review efforts to strengthen the business climate.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic activity appears robust amid mixed
signals. Growth has been underpinned by expansion of
large-scale manufacturing (3.9 percent y-o-y in the first
quarter), construction, and the services sector. Alongside,
consumer confidence continued to improve. However,
exports declined by 9 percent y-o-y (in US$ terms) in Q1
FY2015/16, owing to falling cotton prices and real exchange
rate appreciation, and growth of remittances eased to
4 percent y-o-y in Q1 FY2015/16 (from 18 percent in
FY2014/15). Foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by a half in
FY2014/15, albeit with some recovery in Q1 FY2015/16.
Despite several interest rate cuts (400 bps since November
2014, see Figure 2), real private sector credit growth remained
subdued at 2.2 percent y-o-y in July-September 2015.
Headline inflation picked up to 2.7 percent y-o-y in
November 2015 but remained near multi-year lows, driven by
lower food and energy prices. Core inflation has also declined
to 4.1 percent in November, still significantly above headline
inflation. Officially reported unemployment has remained
stable at around 6 percent over the past five years, although a
large share of the economy is informal.
5.
The external position has further strengthened.
Despite weak export performance, the current account deficit
narrowed to 1 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15 and is on track
for a further gradual decline this year, helped by lower oil
prices and increased grant assistance from the Coalition
Support Fund (CSF). Owing to SBP purchases to save the oil
windfall, foreign exchange reserves reached US$15.2 billion at
end-September, covering almost four months of imports.
Nevertheless, export competitiveness has suffered from
structural factors such as security concerns, power outages, and
an unfavorable business climate, as well as from significant real
exchange rate appreciation over the past two years (Box 2).
6.
Banking system soundness indicators remain
adequate. Banking system profitability increased, albeit on the
back of higher government borrowing which exceeds credit to
the private sector. Alongside, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
increased to 18.2 percent in Q1, 2015/16 (from 15.5 percent last
fiscal year). Liquidity in the banking system has remained
adequate.

Box 2. Pakistan: External Sector Assessment
The current account deficit has come down from the peak of 8 percent
of GDP in FY2008 to 1 percent of GDP in FY2014/15. While the deficit is
relatively small, its structure—a large trade deficit (7½ percent of GDP)
financed by remittances (7 percent of GDP in FY2015) and other
transfers—highlights the importance of strengthening Pakistan’s export
competitiveness. Indeed, market shares for Pakistan’s exports have been
either stagnant or declining.
The structure of the financial account shows reliance on debt issuance
rather than on FDI flows, which have significantly declined over the last
decade. The net International Investment Position (IIP) has marginally
declined in the last years.

Following appreciation of the REER by 17 percent over the past two years, estimates from standard methodologies for
exchange rate assessment, while subject to significant uncertainty, point to overvaluation of varying degrees. The Fundwide EBA exercise suggests a modest overvaluation (just below 5 percent), finding the current account close to its norm
of -0.7 percent of GDP, with a policy gap of 1.2 percent of GDP driven by more expansionary than optimal fiscal policy and
still less than desirable reserve accumulation. By contrast, the REER-based EBA-lite method, explicitly accounting for factors
1
such as remittances and aid flows, suggests a much larger overvaluation of up to 20 percent. See the accompanying Selected
Issues Paper: “Improving Pakistan’s Competitiveness and Business Climate.”
Gross reserves have remained below the adequacy level as suggested by the ARA metric. At US$15.2 billion as of endSeptember, they cover 3.8 months of prospective imports, or 67 percent of the ARA metric. While gross reserves are broadly
in line with projections at the outset of the program, SBP spot foreign exchange purchases in FY2013/14 and FY2014/15 have
2
exceeded the significant windfall from commodity prices and remittances. Continued accumulation of reserves is needed to
further strengthen buffers while also supporting competitiveness.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook is favorable, contingent on sustained fiscal
consolidation and implementation of structural reforms (“reform” scenario, Box 3).


Growth is expected to increase to 4.5 percent this fiscal year and gradually reach about
5.5 percent in the medium term supported by ongoing strength in services and construction,
second-round effects of the marked decline in oil prices, expected improvements in the
supply of gas and electricity, investment related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC),1 gradual strengthening of domestic demand, and an improving investment climate
and security situation.



Inflation is expected to rebound to an average rate of about 3.7 percent this year due to
bottoming out of the effects of low commodity and food prices. In the medium term,
inflation is likely to hover around 5 percent, anchored by prudent monetary and fiscal
policies.



The current account deficit is expected to remain at close to 1 percent of GDP in
FY2015/16 as the benefits of lower oil prices will continue to be offset by weak export
performance and a more moderate growth in remittances owing to a weakening outlook for
non-oil growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the main source of
remittance flows. Foreign exchange reserves are on track to reach US$16 billion by endDecember 2015 and close to US$ 18 billion (about 70 percent of the ARA metric) by end of
FY2015/16.

8.
Near-term risks to this outlook have slightly tilted to the downside (see Risk
Assessment Matrix). External vulnerabilities include a protracted period of slower growth in key
advanced and emerging market economies (including in China and the GCC), hurting exports and
remittances. Continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar combined with limited variation in the rupee’s
exchange rate could further erode export competitiveness. Exports, and consequently growth, will
be adversely affected further if Pakistan falls behind its competitors in securing favorable treatment
in major markets.2 Ongoing legal challenges to electricity surcharges, and the still challenging
political and security conditions could affect economic activity and undermine fiscal consolidation
efforts. Conversely, fast implementation of CPEC projects and an improvement in the security
situation could boost investment and growth, and removal of international trade and financial
sanctions against Iran could have a positive impact on energy supply to Pakistan.

1

For a macroeconomic assessment of CPEC, see Box 1 in EBS/15/106.

2

For example, Pakistan is not a participant in the forthcoming Trans-Pacific Partnership, while some of its
competitors in textiles and clothing are.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

9.
A key medium-term risk could lie in slower reform implementation (“no reform”
scenario, Box 3). Slowdown or suspension of fiscal consolidation and key energy and other structural
reforms could reverse recent stability gains and affect total factor productivity and potential growth.
Deterioration of the power sector’s and other SOEs’ financial performance would lead to higher
budgetary transfers to compensate for companies’ losses. Together with lower tax revenue, this
would reduce the fiscal space for public investment and raise the deficit, potentially crowding out
private investment and fueling inflation. A reversal of stability gains together with slippages in
energy sector and other structural reforms would imply that economic confidence and the business
climate could deteriorate quickly, with increased instability and resumed power outages in the
industry. As a result, medium-term growth could slow to about 3.5 percent (the estimated long-term
growth in the absence of significant structural reforms to lift productivity and investment), with
increased domestic and external vulnerabilities.
10.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the economic outlook and risks.
While concurring with the overall risk assessment, the authorities noted that Pakistan is now better
prepared to withstand external shocks with improved policy instruments and the significant fiscal
and current account adjustment that took place over the past several years. The authorities also
emphasized the importance of maintaining the political momentum to implement reforms beyond
the program period, and requested continued technical assistance, notably with tax reforms.

ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA
Discussions focused on the macroeconomic policy mix, utilizing the benefits of low oil prices and strong
remittances to strengthen external buffers, progress with improving performance and addressing
arrears in the power sector, efforts to further strengthen financial stability, and structural reforms.

A. Consolidating Macroeconomic Stability and Resilience
11.
Low oil prices present a unique opportunity to solidify external stability. The SBP has
continued with spot purchases of foreign exchange, netting US$750 million in Q1 FY2015/16 to
further raise the reserve coverage and bolster resilience against external shocks. While the expected
tightening of global financial conditions and possible turbulence in international financial markets
can affect near-term capital inflows, staff and the authorities agreed that further accumulation of
reserves is desirable as the balance of payments position remains vulnerable. Staff noted that further
accumulation could also help arrest the recent trend of REER appreciation, which has been eroding
competitiveness, although staff agreed with the authorities that a range of other issues (such as
electricity shortages, security issues and the business environment) are adversely affecting it as well.
12.
A cautious monetary policy stance is warranted in the period ahead. The SBP has
pursued an accommodative monetary policy stance in the wake of declining inflation. Staff and the
authorities agreed that, as global financial conditions remain uncertain and inflation is expected to
rebound in the coming months, monetary policy needs to remain prudent and target clearly positive
real interest rates to preserve achievements in anchoring low inflation expectations and meet the
program’s monetary targets. Smooth functioning of the newly improved interest rate corridor
should continue to improve the SBP’s credibility among market participants, and the government
should continue supporting this credibility by continuing fiscal discipline and further improving cash
management.
13.
Staff supported the authorities’ medium-term plans to gradually move toward
inflation targeting. With various pre-conditions being put in place—strengthening of the interest
rate corridor, advancement of fiscal consolidation, establishment of an independent monetary policy
committee (MPC), development of technical forecasting capacity, and strengthening of the SBP’s
communication strategy—the SBP is planning to gradually move toward flexible (or soft) inflation
targeting over the medium term. Staff supported these plans and urged strengthening the monetary
policy transmission mechanism, including by further reducing fiscal dominance, while pointing out
that increased exchange rate flexibility under inflation targeting underscores the need to increase
reserve buffers to more adequate levels. In addition, staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
further strengthen central bank independence, by addressing the remaining recommendations of
the 2013 Safeguards Assessment during the current fiscal year (MEFP ¶7).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PAKISTAN

14.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to firmly reduce public debt through
fiscal consolidation. Pakistan’s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains vulnerable to shocks due to still
significant reliance on short-term debt instruments and, consequently, high gross financing needs
(Annex I). Further fiscal consolidation in the period ahead consistent with a budget deficit (excluding
grants) of 3½ percent of GDP in FY2016/17 and 2½ percent over the medium term, will help keep
debt on a firmly declining trajectory. The authorities agreed with the need for fiscal consolidation
while noting a preference for a somewhat more gradual path to address the country’s development
needs. In their view, removing constraints to private sector investment and FDI will take time, and
activity will need to be stimulated by the public sector in the interim, albeit with increased private
sector participation, e.g. through public-private partnerships (PPPs).
15.
There was agreement that fiscal consolidation needs to be based on a concerted effort
toward raising the tax-to-GDP ratio to 14.5 percent over the medium term. Pakistan needs
substantial fiscal space for growth-enhancing priority spending on infrastructure, education,
healthcare, and targeted social assistance. But the current level of tax collection is too low to provide
this space, and mobilizing additional revenue with focus on widening the tax net will be critical to
address the country’s pressing development and social needs. Despite increasing by one percent of
GDP since FY2012/13 to 11 percent of GDP in FY2014/15, tax revenue remains well below the level
observed in comparator developing countries and Pakistan’s estimated potential of over 22 percent
of GDP (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Unlocking Pakistan’s Revenue Potential”).
16.
In this context, a comprehensive and frontloaded tax reform agenda is needed. Federal
and provincial policy adjustments and institutional changes are needed to expand tax bases, reduce
concessions and exemptions, address fragmented tax administration, and improve tax compliance
across all sectors of the economy. The authorities agreed with the need to pursue such an agenda
while noting the substantial progress already achieved in tax administration reforms and reducing
tax expenditure. There was broad agreement on key elements of the reform agenda:


Continued removal of concessions and exemptions, most importantly from the General Sales
Tax (GST) and customs duties. Staff welcomed the authorities’ success in reducing the cost of tax
concessions and exemptions from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2013/14 to 1.5 percent in 2014/15 and
strictly limiting the authorization of administrative tax concessions and exemptions through
Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) to be temporary and only applicable in a number of
exceptional circumstances. It was agreed that continued removal of SROs will be needed to
widen the tax base and increase evenhandedness and fairness of the tax system.



Broadening the base and improving compliance. To increase the number of active taxpayers,
the authorities have introduced a variety of measures that are yielding some results (MEFP ¶14).
With this, the number of personal income tax (PIT) filers has increased by more than 200,000
over the last two years. Nevertheless, at around 970,000 as of end-November, the number of
active PIT filers is still significantly below the estimated 5.7 million potential taxpayers and the
number of corporate income tax (CIT) filers is less than one percent of all commercial and

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

industrial electricity users. Staff encouraged swift implementation of the newly adopted riskbased audit policy to identify noncompliance, and further measures to assess compliance risks,
improve access to taxypayers’ financial information, and pursuing a stepped-up agenda to
improve governance in tax administration (MEFP ¶15-16). Staff welcomed the authorities’ work
on legislation against “benami” transactions (SB), which will help reduce tax evasion.3 Adopting
amendments to the AML Act to include serious tax crimes and implementing measures targeting
the laundering of proceeds of tax crimes will also allow better detection and deterrence of tax
evasion (MEFP ¶29). Compliance can also be encouraged by swift handling of tax refunds: the
authorities plan to continue reducing the backlog of GST refund claims to a level consistent with
a three-month flow (or about PRs 20 billion) from PRs 87 billion in September 2015 (MEFP ¶13).
Supported by IMF technical assistance (TA), they are exploring further options for modernization
of GST and other taxes.


Improving taxation and collection at the provincial level. The seventh National Finance
Commission (NFC) award grants 57.5 percent of most revenues to the provinces. And although
some expenditure responsibilities have been devolved as well, the existing fiscal federalism
system remains unbalanced and tax revenue collection under provincial authority—GST on
services as well as agriculture and property taxes—is very low. Going forward, it will be
important for the government to seek a better balance in the demarkation of revenue and
expenditure responsibilities and encourage improvement in provincial revenue collection
(MEFP ¶18). Staff also urged the authorities to reduce fragmentation in tax administration and
improve cooperation with provincial tax authorities.

17.
Strengthening of debt and public finance management is needed to further reduce
fiscal risks. A debt management strategy based on building funding buffers, assessing off-budget
fiscal risks, diversifying financing from both domestic and external sources, and lengthening the
maturity profile of domestic debt will help mitigate these risks. In this context, staff welcomed the
authorities’ plans to continue enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of the Debt Policy
Coordination Office and to update the medium-term debt strategy by January 2016 (MEFP ¶23).
Meanwhile, proposals to further strengthen the existing fiscal responsibility framework, improve
intergovernmental policy corrdination, and develop a PPP framework at the federal level are being
developed with support from IMF TA. Their implementation will help provide a more effective
guidance for fiscal policy and ensure sound practices in the evaluation, prioritization, and
implementation of public investment projects (MEFP ¶19).

In “benami” transactions, assets are held by (or transferred to) a person but have been provided for (or paid by)
another person. These transactions can be used to conceal one’s assets and evade taxes.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PAKISTAN

B. Promoting Higher and More Inclusive Growth
Policies to Increase Competitiveness
18.
Decisive policy action can ease growth-limiting bottlenecks. Staff argued that, with swift
improvements in supporting policies, medium term growth could reach 6½ percent (Box 4). Staff
and the authorities agreed that policy priorities include broadening the tax base and further
reducing energy subsidies to free resources for higher public investment, strengthening the power
sector, improving the business climate, and restructuring or privatization of loss-making public
enterprises. Alongside, improving access to finance and further reducing public borrowing will be
critical to raise private investment.
19.
Within this agenda, staff emphasized the importance of improving export
performance. Pakistan lags behind most of its regional peers in terms of growth and level of
exports. The country’s exports are highly concentrated, with textile and clothing accounting for
about a half of total exports of goods. Moreover, Pakistan’s world market shares, both for these
products and across the full spectrum of exported goods, have been either stagnant or declining in
recent years (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Improving Pakistan’s Competitiveness and
Business Climate”). In staff’s view, this is reflective of both structural impediments to business
productivity and security issues. Moreover, the marked appreciation of the real effective exchange
rate over the last two years points to the need for continued structural reforms and supportive
monetary, fiscal, and financial sector policies to maintain a competitive real effective exchange rate,
supporting exports and import-competing industries.
20.
The authorities agreed with many components of staff’s analysis. They agreed with the
importance of raising business productivity and investment to stimulate exports and growth, while
also pointing to security-related constraints during the past decade which have affected outcomes.
They pointed to plans to work with the World Bank to develop a new reform agenda with specific
time-bound measures to strengthen the business climate (new end-February 2016 SB, MEFP ¶42).
They also highlighted their existing agenda to promote financial inclusion, develop alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms, simplify property registration, and develop the regulatory
framework for credit bureaus. The authorities were skeptical that public borrowing might crowd out
private sector credit amid adequate liquidity in the banking sector and low nominal loan demand for
working capital amid falling commodity prices. Pointing to the inherent imprecision of estimates of
exchange rate alignment, they held the view that the nominal exchange rate, being marketdetermined, is in line with fundamentals.

Box 4. Raising Medium-Term Growth
Improving competitiveness can significantly raise potential GDP growth. Pakistan currently ranks 138 out
of 189 economies in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report 2016 and 126 out of 140 countries in the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2015–16. The latter indicates that Pakistan ranks below
the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) comparator group in every subcategory but
market size and its score gradually deteriorated over the past 10 years. The results of Mitra and others (2015)
suggest that an improvement in the overall Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) score is significantly correlated
1
with economic growth through its positive effect on productivity. Staff estimates suggest that regulatory reforms
leading to improved business climate sufficient to reach average MENAP levels of the GCI and the FDI technology
transfer index, and increasing the shares of trade and public investment to GDP by one percentage point each,
could raise Pakistan’s medium-term potential growth rate to 6.5 percent in 2017–21. See accompanying Selected
Issues paper: “Improving Pakistan’s Competitiveness and Business Climate.”

The energy sector has begun to show improvement and completing this reform will
significantly enhance business productivity. Staff noted the progress achieved with reducing
untargeted energy subsidies from 2.3 percent of GDP in FY2011/12 to the planned 0.4 percent of
GDP in FY2015/16, along with improved collections and loss reduction. Staff also welcomed that the
end-September indicative ceiling on accumulation of power sector arrears was met, quarterly loss
reduction targets have been set for distribution companies (DISCOs) (October 2015 SB), and
progress is under way with setting multi-year tariffs, albeit with some delay owing to late finalization
of DISCO’s multi-year investment plans (missed end-November 2015 SB) (MEFP ¶37). Staff
emphasized the importance of implementing other aspects of the energy sector reform (Box 5),
including the privatization of DISCOs, overcoming legal challenges to electricity surcharges, and
completing the gas sector pricing reforms (MEFP ¶40). The authorities reiterated their commitment
to the energy sector reform and were optimistic about eliminating the power deficit in the medium

of other delays have led to bunching of a large number
of planned transactions in the next nine months, and staff felt that the overall agenda appears quite
ambitious despite the progress under way in most cases. The authorities expressed a strong
preference for swiftly advancing in this key reform area in light of the potential benefits for growth
and containing fiscal risks (MEFP ¶45).

Improving access to finance and financial sector stability
23.
Improving access to finance, notably to the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector,
will be important to boost medium-term growth. Access to finance for Pakistan’s 3.3 million
SMEs (about 90 percent of enterprises) is extremely limited, with only 7 percent of SMEs receiving
bank lending. Given the potential of the SME sector to generate growth and jobs, staff welcomed
the authorities’ plans to continue implementing policy reforms to improve SMEs’ access to finance
(Box 6).
24.
Strengthening financial sector resiliency and stability by reinforcing the regulatory
and supervisory frameworks remains a priority. Bolstering regulatory and supervisory
frameworks, strengthening corporate insolvency and bankruptcy regimes, instituting the deposit
insurance scheme, and enhancing consolidated supervision are essential to safeguard the financial
system. Also, improving the regulator’s contingency planning framework, including for domestically
important banks (D-SIBs), would strengthen financial resiliency. The authorities are evaluating policy
options to enhance supervision for D-SIBs (MEFP ¶26).

Box 5. Reforming the Power Sector is Critical to Raising Potential Growth
The power deficit has been a major constraint on growth in the
past decade. Utilizing less than 70 percent of its installed capacity,
Pakistan’s cash-strapped power sector has been unable to meet
the growing demand for electricity resulting in widespread outages
affecting both businesses and households.

arrears, also known as circular debt, gradually stripped the sector of
working capital, constraining investment and capacity utilization. As a quasi-fiscal liability, circular debt has also
increased fiscal risks. Since 2013, the authorities cleared a large part of circular debt from the budget and moved
another PRs 335 billion to the books of the specially-created Power Holding Company Ltd. (PHCL). This helped
relieve pressures in the system, but DISCOs’ continued loss-making led to re-accumulation of arrears which, together
with PHCL, amounted to about 2 percent of GDP in 2014/15.

The power sector is gradually improving amid the authorities’ efforts to eliminate the power deficit. Improved
load management has reduced power outages from 8–11 hours to near zero in industry and 6–8 hours for
households. Capacity utilization improved to 80 percent owing to improved fuel mix and management of generation.
The flow of circular debt has begun to decline with improved recoveries and lower line losses. Various planned
investments, including in the context of CPEC, envisage raising the sector’s installed capacity by GW 9 in the next five
years. Alongside, the authorities have begun to implement a plan to reduce the flow of circular debt envisaging,
among other things, improving efficiency in DISCOs, taking advantage of low oil prices to bridge the gap between
costs and tariffs while minimizing the impact on final consumers, efforts to improve the fuel mix, resolving nonpayment by provinces and special areas, strengthening of the regulatory environment, and introduction of multi-year
tariffs to incentivize investment. At the same time, privatization of DISCOs will help pay off part of the circular debt.
International experience points to the importance of a sustained reform effort. Continued improvement of
governance of the DISCOs and other aspects of the reform will be important to reap potential gains. For example,
starting from a similar position as Pakistan, Turkey moved fast to reform its energy sector, achieving a remarkable
turnaround in closing the energy gap and improving services between 2006 and 2014. Similar reforms in the
Philippines reduced system losses by 30 percent between 2007 and 2013, and decisive reforms in Chile doubled
annual generation capacity between 1990 and 1998.

Progress is under way to strengthen banks that are below regulatory capital
requirements. A rights issue for the only remaining CAR-non-compliant bank has been completed
and, after the due diligence of the investor is completed (expected by end-December 2015),
application of the full amount of the rights issue would enable it to become CAR-compliant
(MEFP ¶25).4 Time-bound plans are under way to bring three other small banks into compliance with
the minimum requirement for paid-up capital (MCR) by raising equity or privatizing affected public
banks.5 Staff stressed the need for the supervisor to continue to engage with noncompliant banks
for early compliance with statutory requirements, and, subsequently, for continued engagement to
ensure that banks remain in compliance. Nonperforming loans in the banking system have gradually
reduced but remain high at 12.5 percent in September 2015 amid complex legal procedures,
difficulties in enforcing collateral, and limited creditor rights. The authorities have introduced legal
amendments to parliament that would strengthen collateral enforcement. They are also improving
mortgage foreclosure and corporate restructuring legislation, with the aim to improve recovery
while preserving appropriate safeguards for borrowers (MEFP ¶26).

4

The size of this bank is about 0.9 percent of the banking system assets (or 0.4 percent of GDP), and the CAR
shortfall has decreased to PRs 0.3 billion.
5

These MCR non-compliant banks represent about 0.5 percent of banking sector assets (0.23 percent of GDP).

Box 6. Improving Access to Finance for SMEs
The SME sector has the potential to become an engine for jobs and growth. Pakistan’s SMEs represent about
30 percent of GDP, account for 25 percent of exported manufactured goods, and employ about 80 percent of the
non-agricultural labor force. However, bank lending to SMEs is only about 1.2 percent of GDP, and SMEs’ access
to finance is very low, also in comparison with regional peers, constraining opportunities for growth.
Supply side factors constraining access to finance: Banks’ propensity to lend to the private sector, particularly
SMEs, remains low because of high NPLs (32 percent among SME loans in September, 2015) and loan losses, lack
of credit information and adequate creditor rights, and limited competition among banks (banks tend to orient
activities toward profitable and low-risk government lending). The absence of an effective, secured lending chain
with ease of registration, and transfer and liquidation of collateral, especially for movable collateral, is an obstacle
to increasing SMEs’ access to finance. As result of these constraints, SMEs are charged high collateral (130–
140 percent of the total loan amount) and banks apply more stringent risk-management tenets on SMEs. In
addition, most banks do not have the required expertise, instruments, or capacity to gauge the feasibility of
granting access to finance to SMEs, and banks face high administrative costs to process loan applications, which
may reduce the marginal profit on already small facilities.
Demand side factors constraining access to finance: In an environment of insufficient access to finance and
market-based development solutions, the obstacles that SMEs face include the lack of financial literacy and
capacity skills, high rates of interest, high collateral requirements, and cumbersome documentation processes.
Banks are only the third preferred source of borrowing for SMEs, after nongovernmental organization MFIs and
family/friends networks, mainly due to high direct and indirect borrowing costs and complexity of loan products.
Policy options: Bolstering the financial sector’s development is vital to broadening access to finance, and to that
end, the authorities adopted a National Financial Inclusion Strategy in May 2015. It will be important to continue
developing the underlying legal and regulatory framework (bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings) and to
implement a viable secured lending chain to strengthen creditor rights. Improving the financial infrastructure,
including the credit information system, collateral and insolvency regimes, and accounting and auditing
standards would enhance the operation of financial

Staff supports the ongoing reforms to strengthen financial stability. To put in place
a modern deposit insurance mechanism in support of financial stability and resilience, the SBP has
finalized the draft Deposit Protection Fund (DPF) Act, which is on track for enactment by endFebruary 2016 (SB), and has begun the preparatory work to make the DPF operational by March
2016 (MEFP ¶28). The SBP is also strengthening, supported by IMF technical assistance, the
framework for supervision of financial conglomerates and its contingency planning framework for
systemically important banks. The authorities are pursuing a legislative agenda to put in place a
Futures Trading Bill and strengthen the regulatory powers of the Securities and Exchange
Commission of Pakistan (SECP) (MEFP ¶26). The SBP is also moving forward with phased
implementation of Basel III capital and liquidity standards (MEFP ¶27).
27.
Improving the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) legal framework remains a priority for financial stability, detecting proceeds of
corruption, and tax compliance (MEFP ¶29). The government submitted draft amendments to the
AML Act to the Senate that would include serious tax crimes in the Schedule of Offenses and enable
the use of AML tools to combat tax crimes. The Senate amended the draft legislation to significantly
limit the scope of tax crimes in the Schedule of Offenses and the National Assembly adopted it
without further changes. While not covering many important tax crimes, including related to
personal and corporate income taxes, these amendments are nonetheless a first step toward
widening the application of AML tools to proceeds of tax crimes. To further increase the scope, the
authorities plan to introduce to parliament by January 2016 amendments to the AML Act to cover
additional important tax crimes (new SB), for parliamentary passage and enactment by May 2016
(modified SB). Going forward, staff and the authorities agreed that, once the amendments are
adopted, there is a need to upgrade the regulatory framework to mitigate ML/FT risks, including
with regards to the proceeds of corruption and tax crimes; bolster the Financial Monitoring Unit’s
analytical capability; and strengthen the effective implementation of relevant United Nations
Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) to freeze terrorist assets.
Protecting the Vulnerable and Promoting Inclusiveness
28.
Staff supports the authorities’ work in expanding the targeted income support to the
vulnerable groups through the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). The BISP program
increased coverage to reach 5.14 million beneficiaries at end-September 2015, and is on track to
expand the number of beneficiaries to 5.3 million by the end of current fiscal year. The authorities
are in the process of securing support from development partners to protect the real purchasing
power of cash transfers. Furthermore, in partnership with the provincial governments, they rolled out
education-conditional cash transfers covering over 70 thousand children (48 percent are girls) in
32 districts at end-September 2015.
29.
Staff recommended policies to promote gender equality and female labor force
participation to help improve productivity. International evidence points to significant potential
gains from greater female labor force participation. Policies to promote gender equality include
facilitation of access to credit, strengthening legal and property rights, securing quotas for women in
senior/managerial positions, improving work/life balance with paternity leave, childcare and flexible

work arrangements, enhancing transfers under the BISP program, as well as improvements in rural
infrastructure (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Macroeconomic Gains from Gender Equity
in Pakistan”). The authorities agreed with gender equality as an important policy priority and
emphasized a number of recent measures, including in the financial inclusion strategy, enhancement
of BISP, and their efforts toward improving gender-responsive budgeting (MEFP ¶20).

PROGRAM ISSUES AND MODALITIES
30.
Program performance has been broadly satisfactory, although several quantitative
conditions have been missed:


Performance criteria. The end-September PCs on reserve accumulation, the SBP’s net
swap/forward position, and government borrowing from the SBP were met with significant
margins (Table 1). However, the PCs on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the SBP and the
general government budget deficit were missed by PRs 172 billion (4.9 percent of reserve
money) and PRs 23 billion (close to 0.1 percent of GDP), respectively.



Indicative targets. The end-September 2015 indicative targets on cash transfers under BISP and
the accumulation of power sector arrears were met. However, the IT on federal tax revenue was
missed by PRs 40 billion (0.15 percent of GDP).

31.
Fiscal underperformance in Q1 FY 2015/16 owed to a number of factors. They include
the shortfall in federal tax revenues owing to lower international commodity prices and domestic
disinflation, underperformance in the collection of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC), and
the temporarily reduced withholding tax rate on banking transactions.
32.
The authorities have agreed to implement corrective measures to attain the FY2015/16
revenue and deficit targets. On the spending front, the authorities have cut current and capital
expenditures by 0.1 percent of GDP and are absorbing additional budgetary spending related to the
new agricultural support package (amounting to 0.1 percent of GDP) within the recurrent spending
envelope. Similarly, additional budgetary spending as result of the reclassification of some “nonplan
loans” (amounting to 0.1 percent of GDP) will be made through re-allocation of existing capital
expenditure plans, including at the provincial level. On the revenue front, the authorities have
introduced additional tax measures (amounting to 0.15 percent of GDP) by raising the excise duty
on cigarettes and imposing regulatory duties and additional customs duties on a variety of products.
The authorities have also started the consultative process to eliminate tax concessions and
exemptions amounting to 0.3 percent of GDP on an annualized basis and are committed to
implementing this measure by February 2016 (or as part of the FY 2016/17 budget if the endDecember revenue target is met).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

PAKISTAN

33.
Corrective measures are under way in light of the missed NDA target. A combination
of factors led to higher-than-programmed NDA in Q1 FY2015/16: an unusual seasonal demand for
currency in circulation in connection with two Eid festivals, a higher volume of cash transactions in
light of financial disintermediation related to the new financial transactions tax for non-filers, and
injections in the interbank market to align money market rates close to the recently lowered policy
rate. A revised path for NDA consistent with projected inflation was agreed, and, consequently, the
end-December PC for NDA is proposed for modification to ensure adequate reserve money growth.
The authorities agreed on a prior action for end-November NDA to ensure that they are on track for
the revised end-December target. Based on preliminary information provided by the authorities at
the time of issuing this report, this prior action has been met.
34.
Most structural benchmarks have been met, and some modifications and new
benchmarks are proposed. Most SBs were met, including the merger of NTN and CNIC databases,
adoption of a risk-based audit policy by the FBR, improving the Debt Policy Coordination Office’s
staffing capacity and publishing quarterly debt management risk reports, operationalization of the
SBP’s improved interest rate corridor, enactment of the Credit Bureaus Act, and setting quarterly
performance targets for DISCOs. Enactment of amendments to the SBP law was completed as a
prior action in November (missed end-September SB). The SB on enactment of the AML Act
amendments including serious tax crimes is proposed to be modified for completion by May 2016.
In light of the missed end-November SB on determination and notification of multi-year tariffs in
three DISCOs, two new SBs are proposed for January and April 2016, respectively (Table 1 and MEFP,
¶38). This reflects the authorities’ plan to determine the tariffs first to facilitate the privatization
process, while notification would follow together with tariffs for all DISCOs according to an
established timeline. Five other new SBs in the areas of tax administration, AML, and energy sector
and business climate reforms are proposed (Table 2 and MEFP).
35.
Financing, program risks, and capacity to repay the Fund. Pakistan’s program financing
needs (estimated at US$7.2 billion or 3.2 percent of GDP) are fully covered for the current fiscal year
(the remainder of the program). Disbursements from multilateral and bilateral partners (including
about US$2.6 billion from the World Bank and the ADB) are expected to cover most of the financing
needs. Pakistan has access to international markets, which reduces financing risks going forward.
The reserves situation has continued to improve to cover almost four months of imports, but further
accumulation is needed to meet adequacy norms measured by the Fund’s ARA metric. The Fund’s
exposure to Pakistan increased with the disbursement made upon approval of the eighth review,
reaching SDR 3.24 billion (about US$4.5 billion and 7.0 percent of total external debt) by endSeptember 2015. Pakistan’s capacity to repay the Fund has been strengthened by supportive
policies, improved foreign exchange buffers on the back of strong remittances and low oil prices,
and a lower budget deficit. However, the materialization of risks to the economic outlook could
erode these gains, particularly in the context of the Fund’s exposure increasing further with new
EFF program disbursements (Table 11).

22

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Economic activity is improving and near-term vulnerabilities have been substantially
reduced. Real GDP growth is expected to further increase to around 4.5 percent this fiscal year and
inflation is expected to rise to an average rate of 3.7 percent. Since 2013, the authorities’ IMFsupported program has made significant progress with reducing near-term vulnerabilities by
reducing the budget deficit, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, strengthening the monetary
policy framework, and beginning to roll out a number of important structural reforms. Social
protection under BISP continues to expand and energy sector reforms have begun to reduce power
outages across the country. Despite several missed targets, program implementation has remained
adequate and, with continued reform implementation, growth is expected to accelerate to
5.5 percent in the medium term.
37.
The main medium-term challenge is to make the economy more resilient and
competitive to generate a strong and sustainable growth momentum. Low oil prices provide a
unique opportunity to continue strengthening foreign exchange reserves as a buffer against future
shocks. Further fiscal consolidation is needed to improve debt sustainability, reduce fiscal
dominance, and crowd in private investment. Sustained efforts with widening the tax net,
completing the energy sector reform, restructuring and privatization of loss-making public
enterprises, improving the business climate and competitiveness, and fostering financial sector
stability and development, are needed to generate higher and more inclusive growth.
38.
Continued efforts are needed to keep the fiscal program on track. The additional
measures adopted by the authorities to close the revenue shortfall and stay on track to meet endFY 2015/16 fiscal targets are welcome signs of ongoing commitment. Further fiscal consolidation
should target a budget deficit (excluding grants) of 3½ percent of GDP next year and 2½ percent
over the medium term to keep debt on a firmly declining trajectory and limit the borrowing
requirement from the domestic banking system.
39.
A sustained effort to widen the tax net should drive the fiscal consolidation. Despite
recent progress, at 11 percent of GDP, tax revenue remains much too low to allow for sustained
increases in infrastructure investment and social spending, which are needed to underpin Pakistan’s
development. The authorities’ commitment to raise this ratio to 14.5 percent in the medium term is
thus highly pertinent. To improve fairness of the tax system and mitigate economic distortions, this
goal should be achieved mainly by widening the tax net. Specific priorities include continued
removal of GST and customs duty concessions and exemptions, improving taxpayer compliance,
and encouraging better tax collection at the provincial level by rebalancing of the existing fiscal
federalism system and reducing fragmentation in tax administration. Alongside, upgrading of the
debt and public finance management frameworks should continue to further reduce fiscal risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PAKISTAN

40.
The authorities should continue strengthening the monetary policy framework while
maintaining a cautious monetary policy stance in the short term. The authorities’ corrective
action in restricting NDA growth puts monetary policy on track to achieve upcoming program
targets, in line with projections for moderate inflation. Monetary policy should continue to target
clearly positive real interest rates and keep inflation expectations well anchored amid increased
global financial market volatility. The establishment of an independent MPC is welcome, and the SBP
should continue to put in place pre-conditions for gradual transition for flexible inflation targeting in
the medium term. In this context, reducing fiscal dominance and further strengthening central bank
independence by addressing the remaining recommendations of the 2013 Safeguards Assessment
will be critical.
41.
Continued reform progress is needed to strengthen financial stability and increase
access to finance. Progress with strengthening banks that are below regulatory capital
requirements is welcome. Further bolstering regulatory and supervisory frameworks, instituting the
deposit insurance scheme, improving contingency planning, and enhancing consolidated
supervision are needed to safeguard financial sector stability. With only 7 percent of SMEs receiving
bank lending, it is important to remove structural impediments to access to credit by putting in
place efficient credit information and dispute resolution systems and strengthened frameworks for
collateral, insolvency, and corporate restructuring. These efforts should be complemented by
continued enhancement of the AML/CFT framework. The recently passed amendments to the AML
Act constitute a first step toward widening the application of AML tools to proceeds of tax crimes.
However, many important tax crimes, including related to income taxes, are still not covered under
the AML legislation. Increasing the scope of tax crimes covered under the AML Act remains a priority
that should be addressed without delay in order to improve the efficiency of AML framework and
the ability to fight tax evasion. Efforts should also continue to improve systems to freeze terrorists’
assets.
42.
Advancing structural reforms is critical to improve competitiveness and boost
potential growth in the medium term. Priorities include mobilizing revenue and further reducing
energy subsidies to free resources for higher public investment, persistent progress with the energy
sector reform, improving the business climate and competitiveness, and restructuring or privatizing
loss-making public enterprises. Building on the progress under way in these areas, swift reform
implementation in the period ahead could significantly raise Pakistan’s medium-term growth,
helping to create jobs for new labor market entrants and raising living standards. Alongside,
continued policies to promote gender equality and strengthen targeted social protection will be
important to support higher and more inclusive growth.

43.
On the basis of Pakistan’s performance under the extended arrangement and the
corrective actions outlined above, staff supports the authorities’ request for completion
of the ninth review under the arrangement and for waivers for the nonobservance of the endSeptember PCs on the budget deficit and NDA of the SBP, and modification of the endDecember 2015 PC on NDA. Staff also recommends the establishment of end-March 2015 PCs;
setting of seven new structural benchmarks; and the revision to the timeline of structural
benchmarks as proposed in the attached MEFP. It is recommended that the next Article IV
consultation take place on the 24-month cycle in accordance with the Decision on Article IV
Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010)).

Annex I. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Pakistan’s public debt is projected to decline from 64.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to 55.2 percent by
2021. This downward path, however, is conditional on continued fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms over the medium term. High gross financing needs and reliance on short-term borrowing keep
public debt dynamics vulnerable to shocks, and this fragility, while ameliorated by a captive domestic
investor base and the Fund-supported program, will likely remain in the foreseeable future. Pakistan’s
debt dynamics are particularly vulnerable to economic growth, primary balance slippage and interest
rate shocks because of the significant reliance on short-term debt, highlighting the need for sustained
fiscal consolidation and an increase in the average debt maturity.
1.
Pakistan’s public debt dynamics have improved over the past few years but remain
vulnerable to shocks. Prior to the current Fund-supported economic stabilization program,
Pakistan’s debt-to-GDP ratio was on an upward trend as a result of large fiscal deficits, although
debt dynamics benefited from low effective real interest rates provided by central bank financing.
However, significant fiscal consolidation—lowering the budget deficit from 8.9 percent of GDP in
FY2011/12 to 5.4 percent in FY2014/15—has helped reverse this adverse trend. The coverage used
for public debt includes federal and provincial governments, but does not include state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). Consequently, government guarantees and circular debt among energy SOEs
represent contingent liabilities amounting to 2.3 percent and 0.8 percent of GDP, respectively.
2.
Domestic funding remains reliant on short-term instruments, but active debt
management has improved the maturity profile. The share of short-term domestic debt (less
than one year) remains close to 50 percent, albeit declining significantly from 64 percent in 2013,
as the authorities have extended the yield curve and made improvements in debt management.
Although domestic funding remains reliant on short-term debt and various national saving schemes,
these instruments have a relatively captive investor base. On the external debt front, the authorities
have issued more marketable securities as part of their diversification strategy, but bonds and bank
private creditors still account for only about 3 percent of the total.
3.
The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions underpinning the DSA are based on the
medium-term baseline scenario. The program assumptions on growth and inflation are realistic
and remain in line with the incoming data. Real GDP growth is projected to improve over the
medium-term above the levels observed in recent years, as the economy moves beyond the impact
of the global crisis and the severe floods. On the other hand, while benefiting from the fall in
international commodity prices, Pakistan continues to face significant security concerns as a
downside risk. The envisaged primary balance is larger and more persistent relative to Pakistan’s
previous track record, which increases vulnerability to fiscal policy slippages and exogenous growth
shocks over the medium term.

4.
Public debt is projected to decline to 55.2 percent of GDP by 2021, but high gross
financing needs are a source of significant fragility. Fiscal consolidation under the program is the
key driver of improvements in debt dynamics. Fiscal adjustment not only improves the debt ratio
under the baseline scenario, but the declining trend is quite resilient to standard size shocks
envisaged in the DSA. The fan charts show that debt would stabilize even under significant shocks,
and it is only when one restricts the distribution of positive shocks to the primary balance that the
public debt-to-GDP ratio trends up under strong shocks. However, gross financing needs are high
and are sensitive to shocks. While the consolidation will ameliorate this risk, a more significant
improvement in the debt profile will require longer term fiscal consolidation efforts. These gross
financing needs indicators reflect the relatively large share of national savings schemes which, given
their diversified base, might have a smaller rollover risk.
5.
The external DSA shows that the projected path for external debt is sustainable. Gross
external debt as a percentage of GDP has been on a declining trend—reaching 24.4 percent in
2015—and is expected to see a continued modest decline over the medium term. This is consistent
with relatively stable gross financing needs, which are expected to peak at 2.6 percent of GDP.
Bound and stress tests suggest that the external debt-to-GDP ratio is resilient to adverse shocks.
While sensitive to growth and exchange rate shocks, the external debt ratio would not exceed
37 percent of GDP under any scenario.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
December 3, 2015

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC, 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde,
Reaching the ninth review under our three-year economic reform program, we continue to make
significant progress with our economic policies. Risks present at the beginning of the program have
greatly receded as we have reduced our budget deficit and rebuilt our foreign exchange buffers.
Alongside, we have rationalized untargeted energy subsidies, while significantly expanding coverage
under the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) to protect the most vulnerable segments of
society.
Looking ahead, we remain strongly committed to achieving the remaining objectives of the
program. In this context, we focus on reinforcing and building on our recent macroeconomic
stability gains, and on advancing further structural reforms to achieve higher, sustainable, and
inclusive economic growth. A major goal in this regard is to continue to widen the tax net to
generate the necessary resources for higher infrastructure and social spending while strengthening
public finances. In addition, we are addressing the circular debt issue in the power sector, continuing
to build foreign exchange reserves buffers to bolster resilience in the face of external shocks,
advancing in the implementation of our plans for privatization and restructuring of public
enterprises, and creating suitable conditions for higher investment and exports by improving
competitiveness and the business climate. The actions described in the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are consistent with this strategy.
While our performance on the ninth review has been broadly satisfactory, we have encountered
some difficulties:
Quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks (Tables 1 and 2). EndSeptember 2015 quantitative performance criteria (PCs) on the SBP’s net international reserves,
government borrowing from the SBP, and foreign currency swap/forward position were met, and so
were the indicative targets on accumulation of power sector arrears and social spending under the
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). However, the PCs on net domestic assets (NDA) and the
fiscal deficit were missed, as was the indicative target on tax revenue. We are taking corrective
action to meet the remaining quarterly targets under the program, as outlined in the attached MEFP.
We request waivers of nonobservance for the missed performance criteria based on our corrective
actions.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

The program will continue to be monitored through prior actions, quantitative performance criteria,
indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. As detailed in the attached MEFP, we propose new
structural benchmarks against which to measure progress under the program (MEFP, Tables 1 and
2). The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) explains how the program targets
are measured.
In the attached MEFP, we set out our plans to further advance the objectives of our stabilization and
inclusive growth program. We propose to modify the end-December PC on NDA in line with our
revised monetary projections and set new PCs for March 2016 as specified in the attached MEFP,
and completion of the ninth review under the Extended Arrangement. We reaffirm our commitment
to our economic reform program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We believe
that the policies set forth in this letter and in the letters of August 19, 2013, December 11, 2013,
March 6, 2014, June 19, 2014, December 2, 2014, March 12, 2015, June 12, 2015, and September 15,
2015 are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, and we stand ready to take additional
measures as appropriate to ensure achievement of its objectives. As is standard under all IMF
arrangements, we will consult with the IMF before modifying measures contained in this Letter or
adopting new measures that would deviate from the goals of the program, and will provide the IMF
with the necessary information for program monitoring. We authorize the IMF to publish this Letter
of Intent and its attachments, and the related staff report.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
1.
Economic activity remains robust amid mixed signs. We expect, for program purposes,
that real GDP growth will reach about 4.5 percent in FY 2015/16. However the government retains its
goal of achieving growth of 5.5 percent this fiscal year. Lower oil prices, planned improvements in
the supply of gas and electricity, and investment related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC) are supporting growth. Moreover, growth in large-scale manufacturing in the first quarter
(3.9 percent, compared to 2.6 percent last year) is encouraging. Nonetheless, there are challenges
going forward, as private credit growth has further declined and weakness in both exports and
imports are weighing on growth prospects. Headline consumer price inflation registered at
2.7 percent y-o-y in November, mainly driven by lower food and energy prices. We expect inflation
to increase to around 3.7 percent on average in FY2015/16, due to a likely bottoming out of the
effects of low commodity prices, but to remain well-anchored by continued prudent monetary and
fiscal policies.
2.
International reserves strengthened, helped by an improved current account. Gross
international reserves reached US$15.2 billion by end-September 2015, up from US$13.5 billion at
end-June 2015 and covering close to four months of prospective imports. Exports have continued
to decline reflecting lower commodity prices, weakening external demand, ongoing energy
shortages, security and business climate challenges, and the significant appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate (10 percent year-on-year in August 2015). However, low oil prices and
strong remittances helped improve the current account deficit in the first quarter to US$109 million
(compared to the average deficit of US$657 million in FY2014/15). Looking ahead, we expect further
improvement in our foreign reserve coverage to more than four months of imports by endFY2015/16.
3.
The fiscal outturn in the first quarter of FY2015/16 fell short of the program targets.
The PC on the general government budget deficit excluding grants was missed by PRs 23 billion
(0.07 percent of GDP), including the adjustor for one-off spending on security and internallydisplaced persons. This deviation was due largely to the shortfall in federal tax revenues by PRs
40 billion (missed end-September IT). Nonetheless, we maintained strict spending discipline amid
higher-than-expected interest payments of PRs 75 billion. We met the IT on targeted cash transfers
through the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) and expanded the BISP coverage to
5.14 million beneficiaries last quarter. Likewise, the end-September IT on accumulation of power
sector arrears was met.
4.
Despite lowering government borrowing from the SBP, private sector credit growth
continued to decelerate. Favorable international oil prices, stable macroeconomic conditions, and
steady spot purchases in the market helped us meet the end-September NIR target with a margin of
US$70 million. We also comfortably met the target on the SBP’s net short position of swap/forward

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

contracts. However, we missed the end-September NDA target by PRs 181 billion largely due to
(i) an unusual seasonal demand for currency in circulation in Q1 FY2015/16 as a result of the two Eid
festivals, (ii) a higher volume of cash transactions in light of financial disintermediation related to the
new financial transactions tax for non-filers, and (iii) injection in the interbank market to align money
market rates close to the recently lowered policy rate. These developments led to a sharp increase in
reserve money by 24.9 percent y-o-y in September 2015, and broad money expansion of
14.5 percent y-o-y. Nevertheless, private sector credit expansion continued to slow down to
3.6 percent y-o-y in September 2015, amid lower commodity prices, which have reduced the
requirements for working capital and trade finance, and lower interest rates. However, credit for
fixed investment grew by 21 percent year-on-year in September 2015. We have taken corrective
actions to bring the stock of NDA to below PRs 2,652 billion by end-November 2015, subject to
program adjustors (prior action).

Economic Policies
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary and exchange rate policies will remain focused on further boosting external reserves,
maintaining price stability, and strengthening SBP independence.
5.
We are committed to further strengthening our foreign exchange reserves and
alleviate external vulnerabilities. As the outlook for international oil prices remains favorable, we
continue to take full advantage of the oil windfall and build external buffers. In the meantime, we
are committed to improving our trade competitiveness, which has eroded in recent months. In this
regard, the rupee has depreciated by 3 ½ percent during July-October 2015.
6.
We are committed to maintaining a prudent monetary policy stance. The SBP lowered
the policy rate (along with the repo and the reverse repo rates) by 50 bps in September 2015. We
expect a continuation of uncertain global financial conditions and higher inflation in coming
months. To anchor low inflation expectations and meet the program’s monetary targets, the SBP will
maintain positive real interest rates and continue to set the policy rate in a forward-looking fashion.
We believe that the newly improved interest rate corridor continues to work smoothly and improves
the SBP’s credibility among market participants. The government will continue to support this
framework with sustained fiscal discipline.
7.
Efforts to further strengthen the SBP’s independence are underway. Amendments to
the SBP law that include creation of an independent decision-making monetary policy committee
have been approved by the Senate with a change regarding the committee’s composition, hence reapproved by the National Assembly and enacted in November 2015 (prior action). In addition, we
are working with IMF staff to address the remaining recommendations of the 2013 Safeguards
Assessment during the remainder of the program period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

PAKISTAN

8.
Over the medium term, we are working to strengthen the monetary policy
transmission mechanism and gradually move toward an inflation targeting framework. To this
end, we are further strengthening the SBP’s analytical capabilities in support of a flexible inflation
targeting framework continuing implementation of the new interest rate corridor, improving
transparency, and disseminating information about inflation expectations and forecast.

B. Fiscal Policy
9.
While the budget deficit target was missed in the first quarter of FY2015/16, we
remain committed to sustained fiscal consolidation. To place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm
downward trajectory, bolster macroeconomic stability, and set the stage for sustainable and
inclusive growth, we remain determined to lowering the budget deficit excluding grants to 4.3 of
GDP in the current fiscal year and to 3½ percent by the end of the program in FY2016/17, mainly
through revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization across all layers of government. This
will create the much-desired fiscal space for priority spending on infrastructure, education,
healthcare, and targeted social assistance to improve living standards and to protect the most
vulnerable segments of our society.
10.
We will take additional measures to attain the budget deficit target of 4.3 percent
of GDP, including an adjustor of 0.3 percent of GDP for critical one-off spending. Lower
international commodity prices and domestic inflation, underperformance in the collection of Gas
Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC), and the temporarily reduced withholding tax rate on
banking transactions have constrained revenue collection, contributing to a shortfall of PRs
40 billion in the first quarter of FY2015/16. Although we have raised the General Sales Tax (GST)
rates on petroleum products in recent months, this could still lead to a full-year revenue gap. To
bridge the projected fiscal gap and meet the IT on federal tax revenue, we took additional revenue
measures amounting to PRs 40 billion by imposing regulatory duties and additional customs duties
on a variety of products besides raising the excise duty on cigarettes. Furthermore, the process on
consultation on SRO removal (phase III), yielding 0.3 percent of GDP on a full-year basis, shall be
initiated in December 2015, to be concluded by end-January 2016. We will enact this measure by
end-February 2016. If the end-December revenue target is met, this measure will be introduced as
part of the FY2016/17 Finance Bill. In addition, on the expenditure side, we will reduce recurrent and
capital spending by PRs 15 billion each, unless stronger federal revenue performance warrants
otherwise.
11.
Over the past two years, we have carried out an ambitious program of tax reforms.
This has included: (i) eliminating decades old distortive and discriminatory tax exemptions and
concessions amounting to PRs 224 billion; (ii) introducing the concept of differential taxation of
filers and non-filers to reward compliance and penalize noncompliance; (iii) reengineering and
automating business processes and procedures in tax administration; and (iv) initiating far-reaching
tariff liberalization and putting in place measures to bring about behavior change among taxpayers.
In addition, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) did not grant any new tax concessions and
exemptions and the government did not issue concessional Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs),

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

except under exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, parliament approved the legislation
permanently restricting the government’s authority to grant tax concessions or exemptions. Such
concessions and exemptions are now in the purview of parliament, except in a number of specified
exceptional circumstances, in which the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet can
grant them on a temporary basis.
12.
We are renewing our efforts to strengthen tax revenue mobilization with a growthfriendly reform agenda. While we have steadily raised the tax-to-GDP ratio, it still remains low and
we continue to see great scope to increase tax revenue by broadening the tax base, strengthening
tax administration, and shifting the tax composition from indirect to direct taxes in an efficient and
equitable way. Our objective is to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to 14.5 percent by FY2019/20. To this
end, we will further streamline tax concessions and exemptions, except for goods with social priority,
well-targeted export incentives, and those related to bilateral trade agreements and international
conventions. As part of the FY2016/17 budget, we will continue to simplify the GST regime and
move toward a single standard rate and limited exceptions and exemptions, and to improve the
taxation of capital gains, including on real estate investments.
13.
We are committed to modernizing the GST regime and dealing with the backlog on
GST refund claims at a faster pace. We will continue making efforts to optimize the GST on goods
and services in close coordination with provincial revenue authorities before the FY2016/17 budget
is presented to parliament. We managed to lower the amount of outstanding GST refund claims
from the peak of PRs 113.2 billion in November 2014 to PRs 86.5 billion by end-September 2015.
With the introduction of an automated system of pre-verification in addition to post-verification, the
FBR has accelerated processing and payment of GST refund claims. Our aim is to bring the stock of
GST refund claims to a level consistent with no more than a three-month flow of claims (estimated
at PRs 20 billion).
14.
Recent efforts to enhance tax administration have yielded gains, but the gap between
potential and actual tax collections remains. We met our target to issue 225,000 first notices by
end-September 2015, to bring more potential taxpayers into the revenue base. This helped increase
the number of taxpayers filing for income tax return from 722,000 on July 1, 2013 (for tax year 2012)
to 967,544 (for tax-year 2014) as of end-November 2015. We have also started a new initiative in
FY2014/15 to bring retail trade into the tax net. Under this initiative, retail trade is bifurcated into
two tiers. Small retailers (Tier 2) are being charged GST as part of their monthly electricity bills at
varying rates according to the amount of electricity consumption. Large retailers (Tier 1) are being
registered under the GST law. Out of 15,000 large retailers identified, we already registered about
6,500 retail outlets by end-September 2015.
15.
We will accelerate tax administration reforms to improve compliance and
enforcement, which are critical to realize our revenue potential. We will continue to strengthen
the culture of taxation by aggressively pursuing tax evaders, avoiding tax amnesty schemes, and
adopting a program of comprehensive reform of the tax institutions. We will further improve our
enforcement efforts on non-filers who have the potential to contribute at least the average tax paid
by currently registered taxpayers and especially large corporations and high wealth individuals:

We will continue to improve the FBR’s information technology infrastructure and expand its
access to taxpayer information. We have integrated the National Tax Number (NTN) system
with the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) database (SB, end-September 2015).
This allows us to improve taxpayer compliance and broaden tax bases as we record all
financial and property transactions by individuals with CNIC numbers.



Our tax audit initiatives have shown great success. With the number of audits increasing
from 3,000 in FY2010/11 to 74,492 in FY2012/13, additional tax assessments surged from
PRs 1 billion to PRs 50 billion over the same period. The FBR has adopted a new risk-based
auditing policy to identify those taxpayers who are most likely to be noncompliant (SB, endSeptember 2015). The FBR will put in place a comprehensive monitoring system with
quantitative performance criteria, such as the number of risk-based audits, as well as
qualitative audit indicators (new SB, end-December 2015).



The income tax law has been amended to provide the FBR with full access to bank accounts
and transactions, with a view to minimize the risk of tax avoidance and evasion. A series of
legal challenges, however, has delayed operationalization of this provision. While we are
actively pursuing a legal resolution, the FBR is strengthening its intelligence capacity to
gather financial information, particularly on high wealth individuals, from multiple sources
including real estate transactions, motor vehicle procurement, survey of palatial houses, and
international travel.



By end-January 2016, we will prepare and submit to the National Assembly draft legislation
against “benami” transactions, in which assets are held by or transferred to a person, but
have been provided for, or paid by, another person (SB).



We now require all government suppliers to be on the current list of active income and GST
taxpayers to conduct business with government departments. In addition, the FBR has
started monitoring the penalties imposed by its field officers.



We will streamline the online filing scheme (which will facilitate registration and filing of PIT
returns by simplifying the tax return form) and maintain the coverage of tax audits at
7.5 percent of filed tax returns.



We will establish a tax policy research and analysis unit under the Revenue Division to
improve our analytical capacity for fiscal policymaking.

16.
We place emphasis on taking measures to improve governance and reduce the
likelihood of corruption in tax administration. We have established an integrity management unit
in the FBR and collected asset declarations of all FBR employees. We will further strengthen the
integrity management unit by identifying potential processes within the FBR that could strengthen
its anti-corruption structures, including in the Directorate General of Internal Audit, by endDecember 2015. We will simplify tax laws and procedures and work with provinces to consolidate
collection of provincial taxes and fees to make it easier for taxpayers to meet their obligations and

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

at the same time eliminate opportunities for corruption by limiting the discretion of tax officials. We
will also expand the IRIS (an end-to-end integrated IT system) to all business areas throughout the
FBR’s network of offices to further reduce discretion in tax administration. In addition, following the
ratification of the whistleblower law for tax crimes, we will establish communication platforms
(phone hotline and website) to facilitate public reporting of corrupt practices in tax administration,
the aggregate results of which we will publish on a quarterly basis, starting in April 2016.
17.
We will continue to manage budgetary spending prudently and strive to achieve the
contribution of provinces to fiscal consolidation. To this end, additional budgetary spending as
result of the reclassification of some non-plan loans (0.1 percent of GDP) will be made through reallocation of existing capital expenditure plans, including at the provincial level. The additional
budgetary spending related to the new agricultural spending package (0.1 percent of GDP) will be
absorbed within recurrent spending. As agreed, we are working towards reducing energy subsidies
(including amounts for arrears clearance) to 0.4 percent of GDP in FY2015/16, from 0.8 percent in
FY2014/15. To protect against a potential negative outcome of legal challenges to electricity
surcharges, we will take mitigating measures as necessary (¶32). To assure achievement of our fiscal
targets in FY2015/16 and beyond, the provincial finance secretaries have agreed in writing to
increase provincial budget surpluses consistent with the program. To this end, total provincial
spending will be maintained at 6.5 percent of GDP in FY2015/16, with total provincial own tax and
nontax revenues standing at 1.1 percent of GDP. We are intensifying our interaction with provincial
authorities at a higher level to arrive at a mechanism to strengthen the provinces’ fiscal commitment
for FY2015/16. We are also holding quarterly meetings among the federal and provincial Finance
Secretaries to review fiscal performance and coordinate spending priorities to correct any slippages
in a timely manner. We will again prepare contingency measures as needed and reduce expenditure
allocations in the first nine months of the year compared to the budget to create a fiscal buffer
against any deviation away from the program target.
18.
We aim to better balance devolution of revenue and expenditure responsibilities
between the federal government and provinces. With recent constitutional amendments,
Pakistan has a highly decentralized system of government. The seventh NFC award grants
57.5 percent of most revenues to the provinces, along with devolution of spending responsibilities
and administration of the GST on services in addition to the existing taxation authority in agriculture
and property. In the new round of NFC negotiations, we will seek an agreement to balance
devolution of revenue and expenditure responsibilities in a way that allows for macroeconomic
stability. The Federal government will encourage provinces to improve provincial revenue collection
by modernizing agriculture taxation and improving taxpayer compliance with a particular focus on
identifying mis-declarations in this area. In January 2016, we will start working closely with provincial
governments to establish a centralized electronic fiscal cadastre to better record transactions and
assess real estate tax for each property based on periodically updated market valuation.
19.
Strengthening the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation (FRDL) Act will provide
better policy guidance and anchor debt sustainability. Pakistan adopted the FRDL Act in 2005,
setting out the principles of sound management of public finances. Having worked with the law for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

PAKISTAN

more than a decade, it is time to evaluate its efficacy in meeting its basic objectives, and also to
ensure that it is in line with the emerging international best practices. Accordingly, we have sought
the Fund’s advice on options to strengthen the FRDL Act in terms of operational and procedural
aspects, such as an appropriate fiscal policy anchor, medium-term orientation of the budget
process, and policy coordination across all layers of government. In this context, we are also working
to improve the policies and procedures for government guarantees and risk management, even
though the size of government guarantees (about 2.3 percent of GDP in FY2014/15) remains
manageable. The exercise will enable us to follow international best practices to systematically
account for the fiscal costs and contingent liabilities associated with the broader public sector
operations including SOEs, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and special purpose vehicles (SPVs).
To this end, we have asked technical assistance from the Fund to develop a PPP framework at the
federal level.
20.
We will ensure that the budget preparation process takes into account the impact
of fiscal policy on gender equality. The ultimate objective of our economic program is to unlock
Pakistan’s growth potential and achieve inclusive growth that benefits every section of society. In
this context, gender equality is a key factor contributing to rapid and broad-based economic
growth. While improving gender equality in education and raising labor force participation among
women require a wide range of policy initiatives, we will enhance the budget preparation process
to better incorporate gender equality. To this end, we are reinvigorating the work on genderdisaggregated analysis and preparing a plan for gender-responsive budgeting. We will carry out
a gender-responsive analysis of the FY2015/16 budget with the assistance of our development
partners by end-February 2016, which will become a baseline for the FY2016/17 budget. To foster
gender equality throughout the country, we will share the findings of this analysis and policy
proposals with the provincial governments and will encourage them to use those findings in
formulating their respective budgets.
21.
We continue our support to the poor and most vulnerable segments of the population
through the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). As of end-September 2015, we have
reached 5.14 million beneficiaries and met the indicative target for transfer payments. In FY 2015/16
we are on track to expand the number of beneficiaries to 5.3 million. If additional donor support can
be secured, we will also further increase the stipends (as elaborated in the TMU). In order to improve
the service delivery to the beneficiaries and to reduce cost, we have already signed amendments in
the contracts executed with the commercial banks working with BISP. We have extended the existing
contracts with commercial banks for continuity of benefit transfers to BISP beneficiaries. To achieve
the beneficiary centric payment model, in collaboration with the State Bank of Pakistan, we are
revisiting the existing model and accordingly will enter into new contracts with the partner banks.
Decision in this regard is expected to be reached by November 2015 and if needed, a transition plan
would be finalized by end-November 2015. In partnership with the provincial governments, we have
rolled out education-conditional cash transfers (CCT). As of end-September 2015, we are disbursing
in 32 districts. Currently, more than 700 thousand children are beneficiaries of the CCT. We will
expand the total number of children benefitting from the program to 1 million by end-March 2016.

C. Fiscal Financing
22.
We are committed to further improve fiscal financing and cash management. The stock
of government borrowing from the SBP reduced by PRs 304 billion, well below the end-September
program target, helped by issuing T-bills, additional Coalition Support Fund (CSF) inflows, bond
issuance, borrowing from commercial banks and short-term foreign borrowing. To provide more
space for private sector credit growth, we will continue with our fiscal consolidation efforts, maintain
focus on securing adequate foreign financing, and improve our cash management system. We will
further improve our cash management coordination with provinces in light of forthcoming
recommendations by the IMF TA mission on the FRDL Act (¶20).
23.
We will strengthen the institutional framework for debt management. We are focusing
on reducing rollover risks, balancing financing from domestic and external sources, and lengthening
the maturity profile of domestic public debt, while continuing to watch contingent liabilities.
To further improve debt management, we will improve the effectiveness of the Debt Policy
Coordination Office (DPCO) and its integration in the Ministry of Finance’s core functions. We have
enhanced its staffing capacity for the implementation of an optimal borrowing strategy. We have
already taken steps to synchronize the rate setting between domestic retail and wholesale debt
markets. Specifically, to achieve savings in, and more effective decision-making for, government
borrowing, we will:


Continue to provide Fund staff with a detailed quarterly financing plan for the coming
12 months and publish our rolling quarterly issuance program for domestic public securities;



Update the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) covering the period
FY2015/16–FY2018/19 (preparation of an initial draft by end-November 2015 and
publication by end-January 2016); and



We met the end-October 2015 SB to appoint risk management staff (director and two staff)
and publish quarterly debt management risk reports covering all government liabilities
including guarantees, as defined in the TMU, to allow monitoring of fiscal and financial risks
and the implementation of the MTDS.

D. Financial Sector
24.
The banking sector remains sound, with high earnings and solvency ratios. The pre-tax
profit of the system increased by 43 percent y-o-y in September mainly attributed to increased net
interest income from investments in government securities and higher noninterest income, despite
higher provision charges. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved to 18.2 percent, significantly
above the 10 percent minimum requirement. As of end-September 2015, asset quality has remained
unchanged with the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio at 12.5 percent and net NPL ratio at 2.5 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

PAKISTAN

25.
The SBP is making progress in bolstering banks that are below the regulatory capital
adequacy requirement. Only one bank (out of 35 banks) remains CAR and MCR-noncompliant.1
A rights issue to correct for the shortfall has been completed and, after the due diligence of the
investor is completed (expected by end-December 2015), application of the full amount of the rights
issue would enable it to become CAR-compliant. We will continue to engage with the bank to
ensure it will stay CAR-compliant thereafter. Additionally, three small banks, while remaining CARcompliant, are still below the minimum capital requirement (MCR). We are on track to implement
our devised time-bound plan to bring these banks into regulatory compliance by end-June 2016.
26.
We remain committed to protecting financial stability by reinforcing the regulatory
and supervisory framework.


The revised Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Act to enhance the
regulatory power of the SECP will be discussed with the IMF and will be considered by the
CCI before being submitted to Parliament for enactment by April 2016.



The Futures Trading Bill is being finalized and will be placed before Parliament by endDecember 2015.



A working group of the SBP-SECP joint task force continues to work on surveillance and
assessment of banking groups and financial conglomerates for their effective monitoring
and supervision. With support of IMF TA, we are developing a framework for consolidated
supervision of banking groups.



To improve the recovery of NPLs without banking court intervention and enhance credit
growth, amendments to the foreclosure clauses in the Financial Institutions (Recovery of
Finances) Ordinance, 2001, has been placed in Parliament for enactment. Alongside, the
draft Corporate Restructuring Companies (CRC) Act has been submitted to Parliament in
April 2015. These legal reforms will be pivotal for facilitating timely resolution of NPLs and
allowing banks to focus on their core areas of operation. The SECP has also prepared a
concept note for developing the Corporate Rehabilitation Act, which has been shared with
stakeholders.



The SBP continues to improve its contingency planning framework with support by IMF TA.
Among other things, this work will encompass a review of the legal framework, identification
of gaps, an assessment of the consolidated supervision framework and domestic
systemically important banks (D-SIBs). The SBP had already conducted an initial assessment
of identification of the D-SIBs and will work on developing the monitoring mechanism.

1

The size of this bank is about 0.9 percent of the banking system assets (or 0.4 percent of GDP), and the CAR
shortfall has decreased to PRs 0.3 billion. The bank’s CAR is at 9.63 percent (against 10 percent requirement).

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

27.
We are gradually transitioning to Basel III capital and liquidity standards. We are
phasing in the implementation of strengthened capital adequacy standards. The CAR requirement
will increase to 10.25 percent by December 2015, with further gradual steps toward 12.5 percent by
2019. We are also working toward adopting Basel III liquidity rules by end-December 2016.
28.
Instituting a modern deposit insurance scheme will strengthen the stability and
resilience of the banking system. The Deposit Protection Fund (DPF) Act has been finalized in line
with best international practices (as specified in the TMU), has been introduced in parliament in
November, 2015 and is expected to be enacted by end-February 2016 (SB). In the meantime, the
SBP has initiated a preparatory work to establish the corporate infrastructure of the DPF and has
requested IMF TA to help in this process. The DPF will become operational by March 2016.
29.
We continue strengthening the anti-money laundering and combating the financing
of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. We made progress toward meeting the end-November
benchmark on strengthening AML legislation. The Government submitted to the Senate the
amendments to the AML Act to include serious tax crimes in the Schedule of Offenses and enable
the use of the AML tools to combat tax crimes. Following amendments to the draft legislation by
the Senate that significantly limit the scope of tax crimes in the Schedule of Offenses, the National
Assembly adopted it without further changes. While the scope of tax crimes in the Schedule of
Offenses is limited, these amendments are nonetheless an important achievement as they open the
scope for using AML tools for the proceeds of tax crimes. To increase the scope, we will introduce
new amendments to parliament to cover additional important tax crimes, as defined in the TMU, by
January 2016 (new SB), for enactment by end-May 2016 (modified SB). We will continue
strengthening the effectiveness of the AML/CFT framework in line with international standards. We
will also continue to bolster the Financial Monitoring Unit’s analytical capability and strengthen the
effective implementation of the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions.

E. Energy Sector Reforms
30.
The National Energy Policy identified priority steps to anchor the reform agenda for
the next three–five years. We are implementing our time-bound strategy to tackle price
distortions, insufficient collections, costly and poorly targeted subsidies, governance and regulatory
deficiencies, and low efficiency in energy supply and distribution with the support of our
international partners. We are reducing electricity subsidies to 0.3 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16, and
allocating an additional 0.1 percent for arrears clearance. We also began addressing both the flow
and stock of payable arrears in the power sector including by allocating budgetary resources,
levying surcharges, gradual improvement in company performances and recoveries, and initiating
the process of privatizing power sector companies.

Price Adjustments.



In June 2015, we notified the FY2014/15 tariff, as determined by NEPRA, and implemented
surcharges in line with the program targets (as defined in the TMU ¶20). We are committed
to protect the level of revenue in the electricity sector by adjusting prices as needed. We will
undertake all necessary measures to ensure the full recovery of costs from consumers.



We are ensuring that technical loss diagnostic studies for all DISCOs will be finalized shortly
so that better estimates of loss rates can be considered by NEPRA in its FY2015/16 tariff
determination by end-April 2016.



We are committed to gradually phasing out untargeted subsidies, while continuing to
protect the most vulnerable consumers.

32.
Arrears (Circular Debt). We have developed a monitoring mechanism to track the stock
and flow of payables at all levels of the energy sector (including Power Sector Holding Company
Limited, PHCL) (as defined in TMU ¶22). There are two main components of the stock this circular
debt:


The payables in the power sector increased by PRs 13 billion in the first quarter of FY
2015/16 and currently stand at PRs 326 billion at end-September 2015. In addition to
current payables, it comprises: (i) a residual from payables clearance of June and July 2013;
(ii) a disputed amount with the Independent Power Producers (IPPs); (iii) Distribution
Companies (DISCOs) non-recovery and penalties levied on past nonpayment (as defined in
the TMU); (iv) transmission and distribution losses that are not recognized by the regulator;
(v) the debt that emerged from the court stay order on surcharges; (vi) unpaid amounts of
verified subsidy claims of DISCOs under various heads (vii) PHCL loan servicing, and
(viii) payables to cross border trade.



The stock of past arrears, including the PHCL, in the syndicated term credit finance (STCF)
facility remained at PRs 335 billion at end-September 2015.

33.
We have adopted a plan for reducing the accumulation of payables arrears and to
gradually eliminate the stock. This plan includes steps to improve collections and reduce
operating costs, losses, and price distortions in the tariff structure. With this, the accumulation
of payables will be reduced from PRs 209 billion in FY 2014/15 (including the PHCL) to under
PRs 100 billion in FY 2015/16, with a view towards further halving new arrears accumulation by
FY2018/19 (Table 1). While some elements of the plan have not been fully addressed i.e.
implementation in two regions and GST refunds, yet we have met the end-September IT on the flow
of power sector arrears, helped by lower international oil prices. We remain on track to meeting
upcoming quarterly targets.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN



We will continue to reduce losses and improve collections through capital expenditures and
revenue-based load management. Overall losses in at the last 12-months declined from
19.0 to 18.22 percent. Collections in the same period improved from 88.6 to 90.7 percent,
primarily due to better load management across consumers in rural and urban areas, and
industries. More broadly, to address increased losses in some DISCOs, the chief executives
and some members of senior management of poorly performing DISCOs have been
replaced, and we are working with provincial governments to address their payment
problems. We will work on improving the average performance of the sector further in
FY2015/16.



FY2014/15 determined tariffs utilized the room created by falling oil prices and late payment
surcharges, and incorporated better reflection of system losses. This is expected to arrest a
portion of the build-up of the circular debt and improve the cash-flow of the system. The
continued decline in fuel prices will also mitigate the build-up of arrears due to prior year
adjustments.



We have allocated about 0.1 percent of GDP of budgetary resources to clear part of the
stock of arrears that accrued in AJK, FATA and Baluchistan Tube Wells. We will continue to
work with these governments to prevent further accumulation of arrears.



We are moving the stock of PHCL debt into DISCOs’ balance sheets where privatization will
take place. This will help to reduce the stock of PHCL debt and will ease the servicing of this
debt. In the meantime, we will continue to fully service the PHCL obligations.

34.
Monitoring and enforcement. To further reduce losses, raise payment compliance, and
improve energy efficiency and service delivery, we have already signed performance contracts with
the boards of nine DISCOs. We have begun monitoring the performance indicators on a monthly
basis specified in the contracts and we have already invoked remedial measures for the
management of three distribution companies who failed to comply, as specified in the Companies’
Ordinance i.e. LESCO, HESCO, and SEPCO. We have already set quarterly loss-reduction, collection,
and recovery targets (as defined in the TMU ¶23) consistent with our arrears reduction plan for each
DISCO in September (mid-October 2015 SB). The amendments to Penal Code 1860 and the Code of
Criminal Procedures 1898 were promulgated through Presidential Ordinance which lapsed in August
2014. The Bill, after approval by the National Assembly, was transmitted to the Senate, which has
referred it to the relevant standing committee where its approval is awaited. We expect it to be
enacted by end-January 2016 (new SB). We will work with the Ministry of Law on creating an
effective system for handling cases related to electricity theft that can be effective by end-March
2016. In parallel, we drafted the new Electricity Act to modernize governance of the sector. We have
shared the draft Act with a broader set of stakeholders and submitted to the CCI secretariat in
October 2015 to build consensus with the provinces by end-March 2016.

35.
Demand Side Management. To improve resource allocation and energy efficiency, we are
using pricing (¶32) and other market-based instruments. We have finalized the required approvals to
begin Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) before the end of October 2015, which will be initially
implemented in LESCO and IESCO to help reduce commercial losses, increase recoveries and better
manage revenue-based load shedding. We have completed the consultative process with
stakeholders on the draft Pakistan Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act. In August 2014, the CCI
approved the bill and it is now in the National Assembly. We expect it to be enacted in early 2016.
The Act will include equipment performance standards, and would cover key electrical and gas
equipment and appliances which are not yet covered. In parallel, we are also preparing the
necessary implementing regulations.
36.
Supply Side Management. We continue to prioritize the use of gas and coal rather than
fuel oil in electricity generation and remain committed to a transition to market-based allocation
of natural gas in the medium-term. By providing adequate liquidity and therefore fuel inventories to
generation plants, we were able to prioritize generation at more efficient plants, while maintaining
better recovery from consumers and control over losses. This helped us to save significant costs
(PRs 47 billion) and increase power generation by 3 percent. In addition, the better load
management policy helped us attain zero load-shedding for industrial consumers and ensured
predictable and reduced load-shedding for urban and rural consumers. To further improve supply,
we will continue to rehabilitate generation plants, while upgrading electricity transmission and
distribution facilities to further reduce technical losses. In addition, we have signed performance
contracts with three state-owned generation companies which are run on furnace oil to reduce their
losses. We continue with the development of hydropower projects, with the start of construction of
the Dasu project. We will promote policies for private investment for power generation through
both the entry of new players as well as expanding existing capacity of those IPPs systematically
adhering to energy mix targets and least-cost generation plans. The expansions include around
1300 MW in 2015 and are expected to add an additional 700 MW in generation capacity in 2016.
Beyond this, 8.3 GW generation capacity is envisaged through FDI under the CPEC over 2017-2021,
with additional capacity expected to come on stream in the longer term. Power purchasing
agreements with investors should be agreed in a way that mitigates potential fiscal risks.
37.
Governance, Regulatory, and Transparency Improvements. Improving energy sector
governance and transparency, and strengthening the regulatory framework are critical for delivering
improved service and for attracting needed private sector investment. To begin addressing
administrative and technical constraints, we have appointed a new Chairman and Board member
with financial skills to NEPRA. NEPRA is moving forward with preparations to determine multi-year
tariffs. To facilitate the transition, DISCOs prepared five-year investment plans and submitted the
plans to NEPRA. The petition for FESCO was submitted in August, and submission of IESCO and
LESCO petitions were completed in October. We expect to complete the missed end-November
2015 SB by determining multi-year tariffs for FESCO by end-December 2015, and for IESCO and
LESCO by end-January 2016 (new SB), with the remaining ones done annually on a rolling basis. The
multi-year tariffs for FESCO, IESCO and LESCO will be notified by end-April 2016 (new SB). We have
set up the Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee (CPPA(G)) and have amended its Articles

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

of Association. We have separated it from the National Transmission and Dispatch Company
(NTDC). NTDC’s license has been modified so that it can no longer purchase or sell electricity. The
Market Operator Registration, Standards and Procedure Rules 2015 were issued in late May 2015
and the Commercial Code was approved by NEPRA in early June 2015. Key CPPA(G) staff are being
put in place. CPPA(G) is now functional. In line with our plans to liberalize the market, we have
introduced the policy for net metering in October 2015 that will allow the electricity producing
consumer to sell electricity to the system.
38.
Energy public sector enterprise (PSE) reform. We have already transferred governance
of DISCOs, three GENCOs, and the NTDC to new boards of directors and management. We are
committed to building the institutional capacity of the Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA), and we have begun to strengthen WAPDA’s financial capacity by allowing the tariff to
incorporate capital investment plans. We are also committed to ensuring timely payments by
CPPA(G) for all power purchased from WAPDA Hydel. We have included several DISCOs in our
privatization plans with the goal of privatizing three of them in the next fiscal year (¶46). We have
begun the process of introducing competitive pricing and direct contracting between power
producers and wholesale customers in the power sector. To that end, we introduced the necessary
policies and timeline through an ECC decision.
Oil and Gas Sector
39.
Supply. To help tackle gas shortages, we received the first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
imports at the end of March 2015. We have determined and notified the LNG prices on October 7,
2015. We are fully passing-through the cost of imported LNG to the end-user purchase price
(including to Compressed Natural Gas) and we will finalize the contractual agreements with all
relevant parties by end-November 2015. MW&P and MoPNR have recently finalized the RLNG
payment mechanism. We will also finalize with the independent power producers’ letters of credit
by November 2015. We have issued new exploration and production concessions for domestic gas
resources and continue to limit further expansion of the gas distribution networks for domestic
consumption.
40.
Pricing. In December 2013 we devised a gas price rationalization plan to encourage new
investment, promote efficiency in gas use, assure that there will continue to be no fiscal cost from
the gas sector, and eliminate distortions from the existing gas price structure. We remain committed
to the plan and are stepping up action to implement it:


Under the Petroleum Exploration and Production Policy 2012 (2012 Policy), we are
incentivizing producers to enhance production from existing fields as well as to initiate new
exploratory efforts, with price increases ranging from 2.8–3 U.S. dollars per MMBTU to
6–10 U.S. dollars per MMBTU. To this end, we are ensuring that existing concessions are in
the process of conversion to the 2012 Policy with support from international partners. So far,
we have converted 94 concessions with the remaining 26 that are currently being reviewed
in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources for determination of eligibility under the
2012 Policy. We have also awarded 46 concession agreements for the exploration of new

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

PAKISTAN

blocks under the 2012 Policy and are expecting to award additional 10–15 exploration
concessions by end-December 2015.


The loss in cost recovery incurred by gas companies due to the delayed price notifications
of FY2014/15 (due in July and January) was partially recuperated in the new tariff which was
notified and implemented, in line with the OGRA determination, in August, 2015.The
remaining revenue shortfall will be recuperated in the January 2016 gas price notification.
We will also make any necessary adjustments to notified prices to reflect imported gas
prices, so that the cost of this gas will be fully reflected in the tariff on a monthly basis.



Following enactment of the GIDC Act in May 2015, we have already recovered PRs 57 billion
in FY 2014/15 and PRs 25 billion in the first quarter of FY2015/16. In addition to the ongoing
GIDC collection, we will continue to focus on recovering GIDC from collecting agents that
had collected the GIDC in their prices before May 2015.



We are also evaluating the downstream gas business with the objective of reducing
inefficiencies in the transmission and distribution segments. In this respect, the World Bank
awarded a contract to consultants at the end of June 2015 to support our study of the
restructuring, unbundling, and eventual privatization of the two gas utility companies. This
study will formulate recommendations based on international best practices to segregate the
gas network into one transmission and multiple distribution companies, with independent
profit and cost centers to ensure maximum efficiency. A mechanism will also be developed
for determining separate transmission and distribution tariffs.

41.
Governance. We are committed to supporting the governance of the oil and gas market
and to keeping the public informed about our strategy for the sector. To that end:


We have established performance monitoring units in the Ministry of Water and Power and
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) which report progress quarterly to the
ECC. We are committed to updating the public on reform progress and are therefore
posting quarterly monitoring reports on the websites of the concerned ministries. The first
two monitoring reports were approved by the ECC in April 2015, and October 2015 and we
have already disclosed these reports on the Ministry MPNR’s website. To support the efforts
of the regulator, we advertised the vacant positions on the Board of the Oil and Gas
Regulatory Authority (OGRA). We have appointed the Member Finance, but were not able to
select the Member Oil and re-advertised the position with revised criteria.



We will further encourage bilateral contracting between producers and consumers. OGRA is
reviewing rules for third party access to the gas transmission system.



We are also pursuing companies to reduce losses by benchmarking international standards,
through investment measures, managerial and administrative improvements, and through
building the capacity of the gas distribution companies. The current level of Unaccounted
For Gas (UFG) was on average 10.3 percent in the first quarter of FY2015/16 due to

commercial and technical losses. The gas companies submitted loss reduction plans to the
MPNR in May 2015 and Sui Southern Gas Company is working with the World Bank on the
Natural Gas Efficiency Project (NGEP).


Finally, in January 2014, the President promulgated the Gas (Theft Control and Recovery)
Ordinance 2014, which was sent to Parliament. The Senate has approved the Ordinance and
it was sent for consideration by the National Assembly, however, the National Assembly did
not approve the Ordinance during the required 90 days, and hence it was returned to the
Senate. The government has put forward a motion to refer the law to an upcoming joint
session of parliament, for expected enactment before end-February 2016 (new SB).

F. Improving the Business Climate, Liberalizing Trade, and Reforming
Public Enterprises
We are working to improve the business climate, the trade regime, and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs)
to increase foreign and domestic private investment and boost economic growth.
42.
Business Climate. Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments in the
legal framework for creditors’ rights and contract enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups,
complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements, and limited access to finance. In consultation
with international partners, we finalized a time-bound detailed implementation plan in October
2014 that identified legislative and administrative actions, institutional roles and responsibilities, and
resource requirements of the reform program. Our focus is on six indicators—construction permits,
paying taxes, enforcing contracts, starting businesses, trading across borders, and getting credit. In
parallel, we are building consensus and ownership for business climate reforms by provincial
authorities with a special focus on property registration and contract enforcement. By end-February
2016 (new SB), we are also developing a new plan to overhaul our efforts to significantly improve
the ease of doing business.
 New Firms. The SECP, FBR, and Employees’ Old Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) have
joined to launch a virtual One-Stop-Shop (OSS) for business registration in December
2014 and we set up a physical OSS in Lahore in April 2015. We have set up another
physical OSS in Islamabad by September 2015. By streamlining overlapping procedures
and establishing database sharing and a common portal for registering businesses, the
OSS has begun facilitating new firm creation. We have so far reduced two procedures
and two days and plan to save an additional eight days of the procedures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

 Contract enforcement. We completed in March 2014 a study to identify necessary
changes to the bankruptcy regime that would support the rehabilitation of weak but
viable companies. Based on the findings of the study, we are reforming the bankruptcy
framework through introducing two far-reaching legislative measures: (i) the Corporate
Rehabilitation Act, which will provide a mechanism for the reorganization and
rehabilitation of distressed companies; and (ii) the CRC Act, which envisages setting up
private Corporate Restructuring Companies to take over assets of bankrupt companies
(¶27). The CRC Act has been placed before the Parliament in April 2015. In addition, we
have established Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in Karachi and
Lahore. The ADR mechanism has been extended to Islamabad and Rawalpindi in
September 2015. We began work to expand to other provincial capitals (i.e., Peshawar
and Quetta). We have begun to pilot commercial courts in Lahore to expedite resolution
of commercial disputes and contract enforcement.
 Paying Taxes. We have completed a review to reduce the number of existing processes
and forms for sales and income tax by end-March 2015 (SB). We have identified
39 income and sales tax processes that required elimination or streamlining. Based on
this review, we took measures to streamline, simplify, and automate procedures and
processes and we developed 8 IT-based modules. We have launched the integrated endto-end IT solution (IRIS) on the following 8 processes: registration, declaration,
audit/assessment, rectification, penalty, default surcharge, refunds, and exemption
certificates. We will continue to streamline and fine-tune the system based on the
feedback we receive from the taxpayers and in accordance with international best
practices. So far, we moved all internal operations to IRIS and conducting public
awareness campaigns to use the system.
43.
Access to credit. Access to finance for poor, women, and marginalized segments of society
including micro, small and rural enterprises remains very limited owing to both demand and supplyside constraints. In June 2015, the SBP issued guidelines to banks to facilitate the opening of bank
accounts for the unbanked population to meet the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS)
target of 50 percent adult population with bank accounts by 2020. Commercial banks have
developed quarterly and yearly plans to open Asaan (“Simple Small”) Accounts and are running
public awareness and media campaigns on the benefits of this initiative. We are devising plans to
strengthen the financial literacy of these new client groups. As a critical component of the NFIS to
improve the credit information system and help banks extend credit to broader sections of society,
the Credit Bureaus Bill has been enacted in August 2015 (end-November 2015 SB). The SBP will
finalize the development of the regulatory and operational framework by end-February 2016. The
existing private Credit Bureaus have to apply for SBP licensing by mid-October 2016 in order to
comply with the provisions of the Act. Among other priorities, the Act will ensure that credit
information sharing will protect the privacy rights of individuals.

44.
Trade Policy. Trade policy reforms will increase consumer welfare and stimulate growth as
a result of increased competition. Simplifying tariff rates, phasing out SROs (¶12) that establish
special rates and/or nontariff trade barriers in some 4,000 product areas, and improving trade
relations should deliver the much-needed competitive environment.
 Tariff simplification. We are implementing a plan to simplify the tariff structure to
move over three years to a simple, transparent framework, with four slabs between
2 and 20 percent rates with fewer exceptions.3 The FY2015/16 budget reduced tariff
slabs from six to five and further eliminates trade-related SROs. Implementation of the
new tariff structure that will reduce the slabs from five to four will be completed by July
2016.
 Improved trade relations. We are implementing a strategy to take full advantage of
trade preferences available from the European Union who have extended the
Generalized System of Preferences plus benefits from January 1, 2014 on a broad range
of Pakistan’s exports. We remain committed to promoting trade with regional countries,
especially under various regional trade arrangements.
45.
Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). We are working to reform or privatize PSEs, focusing on
limiting poor performance and improving public sector resource allocation. The Cabinet Committee
on Privatization initially approved a list of 31 PSEs for action and subsequently added another 8 PSEs
to the list. We have developed a plan to sequence the capital market and pre-privatization
restructuring for these firms. The privatization program has experienced some delays as a result of
which the number of transactions planned for the next twelve months has increased. While
recognizing potential implementation challenges, we are nevertheless determined to implement this
ambitious agenda.
 Capital Market Transactions Roadmap. We have identified ten companies, (listed in
the TMU), in the oil and gas, banking, and insurance sectors for block sales and primary
or secondary public offerings. We successfully sold minority stakes in United Bank
Limited (UBL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) in June 2014, Allied Bank Limited
(ABL) in December 2014, and Habib Bank Limited (HBL) in April 2015. Despite a slight
delay, we expect to hire a financial advisor for State Life Insurance by end-December
2015. We are also in the process of hiring a financial advisor for Mari Petroleum Limited,
and plan to finalize (as defined in the TMU) the sale of these companies’ minority shares
by end-June 2016. On the other hand, Pak Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) will likely be
removed from the list of PSEs to be privatized to consider alternative options. We are
working towards updating the roadmap for the remaining three companies in the list.

3

In addition, we maintain our current Free and Preferential Trade Agreements with some countries.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

PAKISTAN

 Strategic Private Sector Participation. We have identified 25 companies (listed in the
TMU) for strategic partnerships, which will act as a catalyst in unlocking their potential
through their managerial and investment participation, and can also increase the value
of Government’s residual shareholding. We will make efforts to balance the objectives
of sale proceeds while adequately addressing labor market issues and social
implications.

72



DISCOs. We appointed financial advisors for share sales of Faisalabad Electric
Supply Company (FESCO) in July 2014. We will complete the bidding process by
end-June 2016 (SB) leading to finalization of the transaction by end- September
2016. For Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) and Lahore Electric Supply
Company (LESCO), we have hired financial advisors. Notwithstanding a delay
with determination of the multi-year tariffs for these companies, we expect to
approve the transaction structure for these companies in December 2015 for
expected completion of the bidding process by end- June 2016 and finalization
of the transactions by end-September 2016. We hired financial advisors for
Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO) in April 2015; and for Hyderabad,
Peshawar, Quetta, Sukkur, and Multan Electric Supply Companies (HESCO,
PESCO, QESCO, SEPCO, and MEPCO) in May 2015. We expect finalization of
these transactions in 2016 and 2017.



Other companies. We are in the process of resolving the legal challenge to the
cancelled sale of Heavy Electrical Complex (HEC) in May 2015 owing to the
winning bidder’s inability to provide the funds to close the transaction. We have
completed the sale of National Power Construction Co. (NPCC) in September
2015. We appointed financial advisors for Northern Power Generation Company
Limited (NPGCL) in July 2014 and expect completion of the bidding process by
end-September 2016 with finalization of the transaction by end-December 2016.
We have appointed financial advisors for Jamshoro Power Generation Company
Limited (JPCL) in April 2015 with completion of the bidding process expected by
end-September 2016 and finalization of the transaction by end-December 2016.
In May 2015, we have finalized the hiring of financial advisors for Lakhra Power
Generation Company Limited (LPGCL), and Central Power Generation Company
Limited (CPGCL), with completion of the bidding process expected by endSeptember 2016 and finalization of the transaction by end-December 2016. In
July 2015, we have hired the financial advisor for Kot Addu Power Company
(KAPCO) and, despite a delayed start, initiated the due diligence process with
expected completion of the bidding process for the sale of the government's
equity by end-June 2016 and finalization of the transaction by end-September
2016. Plans are being developed for the remaining companies on the list.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

 Restructuring. We have developed restructuring plans for Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) and
Pakistan Railways (PR), and our financial advisors are finalizing a plan for Pakistan
International Airlines (PIA). Specifically,


Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). We have appointed financial advisors in
July 2014 to seek potential options for restructuring and strategic private sector
participation in the core airline business. However, the due diligence process,
completed in August 2015, showed that resolution of legal challenges is needed
before moving forward. For this purpose, the government has amended the PIA
Act through a Presidential Ordinance while initiating in parallel the process of
seeking parliamentary approval. This will pave way for soliciting expressions of
interest (EOIs) for strategic private sector participation by end-December 2015
(SB).



Pakistan Steel Mills. We have approved a comprehensive restructuring plan to
prepare for potential strategic private sector participation in the company.
However, due to gas supply difficulties, operational efficiency remains well below
the breakeven threshold. We hired financial advisors in April 2015 and
completed the due diligence process in August 2015. However, the privatization
process has been put on hold by the government’s decision in October 2015 to
offer the provincial government hosting the PSM to acquire the company. We
hope to receive the final response to the offer from the provincial government
by end-December 2015. Should the provincial government decline the
government’s offer, the privatization process will resume with approval of the
PSM transaction structure in January 2016 with the view to complete the bidding
process by end-June 2016, and finalize the transaction by end-September 2016.



Pakistan Railways. Aging and shortage of equipment, overstaffing, and large
debts continue to weigh on railway operations. Nevertheless, through
rationalization of tariffs and expenditures and improved occupancy rates, we
improved revenue in FY 2013/14 and FY 2014/15 by 32 and 45 percent,
respectively. The trend continued with an increase of around 20 percent in the
first quarter of FY 2015/16. Since April 2014, we have been moving forward with
our comprehensive restructuring plan, which includes improvements in business
processes and the institutional framework, financial stability, and service delivery.
Appointment of the Railway Board was completed in February 2015. In the shortterm, we are focusing on improvements in freight transportation through
creation of a freight company, and adding more locomotives and wagons. In
FY2014/15, we have added 35 new locomotives for both passenger and freight
service, and more than doubled revenues from freight operations.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
December 3, 2015
This memorandum sets out the understanding between the Pakistani authorities and the IMF staff
regarding the definitions of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as
respective reporting requirements used to monitor developments, for the program under the Extended
Arrangement. To this effect, the authorities will provide the necessary data to the IMF as soon as it
becomes available. The definitions used in this TMU will be adjusted to reflect any changes in
accounting classifications introduced during the program period. For the purposes of monitoring under
the program, all assets and liabilities as well as debt contracted, denominated in SDRs or in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, will be converted into U.S. dollars at the program exchange rates. Net
external budget financing and external cash grants will be converted into Pakistani rupees at the
program exchange rate. The program exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee to the U.S. dollar is set at
99.66 rupee per one U.S. dollar. The corresponding cross exchange rates for other foreign currencies
are provided in Table 1.

A. Quantitative Targets
The program sets performance criteria and indicative targets for defined test dates (Table 1 in
the LOI). The program sets the following performance criteria:

Performance criteria


Floor on the net international reserves (NIR) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) (millions
of U.S. dollars);



Ceiling on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the SBP (stock, billions of Pakistani rupees);



Ceiling on the general government budget deficit excluding grants (cumulative flows, billions
of rupees);



Ceiling on net government budgetary borrowing from the SBP (including provincial
governments) (stock, billions of rupees);



Ceiling on SBP’s stock of net foreign currency swap/forward contracts (millions of U.S. dollars);

Continuous performance criteria


Ceiling on the accumulation of external payment arrears by the general government;

Indicative targets


Floor on targeted cash transfers spending (BISP) (cumulative, billions of Pakistani rupees)



Floor on net tax revenues collected by the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) (cumulative, billions
of Pakistani rupees)

B. Definitions of Monitoring Variables
1.
The general government is defined as the central (federal) government and local
(provincial) governments, excluding state-owned enterprises. The definition of the general
government includes any new funds, or other special budgetary or extra-budgetary entities that may

PAKISTAN

6.
Aggregate net position in the foreign exchange derivatives is defined as the aggregate
net positions in forward and futures in foreign currencies of the SBP vis-à-vis the domestic currency
(including the forward leg of currency swaps). The SBP’s aggregate position was –US$1.7 billion at
end-June 2015.
7.
Reserve money (RM) is defined as the sum of: currency outside schedule banks (deposit)
money banks); schedule banks’ domestic cash in vaults; schedule banks’ required and excess rupee
and foreign exchange deposits with the SBP; and deposits of the rest of the economy with the SBP,
excluding those held by the federal and provincial governments and the SBP staff retirement
accounts.
8.
Net domestic assets of the SBP are defined as RM minus NIR, minus other assets not
included in gross official international reserves, minus commercial bank required and excess reserves
at the SBP in foreign currency, plus medium and long-term liabilities (i.e., liabilities with a maturity
of one year or more) of the SBP, plus other foreign liabilities not included in official reserve liabilities,

9.
Net government budgetary borrowing from the SBP (including provincial
governments) is defined as SBP claims on the government minus government deposits with the
SBP. SBP claims on the government include government securities, treasury bills, treasury currency,
and debtor balances. SBP claims on the government exclude accrued profits on government
securities. Government deposits with the SBP exclude the Zakat Fund (Table 4).

guaranteed, including unpaid penalties or interest charges associated with these obligations that are
beyond 30 days after the due date. The definition of debt, for the purposes of the EFF, is set out in

C. Adjustors
25.
The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative excess (shortfall)
of cash inflows from multilateral and bilateral creditors, Coalition Support Fund (CSF), and bond
issuance relative to projected inflows (Table 2). Cumulative cash inflows are defined as external
disbursements (including grants) from official multilateral creditors (including, but not limited to
Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, and World Bank), official bilateral creditors
(including, but not limited to DFID, UK, USAID), external bond placements and other commercial
borrowing that are usable for the financing of the central government budget. The adjustor is
modified for the end-June 2014 calculation of the fourth review to exclude the proceeds of the
US$2 billion Eurobond transaction and for the end-December 2015 and end-March 2016
calculations to exclude US$500 million of external long-term market financing that is expected to
happen in each Q2 and Q3 of FY2015/16. This modification does not apply to subsequent reviews.
26.
The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative amount of
any excess (shortfall) of budget support loans or budget support grants compared to the program
amounts (Table 3) and Euro bond issuance or project grants compared to projected inflows
(Table 2). Budget support grants to the public sector are defined as grants received by the
government (including provincial governments) for direct budget support from external donors
and not related to the projected financing. Budget support loans to the public sector are defined
as disbursements of loans from bilateral and multilateral donors for budget support (including
provincial governments).
27.
The ceiling on the consolidated overall budget deficit (excluding grants) for FY2014/15
will be adjusted upward for the cumulative excess in net external program financing in rupee terms
for up to PRs 15 billion at end-September, PRs 25 billion at end-December, PRs 42 billion at endMarch, and PRs 50 billion at end-June. The ceiling for FY2014/15 will be adjusted downward for any
shortfall in federal development spending below PRs 25 billion at end-September, PRs 80 billion at
end-December, PRs 243 billion at end-March and PRs 410 at end-June. The ceiling for FY2015/16
will be adjusted downward for any shortfall in federal development spending (excluding one-off
spending included in the below adjustor for security enhancements related to fighting terrorism and
resettlement of internally displaced persons) below PRs 35 billion at end-September, PRs 90 billion
at end-December, PRs 250 billion at end-March and PRs 450 at end-June. The ceiling will be
adjusted downward for any shortfall in the targeted cash transfers (BISP) and it will be adjusted
upward for over performance in the BISP up to PRS 12 billion in FY2014/15 and PRs 6 billion in
FY2015/16 from their indicative targets. In FY2015/16, the ceiling will be adjusted upward for oneoff spending of up to PRs 100 billion in total on security enhancements related to fighting terrorism
(budget code: ID 8262, demand no. 114, Development Expenditure of Finance Division) and
resettlement of internally displaced persons (budget code: ID 8261, demand no. 114, Development
Expenditure of Finance Division).

Current Status of Safeguards Assessment
An update safeguards assessment with respect to the current EFF was completed on December 16,
2013. The assessment concluded that legal amendments are needed to strengthen the central
bank’s autonomy and the effectiveness of governance arrangements. Further, some data reporting
issues, in particular the definitions and the composition of the program Net International Reserves,
required clarification to safeguard against inadvertent misreporting. Accountability mechanisms,
including the external audit were broadly effective, although the role and function of the audit
committee could be enhanced in certain areas. The authorities have implemented some
recommendations, but the latest amendments to the SBP Act only partially addressed the
assessment’s recommendations on the central bank’s autonomy. Previous assessments were
completed in February 2001, March 2009, and March 2010.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
On May 19, 1999, the dual exchange system was unified, with all international transactions
conducted at the interbank market exchange rate (FIBR). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is
classified as “other managed”. De Jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no
predetermined path. The SBP does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an
exchange rate target or path. The SBP intervenes in the foreign exchange market, but does not
publish information regarding its interventions. Pakistan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
sections 2, 3, and 4. Pakistan is maintaining an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

The last Article IV consultation (Country Report 13/110) was discussed by the Executive Board on
September 4, 2013.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of November 16, 2015)
1.
Pakistan is among the largest recipients of World Bank financial assistance. The World Bank
Group program in Pakistan consists of an integrated package of financial support, including IBRD
lending, concessional IDA credits, Trust Funds and Grants administered by the Bank on behalf of
other development partners, Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Balochistan, The Accelerated Growth and Reform (TAGR) from
DFID, IFC investments, and MIGA guarantees, along with complementary analytical and advisory
services. The Pakistan Portfolio (IDA, IBRD and MDTF) as of June 30, 2015, has 38 active projects.
2.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) outlines the Bank’s strategic approach to helping
Pakistan achieve its development goals over a five year period. The Bank Group’s Board of Directors
endorsed a Country Partnership Strategy for Pakistan on May 1 2014, covering fiscal years 2015
through 2019. The WBG’s Pakistan Country Partnership Strategy is anchored in the Government’s
framework of 4Es: Energy, Economy, Extremism and Education; and the initial priorities of the
incoming Vision 2025. Enough flexibility has also been built into the Strategy to allow for quick
reallocation of resources in case of unforeseen needs or emergencies.
3.
The four strategic pillars or result areas and cross-cutting theme of the Country Partnership
Strategy are:


Transforming the energy sector. Policy reforms and large investments in the power sector aim to
reduce load shedding, expand low-cost generation and supply, improve governance and cut
losses;



Supporting private sector development. WBG’s support is aimed at strengthening the business
environment, improving competitiveness and productivity of farms and businesses, and making
cities growth friendly to support productive and quality jobs;



Reaching out to the underserved, neglected, and poor. The strategy has a special focus on
targeted support for poorer districts and vulnerable groups e.g. women and youth; micro, small
and medium enterprises particularly in fragile and crises-affected provinces / regions; and
support for enhancing resilience and adaptation to the impact of climate change;



Accelerating improvements in public service delivery. WBG would support efforts for increasing
revenues both at the federal and provincial levels to fund public services and setting more
ambitious targets to create greater impact in critical areas especially education and health; and



Leveraging regional markets. As part of the four result areas, this cross-cutting theme focuses on
energy and trade, aimed at an integrated electricity market in South Asia with power
transmission links to Central Asia and India; and other opportunities to capture the potential of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

cross-border trade between Pakistan and its neighboring countries. Sustained economic
cooperation can help contribute to growth as well as overall stability in the region.
4.
IFC is supporting development of Pakistan’s private sector through an integrated investment
and advisory program. Its strategy is a direct response to the challenges facing the private sector in
the country, including energy shortages, infrastructure constraints and lack of access to finance,
which limit the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). IFC has been focusing on
mobilizing investments in infrastructure, energy (including renewable power), expanding access to
finance to MSMEs, and helping create jobs. IFC’s advisory services are particularly active in
enhancing access to finance for MSMEs, the capacity building of small businesses, improving
corporate governance, creating a better business environment, and promoting clean energy.
5.
Pakistan is also a focus country for MIGA, where it has already provided guarantees in
hydropower and microfinance. Going forward, MIGA’s strategy seeks to support investments into
IDA countries, South-South investments, complex infrastructure projects, and investments into
conflict-affected areas.
6.
Over the last few years, WBG has closely coordinated its development policy financing
support with the IMF Program in Pakistan. Recently completed series of operations on Fiscally
Sustainable and Inclusive Growth and Power Sector Reforms, supported critical structural reforms in
revenue mobilization, SOEs, private sector development and energy sector reforms to complement
the ongoing IMF program. Follow-on World Bank budget support is also planned.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 30, 2015)
Pakistan is a major recipient of financial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Since
1968, the ADB has provided more than $25 billion in assistance through the concessional Asian
Development Fund window and the Ordinary Capital Resources window.
The ADB’s Board of Directors endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering the years
2015-2019 in August 2015. In line with ADB’s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB will support
the government’s objective of higher, inclusive, and sustained growth to create productive
employment opportunities and reduce poverty. The thrust of ADB’s strategy in Pakistan will be to
improve connectivity, productivity, and access to markets and public services, focusing on
infrastructure development and institutional reforms. The broad thrust of this strategy is similar to
those in the previous CPS, reflecting the long-standing development constraints, the governments’
priorities to relieve them, and ADB’s accumulated experience. This CPS places greater emphasis on
(i) partnerships and cofinancing, particularly from commercial sources; (ii) disaster risk management;
and (iii) a more systematic approach to knowledge solutions.
The main areas of ADB operations in Pakistan include: (i) energy, focusing on sector reforms, energy
efficiency, power generation, transmission, distribution, and renewable energy development;
(ii) transport and logistics; (iii) irrigation and water resource management; (iv) urban services;
(v) public sector management including reforms in key sectors of ADB’s operations, development
of public-private partnerships, public sector enterprise reforms and social protection; and
(vi) finance, focusing on long-term sources of infrastructure finance and financial inclusion.
ADB’s program consists of a mix of policy-based lending, multi-tranche financing facilities, standalone projects, technical assistance (TA) loans, TA grants, project design facilities, knowledge
products and services, and policy dialogue. The policy-based lending targets specific areas of
priority reforms, within a programmatic framework in collaboration with development partners,
supplemented with TA for the design and implementation of these reforms. Multi-tranche financing
facilities contain significant components for analytical and capacity development assistance. TA
grants will finance these for stand-alone investment projects.
Pakistan’s active public sector portfolio amounts to $4.68 billion as of 30 September 2015. It
comprises 32 loans for 25 investment projects and 22 TA projects of $23.85 million. The figures
exclude ADB’s policy-based support, which is currently focused on energy sector reforms. The
support for energy sector reform program consists of five annual sub-programs, with the first subprogram (DPC-I) of $400 million approved and disbursed in 2014. The second sub-program, also of
(DPC-II) $400 million, has been signed on November 2015 and disbursement was made on endNovember. The energy sector comprises about 48 percent of ADB’s active public sector portfolio,
followed by transport (12 percent); irrigation and water resource management (15 percent); a multisector post-flood reconstruction project (15 percent); social protection (8.2 percent), and urban
services (2.8 percent).

PAKISTAN

ADB’s private sector operations in Pakistan began in 1983 and complement its public sector support.
As of August 2015, cumulative private sector approvals amounted to $1.15 billion. As of 30 June
2015, total outstanding balance of projects amounted to $584.1 million. Private sector operations
are focused on infrastructure and finance. The infrastructure support comprises renewable energy
development (hydro and wind), development of natural resources (e.g., thermal power capacity
based on captive domestic gas fields), reform support (financing of a privatized distribution electric
supply company) and energy security. Under the financial sector window, ADB provides guarantees,
equity investment, and trade finance. ADB's Trade Finance Program in Pakistan has worked with
ten banks on 2,996 trade transactions of over $9.4 billion, 53 percent of which was co-financed by
the private sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 18, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: In 2013, the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) completed rebasing and revising

of the national accounts statistics from fiscal year 1999/2000 to 2005/06 to bring them in line with
the concepts and definitions of the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The coverage of
transport, storage and communication sector has been expanded, methodology better captures the
measurement of value-added at basic prices (instead of factor cost), uses double deflation for some
industries, and applies Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM). The current
national accounts series goes back only to 2005/06 and the FBS was working to produce backward
linking of series to 1999–2000. FBS has also begun developing quarterly national accounts (QNA).
With respect to labor market statistics, the FBS has now compiled and started releasing quarterly
employment/ unemployment data, the first release being in February 2011 and included five years
of historical data and is investigating the feasibility of disseminating data on wages/salaries.
Price statistics: The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI), and

the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The SPI is
compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 53 essential commodities. The concepts and definitions
of the CPI attempt to follow international guidelines. There is a need to replace the WPI with a
producer price index (PPI). FBS introduced the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP) with the August 2011 index, along with updated weights and expanded item and
geographic coverage. TA is being provided to further improve the CPI methodology and to update
the weights again.
Government finance statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government finance

statistics are broadly based on the GFSM 1986, except that privatization proceeds are included
below the line. The scope of central government data is further limited because it does not cover the
activity of extra budgetary funds. Classification and sectorization in source data follow GFSM 1986
standards to a limited extent. The classification of expenditure deviates from GFSM 1986
methodology because the economic and functional classifications are mixed in reporting, in
particular, with defense and government administration expenditures not clearly identified
according to economic classification. The basis of recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash basis.
Transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily made in the
original period, as required by GFSM 1986. The authorities have indicated their intent to adopt the
methodology of GFSM 2001 over the medium term, and in line with the Board decision (No 14656
of October 2010) to strengthen fiscal analysis, they have compiled with staff assistance a fiscal table
in the GFSM 2001 presentation. However, further improvements in government finance statistics are
needed and the authorities are making progress toward that objective in the context of the Project

for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA). Budgetary central government
operations data are regularly reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, and use the GFSM 2001
framework. However, no data are reported on transactions in nonfinancial and financial assets and
liabilities. The authorities do not report higher frequency data for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics are broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial

Statistics Manual (MFSM) and the MFS Compilation Guide. The SBP has reported the Standardized
Report Forms for central bank (1SR), other depository corporations (2SR), and monetary aggregates
(5SR) to the Fund publication in the IFS. The SBP authorities and the Statistics Department are
working to expand the coverage for including the other financial corporations (OFCs) in the
monetary survey.
Pakistan reports all core Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for the deposit takers (DT) sector and
16 out 28 FSIs of the encouraged set for DT, non-financial corporations and real estate prices. These
FSIs (including the sectoral balance for DTs) are disseminated in the IMF’s FSI website.
Balance of payments: Starting from September 2013 SBP reports regularly quarterly balance of
payments (BoP) statistics in line with the Balance of Payments Manual sixth edition (BPM6). SBP is
regularly reporting the Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER), and is
participating to the Coordinated Direct Investment (CDIS) and the Coordinated Portfolio Investment
(CPIS) surveys. SBP should consider reporting external debt data to the joint World Bank/IMF
Quarterly External Debt Statistics Database (QEDS) and revising the reserves data template posted
on the SBP website to bring it in line with international guidelines,
International investment position: In October 2015 SBP started transmitting to the IMF BPM6
based annual and quarterly international investment position (IIP) data. Some issues of consistency
between BoP and IIP remain to be addressed.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Pakistan
and Shahid Mahmood, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
December 18, 2015
Our Pakistani authorities thank staff for their hard work and constructive discussions during
the Ninth Review under the Extended Arrangement and the Article IV Consultation, and
broadly concur with their assessment and policy recommendations.
Program Implementation
The economy has continued to perform well under the EFF-supported program, which is now
in its third and final year of implementation, with important gains achieved despite strong
headwinds. End-September 2015 performance criteria (PCs) on net international reserves,
government borrowing from the SBP, and foreign currency swap/forward position were met,
as were the indicative targets on social spending under the Benazir Income Support Program
(BISP) and on accumulation of power sector arrears. Two end-September PCs and one
indicative target were, however, missed, and the authorities have taken corrective measures
to stay the course to achieve the FY 2015/16 targets. The PC on net domestic assets (NDA)
was missed for a combination of reasons, including among others, unusual demand for
currency in circulation on the occasion of two Eid festivals, higher volume of cash
transactions following introduction of the new financial transactions tax for non-filers, and
currency injection in the interbank market to align money market rates with the lowered
policy rate, which led to sharp expansion in reserve and broad money. The corrective
measures taken by the authorities have brought NDA within the agreed bounds for
November 2015 as a prior action, and will ensure that the revised target for end-December is
met. Due to less-than-expected revenue collection, both the indicative target on tax revenue
and the PC on the general government deficit, excluding grants, were missed by a small
margin for the first quarter. The authorities are taking corrective measures to ensure that
FY 2015/16 revenue and deficit targets are met. They are requesting waivers for
nonobservance of performance criteria and modification of a performance criterion, as well
as completion of the ninth review.
Most structural benchmarks (SB) have been met, including in particular enactment of the
amendments to the SBP Act (prior action), enactment of the Credit Bureau Act, and setting
quarterly targets for power distribution companies (DISCOs). Modifications of existing SBs
and new ones are proposed, as detailed in the report.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The economic reforms initiated by the authorities at the start of the program have begun to
pay off, despite political, legal, and security challenges: near-term vulnerabilities have
receded, and the macroeconomic situation continues to improve. The economy has been
resilient, with growth projected to pick up from 4.2 percent in FY 2014/15 to 4.5 percent or
more in FY 2015/16, on the back of continued expansion in large scale manufacturing,
construction and the service sector. While inflation remains low, the recent downward trend

2
shows signs of bottoming out as headline inflation rebounded from 1.6 percent to 2.7 percent,
and is likely to average 3.7 percent for FY 2015/16. The budget deficit has been reduced
from 8.5 percent of GDP in FY 2012/13 to 5.4 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15 and continues
on a downward trajectory to reach 4.3 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16 as planned. The
external current account deficit which declined to 1 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15 is
projected to broadly stabilize at this level, with lower oil imports and higher workers’
remittances offsetting weaker export performance. While power shortages and security
challenges continued to adversely impact FDI inflows, spot purchases by the SBP helped
boost gross reserves to US$ 15.7 billion or the equivalent of over 4 months of imports on
December 14, 2015.
Fiscal Policy
Our authorities remain firmly committed to fiscal consolidation, including raising the tax-toGDP ratio to 14.5 percent in the medium-term from its current level of 11 percent, and
reducing the fiscal deficit to 3½ percent of GDP in FY 2016/17. This will help put the debtto-GDP ratio on a firm declining path. To offset the revenue shortfall, they took tax measures
equivalent to 0.15 percent of GDP, and stand ready to advance to FY 2015/16 the elimination
of tax concessions and exemptions planned for FY 2016/17, if needed to achieve program
fiscal targets. To remove distortions in the tax structure, the authorities have so far eliminated
concessions and exemptions equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP in two phases, in FY 2014/15
and FY 2015/16, and plan to continue to complete their program in this area in FY 2016/17
by another 0.3 percent of GDP. These efforts have resulted so far in average growth in FBR
collections by 15.3 percent between FY 2012/13 and FY 2014/15. In the first 5 months of the
current fiscal year, revenues have grown by 16.8 percent y-o-y.
Cognizant that lasting improvement in the tax-to-GDP ratio still requires greater efforts, the
authorities are taking a number of reform measures, including broadening the tax base,
carrying out risk-based audits, introducing differential taxation of filers and non-filers to
reward compliance and penalize noncompliance, expanding the database by integrating the
National Tax Number (NTN) with the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC),
legislating on benami transactions to improve transparency of property transactions, and
reengineering and automating business processes and procedures in tax administration. A TA
mission has recently discussed with the authorities the possibility of single-stage GST and
other tax policy options. Moreover, efforts are under way to weed out corruption, including
the strengthening of the Integrity Management Unit, ratification of whistle blower law for tax
crimes and, beginning April 2016, public reporting of corrupt practices in tax administration.
Fiscal consolidation and improved debt management remain central to keeping the debt-toGDP ratio on a firm downward trajectory. Debt dynamics have improved in the past few
years, with reduced refinancing risk of the domestic debt through improvement in the
maturity profile and lower exposure to interest rate risk. The Debt Policy Coordination Office
(DPCO), which has been further strengthened by the appointment of risk management staff,
has updated the Medium-Term Debt Strategy for the period FY 2015/16- FY 2018/19, which
will be published by end-January 2016. A TA mission on the strengthening of the Fiscal

3
Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (FRDLA) has recently been conducted. The mission
also discussed with the authorities ways to promote intergovernmental policy coordination
and develop the Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary and exchange rate policies remain focused on price stability and boosting foreign
exchange reserves. Maintaining an accommodative monetary policy, the SBP lowered the
policy rate by 50 bps in September 2015. To anchor low inflation expectations and meet the
program monetary targets, the SBP will continue to set the policy rate in a forward-looking
fashion to maintain positive real interest rates, in line with the improved interest rate corridor.
SBP is also enhancing its analytical capacities to move towards inflation targeting in the
medium term. Amendments to SBP Act were enacted by the parliament to strengthen its
independence and give legal force to the independent decision-making MPC.
While noting the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate over the past two years, the
authorities maintain that the rupee has been stable vis-à-vis the US dollar, and that the
exchange rate is market-determined. They also believe that export competitiveness may have
been hampered more by structural factors, such as energy shortages, and security issues, than
by the exchange rate.
Financial Sector
The banking sector remains sound, profitable, and highly solvent, with capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) rising to 18.2 percent in Q1 of FY 2015/16 against the statutory requirement of
10 percent. NPLs remain stable over the same period at 12.5 percent and are wellprovisioned. Out of 35 banks, only one remains CAR and MCR (minimum capital
requirement) non-compliant, but due to close SBP monitoring, the bank is likely to meet the
statutory requirement by end-December 2015. The SBP is also following up with three other
smaller banks to comply with the MCR within the time-bound plan by June 2016.
The authorities remain committed to preserving financial stability and are working on a
number of laws and regulations to reinforce the regulatory and supervisory framework (¶ 26
and 28, MEFP). Parliament enacted the AML/CFT law after amendments by the Senate. To
increase the scope of the law, the authorities will introduce new amendments by
January 2016. They are also working on enhancing the analytical capabilities of the Financial
Monitoring Unit to strengthen effective implementation of the relevant UNSC Resolutions.
Structural Reforms
The authorities have made structural reforms a cornerstone of their ambitious economic
reform agenda, which is designed to unleash growth potential and foster macroeconomic
stability. The main focus is on the energy sector, restructuring and privatization of public
enterprises, tax administration, and monetary and financial sectors. While a large number of
administrative measures are being taken in these endeavors, many reforms which require
legislative backup are at various stages of completion despite challenges. The authorities

4
have completed four capital market privatization transactions and one sale of strategic asset
since the start of the program (Table on page 18 of the Staff Report). The next 10
privatization operations, which are more difficult, as they require complex restructuring or
legislative approvals, remain a priority for the authorities. Six of these privatization
operations are in the power sector where crucial reforms have started taking roots and are
reflected in reduced outages, declining line losses, and stepped up bill collection leading to
reduction in accumulation of arrears and better handling of the circular debt. Rationalization
and better targeting are expected to bring down power sector subsidies from 1.4 percent of
GDP in FY 2012/13 to 0.3 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16 as planned. To keep the
momentum and consolidate gains, the authorities are also following an ambitious but realistic
investment plan in the power sector to stay ahead of the demand curve with medium- and
long-term needs in focus.
The authorities are aware of the importance of improving the business climate to foster
competitiveness and attract foreign and domestic private investment. In addition to the key
reforms underway to strengthen the performance of the energy sector, enhance the delivery
of public services, including transportation, improve access to financing for SMEs, and foster
good governance, the authorities are developing a time-bound plan to tackle other
bottlenecks, in cooperation with the World Bank, and will share it with Fund staff by endFebruary 2016 (SB).
Selected Issues
My authorities thank staff for well-researched presentations on the topics covered in the
Selected Issues paper. While they agree with the diagnosis and the analytical work in the
Chapter on Unlocking Pakistan’s revenue potential, they feel that though the paper does
convey the fact that the authorities recognize the shortcomings in this area, it does not fully
convey that tax concessions and exemptions are being phased out in consultation with the
Fund.
On the Macroeconomic gains from raising female labor force participation in Pakistan, the
authorities recognize the importance of this issue as well as its cultural underpinnings. As the
paper notes, the setting of quotas for women in the parliament has led to higher
representation, exceeding the world average. In the local bodies, their representation has been
raised to one-third. Women have also been assigned minimum quota of 10 percent at all
levels of intake in government jobs, including mid-to-senior level managerial positions.
The BISP is another important initiative to mainstream women from the marginalized
sections of the society. Beneficiary households are selected through a rigorous procedure
applying a poverty scorecard methodology for a quarterly stipend issued to the woman of the
house. At present 5.14 million households are recipient of this stipend. This number is
expected to increase to 5.3 million by the end of FY 2015/16. Connected with this program is
an education-conditional cash transfer program for students. Of the present beneficiaries,

5
48 percent are girls. Authorities are also reintroducing gender-disaggregated budget analysis
and preparing a plan for gender-responsive budgeting.
Conclusion
Our Pakistani authorities feel that reaching this point in the program has been challenging,
but rewarding in light of the achieved macroeconomic stability from a state of near-crisis,
and the large repertoire of reforms that have yet to bear fruit, including those planned for the
coming months. Still, they are mindful that much more needs to be done to entrench
macroeconomic stability and put the economy on a path of stronger and more inclusive
growth. They are grateful for the guidance and support of management and the Executive
Board.
