STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 1, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: After a timid recovery, the economy went into recession in 2011 and is
suffering from the negative feedback loops of weak activity, corporate overindebtedness, and bank strains and deleveraging amidst challenging external
conditions. After a strong fiscal effort, the headline deficit is set to decline to 3½ percent
of GDP in 2012 from 4.3 percent in 2011 (cash-based, net of capital injections). Public
debt, at 47 percent of GDP in end-2011, is still increasing while significant fiscal risks
stem from the financial sector. Slovenia is lagging on many structural indicators but the
government recently announced an ambitious plan, including an asset management
company to deal with bad bank loans, pension and labor market reforms, and
privatizations.
Challenges: (1) restructure and recapitalize banks to ensure financial stability and
reinvigorate growth; (2) continue fiscal consolidation; (3) implement ambitious pension
and labor market reforms and privatization.
Staff views: Bank restructuring, recapitalization, and privatization are needed to break
the vicious spiral of deleveraging and economic contraction. With banks under pressure
and the corporate sector highly leveraged it has become critical to attract fresh external
equity capital. The announced front-loaded, expenditure-based fiscal consolidation to
balance the structural budget by 2015 (net of bank restructuring cost) is appropriate.
Pension and labor market reforms remain a priority. Labor market segmentation hinders
competitiveness.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed that with the assessment and the
recommendations. While the government has set the general goals, the authorities are
still finalizing the details of the bank asset management company, the pension and labor
market reforms, and privatization. They also emphasized the need to build public
consensus on pension and labor market reforms.

Box 1. Slovenia’s High Corporate Debt and Falling Investment
A key challenge facing Slovenia is the high level of nonfinancial corporate debt, especially relative to equity.
Unlike in some other euro area countries, the pre-crisis boom in Slovenia was not primarily fueled by
household debt. Instead, it was fuelled by rapid accumulation of corporate debt with domestic banks rapidly
increasing leverage. This debt financing in place of equity financing has been a major drag on economic
growth as financial conditions deteriorated and has contributed to one of the largest declines in private
nonresidential investment in the euro area. Resolving corporate debt and attracting more equity finance
(including FDI) will be critical to restore the corporate sector as the engine of economic growth.
During the boom, non-financial corporatations in

risen to around 500 basis points in the
summer of 2012 but has declined since. In mid-October, the sovereign issued a US$ 2.25 billion
10-year bond with a yield of 5.7 percent. The bond, which was Slovenia's first denominated in
dollars since 1996, marks a return of the sovereign to long-term capital markets after 18 months.

5.
Bank asset quality deteriorated and the externally-funded lending model remains
under pressure. Foreign banks have reduced their net exposure to the Slovenian banks by about
$9.6 billion (about 21 percent of estimated 2012 GDP) since the beginning of the crisis. Faced
with pressures on funding and asset quality, local banks are restraining credit to the economy.
Credit to the non-financial corporate sector declined by 4½ percent year-on-year in the first
eight months of 2012. Firms, facing subdued demand conditions and difficulty in accessing fresh
credit, are increasingly failing to meet their financial obligations. Non-performing loans (NPLs)
have reached 13.2 percent of total classified claims (mostly loans) in June 2012, with NPLs of
non-bank corporates hovering around 20 percent and those of households around 4.5 percent.
Home mortgages do not entail a major risk for the banking system at this stage, representing
about one fourth of all lending and with an NPL ratio around 3 percent. In the corporate sector,
NPLs have grown the most in the construction sector (mostly infrastructure) and in the financial
holding companies which were used to privatize through leveraged buy-outs, the sum of which
accounted for about 21 percent of total loans in December 2011. Within the banking system, the
NPLs ratio is worse in large domestic banks (24 percent in comparison to 9 percent in foreign
owned banks).
6.
With a headline fiscal deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP (including capital injections),
the debt-to-GDP ratio reached 47 percent at end-2011. From a moderate pre-crisis surplus,
the budget balance deteriorated sharply and the deficit has hovered around 5½ percent of GDP
(in cash terms) since 2009, with pre-crisis debt more than doubling. The structural balance
decreased from around 5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011.
7.
The new center-right coalition government has accelerated fiscal consolidation and
has begun an ambitious reform program. The intensification of the crisis has highlighted the
need for reform. Social dialogue on pension and labor market reforms is ongoing. Privatization,
especially of the state-owned banks, and reduction in public employment, a keystone in the
government’s fiscal consolidation, are very controversial.

Policy discussions focused on the growth outlook, bank restructuring, fiscal
consolidation, pension and labor market reforms, and competitiveness. The authorities
adopted only some of the measures recommended in the 2011 Article IV mission (see table
below.) They agreed that the failure to implement pension and labor market reforms and the
delays in restructuring the financial sector had been key factors behind market jitters.

B. Outlook: A Double-Dip Recession
9.
The growth outlook is difficult and risks are on the downside (see Risk Assessment
Matrix). With stringent financial and economic conditions continuing in the euro area,
deleveraging, and fiscal consolidation, staff expects the economy to contract by 2¼ percent
in 2012 with growth resuming in the second half of 2013 led by the projected euro area recovery.
An intensification of the euro area crisis could further restrict access to external finance; banks’
funding and capital strains may lead to an extended balance-sheet recession and to a further
weakening of the economy, and contingent liabilities could lead to rapid increases in public debt.
Slippages in the implementation of structural reforms could undermine confidence and recovery.
Aggressive deleveraging in Slovenian banks could result in negative spillovers for countries in the
region, including Kosovo, Macedonia, and Montenegro. In the medium-term, resuming the precrisis growth seems unfeasible in light of the adverse demographic dynamics, the closing income
gap with the rest of the EU, and the declining investment (see Box 2).
10.
The authorities agreed broadly with staff’s outlook and the assessment of risks.
There was consensus that economic activity faced strong headwinds from bank deleveraging,
corporate indebtedness, difficulty of accessing external finance, and the needed fiscal
consolidation.

Box 2. Growth Performance
Slovenia’s pre-crisis growth performance was
strong. Real GDP growth averaged 4 percent
in 1997-2005, and accelerated to 5½ percent
in 2006-08, showing a strong convergence to
the EU average given Slovenia’s high initial
income. Throughout this period, growth was
supported by a relatively high investment rate
and to a somewhat lesser extent by productivity
growth.

underpinned by increased access to external
finance, and a credit and investment boom that
were supported by the accommodative global financial conditions as well as Slovenia’s EU entry in 2004 and
euro accession in 2007. The fixed investment rate increased from 24.7 percent in 1997-2005 to 27.6 percent
in 2006-08, but this increase was explained entirely by the increase in non-tradable investment, of which half
was due to the increase in real estate and construction activities.

Pre-crisis growth rates appear to be
unfeasible going forward. A low population
growth rate and a high reliance on relatively
stagnant European markets suggest that
Slovenia’s long-term growth rate is unlikely to
go up to the pre-crisis range. Staff’s baseline
growth forecast for the medium-term is 2
½ percent given the debt overhang in the
corporate sector and the financial sector.
Looking further ahead, using World Economic
Outlook’s global projections and assuming the
pace of convergence matches the 1995-2011
average, Slovenia’s long-term growth can reach
3 percent, assuming that structural bottlenecks
are addressed.

C. Financial Sector: Dealing with NPLs and Improving Bank Governance
11.
The performance of Slovenian banks deteriorated markedly in recent years as a
result of the unfavorable operating environment and weak governance. Bank asset quality
worsened substantially since 2007, with a heavy concentration in the large publicly-owned banks.
Of particular concern are loans to the over-indebted corporate sector, which is facing sluggish
domestic and external demand. The largest firms, especially in the construction sector (mostly
infrastructure), have been the worst hit. The increase in NPLs resulted in substantial impairment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

charges, leading to system-wide bank losses in the last two years and repeated downgrades of
bank ratings with the largest publicly-owned banks losing investment grade.
12.
Although capital adequacy improved in 2011, many banks will need further capital
increases. The aggregate total capital adequacy ratio stood at 12 percent as of December 2011,
up from 11.3 percent in 2010, mainly due to capital injections in six banks for €458 million and
deleveraging. However, banks’ continuing losses are eroding their capital. To meet EBA
requirements, the largest publicly-owned bank Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB), was recapitalized
again by €383 million in June 2012, and further recapitalization of this and some other banks
may be needed after the planned restructuring. While the recent capital injection included
€320 million through a contingent convertible bond, the ECB has noted that it generally prefers
issuances of shares against cash contributions for financial stability reasons. The authorities have
taken note of this preference and plan to act accordingly.
13.
Despite some deleveraging, banks are still heavily dependent on wholesale funding
from abroad, and increasingly on the ECB. Although banks have lost access to external
commercial funding since 2009, the loan-to-deposit ratio remains high at 137 percent at endMarch 2012. Banks have replaced

liquidity position is still comfortable.
However, further downgrades of the sovereign could reduce the pool of eligible assets and
domestic deposits may decline in relation to GDP.
14.
The authorities are moving to strengthen the financial sector broadly in line with
FSAP recommendations. The FSAP noted that the risks to systemic financial stability stemmed
mainly from the negative macroeconomic outlook and the high dependence of banks on
external funding. With real estate being a major form of collateral, the real estate price risk is of
particular concern.

Box 3. Key Recommendations of the FSAP
The recently conducted FSAP highlighted the need to address important structural challenges, in
particular to reform state-controlled banks that have been performing consistently weaker than any other
group of banks in the last few years. Deepening the commercial orientation of state-controlled banks
would require tackling the long-standing weaknesses in the governance and risk management practices
of these banks, which were put into the spotlight by the crisis.
The FSAP also highlighted the need to clean up bank balance sheets and ensure adequate bank
capitalization. The incurred losses should be fully recognized so that greater attention of bank
management can then be devoted to new sources of income rather than resolving legacy problems. The
establishment of an asset management company can enhance the bank capital and liquidity position and
also trigger economies of scale in managing bad debt. However, such an entity needs to be carefully
designed in order to avoid creating incentives for further rounds of similar bank cleansing; the
determination of the type of assets considered and their transfer price are complex decisions.
The FSAP found the regulatory and supervisory frameworks broadly in line with international standards,
though some specific weaknesses exist. It was noted that the supervision of financial institutions should
be complemented with macroprudential oversight. Some elements of the crisis preparedness and
management framework need significant strengthening, including the Bank of Slovenia’s powers to deal
with failing banks, the role of the deposit guarantee scheme, and the arrangements for official liquidity
and solvency support.

15.
The authorities announced a comprehensive plan to address financial sector
vulnerabilities. The authorities have moved to obtain an external assessment of the size and
distribution of bank losses, to create an asset management company, and to define a strategy for
capitalizing and restructuring troubled banks and non-financial corporates.


Diagnostic process. According to the standard definition used by the Bank of Slovenia (i.e.
assets with more than 90 days arrears) total NPLs were € 6.3 billion as of June 2012 (13.2
percent of classified claims). Based also on due diligence exercises (already completed for
NLB and to be completed by the end of the year for Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor and
Abanka), the government intends to transfer up to €3 billion of assets from the banks to the
new asset management company (see below), comprising both non-performing and highrisk ones.



Bank Asset Management Company (BAMC). In October, the parliament voted the law on
financial stability creating the BAMC as a public agency, which is subject to oversight by the
supreme audit institution and the parliament. The new agency should be operational by the
end-2012 or early-2013. The BAMC can issue a maximum €4 billion of governmentguaranteed bonds (about 11 percent of GDP). The acquisition price for impaired assets will
be the “real long-term value,” following the EC State Aide guidelines. The BAMC will have the
instruments and the power to seek a quick resolution of the impaired assets, be it by
restructuring the corporate or by liquidating it and selling its collateral and assets.
Bankruptcy procedures where the BAMC is involved are to be concluded within six months.
The BAMC is to be wound down after five years, at which point the remaining assets will be

11

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

transferred to the Slovenia Sovereign Holding (SSH) company. One of the main purposes of
the law establishing BAMC is to privatize the banks once they have been cleaned up and
recapitalized. While public debt will increase when the BAMC’s bonds are issued, this debt
should be partially repaid with the proceeds from the liquidation of assets, including the
privatization of the banks and other corporations that end up in the BAMC’s portfolio.


Bank capitalization and restructuring. Banks needing recapitalization after selling their
impaired assets to the BAMC will have to prepare a restructuring plan, which will be
submitted to the EC within six months of receiving recapitalization. The government
estimates that banks may need to be recapitalized for up to € 1 billion (2¾ percent of GDP)
to cover the losses due to the difference between the book value of the transferred assets
net of provisions and the actual price paid by the BAMC as well as future losses deriving from
the possible worsening of the bank assets in the future.



The SSH. Also in October, the parliament passed a law to create the SSH to unify the
management of all publicly owned corporations, clean up their finances, and define a
strategy that includes the target stakes in different types of corporations and sectors,
including full and partial privatizations. Addressing the financial weakness of the corporate
sector is a necessary complement to the restructuring of the banks.

16.
Yet the implementation of the plan as well as some of the FSAP recommendations
will need the authorities’ strong effort. The steps taken thus far are substantial, but are just
the initial ones.


Bank recapitalization and restructuring. The authorities and staff agreed that the BAMC
should be independent and free of political pressures, appropriately funded, able to hire the
best talent, fully accountable for its actions, transparent, and subject to external professional
auditing. Staff noted that bringing banks back to a healthy state requires addressing the
corporate sector debt overhang, possibly through debt to equity swaps. They should move at
once to transfer the impaired assets out of the troubled banks and to subsequently
recapitalize those banks. To determine capitalization needs in addition to those arising from
the below-book value asset transfers to the BAMC, staff recommended thorough stress tests
on the banks’ remaining assets. Staff welcomed the clear and short deadlines set in the law
for the acquisition of the assets and their subsequent sale, as well at the provisions to
reinforce the transparency of its governance. Staff also encouraged the authorities to engage
at least one international expert in the board of the BAMC to ensure its effectiveness and the
adoption of solid international practices.



Bank privatization and governance. Staff also encouraged the authorities to move quickly
to privatize banks to bring about the needed change in their governance and commercial
cultures. The changes in the management of the two largest banks may not be enough to
end the public sector’s interference with the commercial orientation of banks. The authorities
agreed that privatization is important but noted that reducing public ownership to below the
blocking minority share of 25 percent requires broader political support.



Crisis preparedness. Staff recommended a prompt discussion and adoption of the draft
Banking and Recovery and Resolution Acts, which enhance the powers and resources of the
Bank of Slovenia to deal effectively with financial sector crises. These drafts provide adequate
legal protection of bank supervisors in civil and criminal court proceedings, and empower the
Bank of Slovenia to define the requirements for major acquisitions by banks, subjecting them
to its approval. In addition, staff recommended periodic stress tests to monitor the quality of
bank assets as well as capital adequacy as economic conditions continue to be challenging.

D. Fiscal Policy: Implementing Structural Fiscal Consolidation and
Reforming Pensions
17.
The fiscal deficit is falling. The headline deficit is set to drop to around 3½ percent of
GDP in 2012 from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2011 (excluding capital injections to publicly-owned
banks and corporations). This is slightly higher than planned in the May 2012 supplementary
budget, mainly due to weaker revenue. The 2013 headline deficit target is 2.8 percent of GDP in
spite of weaker-than-expected economic
activity.

19.
The authorities target a
structurally-balanced budget by 2015, with adjustment heavily frontloaded in 2012
and 2013. In these two years, the cumulative structural adjustment would be around
3 percentage points of GDP. Consolidation measures in 2012 were based on a wide range of
expenditure cuts. Part of these measures will also have an impact in the following years (see box
4). Additional consolidation measures in the planned 2013 budget concentrate on a reduction in
public employment. Expenditure reductions are partly counteracted by gradual corporate income
tax cuts and offset by a planned increase in the use of EU funds.

Box 4. The Public Finance Balance Act
The Slovenian Public Finance Balance Act passed in May 2012 will reduce public wages and social
benefits. In addition, the accompanying budget amendment includes discretionary cuts to the purchase
of goods and services, subsidies and capital expenditure in 2012 by roughly 1 percent of GDP. In 2013,
further cuts in the public wage bill (not yet incorporated in the Public Finance Balance Act) are planned
to fall mostly on staffing.

21.
Barring still higher bank restructuring cost and other contingencies and shocks,
debt dynamics would still be manageable. The staff baseline includes conservatively the
aforementioned debt shock of 11 percent of GDP in 2013 (partly through an increase of the
primary deficit by 2.8 percent of GDP). Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak at
70 percent around 2016. Debt dynamics are less favorable, however, if further shocks occur,
especially if GDP growth turns out lower than expected (see figure 7).

However, aging costs loom large.
Slovenia has one of the most adverse pension
expenditure dynamics in the euro area. The 2012
Aging Report by the EC projects an increase in
pension spending of 6½ percentage points of
GDP between 2015 and 2055. The government
and social partners are negotiating a pension
reform, which appears to have better prospects
than the 2011 reform. However, the current
plans would rein in the long-term expenditure
increase only by about 1½ percentage points of
GDP, according to the authorities’ estimate.

Sources: European Commission; EPC; and IMF staff calculations.

23.
A new fiscal rule is under discussion. Motivated by pertinent stipulations at the EU
level, the government has introduced a proposal for a constitutional fiscal rule in parliament. The
rule would anchor a structurally-balanced budget after 2015. Important design details will still
need to be fleshed out, including the exact correction mechanism for deviations from targets
(“debt brake”).
24.
Staff and authorities concurred on the need to implement the medium-term
structural adjustment path. While modest slippages in the headline deficit are acceptable given
the overall economic situation, there was agreement that the medium-term target of a structural
balance by 2015 should be maintained in light of financial sector restructuring cost and an aging
population. Staff argued that this target should now be defined net of bank restructuring cost
(including higher interest payments). Bank restructuring costs should rather be offset more
gradually in economically stronger years. Staff commended the expenditure-based consolidation
approach but pointed out that additional measures would need to be identified after 2013 for
continued adjustment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Box 5. The Government’s Pension Reform Plan
Key elements of the reform plans are adjustments to the retirement age, the assessment base, wage
valorization, and pension indexation in the almost exclusively pay-as-you-go-based pension system:


The standard retirement age would increase to 65 for both men and women by 2019, with an exception
for long-time insured (40 years of work-related contributions), who could retire at 60, and an early
retirement option with a relatively low discount.



The assessment base is extended from 18 to 28 consecutive years with the highest earnings.



The valorization of wages for calculating pension payments will be less favorable.



The indexation of pensions will be based 60 percent on wages and 40 percent on inflation.

In addition, there are measures to foster the re-integration of disabled into work and strengthen the small
voluntary pension pillars.

25.
The quality of adjustment measures and fiscal governance should be strengthened.
Efforts to rein in negative incentive effects of the planned wage bill cuts are welcome and should
maintain sufficient wage differentiation for rewarding performance, while employment cuts
should be selective. The authorities’ intention to speed up EU fund absorption is laudable and
will help contain negative consolidation effects on public investment and growth. Staff also
recommended revisiting the planned reductions in the corporate income tax rate and generous
allowances for investment, and emphasized the importance of non-financial incentives for
domestic and foreign investment. However, the authorities pointed to existing political
commitments on the tax cuts. Staff and authorities concurred that any future privatization
revenues should be used for debt reduction. Finally, staff and authorities agreed that a
constitutional debt brake and a medium-term fiscal framework would help anchor fiscal
consolidation.
26.
The authorities agreed that the current pension reform is only a first step in the
right direction. The current pension reform adjusts several parameters of the pay-as-you-go
system, with a focus on increasing actual and statutory retirement ages. However, it will leave
Slovenia among the euro area countries with the highest pension expenditure as ratio of GDP,
thus putting planned medium-term consolidation achievements in jeopardy in the longer run.
The authorities concurred that a further reform will need to be initiated to ensure sustainability in
the long term. Important elements that could be considered are the introduction of automatic
adjustors, such as an automatic link of the retirement age and/or benefits to life expectancy,
actuarially fairer pension discounts for early retirement, and the introduction of a mandatory
second pillar.

E. Structural Issues: Regaining Competitiveness and Ensuring Equity
27.
Slovenia’s rebalancing requires relying on supply side policies, in particular in the
labor market. Against a background of weak domestic demand, Slovenia needs to shift
resources to the tradable sector and regain competitiveness. In parallel, significant restructuring
within sectors is necessary to boost productivity, given the corporate debt overhang. Wage
growth has moderated in 2011 to about 1½ percent. Going forward, a consensus by the social
partners on wage restraint would accelerate the adjustment and limit involuntary unemployment.
Minimum wages are high relative to the average wages, especially after the 23 percent hike
in 2010. Avoiding such discretionary increases and holding off the indexation mechanism, as
foreseen in the 2013 budget execution, could alleviate the problem going forward.
28.
Labor market duality should be addressed. Employment protection for workers with
permanent contracts is very high despite some recent improvements, which hinders the muchneeded allocation of labor between sectors and companies. Most of the burden thus falls on
unprotected workers, who are typically younger and female, leading to inefficient and unfair
segmentation in the labor market. The authorities agreed that labor market rigidity and
segmentation is a significant problem, and noted that the changes to labor market regulation
currently under discussion with social partners is intended to address this issue. While these
plans fall short of the single open-ended contract goal, staff views them as a step in the right
direction.
29.
With the banking system under pressure and the corporate sector highly leveraged,
it has become critical to attract external equity capital. Slovenia has a low stock of FDI by
regional standards. This is partly a result of a relatively unattractive business climate
characterized by rigid labor markets and a high administrative burden, but partly reflects a desire
to sustain national ownership of key industries. However, this preference has led to
interconnected holdings between public banks, holding companies, and large corporates, weak
governance, and low levels of capital relative to debt. Authorities and staff concurred that FDI
inflows can help mitigate these problems by injecting equity to existing firms and improving their
governance. Moreover, foreign capital is likely to bring about much needed technology transfers.
30.
Privatization is an important conduit to higher FDI inflows and improved corporate
governance. Staff argued that, to attract FDI, the authorities should level the playing field
between incumbents and new entrants. Privatization can also help reduce public debt and signal
openness to foreign investment. The authorities agreed on the signaling role of privatization, and
noted that the SSH will prepare a list of companies to be privatized. In addition, they highlighted
that the aim of bank restructuring is to pave the ground for privatizing the publicly-owned banks.

Box 6. Slovenia’s Competitiveness
Slovenia has been losing competitiveness in recent years. Slovenia’s market share of exports has
steadily declined since 2008, while those of its competitors have continued to improve. Some of this
poor performance is a result of the slowing demand in Slovenia’s largest export markets, but most
reflects deep-seated price and cost factors. Although Slovenia’s real effective exchange rate appears to
be broadly in line with equilibrium, some of Slovenia’s non-Euro peers have been able to take
advantage of exchange rate flexibility to maintain their competitiveness. Manufacturing wages also
remain high relative to regional peers. Going forward, high wages will continue to be a drag on
competitiveness now that the full effect of the 2010 increase in minimum wages by 23 percent has
taken hold and passed through to the entire wage structure. Recent depreciation of the euro may
provide a small boost to short-term competitiveness, but structural reforms, including in the labor
market, are needed to improve competitiveness in the long-term.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economy is now suffering from the negative feedback loops of recession, bank
deleveraging, and corporate distress against the background of pre-existing structural
weaknesses. Financial conditions have worsened. Amid stress in a number of countries in the
euro area, markets have been reevaluating Slovenia’s riskiness. The failure to address longexisting weaknesses in the financial sector, to implement pension and labor market reforms, and
political uncertainties have contributed to markets’ concerns. The recent sovereign long-term
bond issuance gives a key time window to address these feedback loops and long-standing
structural issues.
32.
Strong and prompt policy actions are necessary to address the structural
weaknesses. The government has announced an ambitious and comprehensive set of reforms,
which includes a plan to deal with NPLs, improve management of public assets, accelerate fiscal
consolidation, and implement pension and labor market reforms. Swift implementation of these
reforms is essential to resolve the current crisis and to realize the economy’s potential.
33.
The BAMC is an important first step to address the building-up of NPLs, but
implementation is of the essence. The Law to Strengthen the Stability of Banks will help to
address the financial distress faced by many large non-financial corporations. Clear and short
deadlines for the acquisition of the assets and their subsequent sale and BAMC’s transparency
are key for the BAMC’s effectiveness.
34.
Publicly-controlled banks and corporates should improve governance and be
ultimately privatized. Political interference should be removed from bank management. To this
end, the government should move decisively to privatize banks and corporations (critically to
below a blocking minority share, which would help attract strategic investors) in order to change
their governance and commercial culture. Improving bank governance will alleviate the banksovereign feedback loop.
35.
The regulatory framework should be strengthened further. The mission welcomes
the authorities’ efforts to address FSAP recommendations. In particular, the mission endorses the
authorities’ action plan to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and improve
macroprudential oversight and the crisis contingency arrangement. The mission also stresses the
importance of maintaining the current supervisory architecture in a period of financial
turbulence.
36.
The envisaged front-loaded, expenditure-based consolidation is necessary to
bolster market confidence. The structural adjustment in 2012 is already significant but further
consolidation is necessary in light of financial sector restructuring costs and an aging population.
Fiscal policy should focus on the structural balance rather than on headline targets. The goal of a
balanced budget in structural terms (net of bank restructuring cost) by 2015 is appropriate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

37.
Fiscal governance and the quality of adjustment should be strengthened. The
proposed cut in the wage bill is very ambitious and staff welcomes efforts to avoid excessive
wage compression, while employment cuts should be selective. A constitutional structural
balance rule with a debt brake, complemented by enhanced medium-term fiscal planning, would
anchor fiscal consolidation in the medium run.
38.
Pension reform is of the essence for long-term fiscal sustainability. Current reform
proposals focus on the retirement age and are a step in the right direction. However, they will
leave Slovenia still among the euro area countries with the highest pension expenditure, and a
more decisive reform will be necessary to ensure debt sustainability in the longer term.
39.
Labor market reform is necessary to reduce labor market dualism and to improve
competitiveness. Employment protection for workers with permanent contracts is still very high.
Unprotected workers are disproportionally young and female, leading to an inefficient and unfair
segmentation in the labor market.
40.
With the banks under pressure and the corporate sector highly leveraged, it has
become critical to attract external equity capital. A preference for national ownership is at the
core of weak governance, and low levels of capital relative to debt.

1/ Difference with numbers reported in staff report tables is due to differences in period average and end-of-period exchange rates.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes and reflects differences in period average and end-of-period exchange rates in the conversion to U.S. dollars.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

GDP in 2011, but not most of the NLB support operation in June 2012 (0.9 percent of GDP, contingent convertible bond).
2/ The primary deficit includes support for financial and non-financial enterprises of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2011.
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
6/ Guarantees are not included in the analysis.
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVENIA: RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX1
Nature/Source of
Main Risks

Overall Level of Concern
Relative Likelihood
(high, medium, or low)

Impact if Realized
(high, medium, or low)

1. Strong
intensification of
the euro area
crisis

Medium
 Market stress could intensify.
 Deleveraging and fiscal drag could affect the
outlook for the euro area, with potential knock
on effects on the financial sector.

High
 Direct effects through lower export
demand and inward financial spillovers,
indirect effects through deleveraging and
uncertainty.
 Funding pressures could create a
negative feedback loop, where spillovers
to bank funding and higher domestic
interest rates hurt growth, and weaken
the sovereign further.

2. Banking sector
funding risks and
recapitalization

High
 Banks’ market financing could be impaired
for an extended period, causing increased
dependence on ECB financing.
 Capital needs could be larger than expected.
 Real estate price decline could intensify and
corporate and mortgage NPLs further rise.

High
 Further ratings downgrades could
worsen liquidity situation of certain
banks, potentially requiring ELA.

3. Fiscal slippage
and public debt
build-up

High
 Implementation of fiscal adjustment plans
may falter amid recession.
 Debt could be further increased by
contingent liabilities.
 Higher-than-expected fiscal multipliers could
lead to a sharper downturn, making it more
difficult to stabilize the debt ratio.

High
 Although the debt level is currently
manageable, fiscal slippages and
contingent liabilities could delay market
reaccess.

4. Structural
reforms slippage

Medium
 Reform implementation may stall due to
politics or social opposition.
 The short-run effects of reform on growth
and employment may be less positive than
anticipated or medium-run effects may fail to
fully materialize.

Medium
 Insufficient reform may keep growth
low for a protracted period, undermining
fiscal consolidation.

5. Protracted
balance-sheet
recession

High
 High corporate sector debt may give rise to

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.

2.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet, which can be reached at:
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
3.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS) follows the
European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by industry and expenditure
categories are compiled in both current and constant prices, and are published within 80 days after the
reference quarter. In September 2005, the SORS changed the base year for compiling constant prices GDP
from 2000 to the previous year’s prices and started using the chain–link index methodology. The SORS also
compiles inflation statistics including the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). However, price
collection is restricted to four cities and their surrounding rural areas. The weights are based on the threeyear average of expenditure data for consumer goods from continuous Household Budget Surveys for
2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs from the consumer price index
in weights only.
4.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high quality. The
ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government Finance, which presents
monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary Central Government), local governments,
social security (Pension and Health funds), and the consolidated general government. The coverage of
general government excludes the operations of extra-budgetary funds and own revenues of general
government agencies (zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are
reported for publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government
operations, including the operations of the extra-budgetary funds are reported for publication in the
Government Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
5.
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and broadly
use the analytical framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986 government finance
statistics methodology. The data reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook are also on a cash basis but
are recast in the analytical framework and classifications of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics
2001(GFSM 2001).
6.
The Slovenian authorities adopted the GFSM 2001 methodology, which is used as a building
block for the compilation of the ESA 95–based data jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the SORS
for reporting to the European Commission. To assist the Ministry of Finance resolve several classification
issues and develop a migration path, a STA technical assistance mission visited Ljubljana in April 2006. The
introduction in 2008 of a new chart of accounts for all public entities based on accrual principles greatly
facilitated the adoption of the new methodology.

Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.

8.
Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of high quality.
The data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook since 1993 (with estimates of
the international investment position published since 1994).
9.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line with the SDDS in
August 2003. The main change comprised the inclusion of trade credits in the debt data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Slovenia
On November 21, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Slovenia.1
Background
With a loss of more than 8 percent of GDP, Slovenia experienced one of the largest economic
contractions since 2008 among euro area countries. The timid externally-driven recovery
observed in 2010 faded as export growth slowed, deleveraging picked up pace, and fiscal
consolidation started. The recession intensified in 2012, as euro area growth decelerated,
external financial conditions worsened, and private consumption growth turned negative.
Unemployment reached 8.4 percent in August 2012. Inflation has been kept in check by weak
demand and averaged below the euro area aggregate, more so in core indicators. The current
account reached broad balance in 2011 and a moderate surplus is expected for this year,
largely as a result of import compression. With stringent financial and economic conditions
continuing in the euro area, deleveraging, and fiscal consolidation, staff expects the economy to
contract by 2¼ percent in 2012 with growth resuming in the second half of 2013 led by the
projected euro area recovery.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The performance of Slovenian banks deteriorated markedly in recent years as a result of the
unfavorable operating environment. Bank asset quality worsened substantially since 2007,
especially in publicly-owned banks. Of particular concern are loans to the over-indebted
corporate sector. The increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) resulted in substantial
impairment charges, leading to system-wide bank losses in the last two years and repeated
downgrades of bank ratings. Although capital adequacy improved in 2011, many banks will
need further capital increases. The loan-to-deposit ratio remains high, and banks have replaced
lost external commercial funding with government deposits and ECB financing. Alongside an
external assessment of the size of bank losses, the government is creating an asset
management company to deal with NPLs and is elaborating a strategy to reform governance of
publicly-owned banks.
The headline deficit is set to drop to around 3½ percent of GDP in 2012 from 4.3 percent of
GDP in 2011 (excluding capital injections to publicly-owned banks and corporations), and the
2013 headline deficit target is 2.8 percent of GDP in spite of weaker-than-expected economic
activity. The authorities target a structurally-balanced budget by 2015, with adjustment
frontloaded in 2012 and 2013. Under the staff’s baseline scenario, which conservatively
assumes a debt increase of about 11 percent of GDP in connection with bank restructuring, the
debt-to-GDP ratio would peak around 70 percent of GDP around 2016 and gradually fall
thereafter. However, Slovenia has one of the most adverse pension expenditure dynamics in
the euro area, and further action will be required after the realization of current pension reform
plans. After more than a year of absence from the long-term markets, the government cash
position was alleviated thanks to a successful 10-year bond issuance in US dollars on October
19. This is Slovenia's first dollar-denominated bond since 1996.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Slovenia’s economy is suffering from the negative feedback
loops of recession, bank deleveraging, and corporate distress against a background of
structural weaknesses, financial sector vulnerabilities, and weak domestic and external
demand. They underlined the need for strong and prompt action to address these problems. In
this regard, Directors considered appropriate the authorities’ emphasis on fiscal consolidation
and their plans for ambitious and comprehensive structural reforms to restore macroeconomic
and financial stability and economic growth. They looked forward to swift implementation of the
reform agenda.
Directors welcomed the proposed establishment of a Bank Asset Management Company to
address the build-up of nonperforming loans, stressing that timely implementation will be of the
essence. Directors noted that publicly-owned banks may need more capital, while the corporate
sector is highly leveraged. They encouraged the authorities to move decisively to restructure,
recapitalize and ultimately privatize banks and corporations, which will also help strengthen

3
governance. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to implement the FSAP
recommendations. In particular, they emphasized the importance of strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framework and improving macroprudential oversight and crisis
contingency arrangements.
Directors commended the progress with fiscal consolidation and the efforts to strengthen the
fiscal framework. They supported the front-loaded, expenditure-based consolidation as
necessary to bolster market confidence. They encouraged focusing on structural rather than on
nominal targets, and endorsed the goal of a structural balanced budget by 2015 net of bank
restructuring costs. Directors called for a strengthening of the quality of adjustment and fiscal
governance, including through a constitutional structural balance rule with a debt brake and
enhanced medium-term fiscal planning.
Directors emphasized the importance of structural reforms to ensure fiscal sustainability,
enhance competitiveness, and spur growth. They considered the current pension reform
proposals to be a step in the right direction, but observed that more decisive measures will be
needed to ensure medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. Directors welcomed the
engagement with social partners on labor market reform, which is essential to reduce market
segmentation and improve competitiveness. They also called for improvements to the business
climate to attract foreign investment.

Statement by Johann Prader, Executive Director for the Republic of Slovenia
November 21, 2012
The Slovenian authorities would like to thank the staff for the constructive dialogue during
the 2012 Article IV mission to Slovenia in September, and for their comprehensive and
candid analysis that provides an objective view of the macro-economic situation and the
challenges ahead. The authorities also value the discussion and recommendations of the IMF
staff related to the FSAP mission that took place in April and its update in connection with
the September Article IV mission. They are in broad agreement with the staff’s assessment of
the economic developments and outlook in Slovenia as well as with its policy challenges.
After the early elections in November 2011, the new government took office in February this
year. To reestablish growth, the government immediately embarked on the preparation of a
comprehensive set of measures and structural reforms addressing the pressing issues
primarily in the financial sector, especially those related to the restructuring and
recapitalization of banks, in conjunction with the need to tackle the corporate debt overhang
and the long term sustainability of public finances.
Economic developments and Outlook
When the crisis hit the real sector in 2009, Slovenia as a small and export-dependent
economy experienced a 7.8 percent decline in GDP, one of the sharpest in the Euro area,
particularly due to the collapse of the construction sector, which can partly be explained by
the completion of the national highway construction program. The economy started an
export-led recovery in 2010, but it was interrupted by the escalation of the euro area crisis in
the second half of 2011, which led to a sharp decline in external demand and curtailed credit
supply to the highly leveraged corporate sector. Consequently, GDP growth slowed down in
2011, and is projected to turn negative again in 2012.
The slow economic recovery in Slovenia’s main trading partners, coupled with weak
domestic demand and restrained banks’ credit to the over-indebted corporate sector, weigh
heavily on the outlook for growth. Due to a very low level of investment, the unemployment
rate has been increasing continuously and is expected to reach 8.8 percent this year. It is
projected to peak at 9.0 percent in 2013, and is likely to start declining gradually in 2014 and
thereafter.
Another reason for the sluggish recovery, in addition to the external environment and the
over-indebted corporate sector, is the fragile banking sector, which is heavily exposed to the
corporate sector. Despite the deleveraging process and recapitalizations, which took place in
2011 and this year, this sector still faces the challenge of bad loans and restrained access to
financing and may need to be further recapitalized. The government is trying to address these
issues by setting up a special asset management company and a specialized agency, which is
supposed to improve transparency and governance of the state-owned assets, and by reducing
its share in the corporate sector by privatization.

2
The new government has started an aggressive, expenditure-based fiscal consolidation to
lower the deficit below 3 percent GDP by 2013, and move further towards the structural
balance over the medium term. To ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, the consolidation
efforts are being supported by a package of economic measures and structural reforms,
specifically the pension reform and the labor market reform.
Against this background, the authorities agree with the staff that the outlook for growth is on
the downside. GDP is expected to contract by 2.2 percent this year and by an additional 1.0
percent in 2013, although the authorities tend to be slightly more optimistic than the staff
regarding the 2012 outturn. Growth is expected to turn positive in 2014. Consequently,
inflation will remain under control and is expected to fall from the estimated 2.2 percent in
2012 to 1.5 percent in 2013. The authorities believe that following the successful launch of a
sovereign bond at the US market in October, downside risks will gradually subside,
especially when the implementation of the reform package starts bearing fruits.
Financial sector
The crisis most severely affected the Slovenian banking sector, which already before the
crisis relied heavily on long-term foreign financing and generous lending to indebted
corporates, especially in the construction sector. Having experienced an abrupt reduction of
foreign resources once the crisis in the euro area had fully unfolded, and faced with the
increasing share of non-performing loans (NPLs), banks have been considerably scaling back
credit to the corporate sector, which declined by 4½ percent year-on-year in the first eight
months of 2012. Companies are facing difficulties to access new credit and are therefore
increasingly failing to meet their financial obligations, which in turn erodes the quality of
banks’ credit portfolios. As a result, banks ended 2011 with considerable aggregate losses.
NPLs reached 13.2 percent (Euro 6.3 billion) in June 2012, with the share of NPLs of nonbank corporates amounting to around 20 percent.
Due to the sovereign credit rating downgrades and a continuous asset deterioration of the
largest banks in the course of the last year, credit ratings of domestic banks were
commensurately reduced, with the systemically most important bank (Nova Ljubljanska
banka d.d. – NLB) losing investment grade rating. Following the recapitalization in 2011, in
line with the requirements of the EBA and the Bank of Slovenia (BOS), NLB accelerated the
deleveraging process and was further recapitalized in June this year by Euro 381 million,
mainly through a contingent convertible bond (Euro 320 million) entirely bought by the
government, as other principal shareholders of the bank (the Belgian KBC) were unable to
participate. The authorities are aware that despite the improvement in the capital adequacy
ratio (standing at 12 percent at the end of 2011), the predominantly long-term government
deposits and a broadly stable ratio of domestic savings, further capital increases may be
needed.
To address the weaknesses and to ensure the stability of the banking system, the government
decided to tackle the issue of NPLs and to improve the access of banks to financing by
proposing a Law on Stability of the Banking Sector, which envisages establishing a special
Bank Asset Management Company (BAMC). In accordance with the law, which was adopted

3
by the parliament in October 2012, the government intends to transfer up to Euro 3 billion of
non-performing and high risk loans from banks to the BAMC in return for governmentguaranteed bonds. An additional Euro 1 billion guaranteed by the government will be used
for the recapitalization of eligible banks, if needed. As one of the purposes of the law is the
privatization of banks and state shares in the corporates, once they have been cleaned up and
recapitalized, the law will enable a quick resolution of the impaired assets, whether by
restructuring the corporates and banks concerned, or by liquidating them and selling their
collateral and assets. The public debt related to the operation of the new agency should be
partially repaid with the proceeds from the liquidation of assets, including those from the
privatization of banks and other corporations that will end up in the agency’s portfolio. The
new agency should be operational by the end of 2012 or in early-2013, and is supposed to be
wound down after five years. The authorities are preparing the implementation bylaws,
which should ensure that the governance structure and the transparency of the BAMC would
be in line with internationally accepted standards. They highly appreciate the Fund’s
technical assistance in their drafting.
As the resolving of the financial vulnerabilities of the corporate sector is a necessary
complement to the restructuring of banks, the parliament passed the Slovenia Sovereign
Holding Act in September. The act should streamline the management of state assets of the
publicly owned corporates by establishing the Slovenia Sovereign Holding (SSH), which will
merge four existing holdings (the Capital Assets Management Agency of the Republic of
Slovenia, the Consulting and Management Company, the Restitution Fund and the Pension
Fund Management Company) under a single umbrella. In line with the act, which is
consistent with the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises,
the SSH’s aim is to increase the value of the state’s capital investments through a transparent
and active management, as well as through efficient corporate governance in different types
of corporations and sectors. The SSH’s task is also to improve the finances of the publicly
owned corporates, and define a strategy that includes the target public stakes in those
corporations and sectors, including their full and partial privatization.
The entry into force and the implementation of the two laws are pending, due to the referenda
initiative filed by opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) at the end of October. Scrapping
of these laws, in particular the Law on Stability of the Banking Sector, would be detrimental
for the stability of the financial sector, since it would preclude any swift resolution of the
NPLs and banks’ recapitalization. The government has already challenged the motion for a
referendum on the SSH in front of the Constitutional Court and intends to make use of all
available legal options to avert also the referendum on the Banking Sector Stability Law. At
any rate, the government remains confident to be able to implement its financial sector
reform as well as state-owned asset management strategy.
Fiscal consolidation
The authorities are firmly committed to fiscal consolidation and long-term fiscal
sustainability. Bringing the deficit, which increased to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2011(on the
cash flow basis), below the EU Treaty’s reference value of 3 percent and balancing it in the
medium term, is one of the top priorities.

4
The new government decided to considerably enhance and accelerate the fiscal consolidation
efforts. In May 2012, the Public Finance Balancing Act (amending or changing around 40
existing laws and introducing additional measures) and a supplementary budget for 2012
were passed in order to enable a forceful front-loaded and expenditure-based fiscal
consolidation aimed at bringing the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2013, and
balancing the structural budget by 2015 (net of bank restructuring cost). The measures,
among others, include a further reduction of public sector wages, non-indexation of wages
and pensions to inflation, cutting social benefits, discretionary reduction of expenditure on
goods and services, lowering capital expenditure, and reducing subsidies and transfers. As a
result, a headline deficit of around 3.5 percent of GDP on the cash flow basis is expected in
2012 (excluding capital injections to publicly owned banks and corporations), which is
slightly higher than planned in the supplementary budget.
The envisaged cumulative structural adjustment in the range of around 3 percentage points of
GDP by 2015 should send a clear signal to the markets about the government’s determination
to balance the budget and restore their confidence, along with the successful 10-year dollardenominated sovereign bond issuance (in the amount of US$ 2.25 billion) in October. In
addition to the measures based on the Public Finance Balancing Act and enshrined into the
supplementary budget for 2012, further reductions in the wage bill in the public sector in
2013 (set at around 5 percent in aggregate), combined with a selective reduction in
employment, should contribute towards achieving the targeted 2.9 percent headline deficit in
2013. On the revenue side, the government intends to increase the absorption of EU funds by
simplifying administrative procedures and relocation of the funds to ready-to-go projects;
introducing a new financial services taxation act (a 6.5% rate, mostly on commissions which
have so far been VAT exempt, will apply for 2013 and 2014 only); and closing some
loopholes in taxation (reducing the list of lower VAT rate items).
The authorities are aware that in the long run, the increasing costs of an ageing population
represent the main threat to the sustainability of public finances, and that the pension reform
is crucial to address this issue. A year after the pension reform law of the former government
was repealed in a referendum the government submitted a new proposal to the parliament for
consideration. Even though the current proposal does not differ dramatically from the
previous one in substance, it is the result of a broader and better dialogue between the
government and social partners. While adjusting several parameters of the pay-as-you-go
system, it introduces a 40-year work period with all contributions paid as the main criterion
for the retirement for men and women alike. Provided that this criterion has been fulfilled,
retirement will be possible at the age of 60 at the earliest. Otherwise, the mandatory pension
eligibility age will be gradually prolonged to the age of 65 by 2019. Even though this
solution will extend the average effective pension age, the government is aware that its
impact will not be sufficient to ensure fiscal sustainability in the long term, and that further
reforms will have to be initiated in the future.
Structural issues
The authorities agree with the staff that resolving corporate debt is critical for restoring the
corporate sector as the engine of economic growth. They are well aware that with a highly

5
indebted corporate sector and the banking system under pressure, the dependence on credit
financing will have to be abandoned for good and replaced by a much higher share of equity,
especially from abroad, and preferably in the form of FDIs. The establishment of the SSH in
the government’s view offers a possibility to attract equity through more expedient
privatization of state assets in public companies.
To further attract FDI and boost competitiveness, which is crucial for Slovenia as a small and
export dependent economy, the government has proposed to the parliament amendments to
the Labor Market Regulation Act and a new Employment Relations Act. They are supposed
to introduce a greater level of flexibility in the labor market and address labor market duality
issues by providing a more level-playing field for the currently well protected workers with
permanent contracts and unprotected workers, who are typically younger and female. Among
other things, the laws envisage a reduction of labor costs related to the severance pay and
payments during the notice period and an improvement in the regulation of indemnities for
unjustified dismissals. In addition, they set the base for introducing a single open-ended
contract and reduce the time needed for dismissal procedures and the notice period, while
lowering administrative barriers. Negotiations between the government and social partners
are difficult and still ongoing. Changes to the laws will be still possible during the
parliamentary procedure, which has just started, since a qualified group of MPs requested an
extraordinary session of the parliament, in which the law on the reform of the pension system
would be considered as well. The main reason for calling an extraordinary session of the
parliament is the intention to have the crucial reform legislation passed by the end of 2012,
and entered into force as soon as possible, which demonstrates that the Slovenian authorities
are aware that time is of the essence.
Financial System Stability Assessment
Given the issues faced by the Slovenian financial sector, the IMF’s Financial Stability
Assessment Program (FSAP) mission to the country in April and its update in September
were timely and useful. The authorities broadly agree with the findings and recommendations
in the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report.
The authorities concur with the staff findings that the strengthening of the financial
conditions of banks is necessary and that the cleaning up and readjustment of their balance
sheets, along with the reduction of their dependence on wholesale and Eurosystem financing,
is an appropriate starting point. They are also aware that despite banks’ present adequate
capitalization, further recapitalization may be needed soon. As explained above, the
government has addressed some of these FSAP recommendations by proposing the
establishment of the Bank Asset Management Company (BAMC). The respective law should
provide the platform for the cleaning up of the impaired assets from banks’ portfolios and the
necessary funding for their recapitalization, as well as the privatization of the state’s shares in
banks, whether partly or in full. Given the extremely tight budgetary situation, the
government would find it enormously difficult to recall the act imposing a tax on bank assets
at this point in time also due to demonstration effects. However, amendments to this act
envisage that its validity would not be extended beyond 2014.

6
The authorities recognize that within the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, which are
broadly aligned with international standards, some weaknesses still exist. The BOS has fully
implemented the Basel II capital framework and has been accelerating the introduction of
Basel III. To improve the supervision framework and enable the BOS to improve the
supervision and regulation in line with the FSAP recommendations, amendments to the
banking law are being in the final stages of preparation. They are expected to be discussed
and approved by the government shortly and sent to the parliament immediately thereafter.
The law, which should be passed by the parliament and entered into force by the end of 2012,
aims at strengthening the legal framework for bank resolution, requiring banks to obtain
authorization prior to acquiring non-bank financial companies and ensuring adequate legal
protection for bank supervisors. The authorities also intend to look into strengthening the
mandate and means of the financial system supervisory agencies and tend to postpone their
merger in line with the FSSA recommendation.
