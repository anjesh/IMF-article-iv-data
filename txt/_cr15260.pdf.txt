IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea
On July 20, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Equatorial Guinea.
Equatorial Guinea’s recent economic performance has been weak, notwithstanding the high
quality infrastructure that has been built. Overall real GDP growth has averaged about
-½ percent from 2010–14, mainly driven by the trend decline in hydrocarbon production. Until
recently, growth in the non-resource sector, led by the large infrastructure spending program,
largely compensated for the declining hydrocarbon sector. The fiscal position has come under
strain, as overruns on capital investment translated into larger-than-expected overall deficits
financed through a drawdown of accumulated government savings. The current account deficit
has progressively increased to around 10 percent of GDP by 2014 as a result of lower exports
from maturing hydrocarbon fields combined with high import levels associated with the public
infrastructure program, although there is considerable uncertainty about this figure given very
weak external sector statistics. Consumer price inflation (CPI) has averaged about 4 percent in
recent years, above the 3 percent regional convergence ceiling set by the Economic Community
of Central African States (CEMAC).
The growth outlook poses very significant challenges with prospects dominated by falling
production volumes and very weak oil prices, as hydrocarbons account for around 80 percent of
the economy. With limited fiscal buffers to cushion the drop in government revenues, fiscal
retrenchment is unavoidable, and will contribute to an economic contraction of 9½ percent
in 2015, and growth is expected to remain in low negative figures through the medium term.
The gradual decline in oil output will likely continue in coming years, but may potentially be
somewhat mitigated by the introduction of new extraction technologies and ongoing
exploration.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The main near-term risk to the economic outlook is a slower-than-expected fiscal adjustment
that could result in the depletion of fiscal buffers and accumulation of public debt. Moreover, an
insufficient effort to address a weak business climate and attract foreign investment would
impede diversification and potential non-hydrocarbon growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the
government’s significant efforts to implement an ambitious program of development and
structural transformation under its National Development Plan, Horizonte 2020, which has
upgraded basic infrastructure all over the country. Nevertheless, the program has yet to achieve
its potential in terms of economic diversification and job creation, and Directors observed that
the economy is facing serious challenges from a trend decline in hydrocarbon production and
the recent fall in oil prices. Given the country’s large dependence on hydrocarbon revenues and
declining fiscal buffers, Directors emphasized the need to restore fiscal space, strengthen
financial management, foster economic diversification, and improve social welfare to support
inclusive growth.
Directors underscored the need for fiscal adjustment and welcomed the government’s planned
response to the oil shock. The fiscal measures introduced in 2014 and the revised 2015 budget
appropriately focus on strengthening spending controls and frontloading reductions of the
disproportionately large capital investment, while shifting resources toward the social sector.
Directors advised the authorities to focus on enhancing non-hydrocarbon revenue mobilization,
notably by reducing tax exemptions and modernizing customs administration. Directors also
recommended reforms to strengthen public financial management, including more frequent
meetings of the National Payments Committee and reinforced mechanisms for selecting,
executing, and monitoring capital projects.
Directors noted that while Equatorial Guinea had largely eliminated the constraints to growth
from poor infrastructure, there was a need for structural reforms to boost competitiveness and
support external stability. They considered it a priority to accelerate reforms targeting the weak
business climate and human capital development.
Directors underscored the importance of preserving financial stability and deepening financial
intermediation. Given the weakening fiscal position and the elevated level of non-performing
loans, macro-financial linkages need to be closely monitored and the government’s payment
arrears promptly cleared. Directors also saw scope for updating the banking infrastructure by
improving the operation of credit and collateral registries, and strengthening creditor rights
enforcement.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors emphasized the need to improve Equatorial Guinea’s very weak socio-economic
statistics. They noted that data provided to the IMF has serious shortcomings that significantly
hamper surveillance. At the same time, the lack of published data could impede prospective
foreign investors. In this context, they welcomed the efforts to make operational the National
Statistics Institute (INEGE), and encouraged the authorities to invest in capacity building and
subscribe to the IMF’s General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS).
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea will
be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic Context. A decade–long hydrocarbon boom has led to a fast rise of average
incomes and spurred a large scaling up of investment spending on infrastructure, although
progress on social indicators has been slow. With hydrocarbon extraction shifting into a
trend decline in the context of weak oil prices outlook and still high capital spending, the
fiscal position has weakened and fiscal buffers diminished.
Outlook and risks. Prospects are dominated by the weakening hydrocarbon sector. The
confluence of lower international oil prices, high dependence on oil revenues, and rapidly
declining buffers requires upfront and substantial fiscal consolidation, particularly focused
on investment. Real GDP is expected to contract by about 9½ percent of GDP in 2015, and
further by about 2 percent per year during 2016–20 due to fiscal consolidation and falling
hydrocarbon production. The associated decline in investment on import-intensive
infrastructure improves fiscal and external balances over the medium term and stabilizes
fiscal buffers. The key risks are insufficient fiscal adjustment and lackluster structural reform,
reducing the authorities’ ability to counter further shocks and weakening potential growth.
Policies. Macroeconomic policies should seek to better leverage the stock of infrastructure
to foster diversification and structural transformation in an environment of much-reduced
government revenue.
 Ensure fiscal sustainability through front-loaded fiscal adjustment targeting capital
spending, followed by a continued gradual reduction of the non-oil primary balance over
the medium term. Immediate cuts should be based on a comprehensive review of
ongoing and planned projects seeking to maximize value and social impact, supported by
measures to strengthen monitoring and control of spending. Consolidation should be
underpinned by reallocation of expenditures to critical social sectors.
 Pursue an ambitious structural reform agenda to energize the non-hydrocarbon sector,
particularly focused on accelerating business climate reforms, strengthening banking
infrastructure, prioritizing human development, and catalyzing investment through
international financial institutions.
 Address emerging banking sector weaknesses by promptly clearing payment arrears by
the government and strengthening its cash management.
 Address a critical shortage of macroeconomic and socio-demographic data, which is
essential for informed decision-making.

CONTEXT: LAUDABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN
INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT MORE REQUIRED TO FOSTER
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
1.
Equatorial Guinea has focused its efforts on creating impressive infrastructure.
Hydrocarbon revenues have allowed the country to massively invest in wide-ranging infrastructure
under the first phase (2008–12) of the national development plan—Horizonte 2020. High quality
roads now cover much of the country, international ports and airports have been constructed, and
access to electricity and potable water has risen rapidly.
2.
The hydrocarbon boom also
dramatically boosted average per capita
incomes, but progress on social indicators
has been slow according to available data.
Over the past few years income levels have
declined with falling hydrocarbon
production (Text Figure 1). Furthermore,
Equatorial Guinea’s social indicators are
similar to those of low income countries, and
in some cases worse (Text Table 1). Part of this
paradox can be linked to very weak data
collection, which limits the ability to draw
meaningful comparisons. At the same
time, the infrastructure investment
program has also included projects with a
weak impact on social indicators,
including sports facilities and a new
administrative capital city at Oyala.

shock to oil prices. Even before the
recent sharp decline in oil prices, hydrocarbon production was in moderating decline, which entailed

negative overall real growth rates over the medium term. Now, like other oil exporting economies,
nominal GDP, exports and especially government revenue, will take an additional hit, and per capita
GDP will continue on its downward trend. While new extraction technologies and ongoing
exploration could alter the outlook somewhat, the strong likelihood is that the hydrocarbon sector
will be a drag on activity for the foreseeable future.

4.
The fiscal position is facing severe strains. In recent years, capital spending has been
sustained around 30 percent of GDP, despite stagnating resource revenues, boosting fiscal deficits to
almost 8 percent of GDP over the past three years. Deficit financing has increasingly relied on
previously accumulated savings, which have declined by around two-thirds since end 2011.
5.
Given limited buffers, the oil price shock will need to be countered with front-loaded
fiscal adjustment and by better leveraging infrastructure to support growth. The authorities
agree on the need to curtail and reprioritize the public investment program to restore fiscal
sustainability. They also agree on the need for structural reform to support economic diversification
and social development. Nevertheless, with several public investment projects starting and others far
from complete, including Oyala, the transition process will prove challenging.
6.
The authorities are increasingly implementing policy recommendations made during
past Article IV consultation over the past year. In 2014 the authorities adopted a series of fiscal
measures to curb the fiscal deficit, including phasing out fuel subsidies to commercial users. The
revised 2015 budget signals an intention to reduce public investment and reorient spending toward
human capital development, and the authorities’ have recently requested IMF technical assistance to
develop a medium-term fiscal rule. The establishment of a National Institute of Statistics (INEGE) also
offers prospects for improving economic and social data. However, there has been limited progress
on recommended business climate reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
7.
Preliminary estimates indicate that GDP declined by 0.3 percent in 2014 (Figure 1). The
oil price shock appears to have had a limited impact as it materialized late in the year. Overall GDP
growth in 2014 was driven by the continued decline in hydrocarbon production2 (accounting for
about 70 percent of GDP), which moderated slightly thanks to higher-than-expected yields in mature
fields. Growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector is estimated to have slowed to 1.9 percent. The key
recent driver of non-hydrocarbon growth, construction, fell 2.3 percent (y-o-y) as public investment
under Horizonte 2020 shifted away from infrastructure. Utilities growth remained strong with
continued modernization and extension of the electricity network. Other sources of growth included
transportation, trade, and hospitality sectors, partly benefiting from several large conferences and
preparations for the African Cup of Nations tournament in early 2015.

Hydrocarbon production includes both crude oil and gas condensate production (classified as primary sector
output) and oil and gas derivatives, such as liquefied natural gas (secondary sector output).

8.
The fiscal deficit target was somewhat reduced in 2014, but remained high at
6.8 percent of GDP. The budget target for revenue was met. However, spending slippages recurred,
despite phasing out fuel subsidies to commercial buyers. The overrun was due to public investment,
although controls introduced in mid 2014 appear to have helped reduce the overrun to 1.8 percent
of GDP, against overruns averaging 10 percent of GDP in 2012–13. Furthermore, the overall deficit
does not capture challenges to cash flow management which led to unbudgeted spending
equivalent to 3.3 percent of GDP to clear unpaid bills on capital investment undertaken in 2013. This
required central bank financing to avoid withdrawals from the Fund for Future Generations and
offshore fixed term accounts. Public sector debt was about 12 percent of GDP at end-2014,
increasing from 8 percent at end 2013 due to the recourse to the Bank of Central African
States (BEAC) overdraft facility.
9.
The current account deficit grew to 10 percent of GDP, reflecting the trend decline in
hydrocarbon exports. The level of reserves remained high at 8 months of prospective imports.
Inflation stood at 4.3 percent in December 2014, above the regional Economic Community of Central
African States (CEMAC) convergence ceiling of 3 percent, due to food price pressures early in 2014. A
weakening of the euro (against which the regional currency, the CFA franc, is pegged), partly offset
by a relatively higher inflation rate than its trading partners, resulted in a negligible 0.3 percent
depreciation of the real effective exchange rate.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Prospects are dominated by the weakening hydrocarbon sector (Figure 2). With
hydrocarbon revenues accounting for roughly 90 percent of all revenue, the currently projected WEO
oil price would reduce hydrocarbon revenue by around 6 percent of GDP in 2015, or roughly a third
of 2014 hydrocarbon revenue. Under staff’s projections, real GDP is expected to contract by
9 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting declining hydrocarbon sector activity and large-scale fiscal
consolidation, particularly focused on investment activity. Over the medium term, overall growth
rates remain negative with hydrocarbon production declining over time, but non-hydrocarbon
growth rebounds with the implementation of the second phase of the development plan, focused on
diversification and social development. Declining investment on import-intensive infrastructure
facilitates a reduction of the current account deficit.

The key short-to medium-term downside risk is an insufficient fiscal
adjustment (Annex I). This could lead to further depletion of fiscal buffers, and accumulation of
arrears and public debt, thereby reducing the ability of the authorities to counter further shocks.
Furthermore, if an insufficiently ‘big push’ to address the weak business climate is made, there will be
little non-hydrocarbon FDI, impeding economic diversification and lowering potential nonhydrocarbon growth. Lower non-hydrocarbon growth could lead to less job creation, potentially
generating social tensions. Fiscal adjustment combined with structural reforms will play a key role in
improving external competitiveness, a key ingredient for non-hydrocarbon growth. In the event that
key global risks to the outlook materialize, including risks to energy prices and protracted slower
global growth, further fiscal tightening and faster structural reform would be required.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: LEVERAGING EXISTING
INFRASTRUCTURE TO RAISE POTENTIAL GROWTH IN
A LOW HYDROCARBON REVENUE ENVIRONMENT
12.
The discussions were framed around the authorities’ strategic objective of better
leveraging their stock of infrastructure to foster diversification and structural transformation in
an environment of much-reduced government revenue. A dialogue also occurred on how
Equatorial Guinea might champion CEMAC regional integration, including by promoting regional
transportation and electricity interconnections, and enhancing regional institutions such the BEAC and
the CEMAC Commission, especially now that the country occupies the CEMAC presidency.

A. Adjusting Fiscal Policy to the Oil Price Shock
13.
The revised 2015 budget outlines the government’s response to the hydrocarbon
revenue drop (Tables 3a–3c). The budget conservatively assumes an oil price of US$40 per barrel,
and caps investment spending based on projected hydrocarbon revenues, resulting in the
authorities’ targeted reduction of domestically-financed investment of 57 percent. The authorities’
strategy also includes measures to contain current spending and increase non-hydrocarbon
revenues, notably by curbing tax evasion, eliminating widespread exemptions on customs duties, and
exceptional revenue through the sale of state assets, mainly housing (Box 1). The medium-term fiscal
framework targets a large further reduction in spending starting from 2018, as the infrastructure
phase of their development plan concludes.

Box 1. Equatorial Guinea: Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
The government has prepared a draft of a medium-term fiscal framework. It aims to assess risks to
fiscal sustainability and provide an eventual basis for medium-term budgeting anchored on a non-oil
primary balance. Recognizing the need to strengthen fiscal management, the framework incorporates
several fiscal measures adopted by decree in May 2014 and further enhanced under the revised 2015
budget. The mission’s baseline scenario applies broad elements of this strategy, but its assumptions vary on
the profiles for revenue mobilization and expenditure consolidation.
The revenue effort focuses on strengthening tax administration. A planned revision to the tax code is
expected to include measures
to: (i) reduce evasion of personal and
corporate income taxes, particularly by
large taxpayers3; (ii) tightening
administration of ad-hoc customs duty
exemptions, supported by African
Development Bank program to
computerize customs administration;

The authorities’ spending baseline includes sharply lower budgeted capital expenditure in 2015. Other
near-term measures seek to curb current spending through lower personnel costs by reducing non-salary
benefits and downsizing (ministerial posts were cut by half in early 2015), scaling back operating
costs (reducing procurement, travel, and fuel allocations and introducing electrical metering in public
buildings), and removing fuel subsidies to commercial users. However, current spending cuts are offset by a
rising maintenance bill and higher social outlays under the second phase of the national development plan.
From 2018, about 70 percent of savings are realized through cuts to capital spending, following a
comprehensive review of the current Public Investment Program.

The authorities’ consider that coverage of the tax base is weak. An ongoing enterprise census has registered
over 1,900 businesses, as compared to 393 corporate tax filings in 2013.

14.
While the government is appropriately focusing its fiscal adjustment on reducing
overly capital spending, the underlying strategy is subject to considerable risks. The envisaged
adjustment in the 2015 revised budget is unlikely to be fully realized given the history of spending
slippages due to weaknesses in public financial management (PFM), the late adoption of the revised
budget, and the practicability of delaying politically-sensitive projects mid-stream. These risks are
amplified under the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework, which backloads a second round of
cuts to investment spending, while relying heavily on tax efficiency gains and a tax amnesty program.
For the latter, empirical evidence shows that while there may be short-run revenue gains, this type of
measure often leads to weakening tax compliance.4 To highlight the risks posed by slow reform and
delayed adjustment, a downside scenario shows higher spending moderately lifting growth in the
short run, but lower medium-term growth due to weak prioritization. The slow fiscal adjustment
contributes to a higher current account deficit and rapid depletion of buffers, as well as public debt
rising to over 30 percent of GDP by 2020 (Text Table 2). This scenario is contingent on the availability
of external financing, absent which there would be a buildup of arrears or need for an abrupt
adjustment.

Staff recommended a consolidation strategy that aims to progressively reduce the nonresource primary balance to under 50 percent of GDP in the medium term.5 Staff’s baseline
adjustment strategy applies current WEO oil price assumptions, and reflects relatively front-loaded
cuts to public investment and stabilizing the government deposit buffer at about 7–8 percent of
GDP, would involve a moderate increase in debt levels to around 17 percent of GDP in 2020
(Tables 1–5, Annex II). In line with this strategy, the mission made the following recommendations:



Address fundamental PFM weakness. To
better monitor and control capital spending, action plans were needed to bring budget
classification and reporting on execution in line with CEMAC norms, and the National Payments
Committee (NPC) should meet more frequently, preferably on monthly basis. Accelerating PFM
reform is also a prerequisite for the move toward a formal fiscal rule that could anchor fiscal
sustainability over the medium term.



Shift the emphasis of spending away from infrastructure toward public services and social
projects. Current spending remains low at 25 percent of total expenditure, compared to
70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa and 60 percent in the CEMAC region, with relatively low
provisions for education and health. In line with World Bank recommendations, budget
allocations need to be overhauled better respond to national development program priorities
(notably in education and health) that are key to higher productivity and raise the return on
infrastructure.6



Phase out remaining fuel subsidies to retail consumers and elaborate well-targeted programs
to address the needs of vulnerable groups.
Launch a multipronged effort to raise
non-hydrocarbon revenues. The
importance of non-hydrocarbon is
highlighted by the fact that Equatorial
Guinea is among the oil exporting
countries in SSA with the lowest
government revenue per
barrel (Text Table 4). This may reflect an
aim to attract investment through a
competitive resource taxation regime.
However, a deeper assessment is required

The authorities reiterated their

determination to achieve the targets
under the revised budget. While acknowledging weaknesses in public financial management, they
were confident that a strengthened NPC would impose discipline through strict cash management in
line with the budget. Furthermore, although late adoption of the budget posed a risk, the authorities
noted that key measures already began in 2014, further cushioned by the use of conservative
hydrocarbon revenue assumptions. Over the medium term, the comprehensive review of the PIP
would reduce investment possibly more quickly than programmed, freeing up resources for
economic diversification, social development, and rebuilding of buffers. This process could be further
anchored on a formal fiscal rule, toward which they would request IMF technical assistance. The
authorities agreed that currently low oil prices offered a useful opportunity to progressively phase
out fuel subsidies to consumers. However, they did not see merit in an urgent review of tax policy,
noting that tax rates are near minimum thresholds set by CEMAC, and higher rates could undermine
the push for diversification.

B. Leveraging Infrastructure Toward Structural Transformation
17.
Horizonte 2020 has considerably enhanced transportation infrastructure and public
utilities (Annex IV)8. Although some of the largest projects have limited economic
payoff (e.g., stadiums), the installed infrastructure “hardware” constitutes a considerable advantage
relative to other sub-Saharan African countries. Nonetheless, economic diversification has remained
elusive so far, and hydrocarbons have remained at more than 90 percent of total exports.
18.
Substantial challenges remain if Horizonte 2020 is to spur diversification. To leverage
the hardware, the “software” needs significant strengthening. Potential investors continue to be
deterred by a weaker investment climate and lower human capital than in comparator countries:

7

Other factors that could affect the tax yield include the cost structure and the stage of production.

8

Horizonte 2020 highlights two objectives: (i) transition from an oil dominated to a diversified economy; and (ii) the
reduction of poverty and enhancement of social cohesion.

Equatorial Guinea lags on most business climate indicators, placing 165th out of 186 countries in
the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking (Text Figures 2, 3 and Figure 3)9. The country ranks low
on property rights, bureaucratic procedures, regulatory quality, corruption, and rule of law. In
addition, economic and social data is scarce, impairing investors’ ability to assess opportunities.10

On human capital, primary completion rates, teacher training, and repeat rates underperform
countries of similar income, as well as the average in sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, new
ventures are required to have a minimum of 90 percent of local employment.

19.
Furthermore, the recent decline in oil prices could lead to an overvalued real exchange
rate unless there is an appropriate fiscal adjustment (Annex II). In recent years, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) has appreciated relative to other CEMAC countries due to consistently higher
inflation. Although analysis based on methodologies developed in Behms and Carvalho Filho (2009)
and Araujo and others (2013) show no significant overvaluation, both are built on macroeconomic
projections that assume a strong fiscal adjustment without which the current account would remain
largely negative. More importantly, these assessments are based on very weak balance of payments
statistics and hydrocarbon production projections in a highly uncertain international oil market.
20.
The authorities acknowledge these challenges and are taking action on several areas.
Phase II of Horizonte 2020 (2013–20) aims at improving governance, the business climate, and
human capital formation. To that end, the authorities are:


Negotiating with the World Bank a Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) agreement to improve
the business climate as well as to establish electronic business registries and an investment
promotion agency.



Restructuring and computerizing public administration, and have taken steps to increase
accountability and transparency by establishing a court of audit, ombudsman office, and an anticorruption attorney’s office.

9

Doing Business indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.
10

Equatorial Guinea is not included in the Global Competitiveness Index Ranking, a major international assessment of
the investment climate.

Fostering human capital formation by funding scholarships for foreign studies, developing school



21.
Given the limited success in growing new export sectors, the mission recommended a
big push of comprehensive reforms aimed at the country’s “software”. Investor interest could
be generated through an ambitious agenda encompassing actions to:


Accelerate business climate reforms under the RAS agreement, and address investment
bottlenecks by reevaluating local content rules and easing labor market rigidities.12

Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union could also catalyze investment.
Immigration policies should be flexible enough so as to ensure adequate supply of human
capital to investors.



Catalyze investment through an IFC investment in the non-hydrocarbon sector and working
with rating agencies on an assessment of the economy.



Fiscal adjustment to avoid real exchange rate overvaluation. To maximize efficiency,
spending should prioritize human development and the rising maintenance bill13 over tax
expenditure, new infrastructure, a new administrative capital, or a co-investment fund. To the
extent possible, public infrastructure investment should incorporate private sector design and
management.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations. However, the authorities
expressed their concern about reducing the local employment content and ownership, as well as of
signing of the EPA. They argued that these actions could reduce employment, technological transfer,
and diversification. They also considered the Co-Investment Fund essential for attracting private
sector partners. With regard to more flexibility on immigration rules, they argued that there is need
to be cognizant of security issues. They indicated that the eventual adoption of biometric
identification by CEMAC countries could facilitate immigration of qualified workers.

11

The Special Economic Zones planned include industrial complexes in Mbini, Sampaka, and Luba.

12

Local content rules stipulate 90 percent local employment, and 35 percent local ownership on new ventures.
Furthermore, the World Bank’s Doing Business report find high redundancy costs minimum wages relative to value
added in Equatorial Guinea.
13

World Bank analysis broadly estimated that annual maintenance costs may rise by 2016 to between
CFAF 300–500 billion.

C. Addressing Emerging Banking Sector Weakness and Fostering Financial
Deepening
23
While the overall financial sector is well-capitalized, liquid, and resilient to
macroeconomic shocks, high credit growth and weak asset quality pose significant
vulnerabilities. A recent FSAP review (Annex V) determined that the overall financial system remains
resilient against shocks to credit quality, liquidity, interest rates, and the exchange rate. However,
NPLs rose from 5.8 percent of gross loans (December 2012) to 21 percent (February 2015), with
increases occurring at four of five banks. The deterioration in asset quality reflects a slowing
construction sector, which in turn is experiencing delays in payments from the government. The
payment delays also fueled high levels of credit growth in 2013–14 (averaging 26 percent), as
companies sought bank financing to maintain operations.
24.
The financial sector is shallow, highly concentrated, and characterized by limited
inclusiveness (Figure 4). Physical outreach is limited, with one-third the numbers of bank branches
and ATMs per head relative to comparators. Financial deepening, as measured by deposit- and loanto-GDP ratios, is also less than a third of peers. Limited information on potential borrowers’ credit
history limits the supply of credit. The banking sector is supervised by the regional agency, Central
African Banking Commission (COBAC), which has limited capacity to properly conduct its mandate.
25.
Equatorial Guinea is moving toward implementation of CEMAC’s AML/CFT framework.
The national agency for financial investigations, ANIF, is not yet fully operational. Staff capacity
building is underway. A regional peer review of Equatorial Guinea AML/CFT legal framework is
scheduled for 2016 to align it with key recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
26.


The mission made the following recommendations:
Launch a detailed assessment of the deteriorating asset quality. The potential weaknesses
are exacerbated by strong macro-financial linkages stemming from recurrent delays in
government payment to the construction sector, which is heavily reliant on the government for
contracts. The weaker government and oil companies’ balance sheets could also weaken the
deposit base for banks. Fiscal consolidation efforts should accommodate the necessity to
promptly clear domestic arrears and strengthen cash management to avoid undermining
economic activity and heightening risks to financial stability. A bank restructuring program may
well be necessary to address any identified weaknesses and limit the fiscal impact.



To deepen financial intermediation and inclusion, the focus should be on modernizing
banking infrastructure by upgrading of credit and collateral registries; undertaking reforms
to strengthen contract enforcement; and encouraging the development of microfinance and
mobile banking. For the latter, a greater promotion of electronic money by banks and the
endorsement of more flexible regional regulations by the government—similar to those adopted
in East Africa—could spur innovation and increased access. Credit reporting system should be
developed and access to registries by SMEs should be enhanced to reduce asymmetric
information. In this context, the recommendations of the International Committee for Credit
Reporting (ICCR) on facilitating SME financing through improved credit reporting could serve as
a guideline.14



Strengthen the AML/CFT regime in line with the 2012 FATF standard, notably by
implementing at the national level CEMAC’s AML/CFT framework, operationalizing ANIF and
ensuring on a risk-basis compliance with AML/CFT measures by regulated institutions.

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities do not see immediate systemic financial sector risks related to the rise
in NPLs. They noted the comfortable capitalization, liquidity and profitability of the banking system
and attributed the general deterioration in asset quality to the weakening economic conditions and
the infrequent meetings of the NPC. While NPL levels were being closely monitored, they would
largely be resolved with the progressive clearing of government obligations.
28.
The authorities agreed with the recommendation to support financial intermediation.
In line with their objectives to become a regional financial hub, the authorities indicated their priority
to develop the overall banking system, with a lesser focus on the micro financial institutions.
Initiatives are underway to create a center to monitor payments incidents to centralize information
relating to customer solvency, and the newly introduced (at the CEMAC level) e-Business collateral
registries would have a positive impact on financial intermediation.

D. Addressing Acute Statistical Data Weaknesses
29.
Equatorial Guinea suffers from a critical shortage of macroeconomic and sociodemographic data. What data is available is not widely published, especially in international
databases. Apart from Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea is the only other country in sub-Saharan Africa that
does not subscribe to the IMF’s General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS). Due to capacity
constraints, there are very serious deficiencies in external sector and national accounts data, and
fiscal data—which often have insufficient coverage of investment spending—are reported to staff
infrequently with very long lags. Moreover, there are considerable uncertainties regarding
demographic data—and in turn social indicators. These shortcomings hamper effective surveillance
and seriously impede policy formulation.

30.
Staff welcomed the work undertaken to modernize national accounts15 and statistics
institutional development. With the assistance of the World Bank and AFRITAC, considerable
progress has been made in the establishment of a new base year for national accounts (2006), using
SNA93 methodology (currently the authorities are using SNA68). A report has been prepared
providing details on the usage of the new methodology, the collection and presentation of data, and
a detailed analysis of the results for 2006. New estimates for the period 2007–12 have been
finalized (but not yet approved), and preliminary estimates for 2013–14 are being finalized. Progress
has also been made toward making the National Institute of Statistics (INEGE) operational, including
(i) adoption of internal operating procedures, regulations, and a short-term action plan;
(ii) recruitment and training of priority personnel; and (iii) the installation of the institute in its own
well-equipped offices.
31.
Staff recommended greater emphasis on the use of good data for informed decisionmaking. This involves a cultural shift throughout government, especially in an environment of muchreduced revenue where the opportunity cost of ill-informed decisions is particularly high. Moreover,
the lack of published data is likely a deterrent for potential investors. Specifically, the mission
recommends:


Strengthening the operations of INEGE through the development of a capacity-building
program and the creation of a national databank to consolidate data that is collected but not
disseminated by other government entities. Over the medium term, a national statistical
strategy will need to be adopted.



The formal adoption of revised national accounts for 2006 (base year) and the series
for 2007–12 following a national workshop. The new accounts use more robust
methodology and have better sectoral coverage.



Undertaking economic and socio-demographic surveys aimed at assessing economic
activity, employment, household incomes, poverty, and health. A population census is
urgently needed to establish a good estimate of the country’s total population. Preparations
for a successful census are now complete. A new socio-economic survey would also provide
the basis for a new base year for national accounts.



Developing statistical tools for systematically monitoring the national development
plan. So far very little has been published on the many notable achievements attained. Once
the appropriate metadata have been prepared, the data could be eventually be published by
such databases as the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. This could be facilitated
by the planned preparation of the annual Statistics Bulletin.



Joining the IMF’s General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS). Subscribing to the
GDDS would be an important first step of the country’s commitment to sound statistics and

15

National account series of the current framework were revised to incorporate some elements of the World Bank
and AFRITAC GDP rebasing exercise. This led to an increase in the non-hydrocarbon GDP, as result of better
measurement of service and construction sectors.

20

transparency. Staff explained to the authorities the steps to allow them to join the GDDS and
to start reporting data to the IMF systematically.


Deploying software for processing international trade transactions such as SYDONIA
World at customs. Equatorial Guinea is one of the very few countries in SSA that does not
have a computerized system for processing trade transactions and compiling data. This is not
only a statistical issue, but likely leads to very weak customs revenue collection.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment and recommendations. They indicated
that improving statistics is one of their key short-run policy priorities. They noted that due to lack of
up-to-date data on social indicators, for instance, their considerable investment in social
infrastructure was not being fully reflected. As a result, they are determined to improve both the
compilation and dissemination of statistics. They are committed to participating in the GDDS, and
would welcome additional technical assistance to INEGE, which has relatively few experienced staff.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The Equatoguinean economy is facing serious challenges, due to the trend decline in
hydrocarbon production compounded by recent sharp decline in oil prices. While commendable
progress has been made in the context of Horizonte 2020 to build its infrastructure “hardware”, the
government now needs to upgrade the underlying “software” in terms of supporting reforms that
can help the country leverage the “hardware” to foster economic diversification. However, it must do
so in a context of declining revenues and limited fiscal buffers. High economic growth, especially
outside of the enclave sectors, is necessary to create much-needed jobs, especially for the youth.
34.
The government has rightly decided to undertake fiscal adjustment. The fiscal measures
undertaken in 2014 and within the revised 2015 budget are steps in the right direction. In particular,
cutting the disproportionately large capital budget should go a long way in creating the necessary
fiscal space to shift more resources towards the social sectors. This is necessary for creating more
inclusive growth, and improving social welfare of large segments of the population. Fiscal adjustment
is needed to help sustain the monetary union.
35.
There is need to further boost non-hydrocarbon revenues and improve public financial
management. Determined efforts will be needed to deliver the authorities medium-term fiscal
adjustment. Previous staff recommendations remain relevant. In particular, there is need to boost
non-hydrocarbon revenue, notably by effectively phasing out generous tax exemptions and
reinforcing tax administration especially at customs, including by computerizing its operations. To
avoid recurrence of arrears, cash-flow management should be enhanced, for example by having
more regular meetings of the National Payments Committee. There is also need to reinforce
mechanisms for selecting, executing and monitoring of projects, especially in an environment of
reduced financial resources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

36.
The government has appropriately aimed at diversifying the economy away from
hydrocarbons, and the oil price shock has underscored the need to foster diversification. While
the binding constraints to growth from poor infrastructure have been largely eliminated, unlike in
most African countries, there is need for a big push focusing more on “horizontal” policies aimed at
improving the weak business climate and the educational system to provide better trained labor.
These policies would help lower factor costs, by boosting Equatorial Guinea’s competitiveness and
supporting external stability. The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, although the
assessment is based on very weak data, and there are serious structural weaknesses that undermine
non price competitiveness.
37.
There is need to improve financial depth and inclusion, pay greater attention to macrofinancial linkages, and address emerging banking sector portfolio weaknesses. Staff
recommends improving the operations of land and commercial registries, streamlining procedures
for recording and enforcing guarantees, and strengthening creditor rights enforcement by enhancing
governance of the relevant courts. Greater usage of mobile banking can enhance financial access,
and the authorities should push for greater regulatory flexibility at the regional level to promote
innovation. There is need to pay greater attention to macro-financial linkages between weaknesses
of the government’s fiscal position and increasing nonperforming loans in the financial sector.
Prompt clearance of government domestic arrears will facilitate the reduction in NPLs.
38.
A quantum leap is required to improve Equatorial Guinea’s very weak socio-economic
statistics. The data provided to the IMF are inadequate for surveillance, especially for the external
sector and national accounts. At the same time, lack of published data is undoubtedly an
impediment for potential foreign investors who need to make well-informed decisions. While there
have been considerable efforts to improve national accounts, these need to be formally approved
and start being utilized. Staff welcomes efforts to make operational the National Statistics Institute,
and encourages the authorities to invest more in training. Publication of existing statistics can be
facilitated if the authorities join the IMF’s GDDS. Finally, there is need to undertake socio-economic
surveys, which are indispensable to measure progress in the authorities’ strategic goals under
Horizonte 2020.
39.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Equatorial Guinea: Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of Risk

Relative
Likelihood

Potential impact

Mitigation Measures

Global Risks
Protracted period of slower
growth in key advanced and
emerging economies:
Euro area and Japan:
Weak demand and
persistently low inflation
from a failure to fully
address crisis legacies and
appropriately calibrate
macro policies, leading to
“new mediocre” rate of
growth.
Emerging markets:
Maturing of the cycle,
misallocation of
investment, and
incomplete structural
reforms leading to
prolonged slower growth.

High

Medium

Risks to energy prices:
Increased volatility due to
uncertainty about the
persistence of the oil
supply shock and the
underlying drivers of the
price decline.
Persistently low prices
triggered by supply factors
reversing only gradually,
and weaker demand.

High

Medium

1

Staff Assessment: High
Lower global demand will
make diversification away
from oil even more
challenging, making it difficult
to reverse the downward
trend decline in overall
growth.

Further fiscal policy tightening
would be needed in a world of lower
oil prices. Structural reforms would
need to be accelerated to increase
external competitiveness.

Overall growth will decline.
Further oil and gas exploration
will slow down and the
reduced demand from lower
government demand will
reduce non-hydrocarbon
growth.

Staff Assessment: High
Lower oil exports will sharply
reduce government revenue
and lead to increased public
debt levels. Financing for
infrastructure would be
curtailed.
Overall growth will decline.
Further oil and gas exploration
will slow down and the
reduced aggregate demand
from lower government
spending will reduce nonhydrocarbon growth.

Fiscal policy would need to be
adjusted even more to a world of
lower oil prices. To smoothen the
adjustment some increase in the
level of debt would be inevitable to
ensure that there are adequate
buffers to cushion oil price volatility.
Structural reforms would need to be
accelerated to increase external
competitiveness.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in staff’s
View). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent; “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent; and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff’s views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly.

Staff Assessment: High
Loose fiscal policy would lead to
a sharp increase in payment
arrears and public debt, thereby
reducing competitiveness and
growth. It could weaken the

spillover to the currency union,
and the financial sector through
increasing NPLs.

structural transformation would
be delayed, thereby reducing
non-hydrocarbon growth and job
creation considerably. Social
inequalities could be
exacerbated, thus potentially
fueling social tensions.

Low

Staff Assessment: Medium
Continued social exclusion,
particularly due to fiscal
consolidation, could give rise to
political instability.

Loose fiscal policy would need to be
reversed in order to create space to
pay off arrears, supported by
strengthened cash management.
Greater attention would need to be
paid to the health of the banking
system, and capital infusions or
complete restructuring may be
needed.
There would be need to create a
social safety net to mitigate the
impact on the most affected.

Risks could be mitigated by
speeding up human capital
development, encouraging meritbased recruitment, and promoting
an open political environment.

Annex II. External Stability Analysis1
The planned reduction in capital spending will lead to a significant decline in the very large current
account deficit. And assuming a major fiscal adjustment in the medium run, as proposed in the
baseline macroeconomic framework, the real exchange rate assessments indicate it is aligned with its
fundamentals. However, very serious data weaknesses affect the accuracy of the quantitative
assessment of the real effective exchange rate in Equatorial Guinea.
1.
The real effective exchange rate (REER)
has appreciated rapidly since 2000 considerably
more than in other CEMAC countries (Figure 1).
REER appreciation has reflected relatively high CPI
inflation. However, there has been a significant
reversal in both the REER since mid-2014 mainly as
a result of the depreciation of the euro, to which
the CFA franc is pegged (Figure 2).

2.
The current account deficit is projected
to decrease significantly in 2015 as a result of
the planned reduction in public investment.
Although the projected 30 percent decline in oil
prices (in CFA franc terms) between 2014 and 2015
will deteriorate the current account by an
equivalent of 4.4 percent of 2014 GDP, the planned
reduction in public sector imports should increase
the current account balance by an equivalent of
8 percent of 2014 GDP. In the medium run, the
current account deficit will gradually continue to
decline as public sector imports decline by half
during 2015–20, offsetting the expected decline in
oil exports during that period.

3.
Although very serious data weaknesses affect the accuracy of a quantitative
assessment of the real effective exchange rate in Equatorial Guinea, there are some indications
that the real exchange rate would be in equilibrium under the assumed macroeconomic
framework2. Both the Bems-Carvalho Filho (2009) and the Araujo et al. (2013) methodology
suggests the real exchange rate is broadly aligned with its fundamentals. Note that both
methodologies are implemented based on a macroeconomic framework that assumes a major fiscal
adjustment that contributes to bring the current account to balance by 2020.
4.
The methodology of Bems and Carvalho Filho (2009) suggests a minor overvaluation of
the real effective exchange rate, around 2 percent.3 The Bems and Carvalho Filho methodology
derives a desired path for the current account based on specified inter-temporal allocation rules of
oil income flows (Figure 3). Under the

the current account in 2020 as the

productivity growth and hence produces
current account norms that would be above
Equatorial Guinea’s medium term current account path if public investment has a significant payoff.
Given only moderate non-hydrocarbon GDP growth and almost negligible growth in nonhydrocarbon exports, it appears that the sizable public investment in past years has not improved
productivity growth significantly.

2

It is worth noting that there have been significant changes to major balance of payments estimates that affect the
composition of the current account and therefore, affect the current account projections used by exchange rate
assessment methodologies. These changes incorporate statistics provided by the authorities, but given the still
significant weaknesses in official balance of payments estimates (described in the Informational Annex), the
conclusions in this exchange rate assessment should be taken with caution. Moreover, current account projections
partly incorporate recent upward revisions to oil production made by the authorities that are highly uncertain
considering the volatile international oil markets.

5.
The methodology of Araujo et al. (2013) suggests that the effective real exchange rate
is overvalued by less than 1 percent.4 This methodology takes into account absorptive capacity
constraints in investment, since ambitious public and private investment programs in developing
countries are often impacted by weak planning, coordination, and oversight contributing to large
cost overruns.5 Results from this methodology suggest only a very mild overvaluation of 0.4 or
0.6 percent depending on the assumed elasticity of the current account to changes in the real
exchange rate (Table 1).

Comparing investment flows to the physical measure variations of the public capital stock in Columbia and Mexico
over the period 1981–95, Arestoff and Hurlin (2006) estimates that one peso of public investments created around
0.40 pesos of public capital. Pritchett (1996) reports that in a typical developing country in earlier decades, less than
50 cents of capital were created for each public dollar invested.

Annex III. Horizonte 2020 Track Record
The main outcome of Horizonte 2020 to date is first-class infrastructure, which constitutes a major
comparative advantage relative to other SSA countries. The government has also built universities,
schools, technical colleges, and health centers, but the level of social spending is still relatively low and
its overall social impact is not yet evident, in part due to poor statistical collection. Further public
investments will be limited by contracting hydrocarbon revenues. Thus, the authorities should protect
priority areas (health and education among others), and secure funds for the maintenance of existing
infrastructure.
1.
Taking advantage of its large hydrocarbon revenues, Equatorial Guinea aims to attain
sustainable development through its National Development Plan (NDP), Horizonte 2020.
Launched in 2007, Horizonte 2020 highlights two objectives: (a) make a transition from hydrocarbondominated to a diversified economy, and (b) reduce poverty and enhance social cohesion. The plan is
two-phased. During the first, Transformation phase of the NDP (2008–12), the government targeted
the development of physical and human capital, as well as the improvement of institutions and the
quality of governance. The ongoing, Emergence phase (2013–20) focuses on fostering nontraditional activities to attain a robust, diversified, employment-generating, and inclusive growth
path. The authorities also plan to meet all the Millennium Development Goals by 2020.
2.
The main outcome of the first phase of the NPD is first-class infrastructure. Whereas
sub-Saharan Africa’s economic potential growth is severely constrained by poor infrastructure, mainly
insufficient and low quality transport links and electricity supply, Equatorial Guinea now excels in this
area:


2,500 km of paved roads cover the relatively small area of the country and efficiently connect the
main population centers in both the insular and continental regions.



While most African cities have intermittent and insufficient electricity coverage, Equatorial
Guinean cities benefit from reliable electricity supply that has tripled from 305 GWh in 2009 to
887 GWh in 2014.



Nine ports (including deep-water ports) and five airports (including three international airports)
provide a strong multimodal shipping capacity.



Telecommunications are supported by a nationwide fiber optic network.

3.
The NDP has also made significant infrastructure investments to more directly foster
economic diversification. Targeted non-hydrocarbon sectors include tourism (luxury hotels and
resorts managed by foreign multinationals), as well as in agriculture, fisheries, cattle ranching, and
forestry. It also has set up a co-investment fund in 2014 to support any private investments in the
country, although no investors have applied to the fund to date.
4.
Significant infrastructure investments have also been made to support social
development, but the level of social spending is still relatively low and its overall social impact
is not yet evident part due lack of reliable and up-to-date socio-demographic surveys. While
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

improved roads and electricity have a clear social impact, the government has further sought to
enhance social welfare by building universities, schools, technical colleges, health centers, and waste
treatment facilities. Properly staffing and equipping education and health facilities is a challenge, to
which the government is partly responding by hiring Cuban academics. Beyond infrastructure, social
development initiatives have included funding scholarships for education in domestic and overseas
study, vaccination programs, and programs to eradicate malaria. However, the level of social
spending remains relatively low and gauging value for money on spending is frustrated by
weaknesses in the functional classification on budgetary spending and more generally on statistical
collection. Furthermore, some declared social spending such as social housing (constructing
apartments), is not well-targeted as most of it is inaccessible to the poorest segments of the
population.
5.
Some measures have also been taken toward much-needed strengthening of
institutions and of the quality of the government, but cross-country indicators do not show
yet any significant impact of these reforms. The 2011 constitutional reform has led to reforms
within the state apparatus, which the authorities consider will strengthen public administration
through better accountability and transparency. These include the creation of a bicameral parliament,
an ombudsman office, an accounts tribunal, and an economic and social council. Among the more
noticeable anti-corruption reforms are the creation of an agency for financial investigation, an audit
secretary within the President’s office, and the establishment of an anti-corruption attorney’s office.
The outcome of these measures is not yet evident in cross-country indicators of governance and
transparency.
6.
The authorities envision continued substantial public investments under the NPD, but
contracting hydrocarbon revenues will limit their implementation. As of mid 2014, only
55 percent of the full cost of the Public Investment Program (PIP) had been implemented. Sectors
with lagging completion rates are public administration, education, health, and sanitation and roads.
Given the priority of these areas, the authorities should ensure the orderly completion of ongoing
projects while down-scaling their plans on less productive areas such as the construction of a new
capital and poorly targeted social housing.
7.
Besides securing the implementation of the most urgent pending investments under
the PIP, sufficient funds also need to be allocated for upkeep. The perpetual inventory method is
a useful guide, and assuming a yearly depreciation rate of 3 percent and an efficiency rate of
40 percent for public investment, staff estimates that public capital stock roughly tripled in size
over 2008–14 to about CFAF 7,200 billion. Applying World Bank estimates of capital maintenance
spending (or an ‘r’ ratio of 3.5 percent ), public capital maintenance costs would average around could
increase by about 1.5 percentage points of GDP by 2017. While the authorities’ medium-term
projects a doubling of current spending to around 50 percent of total expenditure, it remains below
the SSA average of 70 percent and the projected maintenance bill is about 30 percent lower than that
anticipated by the perpetual inventory method.

Annex IV. Promoting Investment in non-Hydrocarbon Exports

1

Despite investments in infrastructure and government efforts to attract FDI to non-hydrocarbon
exports, non-hydrocarbon export growth has been negligible in Equatorial Guinea. Taking into account
the empirical literature on the determinants of FDI, the country needs to increase economies of scale
through trade integration, improve its productivity-to-cost ratio by strengthening its business climate
and human capital, strengthen governance, and preserve macroeconomic stability.
1.
Despite significant investments in infrastructure, non-hydrocarbon exports have not
taken off in Equatorial Guinea. Aiming to increase value-added and local content, the second
phase of Horizonte 2020 focuses on

Some of these countries, such as UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, which by 2014 produced US$115 billion,
US$10.5 billion, US$17.8 billion, and US$57.5 billion of non-hydrocarbon exports, respectively, partly did so by
exporting hydrocarbon-related petrochemicals and fertilizer, as well as steel, fisheries, textiles, and other
manufactured products. They notably benefited from cheap and abundant energy sources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

country studies, such as Blonigen and Piger (2011) and Walsh and Yu (2010), determine the factors
that attract overall FDI3, while the latter paper further identifies those that attract investment by
economic sector (primary, secondary, or tertiary). The factors identified in these papers have been
present in the high performing countries that experienced rapid growth in non-extractive industry
exports: market size (notably China); proximity to large markets (notably the countries near the
United States or the European Union); high productivity-to-cost ratio (notably East Asia, and Eastern
Europe); macroeconomic stability (all countries); cultural affinity (Mauritius and India); and relative
political stability (no high performing country experienced external/internal war during its high
performing period). Furthermore, cross-country evidence shows that to attract labor-intensive
industries that do not require direct government assistance, priority should be given to “horizontal”
reforms.4
4.
Equatorial Guinea has clear deficiencies and needs to take action in many of the areas
that are important to attract non-hydrocarbon FDI. The country has a small population size, is
relatively far from the main global economic powerhouses, and trade integration in SSA is limited. It
can tap into economies of scale by advocating further integration within CEMAC and between
CEMAC and the rest of the world by lowering trade policy barriers and through behind the border
measures. It is also evident that the country has a low productivity-to-cost ratio, as implied by weak
business climate and human capital indicators. The implementation of a RAS agreement with the WB
and further work to improve education and technical training are crucial. Fiscal adjustment is
important to preserve macroeconomic stability in view of the collapse in oil prices. Although the
country remains politically stable, the needed political and economic institutions to deliver the
needed improvements in governance and policy-making are weak, and the government needs to
redouble its efforts in these areas. All these measures and reforms can allow the country to leverage
its first-class infrastructure.

Annex V. CEMAC Financial Sector Assessment Program Review—
1
Lessons for Equatorial Guinea
The FSAP review concludes that the CEMAC financial sector is relatively shallow and undeveloped. This
is particularly the case in Equatorial Guinea. Although stress test analysis shows Equatorial Guinea’s
financial system is relatively resilient within the CEMAC context, greater attention should be given to
the rise in nonperforming loans. The country needs to take decisive actions on financial diversification
to support its economic development efforts, and fully implement an AML/CFT framework.
Structure and reach of the financial sector
1.
The CEMAC’s financial sector is undiversified and dominated by commercial banks, and
foreign banks. The banking sector is heterogeneous, segmented, and strongly concentrated. Overall,
the banking sector is profitable, with profitability of banks varying widely depending on the country
and the size of the institutions (Figure 3 of the FSAP). Loans to connected parties, the main cause of
past failures, remain the fundamental threat weighing on locally owned banks. Electronic banking
services are beginning to be offered but are still embryonic, and the cost of electronic funds transfers
is much higher than that noted, for example, in East Africa. The microfinance sector is relatively well
developed in three countries (Cameroon, Congo, and Chad) and offers financial services to
households and SMEs not using the banking system.
2.
Banking intermediation remains weak and access to banking services is lower than in
comparable SSA countries. Despite a substantial increase in credit to the private sector, and the
number of banks and bank branches over the past 10 years, the banking sector is still not as deep as
the average for the SSA countries or emerging countries. Large enterprises continue to receive the
bulk of bank loans (about 80 percent). Less than 15 percent of adults are bank account holders and
barely 3 percent have their wages deposited directly to a bank account. Similarly, the share of adults
with savings at banks is, on average, only about 7.5 percent in the CEMAC. Despite the progress
achieved in recent years, financial intermediation and access to credit remain hampered by a number
of structural constraints. The barriers include, in particular, inadequate functioning of the judicial
system, the absence of appropriate guarantee instruments, and the lack of credit reporting.
Results of the stress tests
3.
The 2015 FSAP stress tests revealed that CEMAC’s financial system is resilient to
exogenous shocks, with Equatorial Guinea’s financial system performing relatively better than
that of its peers. In terms of resilience to credit quality, liquidity, interest rate and exchange rate
shocks, the financial system is generally sound. The stress tests show that credit risk is the main
source of vulnerability in all the CEMAC countries, although banks and micro-finance institutions with
local capital have shown a greater vulnerability to the shocks. Due to their generally long positions in
euro and the limited sensitivity of the valuation of assets and liabilities to interest rates, all countries
display limited vulnerabilities of their banking system to interest rate shock and exchange rate shocks.

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

The resulting lower government revenue triggered by the sharp drop in hydrocarbon price would
have a sizeable impact on the solvency and liquidity of the banking sector. This will mainly be driven
by an increase in government arrears and a decline in outstanding deposits that will tend to
destabilize more liquidity ratios for commercial banks with capital from the CEMAC.
4.
Equatorial Guinea performs relatively better than the CEMAC as a whole in terms of
both resilience to credit and liquidity shocks. A credit quality shock to Equatorial Guinea’s banking
system leads the percentage of banks satisfying the solvency ratio requirements unchanged at
80 percent, as opposed to CEMAC region for which the same shock reduces the number of banks
respecting the solvency prudential standard to only 61 percent from an initial 82 percent of banks. In
the same vein, after a 25 percent withdrawal in deposits, only 60 percent of banks still satisfy liquidity
requirements, from the original 100 percent. Equatorial Guinea’s performance remains, however,
better than that of the CEMAC region, for which the percentage of banks meeting the liquidity
requirements drops to 27 percent from the 82 percent prior to the shock.
Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
5.
The Task Force against Money Laundering in Central Africa (GABAC)2 has made efforts
to be in a position to carry out its core functions. However, the process to become a Financial
Action Task Force (FATF)-style regional body (FSRB), is currently frozen because of delays in the
GABAC’s adoption of procedures for transparent financial management. All CEMAC countries face
major money laundering and terrorism financing risks, but the implementation of effective AML/CFT
policies remains a challenge as authorities face structural and sectoral challenges that are conducive
to money laundering operations.3
6.
Progress in the implementation of all CEMAC’s AML/CFT arrangements has varied
across the CEMAC and has not been accompanied by an effective use of its tools. The FSAP
determined that Equatorial Guinea is one of the two countries with national financial intelligence
units (NFIUs) not in operation. The expressed commitments of authorities in the sub-region to
strengthening of governance have not translated into an efficient use of AML/CFT tools. In addition,
as regards terrorism financing, the arrangements for freezing terrorist assets, envisaged by the
CEMAC regulations, are not implemented, and are not included in the states’ strategies against
terrorism.
7.
The implementation of AML/CFT measures is weak at all the regulated institutions in
the financial and nonfinancial sectors, and their supervision by the COBAC is limited. This lack
of implementation is due to limited incentives provided by regional and national authorities, as well
as restrained dissemination of information on the standards and the nature and scope of the
obligations for vigilance. The supervision of compliance with AML/CFT measures by the COBAC
2

A predominance of informality and the use of cash in the economy, unreliability of identification documents and
lack of register computerization, highly porous borders, and recycling of dirty money in the real estate, banking, funds
transfers, manual foreign exchange operations, microfinance, and tontine sectors.
3

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

remains inappropriate at both the regional and national levels. Audits undertaken by the COBAC are
limited in terms of number, frequency, and depth due to limited human resources. Besides, these
audits do not involve any penalties. On a national scale, various authorities have powers shared with
the regional supervisors in the procedures of licensing and appointing executives that is not always
clearly spelled out or understood. In the nonfinancial sector, the authorities are generally unaware of
the entire legal framework and of their pertinent tasks. Therefore, no supervisory action has been
taken.
Policy lessons from the FSAP
8.
Equatorial Guinea should strive to have a more diversified financial sector and improve
access to financial services. A number of reforms should be implemented. These include those
aimed at removing the constraints mentioned by potential users, e.g., the relatively high minimum
deposit requirements compared with income, the cost of services, and the distance from the nearest
bank branch. In particular, the development of the MFI sector could make the financial sector more
suited economic development needs. Equatorial Guinea’s authorities should take advantage of its
relatively high mobile telephone penetration (68 percent) to promote and develop the use of mobile
banking.
9.
The results of the stress test imply the necessity for a greater attention to the rise in
NPLs in the Equatorial Guinea’s banking sector. Given that credit risk has been identified as the
most important risk in the CEMAC, a degradation of convergence criteria as a result of the sharp drop
in oil price could have serious impact on the solvency of banks, through various potential channels
both domestic (e.g., construction sector) and regional (e.g., spillover from parent company of the
banks).4
10.
On the implementation of AML/CFT issues, urgent action should be taken to accelerate
progress to bring Equatorial Guinea’s NFIU into operation. The efforts should be accompanied by
an increase in the appropriate financial, technical, and human resources and the capacities of national
supervisors of the financial and nonfinancial sectors, for gradual implementation of all aspects of
disciplinary power, targeting the riskiest activities (e.g., funds transfers, foreign exchange operations,
real estate transactions, etc.).
11.
Deeper understanding of AML/CFT regulations by both authorities and the sectors
concerned should be fostered through a clearly spelled out of AML/CFT policies at the national
level. The FSAP recommends the drafting of a national AML/CFT policy and an AML/CFT prosecution
policy documents by an appointed inter ministerial committee. While the former document will
analyze the principal risks faced by each regulated institution and each activity, the latter will explain
AML/CFT prosecution policy on the principal predicate offenses.

Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR): Not Applicable
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the
Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.

Safeguard Assessments: The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional
central bank of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). As with
other regional central banks, the BEAC is subject to a safeguards assessment every four
years. The quadrennial assessment in 2013 occurred against the backdrop of significant
changes at the BEAC to address governance challenges and control failures that emerged in
2009 and led to close engagement in the period after through IMF monitoring of safeguards
“rolling measures.” The BEAC also embarked on a reform and modernization plan (RMP) to
strengthen controls. The 2013 assessment concluded that, despite some progress made by
the BEAC in reinforcing its safeguards framework, further actions were needed to restore
sound governance and control fully, including through amendments to the BEAC charter and
commitment to achieve the RMP. The assessment also recommended maintaining the
annual monitoring visits to the BEAC to follow up on progress on implementing the
safeguards rolling measures and advancing work on the BEAC’s own reform plan in the
context of new program requests and reviews of CEMAC countries. Consistent with this
engagement, a safeguards staff visit to the BEAC was conducted in April 2015. Staff
concluded that although the BEAC continues to maintain a strong commitment to complete
its reform plan, slippages have occurred and the timeframe of the RMP has been revised.
Progress on implementing the safeguards rolling measures has been mixed, and priority
recommendations on amendments to the BEAC charter and adoption of an internationally
recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS) have been delayed. The BEAC has indicated
a need for IMF technical assistance to advance the above recommendations, and steps on
prompt delivery of this input have been initiated. Strong actions and close coordination with
member states to gain consensus will be needed in the period ahead for the BEAC to
conclude its reforms and the outstanding safeguards recommendations. Progress on
implementation of the latter will remain subject to annual monitoring by the IMF, as a
condition to continuing new program requests and reviews of CEMAC member countries.
Exchange System: The regional currency is the CFA franc, which has been pegged to the
euro at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro, since the euro was introduced in 1999.
Equatorial Guinea has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultations: Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by
the Executive Board on April 30, 2014, on lapse-of-time basis.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
EQUATORIAL GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 10, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (continued)
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. National
accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of payments data are all deficient in quality, timing,
and coverage. The newly established National Institute of Statistics (INEGE) is not fully operational,
although noteworthy progress has been made since its creation last year.
Poor centralization of information between the island and continental regions is also an issue.
National Accounts: National accounts are constructed by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) as
part of their regular Monetary Programming exercise. They are based largely on estimates, with only
limited survey information except for the hydrocarbon sector and other primary sector exporters. The
current base year is 1985 and the methodology used is the System of National Accounts, 1968 (SNA68).
Progress has been made by the National Statistics Institute (INEGE) toward the establishment of a new
base year for national accounts (2006), with the assistance of the World Bank, AFRISTAT, and AFRITAC
Central (AFC), using the SNA93 methodology. New estimates for the period 2007–12 have been
prepared (but not yet validated), and preliminary estimates for 2013–14 are being finalized. Data sources
need to be improved for more reliable and comprehensive GDP estimates. The population census, a
household survey, an employment survey, and an agricultural survey, initially planned for 2011, are now
scheduled for 2016. An enterprise census is underway.
Price statistics: Compilation of the official CPI resumed in January 2009, with data collected in five major
cities. However, a number of deficiencies remain, including outdated weights and composition of the
basket of goods and services, and gaps in the time series corresponding to the period for which data
was not collected (2008). Imputations for missing data do not always reflect underlying trends.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide budget execution data to the Fund, but these
are limited in detail (with, for example, a poor delineation between capital and current spending and no
functional classification) and are not fully reconciled with the monetary accounts. The fiscal data are not
subject to any internal process of verification because weak audit capability. The authorities have yet to
appoint additional residential advisors for public finance, budgeting, and accounting following advice
from the Fiscal Affairs Department. Gains in transparency were made temporarily through the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative process, with a reconciliation report posted on the World Bank website
in March 2010 that included hydrocarbon revenue data and information on state owned oil companies,
but no subsequent information has been published.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des États de l’Afrique
Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the format of the standardized report forms (SRFs). The depository
corporation survey does not include data from deposit-taking microfinance institutions. It is hoped to
include data in the future on interest rates offered by the financial institutions sector to non-financial
entities on deposits and loans.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

Balance of payments: The National Directorate of the Bank of Central African States is responsible
for the compilation of the balance of payments statistics of Equatorial Guinea. The BEAC produces
balance of payments data for its monetary programming exercise, but these largely rely on
estimations. Trade transactions processing and data compilation are complicated by the fact that
customs authorities do not use a computerized system. For example, no data on merchandise imports
are made available. The balance of payments statistics mission of March 2013 noted the severe
capacity constraints at the National Directorate and the need for staff training as well as the
improvement of institutional arrangements in the country to support the production of external
sector statistics.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Equatorial Guinea does not participate in the
GDDS.

Equatorial Guinea has not yet received a mission
to produce the data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (data ROSC).

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Real sector statistics are reported to STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
with a long lag and are limited to GDP (without breakdown by sector or expenditure category), and
exports, and imports. The authorities agreed to submit CPI data for the IFS publication and STA is
communicating with the authorities regarding the procedure. The BEAC reports monetary, interest
rates, and exchange rate statistics for publication in the IFS, but delays are persistent (currently the lag
is about three months). Due to capacity constraints, balance of payments data are not submitted to
STA for publication in the IFS or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The latest year for which
balance of payments data are available is 1996. Equatorial Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA
for publication in the IFS or the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Masato Miyazaki

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund—
African Department

Equatorial Guinea’s public sector debt rose from 8 percent of GDP in 2013 to 12 percent
in 2014, as fiscal needs required the use of central bank financing for the first time in
recent history. The remainder of public debt is external, largely comprised of drawing upon
a credit line with the Exim Bank of China. Based on staff’s projections, fiscal adjustment
and the use of fiscal buffers underpin a sustainable increase in public debt over the
medium term to around 17 percent of GDP in 2020. Under an adverse scenario where the
primary balance is held constant after 2015, public debt would reach 35 percent of GDP.

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

1.
Equatorial Guinea’s public sector debt is low. At end-2014, gross public sector debt
amounted to US$1.7 billion (12 percent of GDP), up from US$1.4 billion (7.9 percent of GDP) at
end 2013. The rise in debt level is due to an increase in domestic-currency denominated debt through
drawing of statutory advances from the regional central bank, the BEAC for deficit financing. The use
of the BEAC overdraft amounted to CFAF 369 billion, or approximately 4.8 percent of 2014 GDP.1 The
bulk of Equatorial Guinea’s public sector debt remains external, all of which with medium- to longterm maturities. External debt declined in 2014 to US$1.0 billion due to repayment of existing debt.
Nearly all of this external debt is comprised of Equatorial Guinea’s US$2 billion credit line contracted
with the Exim Bank of China, used to finance infrastructure projects linked to the national
development plan.
2.
Public debt is expected to remain
sustainable over the medium term. Staff’s baseline
projections anticipate fiscal deficits falling over time,
financed by drawing on externally-held deposits and
limited new external debt accumulation based on
pending credit lines averaging 2.2 percent of GDP per
year. Under these assumptions, the public debt-toGDP ratio is projected to increase to 16.6 percent of
GDP. Under the standard shock scenario applying

BEAC caps statutory advances at [20] percent of revenues of the preceding fiscal year. The annual rate of interest on
central bank financing is equivalent to the policy rate, or 2.95 percent (as at end May 2015).

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
July 20, 2015
On behalf of my Equatorial Guinean authorities, I would like to thank staff for the fruitful
dialogue during the 2015 Article IV consultation discussions in Malabo. I also thank
management for the continued support to the authorities’ development efforts.
Over the past decade, Equatorial Guinea has taken advantage of high oil prices and considerable
hydrocarbon production, to undertake an ambitious program of development and structural
transformation, under its National Development Plan
(NDP), Horizonte 2020. In particular, they developed basic infrastructure all over the country,
including housing, roads, airports, ports and the modernization and extension of electricity and
water facilities. The latter, especially, has greatly facilitated access by the inhabitants to potable
water and electricity, and helped to improve the quality of life of the population.
However, the recent large fall in oil prices has caused a sharp decline in revenues, and adversely
affected the pace of implementation of the development program as well as the economy overall.
As a result, the authorities have adjusted their development program, and made it less ambitious.
They have also revised the 2015 Budget to reduce current and capital spending, and increase
non-hydrocarbon revenues. The medium-term fiscal framework targets further reduction in
spending, as the first phase of the development program comes to an end. My authorities agree
with staff that the new environment has brought new challenges that require attention in order to
ensure that Equatorial Guinea maintains a sustainable growth.
Recent Economic Developments
Real GDP in 2014 is estimated to have declined by 0.3 percent, mainly due to decline in
hydrocarbon production. Growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector was weak as activity in the
construction sector declined. For 2015, with the full impact of the fall
in oil prices, the continued decline in the hydrocarbon sector and a lower public investment, real
GDP is projected to contract by about 9 percent, and would remain negative over the medium
term. However, the authorities expect that the implementation of the second phase of the
development program with emphasis on the non-hydrocarbon sector and an expanding private
sector in the areas of transportation, trade and tourism will help to sustain growth in these
sectors, and contain the fall in total output. Inflation was 4.3 percent in 2014 due to higher food
prices, but is expected to come down to 3.5 percent in 2015.
The fiscal deficit was reduced to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2014, and is expected to be reduced further
to less than 5 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting the fiscal adjustment efforts of the authorities.
However, as noted by staff there remains some cash flow management challenges which are being
addressed by the authorities. Public sector debt remains low at 12 percent of GDP.
The external current account deficit increased to 10 percent of GDP in 2014 mainly due to
developments in the hydrocarbon sector and imports related to the public investment program.
For 2015, the authorities expect the current account deficit to be brought down to 7 percent of
GDP with further improvements over the medium term. The level of international reserves
remains comfortable at about 8 months of imports.

Outlook and Policies
The Equatorial authorities recognize that the economy is facing major challenges going forward
due to the sharp decline in oil prices as well as the decline in production. They expect that the
large infrastructure investments that they have undertaken in the past years will attract
investments both domestic and foreign investors. They are also taking steps to improve the
business climate and increase human capital. They expect that these measures will contribute to
maintain growth over the medium- to long-term.
Fiscal Policy
The 2015 Budget has been prepared with the conservative assumption of an oil price of US $40
per barrel. The investment budget has also been reduced by about 57 percent and caps spending
based on projected hydrocarbon revenues. The authorities recognize that there are weaknesses in
public finance management. However, they are taking steps to strengthen the National Payments
Committee (NPC) and expect improvements in this area through the imposition of strict cash
management in line with the budget. For the medium term, the authorities will take steps to
reduce investment spending further and to build financial buffers. They are also giving thoughts
to a fiscal rule as recommended by staff, and will request Fund technical Assistance in its design.
On oil subsidies, the authorities agree with staff that the currently low oil prices provide an
opportunity to phase out fuel subsidies to consumers.
For the medium term, and recognizing the need to strengthen fiscal management, the authorities
have prepared a fiscal framework which is aimed at assessing fiscal sustainability risks and
providing an eventual basis for medium-term budgeting anchored on a non-oil primary balance.
The framework also incorporates several fiscal measures adopted earlier by decree. The
authorities are also taking steps to strengthen tax administration, tighten the administrations of
ad-hoc customs duty exemptions, reduce tax evasion and enhance tax compliance. Measures also
include a revision of subsidies to government agencies as well as the introduction of rentals and
charges on government property. There will also be an effort to curb current spending through
lower personnel costs by reducing non-salary benefits and downsizing. It is expected that the
measures envisaged will help to bring the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2016 and
much lower over the medium term.
Financial Sector
Equatorial Guinea’s financial sector is well-capitalized, liquid and resilient to macroeconomic
shocks. Lately, with the slowing down of economic activity, there has been an increase in credit
growth and a weakening of asset quality. However, the authorities do not view this as posing a
risk to the financial sector, as it is well capitalized and profitable. Moreover, the authorities view
the increase in NPLs as temporary and will be resolved with the clearing of government
obligations. Going forward, they will continue efforts to deepen the sector, and to make
Equatorial Guinea a regional financial hub.
Structural and Business Enhancing Reforms
The authorities will continue their efforts to diversify the economy and make it less dependent on
the hydrocarbon sector. In this regard, they are taking steps to improve the business climate and
remove structural bottlenecks. The large infrastructure investments go in this direction, in

3

particular, the construction of roads, harbors and airports. Improvements made in electricity and
water supply should also help. The authorities are now taking steps to create a conducive
environment for the development of the private sector and a better labor force. In this regard,
they are negotiating with the World Bank a Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) agreement
to improve the business climate and to develop an investment promotion agency. They have also
taken steps to increase transparency and accountability by establishing a court of audit and an
investment promotion agency. As regards human capital, the authorities are funding scholarships
for foreign studies, and developing schools and technical training, among others. They expect
that these measures will help Equatorial Guinea to return to a strong and more sustainable
growth path over the medium- to long-term.
The authorities have also taken note of staff’s recommendations regarding weaknesses in
statistical data and are committed to take necessary measures to improve the compilation as well
as the dissemination of statistics. In this regard, they would welcome additional technical
assistance from the Fund, in particular, in developing the capacity to participate in the GDDS.
Conclusion
Equatorial Guinea has made important progress in the development of the country. The decline
of the hydrocarbon sector has brought in new challenges which the authorities are determined to
address. In this regard, they look forward to continued technical assistance and advice from the
Fund whose assistance has always been invaluable.
