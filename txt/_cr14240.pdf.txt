STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 19, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Tonga’s economy is rebounding, partially owing to a recovery in agricultural
exports. The outlook for tourism is also improving. The reconstruction from a recent cyclone
is expected to lead to both a temporary boost to growth and additional financing needs.
Risks to the inflation outlook and the external position are low.
Fiscal Policy: The projected fiscal cost relating to the cyclone will be largely met by
confirmed funding mainly from donor agencies. In the near term, the authorities should
focus on reconstruction activities, while a medium-term fiscal strategy should aim at
gradually stabilizing and then reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio, in order to improve Tonga’s
moderate risk of debt distress. This will require careful execution of investments related to
the 2019 South Pacific Games.
Monetary Policy: The deleveraging cycle of the Tongan banks appears to be ending, and
thus National Reserve Bank of Tonga should prepare to gradually withdraw liquidity and
tighten monetary conditions once the current signs of a recovery of credit growth are
confirmed. The authorities plan to lower the cost of credit through supportive credit policies,
including by commercializing the Tonga Development Bank. The successful implementation
of such plan requires sound safeguards, including a robust governance structure and firm
risk management and accountability frameworks.
Structural Policy: Structural reforms to facilitate the functioning of credit markets need to
be implemented with renewed vigor. The authorities’ intention to gradually phase out
existing ad hoc tax incentives is well placed. The promotion of foreign direct investments
should focus on business-enabling structural reforms, while the use of tax incentives should
be minimized and well targeted.

THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION
1.
Tonga’s economy is rebounding supported by a recovery in agriculture and other
sectors. The outlook for tourism is also improving. After slowing to 0-1 percent in FY2012/13 (fiscal
year ends on June 30), real GDP growth is expected to recover to 1½ percent in FY2013/14, and
further to 3½ percent in FY2014/15. The damage caused by the January 2014 Cyclone Ian is expected
to reduce growth by about ¾ percent in FY2013/14, but reconstruction activities would boost
growth by about 1½ percentage points of GDP in FY2014/15 (Box 1 and Figure 2). Thereafter, growth
is expected to gradually converge to the historical trend of 1¾ percent, driven by remittances and
tourism receipts, as well as credit growth.
2.
Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside. Spillovers from a protracted
period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies or in China could adversely impact
Tonga, notably through its interconnectedness with Australia and New Zealand. On the domestic
side, if slippages occur in critical reforms, e.g., owing to the election in late 2014, or a cost overrun
takes place in preparation for the 2019 South Pacific Games (hereinafter “the Games”), they may
hamper macroeconomic stability. The greater frequency of natural disasters also presents significant
risks.
3.
Inflation remains significantly below the NRBT’s reference range (6−8 percent).
Headline CPI inflation has largely fluctuated between -1 and 2 percent since mid-2012, reflecting low
global food prices, stable oil prices, and weak domestic demand. Despite the projected further
decline in commodity prices, staff expects base effects (from the current low levels) and expectation
inertia to incrementally raise inflation to 4-5 percent toward FY2018/19, with demand effects relating
to the preparation for the Games also adding pressures (Box 2).
4.
There are no imminent risks to the external balance. Increases in foreign grants and weak
imports have caused international reserves to increase about threefold since 2008—to about
8 months of imports estimated for FY2012/13. In FY2013/14 and 2014/15, the cyclone’s impact is
expected to ‘reduce’ the current account deficit by about 1¾ percent of GDP in cumulative terms,
with disaster-related grants and insurance payouts more than offsetting increases in imports. In the
medium term, the cyclical recovery of imports—boosted further by the Games—and lower levels of
foreign grants would decrease international reserves to 7 months of imports by FY2018/19. The real
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals (Box 3).

Authorities’ Views
5.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff that the economy is rebounding. However,
they remained cautious about the extent to which the recovery builds on the underlying strength of
the economy. The authorities noted that Tonga’s economic growth should not continue to be driven
by disaster-related or externally funded project cycles, and thus complacency is unwarranted. The
authorities expected inflation to remain subdued through the medium term. They noted that
inflation in Tonga tends to be strongly influenced by commodity prices, which are expected to
decline over the medium term, and the inflation’s link to the output gap is weak.

COPING WITH EXTRA FINANCING NEEDS
Reconstruction spending is a near-term priority, while in the medium term, the authorities should aim
to gradually reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. Tonga’s exposure to natural disasters, as well as the
country’s development needs, require careful management of fiscal space.

A. Background
6.
Reconstruction from Cyclone
Ian is expected to weaken the fiscal
position in the coming years. The
initial damage assessment estimated
property damage of about 10 percent
of GDP and a reduction of the overall
fiscal balance by 1.5 percentage points
of GDP, leading to a deficit of
0.6 percent of GDP in FY2013/14
(Figure 3). The impact of the cyclone is
expected to linger through FY2014/15,
raising the overall deficit by
1 percentage point—to 0.7percent of
GDP.

7.
The repayment of a large external loan (equivalent to about 15 percent of GDP)
provided by a bilateral donor in 2007 appears to have been waived pending renegotiation of
the terms. The loan was provided to support reconstruction of Nuku’alofa’s central business district,
after it was destroyed by a civil unrest in 2006. The 5 year grace period was set to expire in
September 2013.

B. Staff Views
8.
The projected fiscal cost related to the cyclone (7 percent of GDP; about 60 million
pa’anga) will be largely met by confirmed funding mainly from donor agencies. They consist of
grants (about 70 percent), loans (about 20 percent), and holdings of disaster trust funds (about
10 percent). In case a gap emerges in cyclone reconstruction financing, the authorities should seek to
reallocate fiscal resources, for example, by reprioritizing other spending. Consideration can then be
given to domestic bond financing. While government bonds carry relatively high interest costs, there
is some space for a cautious use of domestic bonds for high-priority spending.1
9.
For FY2014/15, the authorities should focus on accommodating the financing needs of
reconstruction from the cyclone. Given the expected increase in the fiscal deficit owing to the
cyclone (about 1 percent), the authorities should maintain a sound position in the overall balance
excluding cyclone-related spending. Staff projects a small surplus for the non-cyclone overall balance
1

The staff’s illustrative analysis shows that a 25 million pa’anga increase in outstanding government bonds in the
medium term would raise interest costs by 0.2 percentage points of GDP, assuming an interest rate of 5½ percent.

this fiscal year, which would provide some additional flexibility to meet priority expenditures. The
authorities appropriately intend to save the waived repayments for the 2007 external loan to the
extent possible. For fiscal and debt-management clarity, the new terms of the repayment should be
defined as soon as possible.

10.
The medium-term fiscal strategy should aim at gradually stabilizing and then reducing
the risk of debt distress, anchoring policy by the debt-to-GDP ratio. Given the country’s
exposure to natural disasters, Tonga also needs to build policy buffers, including by maintaining
prudent levels of indebtedness. To this end, the authorities should aim at gradually increasing the
primary fiscal surplus to about 1 percent of GDP (average; over the longer-term), which in the staff’s
analysis, would be consistent with stabilizing external debt at about 30−35 percent of GDP. Wage
restraint—in line with the authorities’ target—and revenue reform (e.g., broadening the consumption
tax base2) are important to improve the fiscal position, while at the same time, preserving capital
expenditures and maintaining a cash cushion.3 This will contribute to keeping the risk of debt distress
at a moderate level in the medium term, and reducing it to low in the long run. In this context, the
authorities should carefully manage fiscal costs associated with hosting the 2019 South Pacific
Games. In line with their current plans, focus should be put on avoiding cost overruns and debtcreating financing.

C. Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities’ FY2014/15 budget strategy continues to anchor the fiscal position to
the operating cash balance and will contain the growth of nonpriority expenditure. The
authorities intend to implement the ‘Amended No New Loan Policy’ as follows: no external
commercial borrowing, cautious use of concessional loans only in limited cases (e.g. budget support),
and restricting domestic debt issuance in principle to refinancing.
12.
In terms of their response to the cyclone, the authorities intend to first indentify all
available external grants and concessional loans and then adjust spending to this level. If there
is a financing gap, the authorities intend to rephase cyclone spending or reprioritize other spending
before seeking other options.
13.
The authorities took note of the need for prudent management of the South Pacific
Games. They are mindful of the fiscal risks that can arise from a potential cost overrun and are
seeking lower-cost options to meet facility requirements. They are not considering debt-creating
funding of the preparation for the Games.
14.
The authorities expected the revenue-to-GDP ratio to increase over time—including
from new income sources (e.g. the mineral tax). While acknowledging political challenges, the
authorities reaffirmed their intention to incrementally lower the wage bill from 50 percent (as of now)
to 45 percent of recurrent spending.

2

Zero rating and exemptions in consumption tax and excises are estimated to result in about 4 percent of GDP loss in
tax revenues.
3

Staff projects that the cash cushion will gradually increase to 2 months of recurrent spending (from the current level
of 1 month) over the medium term.

REINVIGORATING FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION
The deleveraging cycle of Tongan banks appears to be coming to an end.

A. Background
15.
The deleveraging cycle of the Tongan banks appears to be ending. Bank lending to
households increased by 2.2 percent in February 2014 despite the continuation of nonperforming
loan (NPL) charge-offs, and significant substitution to lending by nonbanks, including retirement
funds and microfinance institutions. Asset quality indicators have also substantially improved, for
example with the ratio of NPL expenses to total loans falling well below the average levels prior to
the global financial crisis. However, business lending continues to decline reflecting still stagnant new
lending and continued charge-offs.
16.
During the last few years, the NRBT has maintained an accommodative monetary
stance. In view of a lower risk of inflation, comfortable international reserves, and a credit squeeze,
the focus was placed on maintaining sufficient levels of liquidity.

B. Staff Views
17.

A strategy to reinvigorate financial intermediation at present will require:



Careful timing of the withdrawal of the monetary impulse. The NRBT should prepare to
gradually withdraw liquidity and tighten monetary policy once current signs about the
imminent turn of the credit cycle are confirmed. This could be done by gradually increasing
reserve requirement ratio to the levels prior to the global financial crisis. A timely reduction
of excess liquidity will help safeguard financial stability, but a premature withdrawal should
be avoided as it may hurt the nascent recovery. There is a need to review the NRBT’s inflation
reference range given the recent low rates of inflation, and the constraints posed by NRBT’s
commitment to a basket peg of the pa’anga’s exchange rate.



Judicious use of supportive credit policies. To support growth and access to finance, the
authorities plan to commercialize the Tonga Development Bank (TDB),4 including through
identifying potential private partners. In this process, proper safeguards against fiscal and
governance risks (e.g., a sound risk management and accountability framework) should be
put in place, including through the revision of Tonga Development Bank bill and, ideally,
continued partnership with the multilateral institutions. In this regard, a thorough peer review
of the bill would be useful. The recent increase in credit extended by retirement funds and
microfinance institutions presents low risk to financial stability, and the authorities’ plan—
based on the IMF’s recent technical assistance— to expand the NRBT’s regulatory mandate
to include nonbank financial intermediaries is welcome. Staff takes note of the authorities’
goal to lower the cost of credit through competition and expanded policy lending. A
safeguard should be carefully crafted to advance the authorities’ plans for new policy options,
for example, a risk sharing facility or policy lending schemes.

4

The plan envisages making TDB to undertake the full range of commercial banking activities (e.g. deposit and
foreign exchange services), which is expected to result in significant expansion of its lending book. Currently TDB
finances its operation mainly by wholesale borrowing. It has so far not engaged in many activities that are allowed
under its banking license, to focus its limited resources on public policy mandates.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA



Continued advances in financial reform. Structural reforms to address bottlenecks in credit
information and creditor rights (e.g., receivership bill, improved credit bureau, and land
registry reform) should continue to help promote financial development and strengthen the
effectiveness of monetary policy. If these reforms become stalled, the cost of credit will
remain structurally high, and the role of the financial sector in supporting private sector
development constrained.

18.
The current basket peg of the exchange rate has served the country well as a nominal
anchor. Despite limited capital mobility, pegging the pa’anga’s exchange rate to a currency basket of
its main trading partners has constrained NRBT’s ability to influence domestic monetary conditions.

C. Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities do not intend to tighten monetary policy at this time. While agreeing
that excess liquidity needs to be reduced for the NRBT to regain influence on market interest rates,
the authorities would like to avoid an increase in interest rates, which could dampen the nascent
economic recovery. The authorities also noted that the recent recovery in credit growth resulted
largely from lending to a few public enterprises and may, therefore, not be sustainable.
20.
The authorities intend to use supportive credit policy instruments to help lower the
cost of credit. In their view, Tonga’s high interest spread results from weak competition and high
staffing costs, rather than structural impediments. The authorities expected the imminent operation
of a new bank to help to enhance competition.
21.
While recognizing the need for safeguards, the authorities will expedite the
commercialization of the TDB. They noted that the revised TDB bill will address safeguarding
concerns, for example, by putting in place a good governance framework, and by subjecting the TDB
to the NRBT’s prudential regulation and supervision. The authorities are also considering more
options for channeling excess liquidity to support lending to priority business sectors and start-ups,
building on their recent experience in the pilot policy lending schemes to support agriculture, fishery,
and manufacturing.

REVERSING THE TREND OF SLOWER GROWTH
Longer-term structural policies should focus on identifying and strengthening engines of growth.

A. Background
22.
Tonga’s efforts to develop the private sector are ongoing. Tonga’s geographical
remoteness and weak infrastructure make a breakthrough in tourism challenging, as evidenced by
the difficulties in finding a private partner for the International Dateline Hotel, which has been in
receivership for years. Nonetheless, the authorities aim to develop tourism as the key engine of
growth. While progress since last year has been limited, the authorities put together a
comprehensive road map for tourism development, with extensive consultation with the private
sector. Tonga’s economy has not been able to create sufficient jobs, particularly for the youth. While
Tonga’s headline unemployment rate is very low (1¾ percent), this is largely a result of low labor
force participation, high levels of emigration, and a large share of subsistence workers.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

B. Staff Views
23.
A robust and sustainable growth model would require identifying and strengthening
engines of growth. Given Tonga’s remoteness, a growth model relying mainly on exports of goods
would have limits. Tonga’s small domestic market limits opportunities for import substitution. Tonga
should thus significantly strengthen services exports. It should also continue to participate in
seasonal worker programs, providing training as needed, and maximizing opportunities that might
arise from the new fiber-optic-cable-connection projects, for example, through call centers or access
to on-line education. The link between remittance flows and domestic investment should also be
strengthened, e.g., through specialized financial products.
24.
The authorities intend to promote tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. Continued
strengthening of the business environment, including through judicious deregulation, and
confidence building through sound macroeconomic policies are welcome. These efforts are very
important particularly in view of the challenges posed by Tonga’s geographic remoteness and
smallness. Ongoing consultations with the private sector through sector growth committees are
noteworthy. Strengthened policy coordination, too, is beginning to improve sentiment and deliver
results, such as a fumigation facility at the main port.
25.
The promotion of foreign direct investments (FDI) should focus on business-enabling
structural reforms, while the use of tax incentives should be minimized and well targeted.
Introduction of new incentives could be linked to retiring existing incentives that are ad hoc and
ineffective. A periodic review of investment incentives based on measurable outcomes would be
useful in this regard. A robust revenue reform to broaden the tax base should also help in creating
fiscal space toward this end. The staff notes the authorities’ intention to find a private partner for the
International Dateline Hotel.
26.
Efforts should continue for further enhancing public sector performance. As in most
microstates, the contribution of the public sector to the economy will remain relatively large.
Enhancing public sector performance is thus a perennial priority. A robust public spending
framework can also buttress a private sector-led growth strategy by addressing bottlenecks (e.g.
infrastructure and education). The authorities’ intention to continue civil service reform is welcome,
given ample scope for efficiency gains in human resource management. Gradual but continued
progress in the integration of corporate planning and budgeting is noted, and the authorities should
further enhance communication with and buy-ins of stakeholders. The authorities’ intention to
finalize a public financial management road map is welcome. Efforts should continue to improve
statistical data—to better enable business decisions, as well as policy making—by strengthening
resources.

C. Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities noted that they intend to promote tourism, agriculture, and fishery
sectors, while recognizing the potential of other sectors. The authorities underscored their
intention to carefully calibrate the right balance between the need to entice priority FDI projects and
to protect the revenue base. They underscored that the new tourism roadmap takes an ‘integrated
approach’—combining rules-based, targeted tax incentives and regulatory reforms. They are also
considering a thorough review of existing tax exemptions and a gradual phasing out of ad-hoc
exemptions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Tonga’s economy is rebounding, in part because of a recovery in agricultural exports.
Despite structural challenges, the tourism outlook is also gradually improving. The reconstruction
from a recent cyclone and the preparations for the 2019 South Pacific Games are expected to lead to
both additional financing needs and a temporary boost to growth. Risks to the inflation outlook and
the external position are low.
29.
The short-term priority is to facilitate reconstruction spending. The projected fiscal cost
relating to the cyclone will be broadly met by confirmed funding mainly from donor agencies. In the
near term, the authorities should focus on accommodating the financing needs caused by the
cyclone. Given the expected increase in the fiscal deficit owing to the cyclone, the authorities should
maintain a sound position in the overall balance excluding cyclone effects.
30.
The medium-term fiscal strategy should aim at gradually stabilizing and then reducing
Tonga’s risk of debt distress, anchoring policy by the debt-to-GDP ratio. With a large exposure
to natural disasters, Tonga must rebuild fiscal buffers, including by maintaining a prudent level of
public debt. To this end, the authorities should aim at gradually increasing the primary fiscal surplus
to stabilize the debt ratio in the medium term, and reducing it thereafter. Wage restraint and
revenue reform will be needed to accomplish this.
31.
The deleveraging cycle of the Tongan banks appears to be ending. Thus the NRBT
should prepare itself to gradually withdraw liquidity and tighten monetary conditions once current
signs of credit growth are confirmed. The authorities plan to lower the cost of credit through
supportive credit policies, including by commercializing the TDB. Robust safeguards should be put in
place to implement these plans in a sustainable way.
32.
Given Tonga’s remoteness, a growth model relying mainly on exports of goods could
have limits. At the same time, Tonga’s small domestic market narrows opportunities for import
substitution. Tonga should thus significantly strengthen services exports. It should also continue to
participate in seasonal worker programs, providing training as needed, and maximize opportunities
from the new fiber-optic-cable-connection projects. The link between remittance flows and domestic
investment should also be strengthened, e.g., through specialized financial products. The authorities
intend to promote tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. Continued strengthening of the business
environment and confidence building are welcome, in view of challenges from Tonga’s remoteness
and smallness.
33.
The promotion of FDI should focus on business-enabling structural reforms, while the
use of tax incentives should be minimized and well targeted. Introduction of new incentives
could be linked to retiring existing incentives that are ad hoc and ineffective. A periodic review of
investment incentives based on measurable outcomes would be useful. A robust revenue reform to
broaden the tax base should also help in creating fiscal space toward this end.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga be held on the 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. The Macroeconomic Impact of the Cyclone 1
In January 2014, a category 4 cyclone hit the Ha’apai island group in the northeast of Tonga; this
island group’s annual contribution to national output is about 6 percent. Cyclone Ian affected
around 5,000 residents and destroyed or damaged almost 1,000 houses and buildings.
The Tongan authorities and development partners provided swift emergency assistance and
designed a Cyclone Response Plan to address the short-term needs of the affected population.
The total damage to the Tongan economy is estimated to amount to about 10 percent of GDP.
Losses and damages were concentrated in housing, but the agriculture, hospitality, power,
manufacturing, and education sectors were also heavily affected. Reconstruction will mostly take
place in FY2014/15.
With the assistance of the World Bank, the
government intends to build 550
permanent houses and support the repair
of 400 damaged houses, with total
construction costs amounting
to 20 million pa’anga (2.5 percent of GDP).
Rebuilding infrastructure, providing
sanitation facilities, and restoring the
livelihoods of affected communities will
require additional resources. The cyclone
is expected have a significant impact on
the economy.

Notes: 1/ Difference between pre- and post-cyclone baseline GDP Forecasts.



Growth: The staff estimates that Cyclone Ian has shaved ¾ percent off FY2013/14 GDP (relative
to the pre-cyclone baseline forecast). This mainly reflects output losses in agriculture,
manufacturing, tourism and imputed rents from housing. Reconstruction activities in the
aftermath of the cyclone are expected to boost GDP by 0.4 percent in FY2014 (relative to the
same baseline).



Inflation: The cyclone is not projected to affect official inflation data. The official inflation
statistics only capture price developments on the main island and spillover effects from a
redirection of food products, additional imports, and wage pressures in construction—based
on historical experience—are likely negligible.



Balance of payments: Disaster-related grants and insurance payouts are expected to more than
offset increases in imports, thus improving the current account balance in FY2013/14 by
2 percentage points of GDP. During the peak of the reconstruction phase in FY2014/15 the
effect of increased imports of construction materials is projected to dominate, worsening the
current account balance by ¼ percentage point of GDP.

Tonga will host the sixteenth Pacific Games in Nukuʻalofa in August 2019. The Games are held every
4 years with the participation of 22 nations in the South Pacific region. The Games will be operated
by the Pacific Games Organizing Committee, a special purpose entity. Tonga plans to upgrade the
existing sports facilities and renovate several school facilities in the Games village to accommodate
the sports teams.
The authorities’ preliminary projected expenditure for hosting the Games is US$70 million, which
represents about 15 percent of current nominal GDP and 50 percent of general government revenue.
The authorities currently envisage covering the operating cost (US$20 million) with the Games
revenue, and the capital cost (US$50 million) with donations and franchises. With nondebt financing
covering the entire costs, the authorities’ plan is fiscally prudent. When followed through, it would
thus not affect Tonga’s risk of debt distress—which is moderate.
However, the experiences of other countries
have shown that actual Game costs often
exceed the original budget. For example, in
Papua New Guinea, the projected expenditure
was US$94.5 million when submitting its bid for
the 2015 Games. More recent cost estimates
have risen to about US$342 million. The
Barcelona Olympics left the central Spanish
government US$ 4 billion in debt, and the city
and provincial governments an additional
US$2.1 billion in debt.
Therefore, the authorities should be cautious
about the risk of cost overrun, with particular
care being taken on avoiding debt financing. As
an illustration of risks, we simulated DSA
assuming, hypothetically, cost overruns
financed by an external debt of US$170 million
(higher-cost scenario). The simulation shows
that Tonga will be at high risk of debt distress
under this scenario.

Nonprice Measures and Other Indicators
 Exports. Export growth is expected at about 8 percent in the medium term, as the economy continues
to recover, and programs to boost exports, including in tourism and agriculture, yield results.
 Costs of doing business. Tonga made good progress in terms of improving the business environment
under the World Bank’s Doing Business 2014 report, in which it is in the top ranking among Pacific island
countries.2 The ease of getting credit has been improved with the establishment of a private credit
bureau to facilitate access to credit information. However, overcoming Tonga’s geographical
disadvantage will require an even stronger business environment. Further improvements to business
climate (e.g. easing tax payment) and enhanced policy coordination to nurture a business-friendly
environment will be important.

Box 4. Tonga: Previous Fund Recommendations
The staff and the authorities have continued to share comprehensive views in the past about policy
priorities. In the 2013 staff report, staff continued to emphasize the importance of preserving cash buffers
and a credible fiscal consolidation; continuing to expedite financial sector reform to renew credit growth;
improving the business environment to strengthen investor confidence.



The authorities continued to manage prudent fiscal policy stance focusing on protecting cash buffers
and restraining non-priority spending. They also continued to adopt No New Loan policy while
amending it to allow taking of concessional budget support loans provided by IFIs (which is in line with
the recommendations from the 2013 staff report).



The authorities continued to strengthen risk-based supervision, including through PFTAC technical
assistance, and expect to enact the Receivership bill this year.



After removing the annual renewal requirement for the headline business license, the authorities are
advancing ancillary licensing reforms, e.g., by easing immigration VISA renewal process.



The authorities are finalizing legislative process for a presumptive tax regime for SMEs and a natural
resource tax regime.

Expected Impact if Threat is
Realized
(high, medium or low)

High
For advanced economies, could result
from failure to address the legacies of
the financial crisis. For emerging
markets, could reflect the maturing of
the cycle, investment misallocation, or
incomplete structural reforms.
Medium
Buildup of excess capacity eventually
resulting in large financial and fiscal
losses.

Medium/High
Tonga would be significantly
affected by economic slowdown in
the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand,
mainly via lower remittances and
exports.

Low/medium
Natural disasters similar to the latest
cyclone could take significant human
and economic tolls.

High
Such an event could have far
reaching effects, such as damages to
infrastructure and the production
base, and an increase in the fiscal
financing gap, which can potentially
be very large.

Medium
Overly optimistic initial estimates
and/or implementation challenges in
construction projects may lead to
significant cost overrun, which is not
improbable in view of the experiences
of other countries.

High
Such an overrun will cause
worsening of debt sustainability and
investor/ development partner
confidence in the short run, and
corrective fiscal consolidation in the
longer run—harming growth.

Low
Weakening of stakeholder supports,
capacity constraints, and slippages in
the reform process could derail critical
reforms agreed with development
partners.

High
Such an outcome could significantly
affect budget support flows, leading
to a significantly large gross
financing gap.

Low/Medium
Tonga would be affected mainly
through China’s trade links with
Australia, as well as Chinese ODAs.

Policy Response
Allow moderation of growth, and delay withdrawal of
monetary impulse. Pressures on the BOP could be met by
combining depreciation and intervention. The fiscal impulse
caused by the post-cyclone activities will help cushion the
shock, and the pace of post-reconstruction consolidation
can be cautiously fine-tuned, if crucial.
Same as the above.

Design disaster recovery and financing strategy with a view
to bolster confidence (particularly by donors) and protecting
debt space. Getting ready for next disaster will need a
comprehensive approach that makes use of multiple
emergency capacities. The capacities include: (i) fiscal space
and international reserve buffer, (ii) catastrophic insurance
schemes (Tonga already participates in one initiative
coordinated by the World Bank), and (iii) toolkits provided
by global financial safety nets.
Avoiding such an outcome by early remedial actions. Tonga
will need much stronger commitment to fiscal consolidation
to redress impaired confidence and re-energize support by
the donors.

Same as the above.

transactions. Since February 11, 1991, the value of the pa’anga is determined based on a weighted
basket of currencies comprising the United States, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, with the
U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2000, the Japanese yen was added to the basket, and
the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised to 5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed
since March 1998, when the allowance for adjustment was introduced. Tonga has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Last Article IV Consultation
Staff discussions were held during February−March 2013. On July 19, 2013, the Executive Board of
the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with Tonga and considered and endorsed the staff
report (IMF Country Report No. 13/234) without a meeting.
Technical Assistance
The Legal Department (LEG) provided assistance on AML/CFT issues for the Pacific islands countries,
including Tonga, from 2002 through 2005. LEG also provided assistance on the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga Act and Financial Institutions Act from 2013 to 2014.
PFTAC has, on an on-going basis, provided assistance on budgetary management; tax
administration; banking legislation and supervision; and balance of payments and national accounts
statistics.
Resident Representative
The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Islands, including Tonga, was opened on
September 2010 in Suva, Fiji. Mr. Yongzheng Yang is the resident representative.

PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(PFTAC) COUNTRY STRATEGY 2013–142
Background
Tonga continues to face a difficult macroeconomic environment. The global economic crisis has
led to a sustained period of slow growth, undermining both fiscal and financial stability. Nonperforming loans in the banking system remain high, while fiscal policy options are tightly
constrained by the high level of public external debt.
PFTAC has provided technical assistance (TA) to Tonga in all sectors in recent years,
collaborating closely with other development partners.
This has been particularly so in the public financial management (PFM) area where PFTAC has been
working with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) to assist the authorities design and implement a
realistic reform roadmap. TA has also been provided in the compilation of National Accounts in
collaboration with an AusAID (now DFAT) funded resident statistics advisor and in Balance of
Payments Statistics. Support has also been provided to the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT)
in off-site and on-site banking supervision.
Strategy 2013–14
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy and is planned within the results
framework for current PFTAC funding cycle.3 This strategy was discussed with the authorities in
June 2011.
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and to
improve the macroeconomic environment. PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader
development partner group to ensure coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions
in the development partners’ budget support reform matrix. Inputs are expected in all sectors,
primarily at the strategic level in the fiscal and statistics sectors with detailed training and capacity
building in bank supervision and macroeconomics.
In the public financial management area, the focus will primarily be, together with AsDB, on
refining the PFM roadmap developed on the basis of the 2010 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment (1.2). PFTAC will contribute specific technical areas to support the
AsDB projects that aim to develop an effective medium-term budget framework (1.5) and improve
budget execution. These are likely to be in more accurate macroeconomic analysis (5.1), more
rigorous cash/debt management (1.6), and planning improvements to the functioning of their FMIS.
In the medium term, PFTAC would look to assist the authorities implement a follow-up PEFA
assessment, probably in 2014 (1.1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

In the revenue area, the main focus remains on assisting the authorities to continue with
implementation of the recommendations of the October 2011 PFTAC strategic revenue review. The
review and PFTAC’s regional benchmarking exercise showed that Tonga is one of the regional
leaders in implementing modern revenue administration practices. PFTAC inputs will be determined
by ongoing discussions with Ministry of Customs and Revenue and will be supported by two new
resident long-term advisors. PFTAC’s specific inputs are likely to concentrate on implementing the
new small/micro business tax regime (2.3), assisting with development and implementation of
natural resource taxation (2.2, 2.3), implementation of risk management and compliance
improvement strategies to improve consumption tax administration and collection (2.3), and
implementation of a new taxpayer services sub-division (2.3).
In statistics, Tonga is relatively well advanced against the overall results framework; based on PFTAC
advice, it produces National Accounts on two independent measures (4.1) with production of a
range of income indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics are now being developed according
to BPM6 standards (4.9). However, the quality of statistics and source data need to be strengthened
which was assisted during 2011 and 2012 by an AusAID funded resident advisor. As a result, direct
PFTAC assistance was minimal during this period. PFTAC continued to coordinate with and be a
resource for the resident advisor and to provide focused technical inputs in particular areas. Reengagement with Tonga resumed during January 2014. Balance of payments and Government
Finance Statistics support have been provided by IMF HQ.
In financial sector supervision, IMF/PFTAC has assisted the NRBT establish enhanced off-site
analysis (3.3) and has provided support to on-site bank supervision (3.4). Intensive support is being
provided in 2013/14 to build on-site supervision techniques through training in standard
procedures, reports and analytical techniques (3.5-3.7). PFTAC is also providing follow-up support to
ensure that NRBT can regularly prepare off-site analysis and monitoring reports (3.1) using base
prudential returns developed by AFSPC. In 2014 this is likely to encompass implementation of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Financial Sector Information System (FSIS) (3.2). The year
2014/15 will see the introduction of technical assistance in the oversight of credit unions (3.9).
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC continues to assist the NRBT in strengthening its capacity for
macroeconomic analysis in cooperation with the research advisor from the Reserve Bank of Australia
currently placed with NRBT (5.1). PFTAC also continues to assist the Ministry of Finance and National
Planning to strengthen its capacity in macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting (5.3). Staffs of NRBT and
MOFNP participated in a regional fiscal analysis and forecasting workshop held jointly by PFTAC and
the Singapore Regional Training Institute in March 2014; NRBT staff attended a regional seminar on
monetary policy management, analysis and operation held jointly by the Bank of England’s Centre
for Central Bank Studies and PTAC in March (5.2).

WORLD BANK–IMF COLLABORATION4
The IMF team led by Mr. Jookyung Ree (mission chief to Tonga) has a close working relationship
with the Bank team led by Mr. Robert Utz (lead economist, East Asia and the Pacific region). The
teams have an ongoing dialog on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues. The level of
cooperation and coordination is good and includes the following:


Article IV Consultation. The World Bank participated in the 2009–14 Article IV missions, as well
as joining several consultations and providing various analytical inputs to the 2014 Article IV
Report. This participation facilitated the discussions, especially in areas of mutual interest such as
fiscal policy and structural reform. In addition, Bank and Fund staffs prepared jointly the Debt
Sustainability Analysis appendix to the staff reports.



Economic Updates. IMF analysis continues to provide a vital framework to the ongoing budget
support program, with IMF assessments used as the basis for decisions regarding the
appropriateness of the overall macroeconomic policy framework.



Structural Fiscal Reforms. Bank and Fund staffs have worked successfully to provide technical
assistance (TA) in public expenditure management and continue to collaborate on the ongoing
analytical work on public expenditure, the medium-term macro-framework, and general
structural issues.

Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and the Fund share a common view about Tonga’s
macroeconomic and structural reform priorities, which mainly aim at mitigating the risks to Tonga’s
external and fiscal sustainability and at promoting long-term growth. These include:


Sustainable fiscal management. Reconstruction financing requirements following the recent
cyclone and pressures for further increases in payroll spending pose challenges to fiscal
sustainability if not carefully managed. Tonga’s recent change in debt distress rating to
‘moderate risk’ suggests some space for new concessional borrowing. A priority for the
authorities is to develop a clear policy framework to guide any new borrowing to ensure that
new borrowing supports high priority investments and remains within sustainable limits. It will
also be important to ensure that renewed borrowing occurs alongside broader progress towards
addressing fecal challenges, including improved revenue administration and expenditure
control, and tighter prioritization of expenditure, as well as structural reforms. The government’s
fiscal efforts will need to be supplemented by continued provision of grants from donors.



Making use of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement. This
remains critical for safeguarding external stability.



Promoting private drivers of growth. Given fundamental constraints of smallness and
isolation, growth prospects are likely to remain concentrated in areas where premiums can be
generated to cover higher costs of production. Natural resource industries, including tourism,

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

agriculture, fisheries and mining hold the greatest potential for private sector development. To
facilitate development in these areas there is a need to: (i) improve efficiency in the energy
sector to reduce costs; (ii) strengthen the institutional framework for lending—including the
enforcement of creditor rights to collateral—as a means to increase access to finance and lower
the cost of borrowing; (iii) improve vital tourism infrastructure, including through the
commercialization of Tonga Communication Corporation; and (iv) lower regulatory barriers to
foreign investment.
World Bank Group cooperation with Tonga is set out in a Country Assistance Strategy presented to
the Board in October 2010. Given the current depth of policy dialogue and Tonga’s difficult position,
the Bank is significantly scaling up both analytical and financial support for Tonga. Total IDA and
Trust Fund commitments to Tonga over the past three years amount to almost US$73 million,
compared to US$30 million between 1985–when Tonga became a member–and FY10. All assistance
since FY09 has been provided on 100 percent grant terms.
A key focus of engagement has been around energy-sector and general budget support operations.
US$5 million was provided to energy-sector reforms in FY2011, with a series of two development
policy operations–focusing on reforms in public financial management, fiscal policy and structural
reforms–providing an additional US$15.8 million of World Bank financing over FY2012–FY2014
through a World Bank-led multi-donor process.
Other World Bank investments are focused around connectivity for sustainable economic
development, and include: (i) a broadband cable, cofinanced with AsDB (US$17.2 million);
(ii) transport sector reform, with PRIF and AusAID financing (US$14.7 million); and (iii) aviation sector
support (US$27.2 million).
The World Bank Group provided TA to the Ministry of Revenue and Ministry of Finance and National
Planning during FY2014 review current tax expenditure arrangements and recommend new
investment incentives and policy reforms to encourage increased foreign investment. The World
Bank Group is providing ongoing assistance to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning to
support the privatization of the International Dateline Hotel and to commercialize the operations of
the Tonga Development Bank. The World Bank also provided technical assistance for a Debt
Management Reform Plan to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning.
An IMF mission visited Tonga in February 2014 to advise on the revision of the Financial Institution
Act (FI) and the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act (NRBT). The mission advised on an amendment
of the FI Act to enhance effective banking supervision, and an extension of supervision to non-bank
financial institutions. It also assessed the possibility for the NRBT to hold government securities.
The Bank and Fund teams will continue their close cooperation going forward, particularly in
supporting the current program of budget support and to assist the Government in responding to
ongoing economic difficulties. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country
teams over the July 2013–July 2015 period. It was also agreed that further details on collaboration,
as necessary, will be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK5
The goal of the Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) Pacific Approach 2010–2014 of a sustained and
resilient and improved standard of living aligns with the vision of the Tonga Strategic Development
Framework 2009/2010-2014/2015 (TSDF) to create a society in which all Tongans enjoy higher living
standards and a better quality of life. Similarly, the Pacific Approach, which serves as AsDB’s country
partnership strategy, aims to achieve its goal through inclusive and environmentally sustainable
growth, which is consistent with the TSDF vision of equitable and environmentally sustainable
private sector-led economic growth. AsDB’s Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) 2014-2016 for
Tonga shares the same focus as the Pacific Approach and the TSDF.
AsDB’s support to Tonga will be through infrastructure development; renewable energy; climate
resilience; and prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management. The Pacific Approach focuses on
the need to mitigate environmental impact and strengthen climate change resilience through
development of renewable energy options; enhancing connectivity via multimodal networks and
new technologies; and supporting urban development. Two key drivers of change to promote the
focus of the Pacific Approach include improved private sector environment and public sector
management. The priority outcome objectives of the TSDF supported by AsDB are: (i) to support the
private sector through better engagement with government, appropriate incentives, and
streamlining rules and regulations; (ii) maintain and develop infrastructure to improve the everyday
lives of people; and (iii) integrate environmental sustainability and climate change into all planning
and executing of programs.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and 9 grants totaling US$131.54 million from the Asian Development
Fund (ADF) to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Sixty seven technical assistance (TA) projects with
a value of US$12.53 million were also provided to improve capacity and strengthen institutional
development in various sectors. Past AsDB investments have focused on finance development and
infrastructure development in transport, power, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include two grant-financed projects and three TA projects in the country portfolio.
The grant-financed program approved in 2013 is helping Tonga to achieve fiscal stability through
improved public financial management, improved fiscal policy and ongoing implementation of
structural reforms, especially in state-owned enterprise reform. The other grant-financed projects
support climate resilience and renewable energy. Of the two ongoing TA projects, one focuses on
corporate planning and a medium-term budget framework and the other on implementing
sustainable off-electricity grids in the outer islands. Tonga also benefits from a number of regional
TA projects in private sector development, economic management, energy efficiency, and public
financial management.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics
Department (SD) and the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP) have received, on a
regular basis, technical assistance (TA) in national accounts, government finance, and balance of
payments (BOP) statistics from Fund’s Statistics department (STA) as well as the Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). Nevertheless, data provision to the Fund continues with long
delays. Capacity of the SD could be increased.
The main sources of statistical information are the SD, the Quarterly Bulletin of the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the MOFNP. The
country has been participating in the GDDS since May 30, 2006. The metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON).
Real Sector Statistics
In June 2012, the SD released a new series of national accounts, which changed the base year
from 2000/01 to 2010/11, with the assistance of the AusAID funded resident advisor. Data were
improved in line with PFTAC assistance provided in 2008 and 2009 by starting to incorporate
the 2009-10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) results, by supplementing customs
data with quarantine office data in merchandize exports, and by including in-kind donor-funded
capital projects and loan projects which were not captured previously. With the release in
February 2013 of the preliminary GDP results for 2011/2012, the historical series was further revised
to reflect improved deflators. PFTAC resumed its statistical support during January 2014 and made
recommendations to further incorporate recent data sources in national accounts estimates. PFTAC
will provide remote TA to review the 2012-13 GDP estimates which are planned to be released by
the SD in March 2014. The compiler of national accounts statistics at the SD attended the PFTAC
regional training course during June 2013.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2009 HIES. TA was
provided in 2008 on the development of an import price index, but trade data was not of sufficient
quality to produce indexes. The compilation of detailed international merchandise trade data is
currently hampered by technical problems.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003; and
average earnings statistics are not available. The compilation of international arrival and departure
statistics has been hampered by technical problems.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY2002/03 Central Government Budget Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal data
compiled according to the methodology of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual. The FY

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

TONGA

2014/15 budget is expected to be presented on a GFSM 2001 basis. Improvements are still needed
to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Reconciliation with monetary and financing data could be
enhanced and lags in updating the accounting system could be shortened. Published data are often
subject to significant revisions. Consolidated financial statistics for the broader public sector and
general government are not published due to lack of capacity. No data are reported for publication
in the GFS Yearbook. Tonga is participating in the three-year GFS-IMF project for the Asia-Pacific
region funded by the government of Japan, and is committed to commence reporting for the
yearbooks.
External Sector Statistics
The SD produces balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis, which are published on its
website in BPM6 format. However, standard methodology, either of BPM5 or BPM6, is largely not
observed, and data are published with a significant lag. Official BOP statistics are compiled annually
by the SD with long lags. Monthly trade figures, derived from customs data, are available with a
three-month lag. The NRBT compiles monthly balance of payments statistics based on the Overseas
Exchange Transactions (OET) records of the banking system with a six-week lag. However, there are
significant differences between the BOP estimates compiled by the SD and NRBT. A new OET code
system consistent with BPM6 is expected to be implemented in March 2014. Large errors and
omissions point to possible under-reporting of imports. Changes in reserves do not distinguish
transactions from valuation changes.
With PFTAC assistance in March 2009, the SD revised the BOP statistics and methodology, and made
recommendations for further improvements in compilation techniques and source data. A follow-up
mission took place in March 2010. As part of the Pacific Region module of the JSA Project on
External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia and Pacific Region, a mission from the IMF visited Tonga in
November 2012 and November/December 2013 to provide TA in balance of payments and IIP.
Tonga made good progress in implementing action plan recommendations. Data have been
collected to compile the international investment position (IIP). Due to capacity constraints,
quarterly IIP data are expected to become available only in late 2014. The NRBT compiled data
reported by foreign exchange dealers (FEDs). The register from these data can be used to improve
the compilation of remittances. Furthermore, the register for public external debt in the BOP has
been reviewed and an International Investment Survey (IIS) has been implemented to improve
information on FDI and other foreign transactions of the private sector.
Monetary and Financial Statistics

JOINT IMF/WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS 2014
Approved By
(IMF) Luis Breuer
(IDA) by Jeffrey D. Lewis,
Sudhir Shetty

Prepared By
The International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association

Tonga remains at a moderate risk of debt distress. Despite some worsening of the underlying
debt dynamics owing to the reconstruction needs from a recent cyclone, the risk rating
continued to be “moderate.” This was also affected by technical changes under the new DSA
framework, namely higher discount factor and stronger focus on debt absorptive capacity of
remittances.1 The public sector DSA shows dynamics that are largely similar to those of public
and publicly guaranteed external debt. Tonga’s external debt sustainability continues to be
vulnerable to external shocks. Among the different stress tests and alternative scenarios, a
significant depreciation and slowdown in exports generate the highest debt ratios. This result
underscores the importance of policies to promote export growth and diversification, and to
hedge foreign exchange risks on external debt.

1

The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for Tonga remains at a medium level (Tonga’s three
year average CPIA score is 3.45).

TONGA

BACKGROUND
1.
Tonga is a small open economy with a narrow production base. It exports a few
agricultural and fishery products, and imports food and services of numerous types. Its high reliance
on remittances and foreign aid, which are subject to large fluctuations, poses challenges.
2.
Economic growth is expected to pick up gradually (Box 1). In January 2014, a tropical
cyclone hit Tonga. The resulting output loss will be more than offset by reconstruction. After
recording between 0 and 1 percent in FY2012/13 (fiscal year ends on June 30), real GDP growth is
expected to recover to 1½ percent in FY2013/14, and further to 3½ percent in FY2014/15, led by
reconstruction from the cyclone. This recovery is also supported by rising agricultural production and
an improving outlook for tourism. Over the longer-term, growth is expected to gradually converge to
the historical trend of 1¾ percent, driven by remittances, tourism receipts, as well as credit growth.
Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside.
3.
Tonga’s total debt stock (mainly external) rose from 30 percent of GDP in FY2007/08 to
42 percent of GDP in FY2012/13. It is expected to remain substantially above 30 percent in the
medium term. The increase in debt levels, so far, has been mainly due to two large loans from a
bilateral donor contracted in 2007 and 2010.2 They account for about 60 percent of the outstanding
external debt, while the long-term loans from international financial institutions (IFIs) account for
only about 35 percent. The repayment terms for the 2007 loan to support the reconstruction of
Nuku’alofa is currently under discussion by the relevant parties, and there are clear signs that the
grace period will be extended, although a formal agreement has yet to be announced. The baseline
scenario builds in an additional 5-year grace period.
4.
Cyclone Ian-related reconstruction activity is expected to weaken the fiscal position.
Assessment of the impact of the cyclone suggests property damage of about 10 percent of GDP and
a widening of the overall fiscal balance by 1.5 percentage points of GDP to a deficit of 0.6 percent of
GDP in FY2013/14. The effect of the cyclone will linger through FY2014/15, raising the overall deficit
by about 1 percentage point compared to the no-cyclone forecast—to 0.7 percent of GDP. The
projected fiscal cost relating to the cyclone, about 7 percent of GDP or 60 million pa’anga, is broadly
met by funding from donor agencies.3
5.
In the medium term, the overall fiscal balance is expected to return to a moderate
surplus, starting in FY 2017/18. On current policies, this would lead to the gradual decline of the
debt-to-GDP ratio to around 30–35 percent towards the end of the DSA timeframe (2034).

2

The loan for reconstruction of the central business district was signed in November 2007, and the loan for road
improvement was signed in February 2010. These loans bear a 2 percent interest rate, 5-year grace period, and 20year maturity.

3

They consist of grants (about 70 percent), loans (about 20 percent), and disaster trust fund (about 10 percent). The
new external loans are consistent with the authorities’ “no new loan policy” as they are due to the World Bank
financing of an equal grant-loan mix for countries with moderate risk of debt distress. The impact of these new
external loans on debt sustainability is very small.

Box 1. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected at 1½ percent in FY2013/14 and at 3½ percent in 2014/15, before
reverting to the historical trend of 1.7 percent in the long term. The near-term pick up reflects the
boosts provided by the reconstruction from the cyclone. The driver of the convergence of the
underlying growth to the historical trend would be remittances, tourism receipts, and credit growth.
The overall fiscal balance is expected to be in deficit in the near term—given the 5 percent public
sector salary increase in FY2013/14 and the extra fiscal costs related to the cyclone—but it will
gradually move into small surplus toward the end of the medium term led by wage restraint and
revenue reform. The continued efforts in improving tax policy and administration are expected to
improve the tax-to-GDP ratio to 17.4 percent, and current expenditures are expected to decrease from
about 27.2 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 to 22.5 percent over the medium term.1 Capital expenditure,
after elevating to about 5 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 will return to 2 percent over the medium term.
Current and capital expenditures are assumed to be broadly stable as a percent of GDP in the long
term, with the former about 21½ percent and the latter about 2 percent of GDP. The primary fiscal
balance will average about 1 percent of GDP in the longer term.
Grants and projected loan disbursements are assumed to be mostly spent on development projects
and associated maintenance. The external financing from the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank is expected to continue to be a 50 percent grant and 50 percent loan mix in the first eight years
or so of the forecasting horizon. Domestic borrowing is assumed to be mainly led by gross financing
requirement.
The current account deficit is projected to decline from 5½ percent of GDP in FY2012/13 to
3¼ percent in FY2013/14. This change is mainly due to higher remittances and official transfers that
more than enough offset the higher imports. However, the current account deficit will increase to
about 6 percent in FY2015/16—2016/17, mainly owing to the hosting of the Games. Afterward, it is
expected to steadily decline to average of 3 percent in the long term.
Exports of goods are projected to remain stable at around 4 percent of GDP over the medium term.
However, imports of goods are projected to reach 34 percent of GDP in the medium term and increase
further to around 40 percent of GDP in the long term.
Remittances and tourism are projected to recover gradually, along with the global economic
recovery. Remittances will increase from 15½ percent of GDP in FY2013/14 to about 19 percent of GDP
over the medium term, and tourism receipts are projected to increase from 7 percent of GDP in
FY2013/14 to about 10 percent over the medium term.

6.
Toward the outer years in the medium term, the South Pacific Games could pose risks
if there are cost overruns or a shift toward debt-creating financing. The authorities estimate the
cost of the Games at US$70 million which they hope to finance mainly by franchises and donations.
The baseline scenario of the DSA uses the authorities’ official costing and financing plan4 which is
fiscally prudent. However, historical experience suggests that cost overruns are not uncommon, and
could create larger need for financing.
7.
The updated DSA framework (DSF)5 is applied to Tonga for the first time. The Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for Tonga remains at a medium level (Tonga’s three
year average CPIA score is 3.45). The new DSF puts greater emphasis on remittances as a source of
foreign exchange and uses a higher discount rate (5 percent versus 3 percent in the previous
framework), which contribute to technical improvements in debt and debt service indicators.6

EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline
8.
Under the baseline scenario,
the trajectories of external debt and
debt service indicators remain
comfortably below thresholds
(Figure 1). The new DSA framework
classifies Tonga as a large remittances
case. In such a case, the external debt
DSA is required to incorporate external
debt absorption capacity generated by
remittances into relevant debt burden
and service capacity indicators, as well
as distress thresholds tailored to them.
With these adjustments, all relevant
indicators shift down comfortably
below their thresholds.

Alternative Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis
9.
Stress tests show that the risk of debt distress is sensitive to a slowdown in exports or a
large currency depreciation. For the debt services-to-revenue ratio (Figure 1), a onetime
depreciation shock causes the indicator to breach the threshold slightly in FY2018/19, when the

extended grace period of the 2007 external loan provided by a bilateral donor (to support
reconstruction of Nuku’alofa) is assumed to end. However, this breach is considered a borderline
case. For all other indicators, there is no breach of thresholds even in the most extreme shock
scenario.
10.
To address the borderline issue, a probability approach was adopted. The new DSF
contains a probability approach for assessing the risk of external debt distress in borderline cases,
which is defined as one where the largest breach or near breach falls within a 10-percent band
around the threshold.7 Similar to the traditional approach, the risk of debt distress is sensitive to
either a slowdown in exports or a significant depreciation, and the stress test results in multiple
breaches of the thresholds. These results indicate a moderate risk of debt distress.
11.
Coming on top of significant reconstruction needs, the Games could pose significant
risks to external debt DSA. With nondebt financing covering the entire costs, the authorities’ plan is
fiscally prudent. If followed through, it would thus not affect Tonga’s risk of debt distress—which is
moderate. However, the experience of other countries has shown that actual cost often exceeds the
original budget. As an illustration of risks, we simulated DSA assuming, hypothetically, a cost overrun
financed by an external debt of US$170 million8. The simulation shows that Tonga will be at high risk
of debt distress (see Appendix).
12.
The historical scenario provides a substantially more sanguine picture than the baseline.
This mainly reflects the higher growth of the GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms applied to the
historical scenario.9 10

PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
Baseline
13.
The public sector DSA shows largely similar dynamics to the external debt DSA
(Figure 3). However, the overall picture is more benign reflecting relatively small levels (about
4 percent of nominal GDP) of public domestic debt. In the baseline scenario, the PV of the public
debt-to-GDP ratio will remain slightly over 30 percent in the medium term, before it steadily declines
throughout the projection period to about 20 percent. The debt services-to-revenue ratio shows a
hump shape, similar to the case of the external debt DSA.
7

The probability approach incorporates a country’s individual CPIA score and average GDP growth rate, whereas the
traditional approach uses one of three discrete CPIA values (3.25 for weak performers, 3.50 for medium performers,
and 3.75 for strong performers), and an average growth rate across LICs (for details see the Staff Guidance Note on
the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries).
8

The scenario assumes that the actual cost (US$190 million) would exceed the current official estimates (US$70
million) by about 3 times. The experience in other countries has shown that a large cost overrun of this tune is not
improbable (see Box 2 of 2014 Tonga Staff Report for the 2014 Article IV Consultation).
9

Four variables are set at their historical averages: (i) real GDP growth; (ii) growth of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms;
(iii) non-interest current account in percent of GDP; and (IV) nondebt creating (FDI) flows.
10

This means more accelerated growth in U.S. dollar nominal GDP given the same real growth rate.

TONGA

Alternative Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis
14.
Alternative scenarios underscore the importance of continued commitment to fiscal
prudence. In contrast to the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt in the alternative scenarios—
with the primary balance fixed at the FY2013/14 level, and with both real GDP growth and primary
balance fixed at historical averages—fails to decline over the medium term. This demonstrates the
need for consolidating the primary balance (from the current levels), as well as to resist reverting to
the historical tendency of low growth and fiscal imbalance. Stress tests suggest that the public debt
positions are particularly vulnerable to a significant depreciation. All indicators increase by a large
margin with such a shock.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
15.
Tonga remains at a moderate risk of debt distress. The underlying dynamics of the
external debt has worsened somewhat compared to the previous DSA, due to the reconstruction
needs of the recent cyclone. However, the risk rating continues to be moderate, partly owing to the
technical changes under the new DSA framework, namely the higher discount factor and stronger
focus on the debt absorptive capacity of remittances.
16.
The public sector DSA shows broadly similar dynamics to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt. However, the overall picture is more benign reflecting the relatively
small levels of public domestic debt.
17.
Tonga’s external debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to external shocks.
Among the different stress tests and alternative scenarios, significant currency depreciation and a
slowdown in exports generate the highest debt ratios. These results underscore the importance of
policies to promote export growth and diversification and to hedge against exchange risks on
external debt.
18.
Well-designed policies to strengthen growth and improve fiscal management would
help enhance debt sustainability. The authorities should continue to prioritize the use of fiscal
space to high-impact growth-enhancing projects, while sustaining and expanding service delivery.
Continued improvement of the public expenditure framework to attain higher efficiency is important
in this regard. Developing a comprehensive debt management strategy, including using financial
instruments to hedge exchange risks, is also a perennial priority.
19.
Coming on top of significant reconstruction needs, the Games could pose significant
risks to external debt DSA. As an illustration of risks, we simulated DSA assuming, hypothetically, a
cost overrun financed by an external debt of US$ 170 million—which shows that Tonga will be at
high risk of debt distress.
The Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment. They recognized that in addition to
the existing debt burden, the cyclone damage potentially put more pressure on debt sustainability.
They agreed with the need to build fiscal buffers and protect priority spending. The authorities
intend to improve debt management framework.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Appendix. The 2019 Pacific Games: High-Cost Scenario
Tonga will host the 2019 Pacific Games. While the authorities’ original plan is fiscally prudent,
international experience suggests that cost overrun often takes place. As an illustration of risks, we
simulate a DSA assuming, hypothetically, a cost overrun (by US$120 million) financed by an external
debt (US$170 million). We assume the hypothetical external loans will be made on terms and
conditions similar to the loans provided by China’s EXIM bank in recent years (2 percent interest rate,
20-year maturity, and 5-year grace period).
The macroeconomic assumptions remain broadly similar, compared to the baseline. In the runup to the Games, the projects of building new sports facilities and improving existing
accommodations and infrastructure would directly boost GDP. However, the growth rate decreases
rapidly afterward, reflecting cooling-down effect after the pre-Games construction. During the game
year of 2019, the positive effects brought by additional tourists and services provided will help spur a
second round of growth windfall followed by a year of unwinding.
The simulated DSA causes Tonga’s rating to change from moderate to high risk of debt
distress. The present value of public and publicly guaranteed debt to GDP plus remittances ratio
would breach its threshold for 3-4 years under the baseline (Figure A1. High-cost). Under stress tests,
four out of five debt and debt service indicators would breach the relevant thresholds. In addition,
the PV of public debt to GDP also breaches the threshold under a stress scenario.

On June 24, the Parliament passed the FY2014/15 government budget.



Total expenditures estimated for FY2014/15 amount to 451 million pa’anga,
including donor-supported in-kind expenditures of around 181 million pa’anga. This
is broadly in line with the staff’s projection.



The budget entails a moderate deficit (13.7 million pa’anga).

3.

The latest data releases are broadly consistent with the staff’s projections.



CPI inflation decelerated from 4.7 percent in March to 3.0 percent in May.



Through May, international reserves declined to 9.4 months of current imports
from 9.9 months at the beginning of the year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On July 23, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Tonga.
A major cyclone hit Tonga in January 2014, causing damage estimated at 10 percent of GDP and
depressing GDP growth in fiscal year (FY) 2013–14(to June 30) by about 1 percent. As a result,
after sluggish growth of 0-1 percent in FY2012–13, the pace of recovery will rise to just
1.4 percent in FY2013–14 before strengthening to 3.4 percent in FY2014–15, led mainly by the
post-cyclone reconstruction. This recovery is also supported by rising agricultural production and
an improving outlook for tourism. Over the longer term, growth is expected to gradually
converge to the historical trend of 1.7 percent, driven by remittances, tourism receipts, as well as
credit growth. Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside.
Risk to the inflation outlook is low. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation has largely
fluctuated between 1 to 2 percent since mid 2012, reflecting low global food prices, stable oil
prices, and weak domestic demand. Inflation is expected to incrementally increase to 45 percent toward FY2018–19. The deleveraging cycle of the Tongan banks appears to be
ending, with both lending and asset quality indicators substantially improving.
The projected fiscal cost relating to the cyclone will be broadly met by confirmed funding
mainly from donor agencies. As a result, the budget is expected to record only small overall
deficits in FY2013–14 and FY2014–15, estimated at around 0.6-0.7 percent of GDP. The
external current account is projected to show a deficit of close to 3 percent of GDP in FY2013–
14 and FY2014–15, largely financed by foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. International
reserves increased about threefold since 2008—to about 8 months of prospective imports. In the
medium term, stronger imports and lower foreign grants will slightly decrease international
reserves to 7 months of imports.
Executive Board Assessment2

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Directors welcomed that Tonga’s economy is rebounding, supported by a recovery in
agricultural exports and post-cyclone reconstruction activity. Directors noted that while the
near-term focus should be on reconstruction, in the medium term, priority should be given to
building buffers to enhance resilience to shocks. Business-enabling structural reforms will be key
to achieving sustainable and robust growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain overall fiscal prudence while accommodating
cyclone-related financing needs. They welcomed that the projected fiscal cost related to the
cyclone will be broadly met by funding from development partners. Over the medium term, the
fiscal strategy should aim to gradually increase the primary surplus, and to reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio. In this context, Directors underscored the need to continue with revenue
reform and wage restraint, strengthen debt management, and avoid cost overruns associated with
the South Pacific Games.
Directors considered the current accommodative monetary policy stance appropriate. They
agreed that the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) should consider tightening monetary
conditions when signs of credit growth firm up. Directors welcomed the plan to expand the
NRBT’s regulatory mandate to include nonbank financial institutions, and supported continued
efforts to address bottlenecks in credit information and creditor rights. They noted that the
authorities’ plan to lower the cost of credit through supportive measures, including by
commercializing Tonga Development Bank, should be accompanied by robust safeguards to
ensure the soundness of the bank.
In view of challenges posed by Tonga’s geographic remoteness and smallness, and its exposure
to natural disasters, Directors encouraged the authorities to identify and strengthen new engines
of growth. They underscored the need to continue to improve the business environment and to
bolster confidence. Directors agreed that the promotion of foreign direct investment should focus
on business-enabling structural reforms, while the use of tax incentives should be minimized and
well targeted.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Statement by Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Tonga
and Tin Moe Moe, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 23, 2014
1. On behalf of the Tongan authorities, we would like to express the authorities’ sincere gratitude
to Mr. Jookyung Ree and his team responsible for the 2014 Article IV Consultation. This
year’s discussion focused on the recovery following Cyclone Ian, and encouraging sustainable
long-term growth. The authorities broadly agree with the substance of the report.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
2. The Tongan economy experienced annual growth of around 3 per cent over the period
between 2008-09 and 2010-11 on the back of public investment projects particularly funded by
China’s EXIM Bank. However, growth started to decelerate in 2011-12 following the
completion of investment projects together with weak remittances and tourists arrival. Despite this,
the estimated nominal GDP for 2012-13 was T$802.4 million (US$446.1 million), giving GDP per
capita of T$7,771 (US$4,320) placing Tonga now in the upper-middle income group of countries for
the first time.
3. In January 2014, tropical Cyclone Ian hit remote regions of Tonga. It was the most powerful
storm ever recorded in the country, severely affecting housing, agriculture, manufacturing,
dwelling services output, water resources and electricity supply. Given this, the NRBT revised
forecasts downward, anticipating the economy to grow by 2.0 per cent in 2013-14. GDP growth is
expected to reach around 3.2 per cent in 2014-15, partly supported by reconstruction of cycloneaffected areas which are boosting construction activity.
4. The Tongan economy is expected to continue recovering from the effects of Cyclone Ian
supported by the recovery in agriculture and tourism and in other areas such as remittances and
credit growth in the banking sector. The authorities noted the staff’s view regarding the need to
identify and strengthen engines of growth in order to achieve a sustainable and inclusive growth
in the medium and long-term. Additionally, relying heavily on imports for domestic consumption
is a major risk to the economy. The authorities welcome the advice to promote tourism, agriculture,
and fishery sectors and others through implementation of policy mix involving tax incentives and
regulatory reform. Up- skilling Tonga’s labor force through continued participation in the seasonal
employment programs is essential to facilitate the country’s growth model. This benefit could
amplify by considering similar programs for high-skilled labor, such as for workers in the health
and education sectors. The authorities intend to introduce growth friendly policy measures by
lowering the cost of credit with robust safe guards. The authorities welcome the staff’s
recommendation to tighten monetary conditions once the turnaround in credit growth is clear.
5. The authorities acknowledge the downside risk related to spillovers from slower growth in
emerging economies and frequent natural disaster. Nevertheless, the authorities stand ready to
mitigate the effect from this downside risk by gradually building fiscal surplus to about 1 percent
of GDP on average over the long-term.
6. Year-ended inflation rose from 1.1 percent in February 2013 to 4.7 percent in February 2014,
reaching its highest level since September 2011 (5.6 per cent). This sharp increase was mainly owing
to the increase in the price index of imported components due to the pa’anga’s depreciation against
the New Zealand dollar, as well as rises in domestic fruit and vegetable prices due to unfavorable

2
weather conditions. However inflation fell over May 2014 to 3.0 per cent following a sharp decline in
the price of domestic fruit and vegetables coinciding with the onset of the harvesting season. The
authorities project year-ended headline inflation to be around 4.0 percent in June 2014, and to fall
further based on the assumptions of a further decline in world food prices, an increase in the world
food supply and the pa’anga exchange rate would remain unchanged. For the medium-term,
authorities share staff views that inflation would be higher with demand-pull effects relating to the
preparation of hosting South Pacific Games in 2019. Notwithstanding this, authorities and staffs
noted that current peak level of inflation is still below the authorities’ reference range of 6 to 8
percent. In light of this, authorities have requested assistance from the IMF to review the current
reference range and await the IMF’s advice on the next steps.
7. Gross official foreign reserves stood at T$266.8 million at the end of May 2014, which is
equivalent to 9.4 months of import cover and well above the NRBT benchmark of 3 to 4 months of
imports. Ongoing increase of foreign exchange reserves is because of mainly materializing inflows
grants and aids in terms of size and timing from Tonga’s development partners. The authorities also
agree with staffs that, to some extent, the expected increase in the level of foreign exchange reserves
will be offset by increase in cyclone recovery of imports. Nonetheless, authorities reiterated that the
level of foreign reserves will remain comfortably above the NRBT benchmark over the near term.
Monetary Policy
8. Authorities agree with staff that the current expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate
given the nascent recovery of economic growth. The Tongan authorities remain focused on
maintaining internal and external monetary stability; and promoting a sound and efficient financial
system in a manner that supports macroeconomic stability and economic growth. To maintain internal
and external monetary stability through maintaining official foreign reserves and promoting price
stability, NRBT set the threshold for maintaining official foreign reserve at 3 to 4 months of imports
cover, and inflation reference range at 6 to 8 percent. It is well noted that the current level of
international reserves is well above the set threshold level and inflation is well below the reference
range.
9. While protecting high levels of foreign exchange reserves, the NRBT anticipates maintaining
conventional monetary policy at its expansionary limit, supporting economic activity over the near
term. The NRBT will not pay banks any interest on their exchange settlement account balances; will
not issue any NRBT securities and will maintain the banks’ Statutory Required Deposit ratio in its
effective lower bound of 5 per cent of deposits. The NRBT will also continue its monthly dialogue
with the banks on other ways to encourage lending. In this context, authorities viewed that growth
could be strengthened by increasing banks’ lending viable corporations to stimulate private sector
growth. The authorities stand ready to mitigate the risk against building up in the level of nonperforming loans while encouraging lending for commercially viable investments.
10. Regarding implementation of monetary policy through lower cost of intermediation going
forward, the authorities will continue with its efforts to increase competition with the opening of a
new bank (Pacific International Commercial Bank) while ensuring all banks continue to follow
prudent lending rules; and support the commercialization of Tonga Development Bank (TDB). The
amendments to the Tonga Development Act have been enacted from July 2014, supporting the
commercialization of the bank. Further effort includes the amendments to the NRBT Act and
Financial Institutions Act to strengthening the Reserve Bank’s role to economic development,

3
monetary stability, and the soundness and resilience of the financial sector. This includes bringing
non-banks to the regulatory framework of the NRBT. Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledge the
staff’s recommendation to tighten monetary policy once credit growth has sustained.
Fiscal Policy
11. Total public debt is estimated at $368.2 million (44 percent of GDP) at 30 June 2014; with total
external debt, of T$338.7 million (40 percent of GDP) of which nearly two thirds is owed to EXIM
Bank. Total Domestic debt, of T$29.5 million (3 percent of GDP) consists only of Government bond
issuance with 56 percent held by financial institutions and over 24 percent by retirement funds. On
the issue of increasing high debt burden, authorities share staffs’ view that well-designed policies to
strengthen growth and improve fiscal management would help enhance debt sustainability. The
authorities also agree with the staffs that building fiscal buffers while protecting priority spending is
warranted.
12. Recent improvement in economic and public management conditions resulted in IMF upgrading
Tonga from high debt distress to medium. This improved classification, however, raises a number of
key issues, as well as changing World Bank and ADB project and budget support from 100 percent
grant to 50 percent grant and 50 percent loan. This provides some room for prudent debt financing. In
the area of domestic borrowing, public debt management will stimulate direct cost savings and
economic growth.
13. To strengthen fiscal management, the authorities remain committed to its fiscal consolidation
strategy started two years ago, which includes ensuring better management of public finances and
returning to a more sustainable position. This consolidation is required to strengthen the long-term
position of the budget and rebuild policy buffers against future external shocks. The authorities fulfill
their commitments by improving their estimation of funding ceilings based on realistic assessments of
revenue raising capacity, budget support and development assistance, and where appropriate prudent
borrowing.
14. The authorities are also aware that revenue reform is warranted to improve the fiscal position
while preserving capital expenditures and maintaining contingency funds. The authorities will
implement revenue measures including continued improvements to revenue collection while avoiding
the burden on businesses and consumers; limiting erosion of the revenue base from exemptions by
applying clear policy guidance rather than ad hoc decisions (taking account of target sectors,
addressing structural disadvantages, improving performance of business, non-discretionary, fairness
and transparency and protecting the revenue base); seeking predictable levels of budget support, to
support sound budgeting; increasing the revenue base through increased non tax revenue sources, e.g.
offshore companies; and improving returns from Government assets.
15. The authorities will also make efforts to further enhance prudent debt management by ensuring
that the sustainable debt policy remains up to date and managing the currency composition of debt to
avoid over exposure to any one currency, or one source of funding.
16. The authorities took note the medium-term fiscal strategy to ensure gradual stabilizing and
reducing the risk of debt stress. Policy measures to anchor the fiscal position have been the
authorities’ priority including the policy of no new external commercial borrowing and cautious use
of concessional loans only in limited basis. The authorities are mindful of the fiscal risk arising from
a potential cost overrun and lower cost options to build South Pacific Game facilities, however, debt

4
related financing for the game facilities is not an option that the authorities are looking at as the
authorities do have the fiscal space available as buffer to absorb the downside risk.
Financial Sector
17. Total bank lending balances increased by 10.9 per cent over the year to May 2014. This follows
a 11.2 increased over the year in April 2014. This is the fastest growth recorded for five years
reflecting lower lending rates. The NRBT is forecasting lending to grow by around 10 per cent in
2013-14. This is on the basis of imminent drawdown of some large loan commitments; the expected
fall in interest rates; and an anticipated improvement in economic conditions more broadly. Faster
growth is expected in financial year 2015.
18. Tonga’s weighted average interest rate spread was less than 6.9 percentage points in May 2014.
The lowest in at least 36 months of comparable records since at least January 2001. The weighted
average deposit rate increased over the year to May 2014 by 9 basis points. Lending rates are now
low by the standards of the past decade. The result can be explained by the increased competition in
the banking sector together with the continued support from the NRBT’s expansionary monetary
policy setting. Tongan lending rates has been unable to decline further due to structural issues
contributing to high risk in lending in Tonga that need to be addressed, such as the land
administration issues and lack of bankruptcy laws.
19. The authorities agree with the staffs that excess liquidity needs to be reduced gradually to support
economic growth and prudent lending. Unsafe and unsound practices through aggressive competition
should be avoided to ensure financial stability is maintained. This will also avoid resulting increase in
interest rate which can hamper the nascent economic recovery. In this respect, given the limited
monetary policy instruments, the authorities intend to introduce growth friendly policy measures
along with continuously seeking means to enhance support for credit growth. On the supervisory
front, the NRBT’s oversight continues to focus on banks’ credit risk management systems as well as
enhanced oversight over the new bank and TDB’s commercialization process.
Structural Reforms
20. The authorities are committed to further strengthening the private public sector partnership to
increase competition which helps improve quality and lower prices for consumers. The authorities
share staffs’ view that promoting FDI should focus on business-enabling structural reforms, and
they highlighted the need to strike the right balance between promoting FDI projects and protecting
revenue base. In this context, the authorities are seeking to further improve the business enabling
environment so that government regulations and revenue reforms are more efficient and effective so
as to reduce regulatory burden on the businesses.
21. Regarding achieving sustainable growth, the authorities are introducing measures to protect the
vulnerable by expanding support to the elderly in a way of lowering the starting point for aged
welfare payments from 75 to 70 years. With the support of a number of Tonga’s development
partners, new policies to protect the most vulnerable are also being in the process of designed. Other
reforms are underway including public financial management reform, improving corporate plans
related to budgets of ministries, strengthening staff performance management system with job
descriptions aligned to ministry outputs, and improving the monitoring and evaluation of our progress
at all levels. The authorities noted that sound governance is essential for building public confidence in
government and creating the trust needed for building good public-private partnerships.

5
Final Remarks
22. To conclude, the authorities are committed to safeguarding the Tongan economy and the financial
system against shocks while maintaining monetary and fiscal prudence. At the same time, the
continued implementation of structural reform measures is essential to secure growth momentum in
the medium and long-term. The authorities are cognizant of the considerable challenges that lie ahead
and realize that results would take time to materialize. Given Tonga’s capacity constraints, domestic
efforts would need to be supplemented by support from multilateral institutions and other countries.
In this regard, the Tongan authorities would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Fund, the
World Bank, ADB, PFTAC and donors for their invaluable technical guidance and support over the
years.
