MAURITIUS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 29, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Growth prospects: Supported by wide-ranging structural reforms and prudent policies,
Mauritius has established itself as a top performer in Africa. The government’s
comprehensive policy response contributed to its recovery in 2010 with growth at
4 percent combined with low inflation. Growth is projected at slightly more than
4 percent in 2011. Going forward higher growth will require increased investments,
improvements in education and skills, and structural reforms to improve productivity.
Fiscal policy and public debt sustainability: The expansionary fiscal stance in 2010
was appropriate to cushion the economy against the backdrop of the European debt
crisis. With the economy operating essentially at its potential in 2011, a less expansionary
fiscal stance is recommended. Mauritius is well placed to comply with the legallymandated public debt limit of below 50 percent of GDP by 2018, although a slightly more
ambitious fiscal consolidation would reduce debt vulnerabilities further. Ensuring that
parastatals operate on a fully commercial basis with full cost recovery would contribute to
achieving fiscal sustainability and to increasing productivity.
Monetary and exchange rate policies: Monetary policy was loosened in 2010 to
support economic recovery. Now, with higher international food and oil prices and excess
liquidity in the financial system, monetary policy should be forward looking and include a
tightening bias to ensure that recent inflationary pressures do not become engrained. The
real exchange rate appreciated during 2010 compared to its estimated equilibrium value
but can still be considered to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
Financial sector: Financial soundness indicators reveal high capital adequacy ratios, few
non-performing loans, and sound liquidity positions. The Mauritian financial system is
expected to expand further as the global economy recovers since Mauritius is well placed
to channel investments to other countries in Asia and Africa.
Green taxation: Mauritius is a pioneer in the development of green taxes with a clear
intention to enhance the tax system to make it more environmentally sustainable.

The authorities argued that Mauritius’

long-term growth rate could be higher with
appropriate policies. Their target is 6 percent,
which would require very large investment rates and
significant improvements in total factor productivity.
They agreed that it was necessary to continue with
their structural reform program to achieve higher
rates going forward.

B. MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL AND DEBT
POLICIES
19.

Mauritius debt outlook is positive but

could be improved. The debt sustainability analysis
(Appendix 4) shows that debt will decline steadily
under current policies to about 51 percent of GDP in
2016. Staff welcomed the recent amendments to the
2008 Debt Management Act, which extended the
50 percent debt-to-GDP target to 2018, since
maintaining the previous 2013 deadline would have
required a counterproductive and excessive fiscal
contraction. Staff recommended considering further
enhancements in the debt law to provide greater
flexibility to respond to shocks (see Appendix 5).
Specifically, the debt law could include an operational
fiscal anchor linked to the economic cycle and
deviations from the debt target. A prime candidate
for such an anchor is some measure of primary
deficit, the main determinant of debt dynamics
together with nominal growth and nominal interest

with the debt target is reached. Calculations of the
cyclical component should be based on a replicable
and transparent formula and undertaken by an

commission.

suggested considering a lower long-term debt target
of 40 percent of GDP since international evidence
suggests that debt vulnerabilities for emerging
market countries are further reduced below this level.
20.

The authorities thought that further

modifications to the debt law might not be
desirable at present. While they considered staff’s
suggestions reasonable they thought that the public
debate required to change the law would be time
consuming and, given projected debt development,
they saw no urgency for immediate changes. Also,
they stressed that the methodology for calculating
the cyclical component of the deficit might be
difficult to agree on and open to criticism even with
an independent fiscal commission.

macroeconomic effects of their financing strategy.
Also they thought that further study was necessary

Mauritius is a pioneer of green taxation,

but challenges remain. Taxes allow policy makers
to fully incorporate environmental damages into the
costs of energy and vehicle use and to reduce these
damages by changing behavior. The existing levy on
energy products (Maurice Ile Durable) is close to an
ideal carbon tax; staff suggested converting it into an
explicit carbon tax; preferably at a higher rate
reflecting the full cost of CO2 emissions. Currently
discussed proposals to base vehicle excise duties on
CO2 per kilometer represent an improvement over
existing taxes on engine capacity. However, they do
not (i) provide equal rewards for emissions reductions
across different vehicles (important for a costeffective policy); (ii) discourage vehicle use (to reduce
CO2 and, more important, traffic congestion);
(iii) preserve revenue; nor (iv) do they simplify the tax

Recent tax changes have lowered the tax-to-GDP
ratio from 19 percent in 2009 to a projected
18.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Given plans for public
investment in education and infrastructure, there
may be a need to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio over
time. As a general principle, tax policy should be
designed to raise revenues in the least distortive,

above average CO2 per kilometer and rebate for
vehicles below it, and a proportional tariff on
purchase price (to meet revenue needs). In addition,
to raise the marginal costs of driving and reduce
congestion, annual road taxes and registration fees
should be converted into a tax on actual annual

recordings with a progressive switch to GPS

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Appendix 1. Mauritius: Output Gap and Cyclical Adjustment of Fiscal Balances1
Estimates of the output gap and cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances are important to guide the
stance of fiscal and monetary policies. The cyclical component of the fiscal deficit appears to
have been almost eliminated at end-2010, and there is little scope for expansionary fiscal policy
going forward. Results suggest that fiscal policy became more counter-cyclical over time.
Calculating the output gap
The output gap y is defined as the difference between actual and potential output. It is usually
expressed as a percentage of potential output Y*, which is the level of output when all factors of
production are at full employment. Both potential output and output gap are unobservable
variables, but can be estimated by various methods:


Linear trend (LT): This assumes constant potential growth. Econometric tests on annual data
suggest a break in 1973, when the Multifiber Agreement (MFA) was adopted. The implied
constant potential growth is 5 percent after 1973 versus 2 percent before 1973.



Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter: Y* is derived by minimizing the deviation of observed data
from the trend and movements in the estimated trend, subject to a smoothing parameter λ. The
lower λ, the smoother the trend.

Note: annual output gap estimates rely on data starting 1950, quarterly – on data starting 1999Q1


Band-pass filters: Frequency filters, which isolate the frequency component of a time series
by specifying the duration of the cycle. Tend to provide better end-period estimates. Baxter-

King (BK) filter is symmetric and time-invariant. Christiano-Fitzgerald (CF) filter is a more
general filter, asymmetric and with time-varying weights. CF is probably the most useful.


Multivariate Bayesian model (Benes et al., 2010): Allows incorporating other conditioning
information (inflation, capacity utilization and unemployment) in estimating the output gap.
Should provide better estimates of the output gap than univariate estimates (Figure 2).

The annual and quarterly measures both
indicate a small output gap in 2009-10.

Figure 2. Mauritius: Output gap, 1999–2015
(In percent)

Estimates for output gap in 2011 are negative,
but small (less than ½ percent of GDP) for
most reasonable estimates.
Methodology of cyclical adjustment
A worsening in the fiscal balance can result
either from: (i) discretionary decreases in
taxes or increases in expenditures; or
(ii) economic slowdown accompanied by the
automatic decreases in tax revenues (as people
earn and spend less) and increases in
expenditures (due to higher unemployment
benefits).

The cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance shows the underlying fiscal position when the cyclical
movements are removed. It is useful for assessing the current public finance policies abstracting
from the impact of the cycle on the budget. We use (i) the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
approach, where the adjustment is made on total domestic revenues and expenditures, applying
generalized elasticities; and (ii) the simplified OECD/European Commission method, where
adjustment is made to individual subcomponents of revenues and expenditures based on
disaggregated elasticities. In principle, we would have liked to take into account discretionary
fiscal policy actions, but we did not have the data for that.
With the FAD approach, the fiscal balance (FB) may be decomposed as: FB = Primary
Balance (PB) – Interest (INT). The PB = (CAPB + CPB + GRANTS), where CAPB is the
cyclically-adjusted primary balance excluding grants and CPB is the cyclical component of the
primary balance. The CAPB depends on the elasticities of revenues and expenditures with
respect to the output gap. Interest payments and grants are treated separately because their
movements are not correlated with cyclical output changes. Estimates for OECD countries give
aggregate revenue elasticity close to 1 and spending elasticity close to zero, as most spending

24

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

does not respond to the cycle, with the exception of unemployment benefits, whose share in total
expenditures is typically small. Thus, using potential output as the scaling variable, the cyclical
component of the primary balance (CPB) can then be estimated as: CPB= r*y; where r
represents revenues excluding grants.
With the OECD approach, the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is the sum of the response to
the output gap of four tax categories (individual and corporate income tax, indirect taxes and social
contributions) and one expenditure category (unemployment benefits). We computed
disaggregated elasticities on data from 1973-2010 following Burnside and Meshcheryakova (2004)
as
where r is the cyclical part of a fiscal component, computed as deviation from
the HP-filtered trend. Since the computed elasticity on social expenditure is counter-intuitive, we
adjusted only individual, corporate and indirect tax receipts for the cycle.
Characterizing fiscal policy
The two approaches yield similar results for Mauritius. There is some evidence that fiscal policy
in Mauritius became more countercyclical over time. The correlation between Mauritius’
structural primary surplus excluding grants as a percentage of potential GDP and the output gap
switches from -0.65 for 1973–1990 to 0.3 for the 1990–2010 period.
The cyclical component in Mauritius’ fiscal balances has been small recently (Figure 3). Our
estimates suggest it was close to zero in 2010, particularly towards the end when the output gap
is also estimated to be close to zero based on quarterly data. This implies that there is little need
for expansionary fiscal policy for macroeconomic stabilization purposes in 2011.

Appendix 2. Mauritius: Exchange Rate Assessment1
The real value of the Mauritian rupee has followed a U-shaped path over the last decade.
The rupee depreciated steadily some 25 percent in real terms from peak (2001) to through (end2006). During the crisis years of 2008–09, the depreciation of the Euro and the Pound pushed up
the value of the rupee. Mauritius experienced a relatively quick rebound from the world
economic crisis, with FDI and other investment flows returning to pre-crisis levels in 2010,
which translated into a slight real appreciation over the course of that year (Figure 1).

Staff estimates that the real exchange rate of the rupee at end-2010 was broadly in line with
fundamentals. At the same time staff notes that the estimated deviation from equilibrium
slightly widened compared to the last Article IV assessment: from 4½ percent for 2009 to about
11 percent in 2010. These findings apply the three CGER-based methodological approaches
(macroeconomic balances, external sustainability and equilibrium real exchange rate).
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach is a two-stage method. First the equilibrium
current account or “CA norm” is estimated based on a GMM regression using a panel dataset
covering 184 economies and spanning 1973 to 2009. The CA norm is then compared to the
“underlying CA”, which adjusts the CA for large one-off imports and projected real exchange
movements. Second, a country-specific elasticity of the CA with respect to the real exchange rate
(0.755 for Mauritius, see IMF WP/08/212) is used to compute the misalignment as the real
exchange rate adjustment required to close the gap between “underlying CA” and “CA norm”.
Figure 2 shows that the underlying current account has diverged from its equilibrium level in
2010, when the overvaluation reached around 12 percent. However, CA projections imply that
the overvaluation would shrink rapidly in 2011 and disappear over the medium term (Figure 2).

The external sustainability (ES) approach also estimates the misalignment as the adjustment
required to close the gap between the underlying CA and the norm. However, unlike the MB
approach, ES defines the CA norm as the CA that would freeze Mauritius’ net foreign assets at
the current level. Despite differences in methodology, results for the ES approach (Figure 3) are
very similar to the MB approach: the 2010 exchange rate is estimated to be overvalued by some
12 percent, but the misalignment is projected to diminish rapidly over the medium term.

The misalignment estimated using ES should be interpreted with caution. As discussed in IMF
WP/08/212 and WP/10/148, the liability side of the Global Business Corporations’ activity is
currently underestimated in external sector statistics, which biases upwards the NFA estimate for
Mauritius. This results in overestimating the CA norm and, consequently, the REER
overvaluation.

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach uses fitted values from a panel
regression to compute Mauritius’ ERER. The difference with the actual REER constitutes the
misalignment. Results, presented in Figure 4, corroborate those obtained from the other two
methods: the overvaluation is projected to shrink rapidly from 8 percent in 2010 to around
2 percent by 2015.

Appendix 3. Mauritius: Long-term Growth Prospects1
Real growth accelerated after the establishment of preferential trade agreements in the 1970s.
However, starting in the mid 2000s, as the agreements expired, trend growth appears to have
declined. A simple growth accounting exercise examines the factors that drove past growth and
are likely to drive it in the future. Future potential real growth is estimated to be between
3.5-5.4 percent depending on the authorities’ policy efforts and private sector initiatives.
Empirical methodology and data
The growth accounting framework is based on
the Cobb-Douglas production function and is
obtained by decomposing the growth rate of
output (Y) into the growth rates of capital (K),
labor input (L), and total factor productivity
(A), where α is the elasticity of output with
respect to capital:

Labor input is augmented with human capital (H), to allow for the role of educational attainment,
where s is the average years of schooling of the labor force and r is the return to each year of
schooling, estimated to be 10.7 percent for middle-income countries: L* = HL = ers L
Total factor productivity (A), which captures other factors, such as technology, infrastructure and
institutions, is computed as a residual. The capital stock and employment series from the Central
Statistics Office (CSO) were extended back to 1950. CSO data on human capital was extended
back to 1960. CSO data exhibit a persistent decline in the share of the employee compensation
over time, which likely reflects the underestimation of the labor income of self-employed
workers. The study uses constant elasticities or capital shares (α from 0.25 to 0.35 to 0.5).
Historical evidence
Mauritius experienced two growth accelerations in the past: in the 1970s growth was 6 percent
on average and in 1990s it was 5.2 percent. The contribution of labor has systematically declined
because of the slowing population growth rate, although its role picks up if one accounts for
improvements in education. Since the 1990s, capital (K) and productivity (A) play the dominant
role (Figure 2), with A permanently higher than before. Accounting for human capital (L*)

suggests lower productivity improvements in recent years. A larger share of economic output
attributable to capital (α) decreases productivity (A) for the whole period (Table 2).

stay at its 2010 estimate of 6.7 percent. TFP growth is assumed to start at its 20-year average
(which varies depending on elasticity and human capital choice) and rise by 70 percent by the
end of the horizon. Given these assumptions, Mauritius could achieve long run growth of
3.4–4.2 percent. Increasing the share of capital in output (or its elasticity) tends to decrease the
growth rate because of its affect on the historical average of TFP growth.

Policy recommendations to raise the long-run growth rate
The results of the growth accounting exercise suggest that a target growth of 6 percent might be
too ambitious and that pro-active policies are needed to raise growth closer to 5 percent:


Improving the investment rates through: (i) acceleration in the implementation of current
investment projects; and (ii) further measures to encourage FDI and domestic savings.



Labor market reforms to increase participation and decrease unemployment rates,
especially for women. In 2009, the female participation rate was 42.6 percent versus
76.1 percent for males and the unemployment rate was 12.3 percent versus 4.4 for males.



Investment in education and education reform to increase secondary (currently, 1/3 of
primary students fail primary exams and don’t proceed to secondary school) and tertiary
enrollment rates (only 40 percent now).



Further reforms to reduce bottlenecks and increase productivity via (i) upgrades and
restructuring of public utilities (water and electricity); (ii) road decongestion; (iii) further
improvements in the business environment; and (iv) a growth friendly tax regime.

Appendix 4. Mauritius: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Assumptions
The macroeconomic projection assumes that the government will resume fiscal
consolidation as part of its post-crisis strategy. Assuming no major negative shocks, GDP
growth is expected to increase gradually to 4½ percent by 2015 driven by increased
infrastructure investment and productivity improvements. The fiscal deficit will decline slowly
as fiscal consolidation resumes and financial discipline on public enterprises is better enforced.
The primary balance including net lending is projected to remain negative through 2012, and be
roughly in equilibrium in subsequent years. The current account deficit will oscillate around
12 percent of GDP through 2012, on account of reduced demand in traditional export markets,
and be expected to decline gradually to 6 percent of GDP by 2015.
Public Debt
The public finances of Mauritius are fundamentally sound, and public debt is sustainable
over the medium-term. With the launching of a wide-ranging reform strategy in 2005, the
government has successfully implemented program-based budgeting within a medium-term
expenditure framework, and the 2008 Public Debt Management Act (PDMA) provides additional
safeguards. Since fiscal consolidation began in 2005, public debt has been reduced from a peak
of over 80 percent of GDP in 2003 to 52 percent in 2008, but increased again to 59 percent in
2010 as a result of the stimulus package enacted in the wake of the financial crisis. The forwardlooking debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that public debt will remain sustainable over
the medium term (Table 1). The 50 percent debt-to-GDP target mandated by the PDMA is likely
to be achieved in 2018. The baseline scenario incorporates fiscal stimulus measures, which are
projected to push the 2011 and 2012 primary deficits (including net lending) to 2.5 and
2.0 percent of GDP respectively. Public debt is projected to peak at close to 60 percent of GDP
in 2012 before falling to 53 percent in 2015, the end of the projection period.
The results of standardized sensitivity tests do not alter the broadly positive outlook, as no shock
scenario raises the debt ratio to the 2003 level. Still, the projected increase in the share of
external debt makes the debt-to-GDP ratio susceptible to devaluations – a 30 percent devaluation
in 2010 would push it up 5 percentage points to 58 percent in 2015 (Figure 1). The medium-term
scenario is quite resilient to other macroeconomic shocks: if growth were about 1 percent lower
than projected, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase insignificantly to 59 percent of GDP by
2015 (Figure 1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT MAURITIUS

While broadly positive, the results suggest that in order to meet the PDMA-mandated debt
ceilings under plausible adverse scenarios over the medium term, the authorities may need to
target a more ambitious fiscal consolidation agenda from 2012 forward.
External Debt
External debt is sustainable. Excluding short-term private sector liabilities, it stood at
12½ percent of GDP at the end of 2010, down from 20 percent in 2002. Official estimates put
short-term private sector debt at only about 1 percent of GDP, which almost surely under-states
its true magnitude. However, a preliminary survey suggests that total short-term external
liabilities of the nonfinancial private sector are unlikely to exceed 10 percent of GDP. Gross
bank external liabilities surpassed 100 percent of GDP at the end of December 2010 and are not
included in external debt, as bank foreign assets are almost twice as large,1 and as in many
international financial centers, it would be misleading to include gross bank liabilities in the
external debt measure.2 Including banks’ position on a net basis in external debt shows that the
net external debt position for the economy as a whole is generally balanced. Projections suggest
that external debt will rise over the next few years—as the authorities take advantage of partially
concessional long-term financing from multi- and bilateral sources—before stabilizing at about
20 percent of GDP. A 30 percent real depreciation in 2010 would push up the steady state
external debt-to-GDP ratio to around 27 percent in 2015. A current account deficit 3 percentage
points of GDP larger than projected in the baseline would put the country on an unsustainable
path, as the debt stock shoots up to 32 percent of GDP in 2015 and keeps growing thereafter.3
Thus, controlling the non-debt creating part of the external current account balance is key to
maintaining external debt sustainability.

1

Bank investments of the GBC float—that is, money from foreign investors meant to be transferred to third
countries but held for a short period by GBCs in bank deposits—are included. Excluding these GBC counterpart
investments would still result in a positive bank net foreign asset position.

http://www-intranet.imf.org/departments/SPR/Debt/Pages/DSAMarketAccess.aspx.

Historically, there are large positive errors and omissions in the balance of payments. These likely reflect, inter
alia, management fees earned by GBCs (which are not captured in the BOP statistics, which treat GBCs as
nonresidents), as well as, possibly, capital inflows. For the purposes of DSA projections, the authorities’ estimate of
likely management fees is included in the service receipts of the current account. Nevertheless, the projections likely
overestimate the increase in external debt, as the unaccounted errors and omissions are unlikely to be all debtcreating.

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Appendix 5. Mauritius: Fiscal Rules and Fiscal Sustainability1
Mauritius followed prudent macroeconomic policies in the recent past. Going forward some
medium-term fiscal consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt adheres to the country’s fiscal
rule, defined in the 2008 Public Debt Management Act (PDMA). The PDMA puts a limit on the
debt-to-GDP ratio. In 2010, the estimated debt-to-GDP ratio of 59 percent came close to the
legally mandated 60 percent of GDP ceiling. Initially, the limit was 50 percent of GDP starting
in 2013, but the authorities recently changed the date to 2018. This appendix provides options
for enhancing the country’s debt rule by introducing an operational fiscal anchor linked to the
economic cycle and deviations from the debt target.
International experience with fiscal rules
Almost 80 countries adopted national or supranational fiscal rules by early 2009.2 On average
rules are associated with improved fiscal performance and more prudent fiscal policies.
However, in many cases rules have been strained by the current crisis. Going forward, rulesbased frameworks can be useful in anchoring expectations regarding fiscal sustainability, but
they have to reflect country circumstances.
A fiscal rule (i) delineates a numerical target with a view to guiding fiscal policy, (ii) specifies a
summary operational fiscal indicator, and (iii) it is simple enough that it can be operationalized,
communicated to the public, and monitored. Fiscal rules serve different goals, but the focus here
is on rules that promote fiscal sustainability.
Fiscal balance rules can help ensure that debt remains sustainable. The overall balance relates
most directly to the change in the debt stock, but countries with a debt sustainability concern
often focus on the primary balance because debt dynamics depend on the primary deficit, and
interest and GDP growth rates, although the two later variables are mostly considered exogenous
and are not controlled by the authorities. Fiscal balance rules that are not adjusted for the cyclical
position of the economy tend to be problematic because revenues in particular respond
vigorously to the output gap. Thus, structural fiscal balance rules reflect the actual stance of
fiscal policies and avoid undesirable pro-cyclical policy responses.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT MAURITIUS

The Mauritius’ Debt Rule in Practice—So Far So Good
Debt rules can be effective in terms of ensuring convergence to a debt target as happened in
Mauritius. The strong debt reduction in the past suggests that legally-mandated debt ceilings
served Mauritius well in improving fiscal sustainability. After the launching of wide-ranging
reforms in 2005, including a fiscal consolidation strategy anchored in the new public debt law,
public debt plummeted to below 60 percent of GDP in 2008 from a high of 80 percent in 2003.
Forward looking, the results of standardized DSA tests on Mauritius’ public debt provide a
broadly positive debt outlook, as no shock scenario raises the debt ratio to the high 2003 levels.
However, international experience suggests that legal debt ceilings without operational
adjustment rules might be overly rigid and could result in a loss of credibility if breached too
often. Precisely to avoid a breach of the debt target, which originally required total public debt to
be below 50 percent of GDP by 2013, the authorities recently extended this target to 2018. The
PDMA specifies that the ceiling can be breached in the case of emergencies and large public
investment projects, but then fiscal policy has to be such to comply with the debt ceiling within
three fiscal years of the breach, which could be too rigid under certain economic shocks.
Moreover, the PDMA provides little guidance as to the mechanism for deciding whether
exceptional circumstances are present and what to do under such circumstances.
Ways to Improve the Mauritius’ Fiscal Rule—An Operational Fiscal Anchor
To be effective the debt rule should not only have an unambiguous link between the numerical
target and its ultimate objective (“public debt sustainability”) but should also have (i) sufficient
flexibility to respond to shocks so that the fiscal rule does not exacerbate the economic cycle;
and (ii) have a clear institutional mechanism to map deviations from numerical targets to
implementable corrective actions.
The 50 percent of GDP debt ceiling seems reasonable over the next few years, but a more
ambitious target might be adopted eventually. International experience suggests that debt levels
below 40 percent of GDP are associated with reduced likelihood of debt crises in emerging
market economies like Mauritius. Thus, consideration could be given to reducing the 50 percent
target over the longer term.
Currently, the debt law’s fiscal adjustment requirements are too stringent and provide
insufficient operational guidance. Before its amendment (i.e., postponing the 50 percent debt-toGDP target to 2018), the debt law implicitly required fiscal adjustment of over 4 percentage

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

points of GDP per year to comply with the law by 2013. Such massive fiscal adjustments would
be counterproductive given the fragile macroeconomic environment and unnecessarily
ambitious. Moreover, the law provides little guidance on how to change the fiscal policy stance
if there is a deviation from the debt target. For example, now there is no guidance on the path of
fiscal adjustment in order to reach the 2018 debt target.
Fund staff proposed to target adjustments in the structural primary balance excluding grants
(SPBEG) as the operational fiscal anchor for reaching the debt ceiling. The SPBEG would have
the advantage of removing the variables that are not directly under the control of the authorities,
such as the cyclical element of the balance, interest rates, and grants. By focusing on the
structural fiscal balance one targets the true stance of fiscal policy over the economic cycle.
Moreover, the primary deficit is the deficit concept most closely related to reaching the debt
target. Finally removing grants from the target does not require the authorities to make ad-hoc inyear budget adjustments, which tend to be inefficient. Adopting such an operational fiscal anchor
would allow the government to comply with the debt law in the case of a debt stock outside its
control and would thus contribute to the credibility of the law.
The size of the annual adjustment of the SPBEG should be related to the deviation from the debt
law target. Adjustments should continue until the SPBEG level is reached that is consistent with
the long-term debt ceiling–which is usually a few years before the debt target is reached. Staff
calculations suggest that annual improvements in the SPBEG of about ¼ percentage points of
GDP over 2011–14 would reduce the SPBEG to a deficit of around ½ percent of GDP in 2014
compared to 1½ percent under the authorities current fiscal plans. With such an adjustment the
debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 46 percent at end-2016 compared to 50 percent under the
authorities’ plans. Targeting this moderately more ambitious fiscal adjustment would allow to
lower Mauritius’ debt level sustainably without unduly affecting the economic cycle.
The precise formulation of the operational fiscal anchor in Mauritius would benefit from further
public discussion and, if adopted, institutional strengthening. For example, the authorities might
prefer the structural balance including grants for greater simplicity even if this complicates
budgetary implementation. In order to create the highest level of transparency and credibility for
the formulation of the fiscal anchor, the projections required for growth, interest rates, grants,
and the cyclical adjustments should be made by an independent fiscal commission. This
commission would calculate and publish the required fiscal adjustment for each new budget,
which should be binding except if a super majority in parliament votes for a deviation from the
recommended fiscal stance.

Appendix 6. Mauritius: Options for Environmental Tax Reform1
Mauritius is one of the pioneers of promoting environmentally sustainable development through
green taxation. The Maurice Ile Durable (MID) levy, introduced in 2008, is close to the ideal
carbon tax that should be considered for implemented in other countries. Motor fuel taxes are
sizable, but appear to be justified on environmental grounds. The government of Mauritius is
interested in a transition towards a system of vehicle ownership taxes that would promote
environmental objectives. Mauritius has implemented taxes to curtail the use of plastic shopping
bags which are harmful to wildlife and the environment. And plans are being considered to
address traffic congestion in Port Louis through road pricing, an approach that has been
advocated by transportation economists for over fifty years. Although significant progress has
been made, important challenges remain, not least the problem of relentlessly rising traffic
congestion, which will require continued development of novel tax approaches. And the reform
of vehicle taxation requires careful assessment.
Carbon policy. The MID, which is currently levied on fossil fuels on a volume basis, could be
converted into an explicit carbon tax. In this case, the tax on a fuel would equal its CO2 potential
per unit, times the CO2 tax. The pattern of fuel taxes would not be very different under the
carbon tax (for same projected revenue yield). However, this change would make carbon policy
in Mauritius more transparent, and would facilitate comparison with carbon pricing in other
countries. The tax on CO2 could be progressively increased over time up to a level that fully
takes into account environmental damages.
Road congestion. The costs of time lost due to road congestion swamp the costs of automobile
pollution and urban gridlock is a growing impediment to healthy economic growth. Preliminary
staff estimates suggest that external costs per kilometer driven from congestion are over ten
times the combined costs from local pollution and CO2 per kilometer.
Although the capacity of the Mauritian transportation system needs improvement (possibly by
adding light rail service to Port Louis), road congestion will always be excessive, unless
motorists are charged for their impact on adding to congestion and increasing delay for other
road users. Ultimately, countries would benefit from implementing (as Germany has done for
trucks) a nationwide Global Positioning System (GPS) for charging motorists for each kilometer
driven, where the charge is higher for urban driving, especially at peak periods. This policy

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

would exploit all of the possible behavioral responses for reducing driving on busy roads (e.g.,
encouraging people to commute earlier or later to avoid the peak of the rush hour, to car pool, to
use public transport rather than drive, to reduce their overall number of trips, to re-locate to jobs
and residences outside of busy downtown areas). Under such a system, prices are adjusted as
needed to maintain reasonable traffic flows: although most people would continue to drive
despite these tolls, typically it only takes a fairly modest reduction in the number of vehicles to
significantly improve travel speeds on clogged roads. Concerns about centralized information
collection of people’s driving habits would need to be addressed, however. A first step in a
gradual transition to this pricing system could be achieved through re-structuring the annual road
tax (see below).
In the meantime, more practical pricing policies to reduce congestion include the proposed
cordon toll for Port Louis. Cordon-pricing schemes are inefficient in that they impose the same
fee regardless of the distance travelled by an individual motorist and can also exacerbate
congestion elsewhere in the road network, as people change their routes to bypass the pricing
region. Nonetheless, well-designed pricing schemes in Singapore, London, and Stockholm have
been reasonably effective at alleviating congestion.
The cordon toll at peak period could be set at a level that reflects the external costs of congestion
from a motorist driving within the tolled area. According to preliminary estimates, the external
congestion cost caused by an extra kilometer driven is in the order of Rs 20 for peak driving in
Port Louis. The appropriate cordon toll would equal this amount times the average trip distance
(in and out) of the tolled area, which is approximately the diameter (in kilometers) of the tolling
area (if the typical motorist drives to the center and back). It is also important that the toll rises
and falls progressively during course of the rush hour to encourage people to depart before, or
after, the peak hour and thereby “flatten” the pattern of trips. To help accommodate this,
employers should be encouraged to offer more flexible work schedules. All routes into the
downtown area should be covered by the toll, and motorbikes should be charged a smaller toll
than cars, as they take up less road space.
Fuel taxes. Preliminary estimates suggest that the level of taxes on both gasoline and diesel fuel
(accounting for excises and various other levies) is about right, when account is taken of their
beneficial impact on reducing congestion, accidents, and pollution. Therefore, changes in the
level of these taxes would not be necessary from an environmental point of view.

Vehicle taxation. Existing proposals to levy a graduated system of vehicle excise duties on CO2
per kilometer will be more effective in improving vehicle fuel economy than existing taxes
levied on engine capacity. However, the proposals do not address critical issues including
maintenance of revenue; providing equal rewards for emissions reductions across different
vehicles (which is important for a cost-effective policy); discouraging vehicle use (to reduce CO2
and, more important, traffic congestion); and simplifying the tax system (so consumers better
understand the tax implications of their vehicle choices).
An excise tax system with two components could be a better solution. The first component is a
(revenue-neutral) “feebate” system where relatively fuel inefficient vehicles are taxed in
proportion to the difference between their CO2 per kilometer relative to that of the average
vehicle (observed in the previous year) while relatively fuel efficient vehicles receive a
proportional rebate. The feebate (which is widely supported by economists as a fuel economy
policy) provides an ongoing incentive to keep reducing CO2 per kilometer for every vehicle. The
tax rate is easily adjusted over time, depending on how quickly policymakers wish to increase
fuel economy. A value of around Rs 2,000 per gram would be broadly consistent with implicit
taxes in other proposals. However, the initial level of the tax/rebate could be more or less
aggressive based on policy preferences.
The feebate is cost effective as it provides the same reward, regardless of how CO2 reductions
come about, and therefore strikes the right balance between fuel economy improvements in small
vehicles, medium vehicles, and large vehicles, and shifting people from large vehicles to medium
vehicles, and from medium vehicles to small vehicles. In contrast, other proposals tend to rely
too heavily on shifting people into small vehicles and do too little to exploit reductions in CO2
per kilometer through other behavioral responses.
The second component is an ad valorem excise on vehicle purchases chosen to meet revenue
requirements (alternatively the tax could be graduated, although the feebate already imposes a
penalty on large and luxury vehicles with high CO2 per kilometer relative to small vehicles
receiving rebates). Revenues are maintained under this system, even if some people shift towards
smaller vehicles—in contrast, revenues are eroded under proposals that induce people into low
CO2 per kilometer vehicles by offering them low or zero tax rates.
Over the medium term, to raise the marginal costs of driving and reduce congestion, the annual
road tax could be converted into a tax on annual kilometers driven, as measured initially by
odometer recordings (odometer fraud need not be a major problem with computerized readings

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

and suitable penalties for fraud). At the same time, a progressive switch to GPS monitoring over
the longer term should also be encouraged through lower taxation for drivers who voluntarily
demonstrate (via GPS) that their driving is predominantly rural or off-peak. As more drivers opt
for GPS monitoring, the toll for odometer-metered cars could rise progressively, and once a
critical mass of drivers have GPS this could ultimately be mandated for all drivers. A less radical
alternative would be a further increase in the level of motor fuel taxes, perhaps made revenue
neutral with corresponding reductions in vehicle ownership taxes. This would increase the
marginal costs of driving, though it would not begin the transition to (far more effective) GPSbased tolling.
Car insurance. A complementary policy to address excessive vehicle use and congestion is the
use of tax incentives to encourage a progressive transition to “pay-as-you-drive” car insurance.
Under this approach, annual insurance payments vary in direct proportion to annual mileage
which discourages vehicle use through raising the marginal costs of driving.
Further possible improvements. One could consider scaling back the subsidy for liquefied
petroleum gas (which undermines environmental objectives); implementing deposit-refund
schemes for hazardous products (e.g., batteries, tires, computer monitors); and studying the
feasibility of “pay-by-the bag” to reduce household waste and promote recycling.

Appendix 7. Mauritius: Export Performance and Outlook1
For a small open economy exports represent the main source of long-term growth.
However, the global recession showed that demand fluctuations in destination markets are the
main source of shocks for such economies. Analyzing Mauritius’ export performance could help
identify past constraints and future sources of growth. While acknowledging the growing
importance of exports of services (tourism and financial services in particular), the analysis
focused exclusive on goods exports, primarily for data availability reasons.2

Export diversification by product and destination. The real value of goods exports (in US$
deflated by US CPI) has been stagnant. Textiles and sugar, the two categories that accounted for
much of Mauritius’ successes through the eighties, have shrunk between 1993 and 2009 by
60 and 40 percent respectively. Fisheries grew six fold—albeit from a low base—and surpassed
sugar in 2009. However, much of the growth in early 2000s and the slowdown since 2006 were
driven by other exports, which warrants a closer look at the disaggregated export basket.
The total number of products exported by Mauritius grew some 57 percent from 1993 to 2009
(for a total of around 2500 products), which compares positively to other small open economies
(Figure 2). However, the number of goods has stagnated since 2004, and Mauritius failed to
increase the number of export goods surpassing constant US$1 million, which remained at
around 110, while several other countries increased this number.

The Hirfindahl accounts both for number of goods and their relative shares in the basket. Computed as the sum of
squared percentage shares of products in the total basket. Higher values indicate a higher concentration, the
maximum being 10000 (one good accounts for 100 percent of exports).

in the Harmonized System). Suppose a country filled in 1993 only 7 cells of this product-country
matrix, by exporting 4 products (P1 through P4) to 3 countries (A through C). The numbers
within cells represent the value of exports of each product-destination (PD) combination, which
sum up to 26. Note that only P1 is exported to all three countries. The 3-by-4 PD subset in which
all exports are located is called the potential PD space (outlined with bold line), and defines
quadrant I. By 2009 exports doubled to 52 in value. 42 percent of this growth was on account of
old goods to old destinations (surviving PD). Filling cells within the old potential PD space
(P4 to C) accounts for 12 percent of growth. Sending old goods to new destinations (quadrant
II) accounts for 19 percent of growth; new goods to old destinations (quadrant III) account for
31 percent of growth; and new products to new destinations (quadrant IV) account for 4 percent.
Finally, the death of old PD combinations (P3 no longer exported to B) has a negative
contribution of 8 percent.

Figure 5 presents the results of export growth decomposition between 1993 and 2009 for
12 countries (right panel normalizes all bars to 100). For Mauritius, we have also looked at
subsets that exclude just sugar, or sugar, textile and fishing (MUS w/o top 3 exports). The
contraction of traditional exports in Mauritius as well as the death of old PD more than offset the
positive sources of growth, which explains the overall contraction of exports. However, the most
important positive contributors to growth is exporting an “old” product to a country to which
Mauritius previously exported other goods (filling the gaps in the 1st quadrant in Figure 4). Also,
Mauritius, along with most all countries in the sample, obtained more growth from the
introduction of new products than from penetrating new destinations.

Sophistication of exports can be measured using the EXPY index, introduced by Hausmann,
Hwang, Rodrik (2006). It is a useful tool for tracking structural transformation of tradables and a
good predictor of future growth. The index is based on the observation that rich countries and
poor countries export different goods (wrist-watches vs. cotton). A country that manages to
export a basket of products that is characteristic for a richer country can be regarded as having
achieved relatively high level of sophistication. The index is constructed in two stages. First an
intermediate index PRODY is computed for each product as the average GDP/capita of exporters
of that good (for example, the PRODY for wrist watches is $31,651). EXPY for a country is then
computed as the average PRODY of exported products, weighted by the value of each good in
the export basket.

The left panel in Figure 6 shows that Mauritius’ EXPY is lower than predicted, i.e. its exports are
less sophisticated than expected. Mauritius is below the regression line because the three major

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT MAURITIUS

exports—sugar, textiles and fish—are goods associated with relatively poor countries (low
PRODY). Once these goods are excluded from the analysis, EXPY rises to around the predicted
level. Unfortunately, the EXPY of Mauritius has remained flat flat since around 2003, signaling
a slow-down in innovation and expansion into new industries.
Conclusions and policy implications. Until the mid-2000s, Mauritius made progress on all
export fronts—value, diversification, and sophistication.The stagnation since 2004–05 points to
important constraints faced by the traded goods sector. These could probably be traced to
bottlenecks in infrastructure, but further investigations are warranted.
The export growth decomposition exercise shows that experimentation is going on: new productdestinations have emerged, some old ones have disappeared. This experimentation is a sign of
healthy competition and structural transformation, and there is probably scope for supporting
firms launching new export products. Regarding trade policy going forward, trade diplomacy is
likely to work best when bringing existing products to markets to which Mauritius already
exports. At the same time, the analysis shows that while new products are being exported, almost
none of them reach large scale, indicating potential scope for supporting export-oriented
enterprises through consulting services rendered by the export promoting agency and the
chambers of commerce.

(JMAP). The team from the World Bank comprised Mr. Muñoz (country economist) and from the IMF,
Messrs. Petri, Culiuc, Svirydzenka, and Parry (all AFR).

The IMF’s work program entails continued engagement through the Article IV consultation process as
well as technical assistance in Program Based Budgeting provided through the Fiscal Affairs Department

The World Bank’s work program entails continuing work on infrastructure, competitiveness, public
sector reform, social sectors and social protection. The 2007-2013 World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy for Mauritius aims at helping the Government to deal with (i) short-term trade shocks and (ii)
the transition to a more competitive and diversified economy, while minimizing negative social impacts
along the transition. Because the Country Partnership Strategy sets out a broad program, specific
activities are determined every year through the Annual Business Plan meeting held jointly with the
government and Development Partners and formal consultations between the Bank and the
government.

Appendix III. Relations with the African Development Bank Group
(As of February 28, 2011)
The African Development Bank (AfDB)’s assistance to Mauritius combines lending and non-lending
activities. The lending program has focused on infrastructure development in agriculture and
transportation and the non-lending on economic and sector work (ESW) in health, poverty reduction,
debt management, gender and social inclusion. The largest on-going lending operation is a policy-based
lending in form of direct budget support aimed at supporting the country’s competitiveness and public
sector efficiency. Conditions for the first tranche have been met and about US$150 million has been
disbursed. A review of the operation will be conducted in April, 2011. The Bank is also providing a MIC
grant to support the Sewerage Master Plan, ICT and sector strategies to improve the Performance based
budgeting (PBB). In line with its Regional Integration Strategy for Southern African, the Bank is
supporting the country’s vision of becoming a regional center of excellence. In this area the Bank is
working with the IOC, COMESA and SADC to support the recently launched Regional Multi-Disciplinary
Centre of Excellence. Under the NEPAD Program, ADB has collaborated with the UNDP, African Union
(AU), and ECA on the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), for which Mauritius is one of the four
pilot cases. The Bank is also collaborating with the Commonwealth Secretariat in supporting Capacity
Building for Public Debt Management. Past collaboration with the World Bank (and other partners) has
included the following sectors: water, sewerage, and sanitation (the Plaines Wilhems Sewerage Project)
and transport (Southeastern Highway). A close working relationship has developed between the two
institutions during the preparation and appraisal of the first and second development policy Loans.
Further collaboration is envisaged as the World Bank will be preparing their third development policy
loan for Mauritius.

Appendix IV. Statistical Issues

MAURITIUS—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of February 22, 2011
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. However, balance of payments (BOP) and
international investment position (IIP) statistics could be improved to meet SDDS requirements. The
authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Coverage and accuracy
of BOP and IIP statistics have diminished as a consequence of the growth of global business license
holders. The authorities are in the process to reinforce the statistical framework to accelerate the
adherence of Mauritius to the SDDS. Already, there were significant improvements in reducing the
errors and omissions category in the BOP statistics.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Participant in the GDDS since September 2002. The A data ROSC report was published in August 2008.
authorities have a time-bound action plan to improve
coverage of BOP and IIP statistics that, when
completed, should help them be in a position to
subscribe to the SDDS by about end-2011.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/49
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 3, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Mauritius
On April 14, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Mauritius, and considered and endored the staff appraisal without a
meeting.1
Background

The Mauritian economy recovered in 2010 and the outlook for 2011 is positive. Real GDP
growth is estimated to have accelerated to 4 percent (compared with 3 percent in 2009), driven
by strong growth in fishing, ICT, and financial industries. Taking account of the expected upturn
in the world economy and the continuing effects of the fiscal stimulus, real GDP growth is
projected at 4.1 percent in 2011. The average inflation rate was low at 2.9 percent in 2010,
although it accelerated to 6.1 percent at end-year. Year-on-year inflation is expected to increase
to 5¾ percent in 2011, on the back of further projected increases in commodity prices,
increases in excise duties, and administered prices, resulting in average inflation of 7½ percent.
Driven by a surge in imports, the 2010 current account deficit widened to 9½ percent of GDP,
and is projected to widen further to 12 percent of GDP as strong export growth will be
overshadowed by higher commodity import prices and large imports related to public

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of
the Executive Board as expressed during the May 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff
report.

MAURITIUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

infrastructure projects and foreign direct investment (FDI). Going forward, the largest risks to
growth would come from shocks to external demand, particularly tourism and FDI.
Fiscal policy in 2010 was less expansionary than originally envisaged due to delays in
implementing infrastructure projects. Total revenues decreased by ¾ percent of GDP on
account of grants. With higher spending of ¾ percent of GDP the overall consolidated fiscal
deficit (including special funds) widened from 2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.5 percent in 2010.
This deficit is projected to increase to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting the authorities’
desire to increase growth through greener taxation and increased public investment. Total
revenues are projected to decline marginally in 2011, reflecting lower nontax revenues and
higher grants. The expenditure mix combines essentially unchanged current spending levels
(more goods and services and less transfers) with greater public investment, much of it under
the PPP framework.
Monetary policy was loosened in 2010 to support economic recovery. Average inflation was low
at 2.9 percent, but increased at end-year mainly due to imported inflation. The real exchange
rate appreciated by 3 percent during 2010.
The banking sector withstood the downturn well. Banks have remained liquid and wellcapitalized, even above proposed Basel III requirements. The share of non-performing loans
(NPL) decreased and banks were profitable with 16.7 percent return on equity despite low
leverage ratios. Stress-tests conducted by BOM in June indicate that the domestic banks would
be resilient to significant increases in NPLs and losses on large exposures. Mauritius became a
member of the International Association of Deposit Insurers and is preparing the necessary
steps to establish a deposit insurance scheme. The nonbank financial institutions (NBFI) in
Mauritius intermediate a large part of international investment into Asia and Africa, and continue
to receive substantial inflows.
Over the past two decades, wide-ranging structural reforms, supported by prudent policies,
have established Mauritius as a top regional performer. Mauritius’ national statistical capacity is
being strengthened in line with its needs as an emerging economy, and subscription to the
SDDS is expected for end 2011.

Executive Board Assessment

In conclusion the 2011 Article IV consultation with Mauritius, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal, as follows:

The authorities’ prompt policy response over 2008–10 helped to cushion the economy from
the impact of the global crisis and supported an economic recovery in 2010. The fiscal
stimulus packages combined with monetary easing and various measures aimed at
preserving private sector jobs contributed to the rekindling of growth to 4 percent in 2010.
The policy measures included in the 2011 budget reflect the authorities’ intent to diversify
exports, restructure and deleverage enterprises, accelerate public infrastructure
investments, and improve the regulatory environment.
Going forward, staff recommended a less expansionary fiscal policy. With the output gap in
2011 estimated close to zero, staff recommends limiting the overall fiscal deficit to 4¼
percent of GDP. This lower deficit target is still compatible with the need for higher capital
spending to address infrastructure bottlenecks. Though Mauritius is well placed to comply
with the legally-mandated 50 percent of GDP debt ceiling by 2018, staff recommends a
slightly more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation path to further reduce debt
vulnerabilities and suggested to target the structural primary fiscal balance to achieve a
debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 40 percent over the longer term.
The central bank should closely monitor inflationary pressures with a tightening bias to
ensure that recent inflationary pressures do not become engrained. With the appropriate
early monetary policy response and wage restraint, the second round effect of imported
inflation should be limited. BOM’s measures to remove excess liquidity will likely reduce its
profitability and should be well coordinated with the government’s financing strategy to
ensure a smooth operation of the money and securities’ markets. Staff estimates suggest
that the rupee appreciated further during 2010 with respect to its estimated equilibrium rate,
although it can still be considered to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
Mauritius has implemented important structural reforms in the past, but needs to continue
with its far-reaching reform strategy to increase its long-run growth potential. Staff estimates
suggest growth rates above 4 percent require accelerated investment project
implementation, labor market reforms to decrease unemployment rates, and education
initiatives to enhance human capital, and structural reforms to increase total factor
productivity. Staff recommends improving service delivery and efficiency in the public

enterprise sector, particularly for water. It encouraged the authorities to expand their policy
of increasing the role of the private sector in managing state-owned enterprises. Staff
supports the authorities’ intention to diversify its export base, which relies heavily on
Europe.
Mauritius is a pioneer of green taxation and should continue to spearhead new initiatives to
support its sustainable development vision. The authorities agreed with staff that taxes are
the appropriate instrument to reduce environmental damages while preserving revenue.
Staff recommends converting a tax on energy products into an explicit carbon tax to fully
reflect the externalities associated with CO2 emissions and a tax system on motor vehicles
that raises the marginal costs of driving to reduce pollution and alleviate traffic congestion in
the capital area. Going forward staff encourages the authorities to continue to review its tax
system to make it more environmentally sustainable and growth enhancing.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
