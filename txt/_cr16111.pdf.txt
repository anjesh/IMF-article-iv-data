IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of San Marino

On May 6, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of San Marino.
San Marino’s economy remains in transition following the implosion of its offshore banking
model in the aftermath of the global crisis. These shocks resulted in the loss of a third of output
since 2008. Nonperforming loans increased to very high levels. The largest bank in the system
has required 13 percent of GDP in 2012–14, and a new support operation equivalent to 3 percent
of GDP is ongoing. A sound fiscal starting position allowed San Marino to use public finances
to support the economy, while deficits and debt remained at sustainable levels. The country also
made important progress toward improving the business environment and international
cooperation.
After six years in recession, the economy is bottoming out, reflecting the improved relations
with Italy and stable bank deposits. As a consequence, modest positive growth is expected this
year and over the medium-term. However, risks remain, as a weak financial sector continues to
cloud the outlook.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the recent recovery in economic activity, and noted that while
the outlook is improving, significant challenges remain. To turn the current recovery into
sustainable growth, they encouraged the authorities to press ahead with efforts to strengthen the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

banking sector, solidify fiscal buffers, and transition San Marino’s economy toward a new, more
diversified growth model.
Directors emphasized the importance of rehabilitating the banking system and addressing the
very large stock of nonperforming loans. They endorsed a comprehensive strategy based on
stronger provisioning, asset quality reviews, and recapitalization, where needed, to help banks
strengthen their balance sheets and place them in a stronger position to support the economic
recovery. At the same time, Directors supported further efforts to address regulatory, legal, and
tax impediments to facilitate the faster resolution of nonperforming loans.
Directors noted the repeated efforts at recapitalizing Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di
San Marino (CRSM), and stressed the need to restore its soundness and profitability, including
by making its current recapitalization contingent on a deeper reorganization of the bank that
quickly brings the bank back to profitability.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress toward rebuilding fiscal buffers that have served
the country well in the past. They considered a strategy aiming for a further fiscal adjustment of
1 percent of GDP over the next 4 years as appropriate to put public debt on a clear downward
path while creating space to deal with adverse shocks. With a view to making room for higher
capital expenditure, they supported measures to increase revenue, including through the
introduction of a VAT system. In addition, efforts to contain the public sector wage bill and
reform the pension system were encouraged. Directors shared the view that exploring external
financing options could help break the bank-sovereign link, diversify funding sources, and
provide an additional fiscal buffer.
Directors commended the authorities for their focus on improving international cooperation, the
imminent completion of the AML-CFT national risk assessment, and the exchange of tax
information starting in 2017. They noted that continuing and deepening recent efforts to
improve the business environment and labor markets would help attract domestic and foreign
investments that are needed to rebalance San Marino’s economy and promote robust growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 21, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: A subdued recovery has started to settle in. However, downside risks persist.
San Marino’s economy remains in transition following the implosion of its offshore
banking model in the aftermath of the global crisis, resulting in the loss of a third
of output.
Challenges: Lay foundations for sustainable growth strengthening the banking system,
realigning fiscal policy with new economic realities, and improving flexibility to enable
the diversification of economic activity.
Key policy recommendations:
• Financial sector policy. Speed up the unfinished restructuring of the largest bank.
Conduct an in-depth asset-quality assessment of the rest of the banking system
followed by appropriate contingency plans. Remove legal, regulatory and tax obstacles
to facilitate dealing with problem loans.
• Fiscal policy. Pursue gradual consolidation of one percent of GDP over four years to
rebuild buffers. Focus adjustment on containing the public sector wage bill, pension, and
health benefits. Introduce a VAT system with a revenue-increasing rate. Create fiscal
space for capital investment. Establish the sovereign’s access to external financing.
• Structural policy. Improve the business environment, including debt enforcement
and insolvency mechanisms, to facilitate the reallocation of resources to nonbank
sectors. Continue the current focus on international cooperation.
Traction of past Fund advice: The authorities undertook measures to achieve fiscal
consolidation. They are designing a strategy to address nonperforming loans in the
banking system, in line with staff’s recommendation. They are also in the process of
recapitalizing the largest bank in the country, but have yet to follow staff’s advice to
speed up its restructuring and improve its governance (IMF Country Report 15/94).

CONTEXT, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
The economy is bottoming out after six years of recession. The impact of the global

large financial sector (Box 1) caused an

recovery of about 1 percent in 2015. Industrial
production and car registrations increased by 2 and 3 percent, respectively, while labor market
condition stabilized. Modest growth of 1–1¼ percent is projected for 2016 and the medium-term,
on the back of rebounding consumption and investment, but this is insufficient to bring the
economy back to its precrisis levels.

2.
A sound fiscal position allowed San Marino to use public finances to support the
economy. In the wake of the output contraction, the central government balance turned to a
moderate deficit. In addition, public funds were used to recapitalize Cassa di Risparmio della
Repubblica di San Marino (CRSM)—the largest bank in the country—totaling 13 percent of GDP (in
three rounds of recapitalization). This has led to an increase in net public debt from virtually zero at
the beginning of the crisis to about 20 percent of GDP in 2015. Notwithstanding the low level of
public debt, options for budget financing remain limited, as the sovereign has not established
access to international markets.

3.
Headwinds from a weak financial sector continue to cloud San Marino’s medium-term
outlook (Annex I). The banking system is undergoing a sharp adjustment, with bank assets having
declined from over 600 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 400 percent in 2015. Moreover, the
recession in San Marino, but also in Italy where many banks have customers, led to a sharp
increase in nonperforming loans and weakened the banking system. Lingering problems impede
the functioning of the banking system and weigh on economic growth through effects on wealth,
the provision of credit, and tax receipts, and their resolution remains a key challenge.
4.
Other risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Prolonged slow growth in Italy, and
more generally in the euro area, remains a downside risk both through external demand as well
as through the quality of Sammarinese banks’ significant Italian assets. On the upside, the
normalization of economic relations with Italy (primarily San Marino’s inclusion in Italy’s tax
whitelist) could stimulate bilateral economic activity more than expected.
5.
In addition, as a euroized microstate, San Marino faces a number of specific
challenges. San Marino’s very small size results in capacity constraints—including skills shortages in
specific areas—, that limit the possibilities of economic diversification, and implies that even micro
policy actions, such as attracting just a few small enterprises or selling a small number of homes
used as collateral for nonperforming loans, often have macroeconomic implications.
Macroeconomic statistics exhibit gaps: no balance of payments data is available and national
accounts are published with a one-year lag. On the positive side, the country’s size has led to a
relatively consensus-based decision-making process and facilitates speedy implementation of
agreed policies. Although euroized, San Marino is not a member of the European Union (EU) and
the Eurosystem and therefore lacks a lender-of-last-resort facility. At the same time, its financial
system is somewhat sheltered from turmoil on international capital markets, as the banks are fully
domestically owned, not quoted on the stock exchange, and do not rely on (external) wholesale
funding. Over the medium term, the country faces the significant challenge of diversifying its model
of economic growth away from banking, and improving competitiveness to integrate its economy
more fully into the world economy.
Authorities’ views
6.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment that the economy is slowly returning to
growth. They see positive trends in employment and new business startups. At the same time, they
emphasized that the short-term costs of the ongoing efforts to comply with international best
practice (e.g., the introduction of extensive anti-money laundering practices and the transposition
of EU directives, see ¶20) and the implementation of deep structural reforms have thus far
outweighed the long-term benefits. Going forward, the authorities emphasized their objective is to
increase economic flexibility in order to improve competitiveness. They see promoting economic
diversification as the main challenge and remain strongly committed to continue structural reforms.
In this regard, they highlighted that capacity bottlenecks of the state administration and Central
Bank of San Marino (CBSM) should be addressed.

The banking system falls marginally
short of the 11 percent minimum capital
adequacy requirement. In particular, CRSM’s
capital position is weak, despite significant public
capital support, and stands at 7.5 percent—
€46 million (3¼ percent of GDP) short of the
minimum capital requirement. Excluding CRSM,
the system’s capital adequacy ratio was
13.1 percent at end-September 2015. However,
banks’ capitalization might be overstated, as the
level of loan loss provisions is relatively low.

Banks’ liquidity buffers have remained broadly stable. As of end-September 2015, liquid
assets cover almost 60 percent of short-term liabilities. The Sammarinese authorities estimate that
the recent Italian policy on voluntary disclosure of offshore assets has resulted in nonresident
deposit outflows of about €260 million until early 2016, and could lead to some additional outflows.

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

10.
The authorities should devise a comprehensive strategy to repair banks’ balance
sheets. Given the institutional setting (see ¶5), San Marino’s possibilities to deal with the problem
are limited and should be carefully crafted. The strategy should consist of the following steps:


Asset quality reviews (AQRs). Forward-looking AQRs for all banks are critical to reduce
uncertainty on banks’ asset quality. Recent on-site supervisory AQRs for three banks resulted in
upward adjustment of provisions. Given existing capacity constraints, the CBSM should consider
hiring external parties to speed up the process.



Provisioning. On the basis of the AQR results, the CBSM should require banks to quickly meet
the need for additional provisions in order to bring their NPL coverage ratios to adequate levels.



Capitalization. The increase in provisions is likely to bring the capitalization of some banks below
the regulatory minimum. These banks should be required to present time-bound market-based
recapitalization plans to the CBSM. The plans should include a predefined set of safeguards,
such as no dividend payments. Foreign investors could support recapitalization efforts, but
sound fit-and-proper standards should apply.



Resolution. Banks for which solvency deficiencies are unlikely to be addressed within a
reasonable period of time should be resolved. For banks deemed systemically important to the
domestic economy, the state could subscribe remaining capital shortfalls, while carefully
considering the case for diluting existing shareholders upfront.

11.
Dealing with the existing stock of NPLs remains a priority. As of end-2015, total NPLs
stood at €2 billion (47 percent of total loans or 140 percent of GDP). Of this stock, €1.1 billion
(57 percent of total) pertains to CRSM, mostly due to its Italian subsidiary (Delta Group) in
liquidation. Excluding CRSM, about half of the remaining €837 million of NPLs are related to loans to
nonresidents, mostly in Italy. This large stock of NPLs is a drag on banks’ profitability and inhibits
their capacity to intermediate and extend new loans.
12.
So far, banks have managed NPLs internally, but the three largest banks are
considering creating a joint asset management company (AMC). Three special purpose vehicles
have been established to deal exclusively with the impaired assets of weak banks absorbed by other
Sammarinese credit institutions (see Selected Issues Paper). The three largest banks are also
planning setting up a joint AMC, although, given the difficulty in agreeing on common valuation
criteria for transferred assets, the AMC is expected to comprise separate funds for each of the banks.
A more effective pooling of the NPL portfolios would help achieve larger economies of scale,
consolidate debtor positions, and could attract potential foreign investors. However, any capital
release should be avoided, since banks retain full ownership of the funds (see Selected Issues Paper).

Box 1. San Marino’s Banking System: An Overview
Since the outbreak of the global crisis, San Marino’s banking sector has consolidated substantially.
The abrupt deleveraging and the rapid asset quality deterioration revealed pockets of vulnerability in the
system. The CBSM played a key role in preserving financial stability, notably by quickly intervening some
small institutions in difficulty. As a result, between 2009 and 2015, the number of operational credit
institutions has declined from 12 to 7, one of which de facto operates as “bad bank” for another credit
institution, while the number of operative fiduciary companies dropped from 48 to 8 over the same period.
The two largest banks, CRSM and Banca di San Marino, account for 56 percent of total assets and deposits
of the system. On average, about 52 percent of the loans are vis-à-vis nonresidents, while only 25 percent of
deposits is from nonresidents.
Nonetheless, the banking sector remains very
large and vulnerable. The size of San Marino’s
banking sector, measured as asset to GDP, is
comparable to Cyprus and Ireland. Contrary to
most other financial centers, all banks are
domestically owned. Although liquidity buffers
appear adequate, on average, the lack of foreignowned subsidiaries or branches in the system
prevents the Sammarinese banks from having
even indirect access to sources of emergency
liquidity assistance. With average capital-adequacy
ratio at around 11 percent, high nonperforming
loans, and relatively low loan-loss provisions, the
Sammarinese banking system compares
unfavorably with peer countries.

Opening of the real estate market to nonresidents could further support the process.
In the domestic market, a significant share of NPLs is related to mortgage loans. An important factor
impeding timely and effective recovery of this debt is the stagnant Sammarinese property market.
The market has limited capacity to absorb a large number of foreclosed properties, reflecting,
among other things, existing restrictions to nonresident ownership. To improve the functioning of
the property market, the authorities should explore the scope for a gradual opening of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

Sammarinese real estate market to nonresident investors, in line with San Marino’s longer-term goal
to integrate into the EU. This would support asset prices and hence facilitate NPL resolution.
14.
Legal, regulatory and tax reforms would help deal with problem loans. While the
Sammarinese framework for debt enforcement is relatively effective, the insolvency regime is almost
exclusively used for asset liquidations and does not provide effective tools for debt restructuring. As
a result, the system does not maximize value by preserving the continuity of financially distressed
but viable businesses. To address some of these gaps in the insolvency system, the Sammarinese
banks have recently adopted a code of conduct guiding multi-creditor coordination during debt
restructuring. However, this process is voluntary and lacks mechanisms to make the terms of
restructuring agreements binding for minority dissenting creditors (see Selected Issues Paper). In
addition, the use of closed-fund AMCs by banks is complicated by a number of regulatory
requirements. Dealing with these issues more comprehensively will require further legal and
regulatory changes. Moreover, to encourage provisioning and write-offs, the current limit on tax
deductibility of 5 percent of total loans per annum should be reconsidered.
15.
Additional challenges arise from the cross-border nature of a large part of NPLs. Many
NPLs have a cross-border element, e.g., the borrower is nonresident and/or the collateral securing
the loan is located outside San Marino, mostly in Italy. This gives rise to legal obstacles that
complicate the management and resolution of problem loans, resulting in delays and high
costs. Improving the framework for bilateral judicial cooperation between San Marino and Italy
could help address these issues.
16.
Provisioning standards and bank supervision should be strengthened to reduce the
likelihood of similar problems in the future. To prevent NPL provisioning problems from reoccurring, the CBSM should gradually introduce more stringent provisioning requirements and
employ stricter on-site supervision. The start of the credit registry later this year will help improve
banks’ credit risk assessment. Macroprudential measures, such as limits to loan-to-value and debtto-income ratios, could also help mitigate the buildup of systemic credit risk in the banking sector.

The fourth recapitalization of CRSM in
four years is underway. CRSM underwent three
separate recapitalizations over the period 2012–
14 (Box 2). Its assets declined to €1.7 billion, or
121 percent of GDP by end 2015 (from
213 percent of GDP in 2009), including its Delta
portfolio of Italian loans of about €700 million.
Yet, CRSM remains undercapitalized, likely
under-provisioned, and loss-making. In
January 2016, at the request of the CBSM, CRSM
submitted a revised business plan based on an
estimated capital gap of €54 million, €40 million

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

of which would be funded by a tier-2 hybrid bond subscribed by the state. In turn, the state will
issue a €40 million bond, underwritten by CRSM and the other Sammarinese banks. These bonds will
be offered to the public, with placement guaranteed by the banks in case the offer goes undersubscribed. Merging a real estate company controlled by the state and the foundation (CRSM’s
major nonstate shareholder, see Box 2) into CRSM and the subsequent revaluation of CRSM’s entire
real estate portfolio is expected to close the remaining €14 million capital gap and provide an
additional €10 million capital to absorb projected 2016–17 losses.

Box 2. Past CRSM Recapitalizations
CRSM is San Marino’s oldest and largest bank. Even though its size has rapidly declined, it accounts for
30 percent of the system’s total assets (121 percent of GDP), 38 percent of total loans, and 30 percent of
customer deposits. CRSM is a domestic bank, majority owned by a foundation established by law in
San Marino for charitable purposes. Since the 2014 recapitalization, the state owns 46 percent of shares, as
well as the majority of voting rights. The foundation consists of some 160 individuals, who together propose
and elect new foundation members. The foundation’s resources are entirely financed by dividends received
from CRSM in the past.
CRSM was recapitalized three times over the period 2012–2014. The liquidation Delta Group, its large
Italian subsidiary, by the Bank of Italy due to alleged fraud in 2009 took a severe tall on CRSM’s
capitalization. As losses ate into its capital buffers, the bank needed repeated capital injections to meet its
minimum regulatory capital requirement.
The first recapitalization took place in late 2012. The government extended a low interest loan to CRSM’s
shareholders for €60 million, which the shareholders then injected into the bank’s capital together with
€20 million of its own funds. With this, the foundation retained its equity stake in the bank. In exchange, the
government obtained some concessions, such as the possibility to name the chairman of the bank’s board
and two other board members.
A second recapitalization was undertaken in early 2013. The bank issued subordinated debt for
€40 million, €35 million of which was underwritten by the social security fund. For the second time, public
support was granted with no dilution of the foundation’s stake and limited or no conditionality.
In 2014, the bank was recapitalized for the third time. The state injected €85 million in capital in
exchange for a 46 percent minority equity stake, as well as the right to appoint a majority of the bank’s
board members, in addition to the board’s chairperson. A government bond fully subscribed by CRSM
financed the capital injection. Despite repeated public support (totaling 13 percent of GDP), the foundation
was able to preserve a majority stake as well as veto power over any sale of the state’s shares in the bank.

18.
The modalities of this operation fall short of international best practice. The
recapitalization does not include upfront dilution of existing nonstate shareholders, who,
according to best practice, should be the first in line to finance losses. While offering the state
bond to the public is a step in the right direction, the authorities could have considered external
financing to fully break the bank-sovereign feedback loop.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

19.
To limit the risk of further public support, the current recapitalization of CRSM should
be contingent on a solid reorganization plan that brings the bank back to profitability. The
bank’s revised business plan continues to rely on overly optimistic assumptions even in the
envisaged adverse scenario. The plan should illustrate how the bank would be able to regain
profitability under a relatively conservative downside scenario, likely requiring a more aggressive
downsizing. Contingency plans need to be formulated in case the restructuring process is
unsuccessful. In addition, the state as the main shareholder should appoint experienced turnaround
experts to CRSM’s board and executive management positions. Without such measures, the bank is
likely to remain loss-making and hence the risk of future recapitalization needs remains high.
20.
Addressing the financial sector challenges requires close coordination among the
stakeholders and additional resources. Developing a strategy aimed at cleaning-up banks’
balance sheets and streamlining laws, regulation, and taxation calls for close coordination between
the CBSM, the government, the banks, and the judiciary. To this end, the establishment of a timebound working group could be considered. Furthermore, the CBSM requires additional resources,
and full independence in their deployment. Going forward, it needs sufficient capacity to bolster
bank supervision (including the AQRs), transpose EU directives (including the Capital Requirements
Regulations and Directive and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, as required by the
monetary agreement with the EU), and finalize the credit register.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities concur that banks’ balance sheets need to be repaired. They note that
capacity constraints have prevented speeding up banks’ AQRs. The central bank is working on a
comprehensive strategy to address the NPL problem. The authorities acknowledged the need for
close coordination in developing and implementing this strategy. Since insolvency procedures are
seldom used in San Marino, the authorities were of the view that improvements in the legal and
regulatory framework might deliver only marginal benefits. Nevertheless, they considered staff’s
recommendations useful and welcome. They stressed that scrapping the limit on tax deductibility of
provisions and write-offs might have substantial fiscal consequences, as the limit also applies to
nonfinancial companies. Thus they saw a temporary exemption from this limit narrowly targeted at
banks’ existing NPL portfolios as a more viable solution.
22.
The authorities see bringing CRSM back to profitability as a crucial challenge. They
pointed out that CRSM’s Delta portfolio consists of restructured loans, for which credit risk should
now be low, and note that excluding Delta assets, CRSM’s financial position would be broadly in line
with the rest of the Sammarinese banking system. To inform a strategy to deal with CRSM’s
restructuring, the authorities have requested IMF technical assistance. The authorities have also
started renegotiating CRSM’s ownership structure with the foundation, to better reflect past and
current state support.

B. Public Finances—Rebuilding Buffers
23.
With the fading of the one-off factors that supported the 2014 outturn, the central
government’s budget is expected to have been broadly balanced in 2015. The central
government registered a 0.8 percent of GDP surplus in 2014, mainly due to expenditure restrain
(1½ percent of GDP) and strong revenue collection due to concerted collection efforts of tax arrears
resulting in unusually high one-off collections. While 2015 data are not yet available, revenue and
expenditure trends thus far are in line with budget numbers. Revenue is expected to have decreased
modestly from 2014 as one-off collections fade and nontax revenue decreased reflecting less
income from transactions with third parties. Expenditure is expected to have remained flat, with
higher transfers to the social security fund largely offset by lower capital outlays. Gross public debt
declined slightly to 19 percent of GDP.

24.
The budget deficit is expected to turn to a ½ percent of GDP deficit in 2016. This
deterioration is driven by an increase in capital investment by €10 million (0.8 percent of GDP)
annually in 2016–18. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit is expected to remain close to
½ percent of GDP, as revenue is expected to decrease to 21¼ percent of GDP largely due to
dwindling profits of public corporations, compensated by lower current expenditure due to
continued containment of the public sector wage bill and an improved outlook for social security
expenditure. On current policies, gross debt is projected to reach 21 percent of GDP by 2020, taking
into account the €40 million CRSM recapitalization bond issued this year and the increased capital
spending, but no further recapitalization needs.
25.
The mission advised that San Marino should gradually rebuild the fiscal buffers that
served it well in the past. The planned additional capital investment in 2016–18 is appropriate, as
capital expenditure, which generally improves productivity and hence growth potential, has fallen to
unsustainably low levels during the recession. The resulting small projected 2016 fiscal deficit can be
accommodated, given that growth is expected to be in line with medium-term forecasts and debt
remains stable over the medium-term. Starting next year, once growth is entrenched, a modest
adjustment of 1 percent of GDP (compared to the baseline without the additional capital
expenditure, or 1¾ percent of GDP when compared to the baseline including the additional capital

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

expenditure) over four years to reach a primary surplus of 1¾ percent of GDP by 2020 would put
debt on a clear downward trajectory and create fiscal space to deal with shocks from the potentially
large contingent liabilities looming in the banking system. Under such a fiscal stance, gross debt
would decline to 15½ percent of GDP by 2020, and a contingent shock of 20 percent of GDP would
be manageable with gross debt peaking slightly above 40 percent of GDP (text table and Annex II). If
the economy were to fall back into recession, the authorities should let automatic stabilizers (e.g.,
unemployment insurance and wage supplements for underemployed workers) work fully.

Notes: 1/ Additional capital expenditure of 0.8 percent of GDP startingin 2016 is included in the baseline.
2/ Adjustment involves fiscal consolidation of 1% of GDP over four years, with 0.75% of GDP
additional revenue from the introduction of VAT in 2017.
3/ Shock senario assumes a contingent financial liability shock of 20% of GDP.

26.
Fiscal adjustment should focus mainly on expenditure rationalization combined with
modest revenue increases. Over the last few years, the government has successfully controlled the
public sector wage bill, which has shrunk by ½ percent of GDP. Nevertheless, it is still high and
expenditure measures should continue to target the public sector wage bill—both through wage
restraint and employment. In addition, the government has set up a working group to explore
options for pension reform to ensure the system’s long-term sustainability. These expenditure
measures combined could yield ¼ percent of GDP annually in each of the years 2017–2020, for an
overall expenditure reduction of 1 percent of GDP. The introduction of the VAT system next year—
for which the authorities have prepared draft legislation and consultations are ongoing—should go
ahead as planned, and should be used to increase revenue by some ½–1 percent of GDP, by setting

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

the average VAT rate somewhat higher than the revenue-neutral rate.1 Together with the revenue
increase, this will create fiscal space of around ½–1 percent of GDP to finance planned capital
expenditure of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2017 and beyond.
27.
Establishing access to external financing for the sovereign would help diversify
funding sources and break the bank-sovereign link. Given the expected small size of potential
financing needs, an external private placement or syndicated loan could be considered instead of
borrowing on international capital markets. Establishing access to external financing would provide
an important buffer to respond to shocks that could simultaneously raise borrowing needs and
leave domestic banks unable to lend to the government. The current low international interest
rates present a window of opportunity, as they limit the additional cost. In addition, an agreement
on a contingent credit line from the Italian authorities would provide a welcome insurance
against liquidity shocks.
Authorities’ Views
28.
The government agreed on the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers. Public finances
have stabilized after many years of recession and adjustment. Looking forward, the authorities see
the need for further capital investment, and at the same time are committed to further fiscal
consolidation to put debt on a downward path and be prepared for possible future shocks. They
highlighted that their policies and the ongoing modest resumption of growth have already reduced
the deficit and stabilized debt. To support the public pension system, the government obtained a
parliamentary mandate to study reform options to ensure the system’s long-term sustainability. The
authorities consider the introduction of the VAT in 2017 a priority, emphasizing this in public.
However, they note opposition to the VAT system from service and domestic trade companies,
whereas the export sector supports the change. Given this opposition, the authorities plan to set a
revenue-neutral average VAT rate, and phase the VAT in gradually. The government views the public
placement of the state bond to recapitalize CRSM as a step toward breaking the bank-sovereign
feedback loop. Going forward they will consider external financing options.

C. Structural—Seeking a New Growth Model
29.
San Marino made important progress toward improving the business environment and
liberalizing the labor market. Improvements in the business environment support a gradual
rebalancing of the economy towards industry and nonfinancial services. The government has, for
example, set up a high-tech business incubator, put in place a simple and fast online process to
establish a business (improving the country’s ranking by 17 positions to 76th in the World Bank’s
Doing Business ranking), and has simplified the registration of property. Recent changes to labor
market policies, such as establishing an entry-level wage below the lowest level in collective wage
agreements, and temporary lower social security contributions when hiring unemployed workers,

support employment. The government has also exempted small high-tech businesses in the
incubator from the slow and complicated procedures to hire skilled nonresident workers.

Price competitiveness improved modestly,
while net foreign assets remained stable. On the
back of the steep euro depreciation since mid-2014, a
proxy2 for San Marino’s real effective exchange rate
(REER) has now fallen close to its lowest level since the
start of the crisis, largely on the back of movement in
Italy’s real effective exchange. These available pricebased indicators and the stability of net foreign assets
at around two months of imports (Figure 2) suggest
no significant balance of payments imbalances.

Sources: IFS and staff calculations

32.
San Marino’s continued emphasis on international cooperation has paid off and
remains crucial going forward. Last year, San Marino (together with Andorra and Monaco) has
started negotiations on an association agreement with the EU. In addition, San Marino’s improved
openness and transparency enabled the conclusion of the bilateral economic cooperation
agreement with Italy and Italy’s inclusion of San Marino in its tax whitelist. Going forward, the
Sammarinese authorities should continue improving this cooperation with Italy. In particular, the
CBSM’s new senior management will need to rebuild and broaden the relations with the Bank of
Italy, which previously relied on a few individuals that were replaced. In this context, the recent
legislative change to allow the exchange of credit information with the Bank of Italy even in the
absence of a signed Memorandum of Understanding is a positive development. It enables the

imminent start of the credit register to be followed by the exchange of credit information with Italy
later this year. The expected completion of the national risk assessment this summer and the start of
the exchange of tax information in 2017 are further welcome steps.
Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities agreed on the need to diversify San Marino’s economy, and the crucial
role that international cooperation plays in this regard. They consider continued structural
reform important to facilitate economic diversification. In this regard, the authorities emphasized the
success of the high-tech business incubator as well as the start of Sammarinese business aviation
and cargo services at Rimini airport under a special agreement with Italy. Future plans include
upgrading the basic tourism infrastructure, to facilitate further private investment in this sector with
the aim of attracting multi-day tourists and increasing per-visitor spending. The authorities expect
to soon start seeing the economic benefits from inclusion in Italy’s tax whitelist. The broader longterm goal remains concluding the association agreement with the EU, fully integrating San Marino
with the EU’s four freedoms and thus leveling the playing field for Sammarinese business in Europe.

D. Data Provision
34.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but gaps exist. While
these data gaps are not uncommon for very small countries, San Marino needs to improve
timeliness of, in particular, national accounts and fiscal statistics and ensure consistency with
international standards. Balance of payments data are not currently available. Importantly, banking
sector data are comprehensive and timely.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
San Marino is emerging from a prolonged recession, but important challenges remain.
There are signs of a modest economic recovery, yet headwinds from high nonperforming loans in
the banking sector and the still incomplete restructuring of CRSM continue to cloud the outlook. On
the upside, stronger growth in Europe and Italy and the normalization of economic relations with
the latter could stimulate bilateral economic activity more than expected.
36.
A comprehensive strategy is needed to clean up banks’ balance sheets. The current
large stock of nonperforming assets is a drag on banks’ profitability and inhibits their capacity to
intermediate and extend new credit. Therefore, addressing the sheer size of the NPL stock is crucial
to safeguard financial stability and support San Marino’s nascent economic recovery. A policy based
on stocktaking, provisioning, and, where needed, recapitalization, would serve to repair banks’
balance sheets. The central bank’s focus on designing such a plan is welcome. At the same time,
regulatory, legal and tax impediments to NPL management and resolution should be addressed,
including by removing tax disincentives to NPL write-offs, enhancing the insolvency regime to
facilitate reorganization of viable companies, and relaxing the regulation governing asset
management companies. Lastly, to improve the functioning of the real estate market and hence

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

support asset value and sales, the scope for a gradual opening of the Sammarinese property market
to nonresident investors should be explored.
37.
The steadfast implementation of this strategy requires close coordination among
stakeholders and likely additional resources. Intensive coordination among the government, the
CBSM, the banks, and the judiciary is crucial for the success of the strategy. In this regard, the
CBSM’s attention to the NPL problem and to policies addressing it is welcome. It remains important
to ensure the CBSM is adequately resourced its tasks and can exercise its duties independently.
38.
The recapitalization of CRSM should be contingent on a deeper reorganization that
quickly brings the bank back to profitability. This will likely require more aggressive downsizing
of the bank. In addition, the state as main shareholder should appoint experienced turnaround
experts to CRSM’s board and executive management positions. Any injection of public resources
should carefully consider the dilution of nonstate shareholders.
39.
San Marino should gradually rebuild the fiscal buffers that served it well in the past.
These buffers have allowed the state to cushion social expenditure during the crisis and its
aftermath, and would be needed again to respond similarly to future shocks. An overall fiscal
adjustment of 1 percent of GDP over four years would put debt on a clear downward path and
create room to deal with potentially large contingent liabilities looming in the banking system.
40.
This modest fiscal adjustment should start next year. The additional public capital
expenditure from the budget of €10 million annually starting this year will help support the recovery.
The resulting modest deficit should be accommodated this year. Starting in 2017, the aim should be
to modestly increase revenue, while reducing current expenditure by ¼ percent of GDP per year in
2017–2020. This would create room to permanently accommodate the higher capital expenditures.
41.
The scheduled introduction of the VAT in 2017 remains a priority, while containing the
public sector wage bill and reforming the pension system are also important. The introduction
of the VAT should aim to increase revenues by ½–1 percent of GDP. Expenditure policies should
focus on further reducing the public sector wage bill, as well as rationalizing and modestly reducing
spending on public pensions and publicly financed health care benefits. In this context, staff
welcomes the authorities’ commitment to reform the public pension system and the recent setup of
a working group to explore options to ensure the system’s long-term sustainability.
42.
External financing options should be considered. This would help diversify funding
sources and break the bank-sovereign link. Since potential financing needs may be too small to tap
international capital markets in a cost effective way, an external private placement or syndicated
loan could be considered.
43.
The government took important steps to improve the business environment and labor
markets. Examples include simplification of the process to establish a business and register
property. The government has piloted streamlined procedures to hire skilled nonresident workers
for startups, and should consider scaling up such efforts to the economy more generally. It has also

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

set up a high-tech business incubator, where the first start ups are now operational and expanding.
Such changes are important to support rebalancing of the Sammarinese economy.
44.
San Marino’s focus on improving international cooperation has paid off, and should
be maintained. The opening of negotiations with the EU on an association agreement and the
conclusion of the bilateral economic cooperation agreement with Italy are important achievements.
The activation of the credit register should start as scheduled, thereby enhancing the cooperation
with the Bank of Italy and helping banks upgrade their credit risk assessment. Lastly, staff welcomes
the imminent completion of the AML-CFT national risk assessment, and the exchange of tax
information starting in 2017.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultations with the Republic of San Marino be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix II. Public Debt Sustainability
1.

San Marino’s gross central government debt is projected to stabilize below 22 percent

of GDP. Before the crisis, gross debt stood below 15 percent of GDP. Net debt was negative, as the
government held cash buffers in excess of 15 percent of GDP. However, the crisis swung budget
surpluses into deficits, which, together with financial support to CRSM amounting to 13 percent of
GDP,1 increased gross debt to more than 20 percent of GDP by 2013, while cash buffers decreased
to below 4 percent of GDP. In 2014, gross public debt temporarily dropped to 19 percent of GDP,
due to fiscal over-performance. However, the fiscal balance is expected to deteriorate modestly in
2015 –2016 and over the medium term, including due to higher capital expenditure. In addition, the
government is in the process of issuing a €40 million bond to recapitalize CRSM. In light of these
developments, public debt is projected to stabilize at 21–22 percent of GDP.
2.

The possible need for further bank capital support represents the main risk to public

finances and debt sustainability. A contingent liability shock scenario where further
recapitalization needs amount to 20 percent of GDP—reflecting a combination of further capital
needs from CRSM and other banks—would, without a change in the fiscal stance, dramatically
increase public debt, reaching 42 percent of GDP by 2020. Such dynamics may not prove
sustainable in a country without a track record of sovereign bond issuance and untested ability to
access external financing.
3.

Fiscal adjustment is needed given these observations. Staff’s suggested adjustment of

1 percent of GDP (compared to 2016 projections excluding additional capital expenditure) over four
years would put public debt on a clear downward trend and provide fiscal space for contingent
liabilities. Under these adjustments, debt would peak below 42 percent of GDP and decrease to
36 percent of GDP by 2020, even in the presence of the above-mentioned contingent shock.

11 percent was provided by the central government and 2 percent by the Social Security Institute.

Exchange Arrangements
Prior to 1999, the currency of San Marino was the Italian lira. Since January 1, 1999, San Marino uses
the euro as its official currency. The central monetary institution is the Central Bank of San Marino
(CBSM). Foreign exchange transactions are conducted through commercial banks without restriction
at rates quoted in Italian markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange. San Marino's exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those maintained solely for the
preservation of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant
to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).1

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 11, 2016)
Data Provision
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but some data gaps exist. Progress has been
made since San Marino’s participation in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) on
May 16, 2008, but important weaknesses in the statistical database remain, mainly due to resource
constraints. In January 2007, in view of their intention to participate in the GDDS, the authorities
named two national GDDS coordinators and announced their objective to increase the frequency of
website updates in order to improve data dissemination. As of March 2012, national and fiscal
accounts, as well as monetary and financial sector data are compiled according to international
standards, but some key statistics (such as real and fiscal data) are available only with delay and, in
many cases, are at a lower-than-standard frequency and level of detail.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts data for 1995 onward have been calculated in accordance with ESA95, and data
are compiled annually based on the income approach with about 10 months delay. The authorities
have also calculated sectoral contributions. As part of ongoing STA technical assistance on national
accounts statistics, production and expenditure approaches are being adopted. Consumer prices
and employment data are available monthly with short delays. An industrial production index based
on electricity consumption, launched in 2000, became available monthly in 2009. Consumption and
business sentiment indices have been compiled starting in 2007 based on annual household and
business surveys.
Government Finance Statistics
The authorities have provided data for the central government, state-owned enterprises, and social
security fund for 2004–15, as well as the budget for 2016. However, some of the data have not been
compiled in accordance with IMF standards. Financing items, such as amortization, are included as
expenditures while “borrowing requirement” is included among the revenues.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Since 1997, the authorities have provided balance sheet data on the commercial banks and the
monetary authorities to STA databases. These data are provided on a quarterly basis, with
approximately a six-week reporting lag. The authorities have introduced laws and took some
measures to improve coverage and timeliness of banks’ reporting. The CBSM has improved
sectorization and expanded data collection to cover the offshore asset management activities of
banks. The breakdown of deposits (and other assets and liabilities) between residents and
nonresidents and the breakdown of short-term credit by public and private sector components are
also available. However, there is no broad money survey. Data on nonbank financial intermediaries
are also lacking.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Mr. Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for the Republic of San Marino
and Ms. Marta Spinella, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 6, 2016

The Sammarinese authorities would like to thank staff for the candid and helpful discussions
held during the Article IV consultations and for the valuable recommendations and tailored
advice in the Report and Selected Issues Paper. They broadly concur with staff’s analysis
and, as in the past, plan to make good use of the accurate and detailed Fund’s
recommendations.
Overview
In the wake of the 2008 global crisis, the Sammarinese economy and financial sector were hit
by several concurrent shocks. Primarily of external origin, such as Delta Group resolution,
the shocks also highlighted the weakness of an outdated banking business model. As a result,
GDP contracted by a third and the authorities were forced to intervene in the banking sector
and financial market, promoting a substantial consolidation of the banking system and
directly recapitalizing the largest and oldest bank, Cassa di Risparmio di San Marino
(CRSM), of systemic relevance. The country’s large public financial buffers helped cushion
the impact of the shocks and cope with the significant decline of tourism and export
revenues, in the context of a deteriorating external environment.
At the height of the crisis, the authorities engaged in a comprehensive and deep reform
process designed to stabilize and then revamp the economy, based on rethinking the
economic strategy while consolidating public finances.
In the span of a few years, the country, is now on the road to recovery and stabilization,
though still confronted with downside risks. International relations have substantially
improved: in 2014 Italy included San Marino in its “white list”; in 2015 the European Union
started the association agreement negotiations and MoneyVal praised San Marino’s progress
in reforming the AML/CFT framework, which led, in April 2015, to the inclusion of San
Marino in the Italian list of jurisdictions adopting AML/CFT measures deemed to be
compliant with international and EU standards. At present, business opportunities with the
global community as a whole are expected to further and consistently increase.
The authorities are mindful of the risks the Sammarinese economy is facing, amplified by its
small scale, openness and capacity constraints. Hence, they remain fully committed to
continue on their reform path and broaden their agenda. San Marino is fully committed to

2
continue complying with international transparency standards, actively participating in
international fora, and fully endorsing best practices and standards in the financial system.
Macroeconomic Outlook
In 2016, as in the previous year, the economy is projected to grow at a moderate pace (1-11/4
percent), validating the positive trend boosted by the implementation of industrial sector and
labor market reforms.
The diversification of the economy remains a high priority on the country’s reform agenda:
establishment of a techno-scientific park, niche tourist initiatives, expansion of existing
tourism infrastructures, further developments in the cultural offer, are all sizeable expansion
plans, which might need to be developed with the material support of foreign counterparts.
Given San Marino’s capacity constraints, the authorities are cognizant that smooth, continuous
and consistent cooperation with foreign (especially neighboring) partners is of the essence
to effectively revamp the economy. Many international partnerships on critical
projects are being developed or consolidated and the authorities are relentlessly working to
endow the country with a flexible and business-friendly set of rules that could attract stable
investments.
Fiscal Policy
Despite the unprecedented challenges posed to public accounts by the needed interventions in
the financial sector and the consequent fall in government deposits, the authorities consistently
maintained fiscal discipline. Public debt has currently declined to 19 percent of
GDP after a peak of 21 percent and the reforms adopted since 2014 – subsequent to the
spending review conducted with technical assistance from the IMF – brought sizeable results.
The public sector underwent a profound and systematic re-organization which resulted in a
substantial cut to the wage bill. In the short term, the fiscal package on public wages
maintains incentives for early retirement coupled by a low turnover ratio, which should
further reduce public sector employment and the wage bill.
As for the public pension system, an ad hoc working group has been established to work on a
reform that would ensure viability to the system while preserving generational neutrality. The
authorities acknowledge that the new system needs to be built on solid sustainability grounds
to avoid funding shortages and/or public contingent liabilities. The appointed experts are
expected to deliver a cost-effective and socially acceptable package by the end of 2017.
Some progress was also achieved in streamlining health expenditure, in line with the
spending review recommendations, even if the work in this field is more challenging as the
health care system has become increasingly complex over time as many activities were
outsourced.
The most relevant measure to be adopted shortly is the introduction of VAT. Thanks to the
almost complete digitalization of the tax administration system – that among other benefits
dramatically increased the level of compliance – the authorities are confident that the
introduction of VAT will not cause major technical difficulties. The new regime should enter
into force in 2017, following a long and complex dialogue with all interested stakeholders,
and is expected to be initially neutral with respect to tax revenues, while improving the
efficiency of the tax system and, over time, enhancing tax compliance. The VAT rates have

3
not been finalized yet, but, most likely there will be two or three different rates for different
product categories with the highest rate expected to be lower than the Italian equivalent.
Financial Sector
The capitalization of the Sammarinese banking sector, with the exception of CRSM, is in line
with supervisory regulatory requirements; the banking system liquidity situation, despite the
pressures related to the Italian Voluntary Disclosure program, does not reveal, at this time,
systemic risks. The crisis legacy remains heavy, as the level of NPLs is still high. The
authorities are aware of the challenges facing the banking system and stand ready to
strengthen regulatory and supervisory standards and facilitate the transition to a new phase of
stabilization and growth.
The Selected Issues Paper underlines a number of critical issues that need to be addressed.
The authorities agree with most of the findings in the paper and do appreciate the dialogue
with the Fund’s staff on these matters. However, they believe the overall tone of the
document is too negative and does not adequately reflect the severe capacity constraints in
terms of human and financial resources that San Marino faces. The authorities believe that
some of the suggested measures require careful assessment as to their macroeconomic impact
and broad ownership to ensure successful implementation and positive outcomes. Similarly
interventions to instill health and vibrancy to the national banking system require also careful
assessment and broad ownership. The newly appointed senior management of the Central
Bank has started working with the Bank’s staff to enhance supervisory and regulatory
capacity in line with international best practice and foster a healthy and vibrant financial
sector.
Coming to specific actions: the authorities continue to see merit in conducting individual
Asset Quality Reviews on the largest banks, most likely during the already planned on-site
inspections.
The fourth intervention on CRSM regulatory capital underscored again the urgency to
strengthen the largest Sammarinese bank and put it on a path to full recovery expeditiously.
The authorities recognize the risks arising from the contingent liabilities related to this last
financial rescue. Those risks were weighed against the major risk of a systemic bankruptcy.
Work is underway to minimize in the future the state commitment in CRSM, with the aim of
completely dismissing its participation in the bank, once it has been restructured and brought
back to profitability. The government has received technical assistance from the Fund on this
critical issue and is carefully evaluating the related recommendations.
On the way forward, given the above-mentioned capacity constraint and the willingness to
strengthen the system as swiftly and expeditiously as possible, the authorities continue to
highly value in-depth technical discussions with Fund staff on the best way to improve the
banking resolution framework and implement Basel III supervisory requirements. The work
is underway and the Central Bank stands ready to play a crucial role in enhancing regulation
and supervision, although at this juncture it would need additional resources and funds to
fully fulfill its tasks.
After MONEYVAL and the EU Commission acknowledged San Marino’s progress in
advancing the AML/CFT legal framework towards full compliance with the FATF
requirements and the European AML/CFT Directives and regulation, the country has started

4
to work on a national risk assessment program which will further strengthen the
implementation and enforcement of the regulations. San Marino is also continuing to work
on the implementation of the OECD program for the automatic exchange of tax information.
Structural Reforms
The Sammarinese authorities are aware of the critical importance of providing the country
with a modern, wide-ranging and effective new business model. To this end, they have
worked unremittingly to improve the market sentiment towards San Marino, strengthen its
accountability and transparency and, ultimately, establish a new course for its future
development.
These underlying objectives shaped the spending review, tax reform, progress in anti-money
laundering issues, as well as scientific and cultural scheme currently in progress. At the same
time, the authorities adopted specific measures to improve the business environment and ease
access to the labor market. Since the law on e-commerce was approved, the number of
enterprises active in product scouting and basic e-commerce services increased dramatically.
The high-tech business incubator established to facilitate the development of a scientific and
technological park multiplied its connections with highly reputable researchers and
universities, paving the way for the establishment of joint-research projects.
Following on the programs launched after the consultancy of Prof. Ichino, a prominent expert
on labor market issues, vocational and training programs have continued to be promoted. Ad
hoc rules were adopted to ease the recruitment of specialized workers and thus facilitate the
reduction of human resources constraints given the size of the country.
The Selected Issues Paper provided additional food for thought on specific regulatory
limitations that might hamper a smooth functioning of the market and, even though the
authorities consider the Sammarinese judicial system overall effective and efficient, Fund
recommendations in this area will be, as usual, carefully considered.
The authorities continue also to pay close attention to the opportunity to open the real estate
market to foreign investments while preserving the adequate level of safeguard to the
territory, considering its peculiarity and dimension.
Among the main priorities are the continuing negotiations for an Association Agreement with
the European Union, aimed at completely aligning San Marino with the EU four freedoms’
framework, and the finalization of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Central
Bank of San Marino and the Bank of Italy. The credit register implementation is underway
and the prospects for a swift completion of the exchange of credit information with Italy are
very positive developments.
The maintenance of a constructive relationship with Italy is paramount for the Sammarinese
authorities, as it reinforces their endeavors to revamp the economy and ensure the welldeserved recognition of all the last years’ efforts to free the country from an image of opaque
tax-haven, which no longer reflects real conditions.
Finally, the authorities are cognizant of the need to further strengthen statistical information
and are committed to resume the work on this issue in cooperation with the IMF and pooling
the Central Bank and the Ministry resources at national level.

In conclusion, the authorities want to reaffirm their commitment to implement a reform
agenda that promotes an internationally transparent, open, flexible and competitive
Sammarinese economy.
