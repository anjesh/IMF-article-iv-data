PRGF Arrangement. The Fund supports Mali’s economic program for 2004-07 under a
PRGF approved in June 2004. Total access under the arrangement is SDR 9.33 million, or
10 percent of quota, of which SDR 2.66 million has been disbursed (Appendix I). A further
SDR 2.66 million becomes available on the completion of this review. The World Bank is also
supporting Mali’s program through both project and adjustment credits (Appendix II).
Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III. Attachment I is the Letter of Intent from the
Minister of Economy and Finance with the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.

The second and third reviews under the arrangement have been combined because of delays in
reaching understandings on fuel taxes. Understandings on the broad outlines of the 2006
budget were reached in a staff visit at end-August 2005, and the 2006 structural reform
program was discussed in October 2005. The authorities request a waiver for the
nonobservance of three structural performance criteria.

•

Political and Regional Developments. The domestic political situation remains stable. In the
National Assembly, the governing coalition is beginning to separate into two blocs ahead of
the 2007 presidential and legislative elections. The political situation in neighboring Côte

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Political and economic context
•

Mali’s democratic political system remains stable, with legislative and presidential
elections scheduled for 2007. Instability in Côte d’Ivoire continues, however.

•

Adverse exogenous shocks during 2004-05 weakened economic growth, budget finances,
and the performance of several significant state enterprises. Agriculture is beginning to
recover from drought and locusts in 2004, while the terms of trade declined 13 percent
in 2005 to a 25-year low.

The Article IV Consultation. The discussions with the authorities focused on the
management of recent exogenous shocks and progress toward accelerating growth and
poverty reduction. The policy response to shocks has been broadly appropriate and helped
maintain macroeconomic stability. Measured progress is being made toward growth and
poverty reduction goals.
•

Cotton sector. Following substantial losses at the state-controlled cotton company in
the 2004/05 season, the authorities reduced producer prices 24 percent for the 2005/06
season, following the adoption of a flexible pricing mechanism. However, progress
toward privatization of CMDT has stalled.

•

Oil prices. There has been a partial pass-through of international oil prices to domestic
prices, along with fuel tax revenue losses. A formula for full but gradual pass-through
and measures to protect the poor could better balance consumer and revenue objectives.

•

Food security. Sales and distribution of food stocks limited the risks of famine, but
nonetheless there were large food price increases. Internal and regional impediments to
trade merit further attention to lessen price volatility.

•

Enabling growth. The staff view an acceleration of growth as unlikely unless the
vulnerability to shocks is reduced and structural reforms, particularly private sector
development, are accelerated. A more explicit growth strategy is needed.

•

Fiscal space and poverty reduction. Economic growth, more efficient revenue
collection, and eliminating unproductive spending will be decisive in creating fiscal
space for poverty reduction over the medium-term. Increased external aid and
multilateral debt relief could also contribute.

Program issues. The PRGF-supported program is broadly on track. Performance on
quantitative aspects remains strong. Although the record on the structural program has been
disappointing, the program for 2006 would mark significant progress on addressing key
challenges. The staff supports the authorities’ request for completion of the second and third
reviews under the arrangement and waivers for nonobservance of three structural
performance criteria.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The 2005 Article IV consultation is taking place at an opportune time. First, the
current program is at the half-way mark, offering the opportunity to take stock of what has
been achieved. Second, the authorities are beginning preparations for their next poverty
reduction strategy (PRS) beginning in 2007, against a backdrop of higher aid and debt
reduction, and in this context are considering reform priorities ahead. Finally, there have
been several exogenous shocks that the authorities have tackled, with varying degrees of
success, that serve as a useful reminder that Mali’s economic performance remains
vulnerable to sharp swings in the terms of trade and climatic factors.
2.
Looking back to the 2003 Article IV consultation recommendations, the record of
follow-through on policy recommendations has been mixed, as discussed further in this
report (Box 1). The overall conduct of fiscal policy remains good, particularly public
expenditure management compared to peer standards. Nonetheless, substantial issues remain
particularly with respect to proliferating tax exemptions, and the potentially high liabilities of
the pension systems. The privatization agenda, key to raising investment and productivity
while reducing fiscal risks, has also experienced several setbacks.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Changes in agricultural output have been the primary determinant of output and
inflation developments since 2002 (Tables 1-2). Due to changes in weather conditions the
agricultural sector has not posted two successive years of positive growth since 1998–99.
GDP growth fell to 2.3 percent in 2004, as inadequate rainfall and a locust infestation
cut 2004/05 agricultural production by an estimated 10 percent (Table 2).1 Bolstered by
good rains, agricultural output is expected to recover in 2005/06 raising GDP growth to
5.4 percent in 2005. In addition, increased gold output in 2005 also supports growth, as
technical problems experienced in 2004 were overcome, though growth in the secondary and
tertiary sectors has slowed reflecting weaker private consumption demand. The food
production shortfall pushed 12-month inflation to a 10-year high of 11½ percent in
September 2005, on account of food price inflation of 22½ percent. Nonfood inflation was
2 percent during the same period. In October 2005, prices moderated substantially as food
supply improved.

4.
The external position has weakened since 2002, on account of both price and
volume developments (Table 3). During 2003–04, the current account deficit (excluding
grants) weakened by 4 percentage points to 9½ percent of GDP, principally due to a fall in
gold export volumes. In 2005, a 13 percent projected decline in the terms of trade to a 25year low, led to a further weakening of the current account deficit to 11 percent of GDP. The
specific shocks to cotton and oil prices are discussed in the following section. External
reserves, which had increased rapidly during 2000–03, fell modestly in 2004 and stabilized
in 2005, at a level of six months import coverage.

The crop year runs from June to May. In the national accounts, production is registered in the year

5.
As a result of the less favorable external environment, money growth slowed
in 2004 and 2005, after robust growth in 2002 and 2003 (Table 4). Broad money fell
2 percent in 2004 and rose 6 percent in 2005.2 Private sector credit growth also slowed from
near 20 percent during 2002–03 to just above 5 percent over 2004–05, partly reflecting
banks’ efforts to improve credit portfolios. Liquidity remains high in the banking system as a
whole, possibly reflecting undercapitalization, while compliance with prudential norms is
only partial (Table 5). The government has decided to recapitalize the housing bank (Banque
de l’Habitat du Mali) through a conversion of government deposits into equity (equivalent to
0.6 percent of GDP) while also strengthening its management and operations. A review of
commercial bank loan portfolios is nearing completion and will provide the basis for a
broader strengthening of bank soundness and adherence to prudential regulations.
6.
Budget implementation in recent years has resulted in a steady increase of
revenues and an upward trend in current spending, both from low levels. Revenue
strengthening derives principally from improved tax administration of both direct and
indirect tax bases. Increases in current spending have been broad based, reflecting higher
levels of employment, as well as transfers. Changes in external grants and loans explain a
considerable share of movements in fiscal balances since 2000. In 2005, fiscal policies
weakened: spending increased principally due to net lending of 1 percent of GDP to cover
losses at the state-owned cotton ginning company (CMDT) and higher foreign-financed
investment, while revenues were stable. The overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis,
excluding grants) is estimated to increase to 8½ percent of GDP (2 percent of GDP increase
on 2004).

In June 2005, the monetary authorities introduced substantial revisions to monetary and
related balance of payments statistics following a revision of methodology for estimating
intra-monetary union banknote movements (see statistical issues, Appendix IV).

7.
The progress of structural reforms was mixed in 2004-05, with both achievements
and setbacks in private sector development. In the cotton sector, the government
privatized a controlling stake in the cottonseed oil company, HUICOMA, with proceeds of
0.3 percent of GDP, although issues relating to the outstanding liabilities of the privatized
company remain unresolved. The privatization of the cotton ginning company (CMDT) into
regional operating units was pushed back from 2006 to 2008 to allow more time for
preparatory work on the regulatory framework and to strengthen producer associations.
Electricité du Mali returned to majority state ownership in October 2005, as a strategic
foreign owner sold out over disputes concerning tariff setting and investment levels. The sale
of government stakes in two banks was delayed by a legal challenge to one sale and
difficulties in mobilizing other official shareholders to join in the sale of a controlling
shareholding in the other.
8.
Public sector institution-building progressed at a measured pace. The government
continued implementation of a comprehensive plan to strengthen public finance
management. Significant progress has already been achieved on expenditure management
and control, especially the organizational changes in the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
initiation of computerization and completion of the audits of the 2003 and 2004 budgets.
Delays have developed on some aspects of financial controls, in particular the creation of a
Supreme Court of Auditors. The authorities completed a study of the criteria for the
allocation of social safety net resources (structural benchmark), albeit with some delay, that
recommends ways to improve the targeting of assistance. A planned study on improving the
efficiency and yield of property taxes (structural benchmark) has not yet been initiated,
pending the availability of the required technical assistance from donors. Plans for
decentralization and deconcentration of government functions, which is also proceeding,
hold out promise of improvements in service delivery. Overall, Mali has satisfied 11 of the
16 Public Expenditure Management AAP indicators, an above average achievement for the
region.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Coping with Exogenous Shocks
9.
Adverse exogenous shocks have unambiguously framed Mali’s economic
performance during 2004-05. The shocks have weakened household balance sheets, budget
finances, and the performance of several significant state enterprises. These developments
have also detracted from longer-term reform objectives. The Article IV consultation
discussions focused on the authorities’ policy responses to a sharp drop in international
cotton prices, rising oil prices, low rainfall and a locust infestation that cut agricultural
production.

is covered by CMDT and cotton
producer resources. Residual financing
needs will need to be covered in 2006 by shareholders (the government and/or a foreign
shareholder) based on 2005 audited accounts. The staff and authorities agree that close
surveillance of CMDT cashflow is warranted in order to clear payment arrears (Letter of
Intent ¶31).
11. The staff support the authorities’ efforts to bring CMDT back to profit in 2006.
Central to this strategy has been the implementation of a producer price protocol linking to
world prices. Consistent with the price mechanism, producer prices were reduced by
24 percent for the 2005/06 season, while cotton producers have maintained planted areas,
with the result that the CMDT is projected to at least break even in the current season. In the
Doha Round, Mali and other African cotton producing countries are seeking the elimination
by developed countries of trade-distorting cotton subsidies and have called for the establishment of a compensation fund for producers until such subsidies are eliminated. While
supporting these efforts, the staff have also pressed for concrete progress toward the

objective of privatizing CMDT in 2008 in order to bolster investment and productivity
improvements, as yields have stagnated against a backdrop of improvements in other major
cotton producing countries.
12. The staff and authorities

revenue objectives. This
recommendation is supported by
conclusions of a study of the distributional effects of fuel price increases that over 40 percent
of a fuel price increase is borne by the top quintile of consumers and less than 10 percent by
the lowest quintile.4 The authorities have concerns about the social impact of higher fuel
prices, particularly in light of sharply higher food prices in 2005, already high costs of
transport, and the impact of rising kerosene prices on the poor. Staff agreed that studies of
the impact of various pricing formulae, and the modalities of protecting low-income
consumers would be desirable prior to the introduction of a pricing formula in 2006 (LoI,
¶18).
13. The cereal production shortfall in 2004/05 along with its inflationary effects have
been a major issue for the Malian authorities in 2005. Cereal production declined by
between 16 and 40 percent according to different methodologies used by the authorities. The
combined efforts of the authorities and donor agencies appear to have been effective in
limiting the human costs of drought and locusts through timely distribution or sale of food
stocks. However, cereal prices increased by over 50 percent in the 12 months through
September 2005, driving food price inflation up to 23 percent. Rising inflation has increased
pressure for compensatory measures, including compensatory wage increases in the public
sector.

4

The distributional impact of fuel price rises and possible palliative actions is discussed in an
accompanying selected issues paper.

- 10 -

14. The staff noted that as the price rises are temporary, only short-lived measures
would be appropriate. The authorities concurred, though temporary measures including
import VAT exemptions for rice and maize appear to have been largely ineffective (possibly
owing to re-exports to neighboring food deficit countries). Proposals to introduce price
controls for rice were proposed but not implemented. Moreover, the authorities agreed that
all temporary measures would be removed as food prices revert to more normal levels in
order not to penalize farmers (LoI, ¶12). The staff considers that high transport costs and
regional trade restrictions have exacerbated food price variability and have supported high
cross-country and regional differences in cereal prices. As trade cannot quickly cover food
deficits, there is a close correlation between food deficits and inflation (Box 2). Accordingly,
efforts in future should be directed to addressing these constraints to trade both within Mali
and vis-à-vis trading partners. The authorities have stressed the importance of increasing
food reserves, which donors are considering financing at least in part, and are creating a
network of food banks that may help to reduce seasonal variability of prices, if well
managed.
B. Enabling Faster Growth and Poverty Reduction
Medium-Term Growth and Competitiveness Issues
15. The authorities’ aim at maintaining macroeconomic stability – by meeting
economic and monetary union macroeconomic convergence criteria – while
accelerating growth and poverty reduction through policies to increase diversification
and productivity. Staff and authorities agreed that the impact of macroeconomic shocks had
contributed to the nonobservance of convergence criteria for inflation and the basic fiscal
balance in 2005, and that the unwinding of the shocks would very likely bring inflation under
the 3 percent ceiling in 2006, and bring the basic balance back to surplus in 2007 (Table 7).
The staff noted a potential tension between increases of aid-financed current spending and
observing the basic balance criterion, an issue that is under review at the Union level.
16. An updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) produced by Bank and Fund staffs (to
be issued as a Supplement to this report) indicates that Mali broadly meets debt indicator
thresholds (defined by country policy and institutions assessment rating) for debt stock and
debt service in the baseline scenario but not for some alternative scenarios.5 A DSA scenario
incorporating the multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI) in 2006 brings debt indicators
well below these thresholds through the medium-term, and would ensure that the WAEMU
5

Four creditors accounting for 0.2 percent of Mali’s end-2004 external debt stock (before
HIPC relief) have not yet agreed to provide HIPC relief. Also, one non-Paris Club bilateral
creditor, accounting for 6.1 percent of 2004 debt outstanding, that is not participating in the
HIPC Initiative, has been providing 100 percent relief on debt service falling due on a rolling
basis.

- 11 -

ceiling of nominal debt to GDP ratio would also be observed going forward.6 The authorities
indicated that MDRI would not change their financing strategy of seeking a rising share of
grant financing, and restricting loan financing to highly concessional terms. They indicated
that a Fund-supported arrangement provided useful leverage in improving debt
concessionality.
17. Projections of the medium-term balance of payments show a steady improvement
in the current account balance (before grants) through 2010, based on a terms of trade
improvement (easing of oil prices and increased cotton and gold prices). The overall balance
of payments position would also strengthen, reflecting the improving current account,
projected increases of official external financing and private investment inflows, including in
the gold sector. The authorities stressed that ongoing efforts to decrease the volatility of
donor assistance would lessen vulnerability to aid fluctuations. Mali’s contribution to
monetary union international reserves would remain at six months import coverage (the
current level for the West African Monetary Union).

The authorities’ medium-term GDP growth objectives are set at 6.7 percent in the
current PRS (through 2006) and 7 percent in the framework document for the next
PRS (2007–11).7 Staff and authorities agreed that shocks to agriculture had contributed to
the recent growth slowdown. Over the medium term, growth potential would depend on
policies to encourage diversification, the quality of the investment environment (including
the strength of the financial system) and raising productivity. Staff expressed the opinion that
the authorities’ forthcoming growth strategy would need to clearly articulate a rationale for
raising growth above current PRGF projections, while taking into account the slow progress
of structural reforms and evidence of a difficult investment environment, that may also act as
a brake on growth. The staff medium-term macroeconomic outlook assumes average GDP
growth of 5.6 percent through 2010, stable inflation at 2½ percent per year from 2007, and a

significant improvement in the terms of trade, with the current account deficit improving from
11 percent to 7 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2010 (Tables 8-9).

19. The authorities recognize the importance of the policy framework for growth,
while also stressing the supply side potential of the economy. Key bases for growth
identified are: the development of rural infrastructure, particularly irrigation; agricultural
diversification (fruits and vegetables); the development of agro-industry (sugar, meat, yarn);
and expansion of transport, telecommunications and tourism service. The authorities
emphasized that their diversification strategy would benefit from the elimination of
agricultural subsidies in industrialized countries (by improving the terms of trade).

21. The staff noted that accelerating growth would require raising investment and
productivity significantly above recent levels. Historical evidence in explaining growth
pointed to a predominance of factor accumulation in explaining growth over increases in
total factor productivity, although there are signs of some improvement in productivity
since 2000.8 Moreover, the performance of several key sectors was not particularly

There are several impediments to external
and internal food trade as geography plays
an important role in market integration.
Food trade is primarily regional and
conducted by small traders. On the external
front, food export restrictions in other West
African countries have contributed to high
spatial and temporal price spreads in food
markets. Mali’s internal markets are not
integrated due to weak information and
transport infrastructure. Private sector traders
are characterized by limited capital, a low
degree of specialization, little long-term
investment. Market failures due to lack of
access to credit, storage markets, and
information have impeded the private trader
operations.

Rising food prices have an impact on the
macroeconomy and the poor in particular.
In Mali, the bottom quintile spent 84 percent
of their expenditure on food; thus, high food
price inflation has a significant impact on
living standards and on economy-wide
demand. Inflationary pressures can have a
negative effect on growth and
competitiveness and on the budget through
tax exemptions and wage pressure.
The combined effects of inadequate
rainfall and the locust invasion in 2004/05
increased the food deficit in Mali. The
cereal deficit in 2004/05 is estimated at one
third to one fifth of cereal production,
depending on the assumption used for dietary
requirements. The size of the cereal deficit is
closely linked to the level of cereal prices
(see chart).

Mali recently faced the challenge of rising
food prices and food insecurity. Food
constitutes 50 percent of the weight in the
overall price index (Bamako), and cereals
make up more than one-third of the food
basket. Thus food price inflation is a major
determinant of overall inflation.

22. The authorities have

investment as the basis for
developing a strategy to improve

the investment environment. Key
impediments that the authorities

identified (in consultation with an
Investors’ Council) include high
operating costs (owing to poor
infrastructure, excessive cost of energy and telecommunications), the proliferation of tax
incentives in neighboring countries, and distance from ports in the region. The crisis in Côte
d’Ivoire may also have deterred some investors. Private sector representatives also noted that
the lack of a skilled workforce was a major impediment. They also stressed that governance
was an issue, especially procurement procedures, the weak judicial system, and access to
financing. An Investment Climate Assessment conducted by the World Bank confirms the
significant impediments to private investment compared to peers. The staff underscored the
importance of maintaining cost-recovery tariffs for utilities, while improving productivity
through private management within an independent regulatory framework. The staff also
cautioned against the use of broad investment incentives and urged that the application of
Investment Code incentives be scrutinized carefully with a view to minimizing revenue
losses. The staff agreed that transport costs are a major issue, and indicated that effective
operation and funding of the newly-created Road Agency is key, and that reduced fuel taxes
on specific import routes was an inefficient method of reducing costs.

23. Trade reforms, especially unilateral tariff reductions in the context of WAEMU,
have advanced. The authorities indicated enhancing Mali's contribution to and benefits from
global trade would require (i) strengthening technical assistance with a view to better
understand multilateral trade agreements, (ii) implementing swiftly the Integrated
Framework so as to improve and diversify Mali's exports, and (iii) a sound and equitable
implementation of WTO agreements, notably a rapid elimination of subsidies and non
justified technical obstacles to trade. Mali implemented WAEMU anti-competitive practices
legislation in January 2003, complementing national legislation. Mali also implemented the
principle of transactional value to determine the custom value of imported goods effective

2004. Mali is eligible for AGOA and was granted the visa for textile products in
December 2003. As regards anti-dumping, pending adoption of the relevant WAEMU code,
reference values under a 2003 decree apply for selected products.
24. The slowdown in growth in 2004 has also impacted on the banking sector after
several years of rapid credit growth. Given less than full compliance with prudential
ratios, and evidence of a degradation of the quality of credit portfolios, the authorities have
strengthened surveillance of lending operations, in part spurred by the recommendations of
supervision reports. In this regard, the Malian authorities’ actions to address liquidity and
portfolio problems in the housing bank are commendable, although prompter action would
have significantly reduced the budgetary costs of recapitalization. A process is under way to
review necessary actions in other banks. The staff also requested additional information for
financial sector surveillance to better gauge the strength of the system and identify priorities
for improving intermediation and raising bank efficiency.

largest export sectors:
Mali’s share of world gold production is increasing and share of cotton production is broadly
stable). At the regional level, the exchange rate is consistent with comfortable reserve
adequacy indicators, in relation to imports, broad money and short-term debt, and in relation
to external shocks, indicating limited vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, the staff pointed toward
analysis that the long-run equilibrium exchange rate in Mali has depreciated, in part due to a
terms of trade decline, and that the adjustment of the actual real exchange rate to the
equilibrium is relatively slow.9 This in turn, emphasizes the need for flexibility of factor
prices to maintain a real exchange rate close to the equilibrium rate. Debt cancellation
coupled with higher government spending would however likely lead to an appreciation of
the equilibrium exchange rate, and equilibrium exchange rate estimates should be treated
with caution.
Fiscal Space and Poverty Reduction
26. Poverty remains widespread in Mali notwithstanding prudent economic policies,
and positive growth over the past decade. There are significant structural barriers to
development, including high illiteracy, low health indicators, undeveloped infrastructure and
distant markets and Mali’s progress toward achieving MDGs is mixed (Figure 2 and Table
10). Progress is more marked in access to health and education, and the spread of
communications technology. Clearly, accelerating progress would require both faster growth
and substantially higher spending on MDG-related objectives.

27. The discussion of medium-term fiscal issues focused on factors that could create
fiscal space for pursuing poverty reduction objectives.10 The authorities agreed that the
key factors that help to create fiscal space were GDP growth (leading to revenue increases
with unchanged revenue yield), raising revenue yields, eliminating unproductive spending
and more generally improving the efficiency of spending, while additional external grant
assistance could also make a significant contribution if aligned to PRS spending priorities.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Developments
Mali’s real effective exchange rate or
REER (trade weighted, CPI based) has
consistently been amongst the least
appreciated in the West African
Monetary Union, and tracks neighboring
Sahel countries REER’s. Since 2000,
REERs have appreciated modestly
across the union on account of CFA
appreciation against the dollar. The
appreciation is slightly more marked if
the REER is calculated using currency
denomination of trade weights rather
than origin and destination of trade
weights.

Over the longer term, Mali’s actual and

depreciated. The depreciation of the

particularly influenced by the declining terms of trade. Debt reduction would however support
an appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate, or equivalently increase the sustainable level
of the current account deficit.

28. The mission illustrated that the fiscal space created under the program mediumterm framework by 2015 could amount to the equivalent of 20 percent of current GDP.
Staff agreed that the projections of fiscal space were sensitive to the underlying assumptions:
lower GDP growth (4 percent rather than 5½ percent per year) and weaker reform could cut
fiscal space created by 2015 in half. Nonetheless across most scenarios, the most important
factor, accounting for over half the projected fiscal space, is additional revenue resulting
from expansion of the economy. The implementation of the multilateral debt reduction
initiative (MDRI) frees up an additional 0.6 percent of GDP per year in constant 2005 prices
(about 1 percent of current GDP over the medium-term), while a doubling of aid levels
by 2010 (consistent with, for example, a number of recent bilateral donor commitments)
would create fiscal space of 2 percent of GDP in constant 2005 prices (with the caveat that
aid flows are volatile and often performance-based). The authorities agreed that maximizing
internal sources of revenue was of paramount importance, while public finance management
reforms were directed at producing revenue yield increases without increasing marginal tax
rates, as assumed in the program. Moreover, eliminating fiscal risks such as cotton sector
support, pension fund losses, and recapitalization of banks could also help create or preserve
fiscal space. While the bulk of projected fiscal space is generated internally, staff noted that
substantially increased net external resource flows could also affect inflation and
competitiveness.
29. Linking fiscal space created to poverty reduction requires both discipline in the
use of the space and an analysis of the impact of spending on poverty reduction
objectives. Illustrative projections of the uses of fiscal space showed that only about half
would be available for additional poverty reduction spending even under optimistic
assumptions, specifically 10 percent of 2005 GDP by 2015 in the baseline scenario.11 The
potential impact of such additional poverty spending could in principle be estimated by
sector specialists in the context of the PRSP elaboration. For example, based on UN
Commission

11

This result is derived by assuming that underlying real spending increases at the same rate
of population growth for an unchanged level of public services per capita, thus reducing the
amount of fiscal space, and that of the remaining fiscal space 70 percent is allocated to
poverty reducing spending, slightly higher than the share in the 2005 budget of 65 percent.

- 20 -

for Macroeconomics and Health estimates, the cost of providing minimum essential health
services in Mali would require additional expenditure of about 6.3 percent of 2005 GDP
(three times the current level of public health expenditure).

30. The authorities found the analytical approach of fiscal space to be a useful
concept for linking fiscal and poverty reduction policies, particularly in the context of
developing the second generation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PSRP II). In
the 2003-04 progress report on the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the authorities noted both

- 21 -

considerable progress toward some poverty reduction goals and significant shortfalls in
reaching key Millennium Development Goals. In this connection, the Joint Staff Advisory
Note stresses the need for the PRSP II to include both a growth strategy and action plan and
an analysis linking the creation of fiscal space with the costing and prioritization of targeting
poverty reduction objectives. Constraints on absorption capacity, at the institutional and
macroeconomic levels, also require attention and, if necessary, plans for mitigating actions.
IV. PROGRAM ISSUES
31. The attached Letter of Intent describes the authorities program implementation
in 2005, specifies policy plans for 2005 and 2006, and requests completion of the second and
third reviews under the arrangement.
32. The authorities met all quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets and
financial performance indicators through September 2005 (Attachment I, Table 1).
33. The quantitative program for 2006 envisages a substantial strengthening of the
fiscal position (defined by the regional convergence criterion on the basic balance), while
net domestic financing is negative, reflecting the repayment of 2005 bridge financing.
Budgetary revenue is projected to increase by about 1 percent of GDP, on account of policy
and administrative measures (see ¶15 letter of intent), which is ambitious but achievable in
light of the upward trend of recent years. Containing the increase in current expenditures is
also feasible, given the track record of spending control, though pressure for public sector
wage increases constitutes a significant risk ahead. Staff view the 2006 budget as fully
financed on the assumption the envisaged external budgetary support is delivered. Such
support has been volatile in past years, in part due to variable reform performance, and also
poses a budgetary risk. Nonetheless, the program adjustor for shortfalls in budget support is
adequate for addressing short-term aid volatility.
34. The structural reforms covered by the authorities’ program continue to advance,
although with a number of delays (Attachment I, Annex II). The authorities have
implemented three prior actions for completion of the second and third reviews concerning
submission to the National Assembly of a fully financed 2006 budget, a revision of fuel
excise taxation and the termination of food import VAT exemptions. Of the four structural
performance criteria applicable for the review, one was met (adjusting cotton producer
price), two were completed with delay (announcement of a cotton producer price consistent
with agreed mechanism and beginning actuarial studies and audits of pension funds), and one
has not been completed owing to a court challenge (closing date for acceptance of final bids
for BIM). Accordingly, the authorities request waivers for nonobservance of three structural
performance criteria. Staff supports the request for waivers on the basis that two measures
are now completed after temporary delays, while the third measure (concerning privatization
of BIM) has been delayed by a legal challenge beyond the authorities’ control and they
remain committed to implementation as soon the legal impediment is lifted. None of the four
structural benchmarks through end-September were met on schedule: a review of the social
safety net program was completed with a delay, while the assessment of the impact of

- 22 -

parametric reforms of the public sector pension fund has begun and is expected to be
completed with a six-month delay. The study of electricity rates has been postponed to
May 2006, following the withdrawal of a strategic foreign partner, while the tender for BIM
was also delayed by the court case, and is now scheduled to be implemented by March 2006,
nearly a year behind schedule.
35. The structural reform program for 2006 makes further progress in addressing
the key challenges, particularly relating to privatization and addressing fiscal risks.
Approval by the Council of Ministers of pension reforms aimed at progressively reducing the
projected deficit of the civil service pension fund is a performance criterion for endMarch 2006. A number of structural benchmarks are also set under the program for 2005–06:
(i) submission of legislation authorizing parametric reforms to the civil service pension fund
to the National Assembly together with an implementing draft decree; (ii) creation of
commission for regular surveillance of cashflow to address short-term financing issues at the
CMDT; (iii) approval of a privatization strategy for CMDT by 2008 by CMDT shareholders;
(iv) approval by the Council of Ministers of a detailed operational plan for CMDT
privatization; (v) launch of the privatization tender for BIM (provided no substantive legal
obstacles remain); (vi) completion of the recapitalization of BHM, with a view to ensuring
significant private sector involvement; and, (vii) in the electricity sector, completion of a
management audit, a financial assessment and review of the electricity tariff-setting
mechanism for Electricité du Mali.
36. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) is likely to occur in 2006. Staff is
of the view that Mali meets the macroeconomic performance criterion to qualify given the
completion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement in March, 2005, the impending
consideration of the second and third reviews by the Board, and the recent track record of
satisfactory macroeconomic performance. In addition, staff is of the view that Mali meets the
criteria for poverty reduction policies and public expenditure management systems and
recommends that the Board determine that Mali qualifies for MDRI debt relief, subject to
continued satisfactory performance in implementation in those areas. The authorities intend
to program the resources to support their poverty reduction efforts, through either submission
of supplementary spending programs to the National Assembly or increasing provisions in
the budget. Resources freed up by MDRI could also serve to cover possible external
assistance shortfalls in 2006.
37. The proposed schedule of reviews and disbursements under the PRGF arrangement
remains unchanged, with disbursements of SDR 1.33 million available on April 15, 2006 for
the fourth review and October 15 for the fifth review (Table 11).
V. OTHER ISSUES
38. Capacity Building. Staff and authorities concurred that capacity building is an
important medium-term objective that will strengthen program implementation. The staff
stressed the need for a contact point that would play a key role in identifying and matching
technical assistance needs that are Fund core competences. The staff, including through West

- 23 -

AFRITAC, will work with the authorities to identify assistance in priority areas identified by
the authorities: (i) tax administration, including taxpayers’ declarations; (ii) computerization
of Ministry of Finance departments; (iii) strengthening the land and property department in
the context of the creation of a land cadastre; (iv) support for the large taxpayer unit (LTU)
to improve service provision; (v) petroleum product pricing formula’s linking to world prices
and design of measures to protect vulnerable groups from fuel price increases; and, (vi) wage
policy. The authorities have also requested a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP). The
proposal is under consideration by Bank and Fund staffs either in the form of a countryfocused development FSAP, or an assessment of the financial system in BCEAO members.
39. Mali’s statistical data is adequate for program monitoring and surveillance
purposes. Although the quality of data could be improved the existing deficiencies have not
significantly affected the staff’s analysis of key issues (Appendix III).
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
40. The Malian authorities have put in place broadly appropriate policies to address
the terms of trade shocks that have contributed to weaker income growth and
threatened budgetary objectives. Central to these efforts is the successful implementation
of a flexible cotton producer price mechanism in full consultation with producers. The new
mechanism protects farmer interests while also limiting risks of budget support to the cotton
sector. The decision to set seed cotton prices at the floor of the price range for the 2005/06
season tackles a significant risk that was hanging over the 2006 budget. Further, the
authorities have continued to pass through increases of international oil prices to pump prices
to protect budgetary revenue, albeit partially and with some delay. To safeguard 2006
revenue objectives, the staff supports timely implementation of a pricing formula for fuel,
once the necessary preparatory steps are complete.
41. Mali will remain vulnerable to further shocks, linked to weather conditions and
deteriorating terms of trade, and needs to be prepared to strengthen adjustment efforts
if necessary. While the policy response to food shortages was commendable, and contributed
to a narrow avoidance of widespread food insecurity, the efficiency of food markets remains
in doubt, with substantial spatial and temporal price differences. More attention should be
focused on impediments to food trade, particularly at a regional level. Further increases in oil
prices, and declines in cotton or gold prices, in the context of an undiversified economic base
and a pegged exchange rate, are also major challenges to continued macroeconomic stability
and growth. Stronger adjustment efforts may be needed, in particular maintaining a prudent
fiscal position and allowing prices to adjust.
42. The continued support of development partners has contributed to a relatively
smooth adjustment to the difficult external circumstances. While some donor budget
support has been delayed into early 2006 for procedural reasons, other donors have increased
their support in 2005. Nonetheless, the staff believes that continued increases in donor
support are contingent on concrete steps to open up the cotton sector to private capital,
financial management reform, and other operational reforms. The initial steps taken by the

- 24 -

authorities to improve surveillance of the financial operations of the state-owned cotton
company, CMDT, are welcome. To build on this success, a comprehensive business plan is
required to chart the course to privatization, a clear strategy to disengage the government
from the cotton sector while protecting farmers’ interests, and firm evidence that this strategy
is being implemented.
43. The staff recommend closer surveillance of the financial sector in Mali, and in
particular a significant reduction of forbearance as regards observance of prudential ratios,
taking into account the unavoidably high levels of exposure to the cotton sector. Increased
vigilance is called for on the part of the supervisory authorities, notwithstanding ample
system-wide liquidity. Within the constraints of prudential norms, the authorities should
examine ways of reinvigorating financial intermediation and private sector lending.
44. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, Mali does not
independently determine its exchange rate policy. Nonetheless, the staff is of the view that
the fixed peg of the CFA franc to the euro remains an important nominal anchor for inflation
and remains credible in light of the levels of reserve coverage. Moreover, the Union has
succeeded in substantially reforming the trade regime while economic convergence criteria
are useful discipline on the conduct of fiscal policies. Competitiveness issues are best
addressed through reforms that will reduce the costs of doing business and factor price
flexibility.
45. Implementation of other structural reforms under the program has been
generally disappointing and risks undermining both the program’s medium-term
growth objective and poverty reduction objectives. Although the privatization of the
cottonseed oil company is a move in the right direction, the broader picture appears to be a
waning commitment to pursue private sector development characterized by continued delays
in the disengagement from the banking and telecommunications sectors. Further, the
deterioration of relations with companies in recently privatized sectors, notably electricity
and water, does not augur well for attracting future investment. Implementation of the 2006
program of structural reforms regarding privatization and management of state enterprises
would provide a clear signal of the authorities policy priorities.
46. The authorities need to complement their clear vision of the growth potential of
various sectors, with determined implementation of reforms to improve the investment
environment and boost productivity. Much of the diagnostic work is in place, and the next
Poverty Reduction Strategy should, in the view of the staff, make explicit the link between a
growth strategy and poverty reduction, as well as maintaining a realistic assessment of the
growth potential. The discussions of exchange rate competitiveness in the context of a fixed
peg underscore the importance of increasing the flexibility of other prices, notably wages and
key product market prices (cotton, fuel) to send market signals to producers and consumers
and improve the efficiency of resource allocation.
47. The concept of creating and using fiscal space is a useful term for analyzing the
medium-term budgetary outlook and the scope for poverty reduction in Mali. While

- 25 -

public finance management reforms continue to progress and are likely to support revenue
growth over the medium term, the specifics of key budgetary policies relating to pensions,
the efficiency of spending, and social safety net payments have not received the attention
commensurate with their potential impact on fiscal space. The staff will continue to focus on
policy advice in these areas in the remainder of the PRGF. Nonetheless, economic growth
remains the key factor in creating fiscal space for poverty reducing spending over the
medium term, even in the context of MDRI and higher than projected external assistance.
This, in turn, underscores the importance of accelerating structural reforms, particularly
relating to private sector and financial market development, while addressing the numerous
impediments to doing business.
48. In light of the difficult circumstances and the authorities efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability, and continuing advances in institution building, the staff
supports the requested waivers for nonobservance of three structural performance
criteria and recommends completion of the second and third reviews under the PRGF
arrangement. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Mali be held
in accordance with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on
July 15, 2002.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV)
terms at the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is
expressed in NPV terms at the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
2/
Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.
_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed
at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation
of preagreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. A new safeguards assessment
of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The assessment found that progress has
been made in strengthening the BCEAO’s safeguards framework of the bank since 2002

- 42 -

APPENDIX I

when the last safeguards assessment took place.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements, and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms have been
established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and follow-up on internal and
external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of
the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangements and Summary of Exchange Restrictions

Mali is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's common
currency, the CFA franc, was pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1
from 1948 until early 1994. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued, and the
new parity set at CFAF 100 = F 1. Effective January 1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to
the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1. On June 24, 2005, the rate of the CFA franc in
terms of the SDR was SDR 1 = CFAF 794.35.
As of June 1, 1996, and in conjunction with its WAEMU partners, Mali accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. Mali’s
exchange system is free of restrictions on making payments or transfers for current
international transactions. In addition Mali does not engage in multiple currency practices.
Mali shares a common trade policy with other members of WAEMU, shifting key trade
policy-making to the sub-regional level. The common external tariff (CET) was adopted in
January 2000. Mali is compliant with the tariff rate structure of the union and has effectively
implemented the dismantling of internal tariffs. WAEMU tariff reform has reduced the
simple average custom duty from 22.1 per cent in 1997 to 14.6 per cent in 2003 (latest
available), with a maximum rate of 20 per cent. Imports to Mali are not subject to
quantitative restrictions.
Mali is a signatory of the Cotonou Convention, and as such Malian exports to the European
Union generally enjoy non-reciprocal preferential treatment in the form of exemption from
import duties. Malian goods enjoy nonreciprocal preferential access to the markets of
developed countries other than the European Union under the Generalized System of
Preferences. Mali is also eligible for the benefits of the United States’ African Growth and
Opportunity Act. At the WAEMU level, Mali does not officially experience legal or
regulatory impediments to its exports.

APPENDIX I

Article IV Consultations

Mali’s Article IV consultation cycle is governed by the provisions of the July 2002 decision
on consultation cycles. The 2003 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive
Board on December 15, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/11, 1/12/04).
XI.

ROSC/AAP

Regarding the HIPC Assessment Action Plan, a May 2004 mission concluded that progress
had been achieved, with the number of the more tightly defined benchmarks observed by
Mali increasing from 8 out of 15 in 2001 to 11 out of 16, and that significant advances were
made in the areas where the benchmarks are not yet met. The report put forward an action
plan to strengthen Mali’s budget management capacity, with the view to helping Mali meet
all 16 indicators in the medium term. One of the main priorities identified by the mission in
many areas is to extend beyond the procedural monitoring of compliance with the rules to
give greater emphasis to effectiveness and efficiency based on a sharper focus on risk
management.

APPENDIX II

Appendix II. Mali: World Bank-IMF Relations
(As of December 6, 2005)
A.

Partnership in Mali’s development strategy

1.
Mali’s development strategy increasingly emphasizes growth and poverty reduction. Its
PRSP (adopted by the government in May 2002) highlights growth as a precondition for poverty
reduction, and outlines programs for (i) institutional development and improved governance, (ii)
human development and access to basic social services, and (iii) infrastructure development and
support for key productive sectors. Mali’s growth strategy aims to be private sector led and market
oriented toward the West Africa region as well as the global market.
2.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting the
government’s macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line with the guidelines for enhanced BankFund collaboration. This includes regular participation of Bank staff in the meetings with the
government on the Fund’s program review missions, IMF staff participation in Bank development
policy missions and Bank internal review meetings. The IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic
stabilization and the World Bank in social and structural areas, with close collaboration on a few
structural areas that have a particular impact on macroeconomic stability. The Fund’s dialogue and
conditionality are consistent with the structural programs agreed with the Bank, and the Bank’s
dialogue and conditionality have maintained consistency with the macroeconomic framework
endorsed by the Fund.
B.

World Bank Group strategy

3.
The World Bank Group’s strategy, outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board of Directors on July 31, 2003, emphasizes three broad themes in line with the
country’s PRSP: (i) promotion of economic growth; (ii) human resources development; and
(iii) public finance management and governance. Mali also benefits under the Bank’s Regional
Integration Assistance Strategy (2001), notably a program for connection to the West Africa Power
Pool, harmonization of country policies and/or regulatory frameworks (telecommunications,
agriculture, financial sectors), water resource development of the Niger and Senegal Rivers,
strengthening of road transport corridors, and strengthening the regional payments system.
4.
Support to Mali during fiscal years 2004-06 amounts to US$400 million in the base case,
with about 30 percent in grants. Budget support of $25 million is provided annually through
development policy credits (DPCs), subject to satisfactory macroeconomic management. This is
complemented by selected investment operations (targeting education, support to growth, and
infrastructure development) and a community-driven development operation. The Bank will prepare a
new CAS in the course of FY07 in support of Mali’s next PRSP (under preparation in the first half of
2006). In that context, the Bank envisions aligning its annual budget support with Mali’s budget cycle
during 2007, possibly in the form of programmatic lending along the lines of a PRSC.
5.
The CAS also includes non-lending activities. Recently completed activities include a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Macroeconomic Growth and Water Variability study,
first phase Poverty Assessment, Country Procurement Assessment Review, and an Integrated
Framework Trade Diagnostic Study. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the cotton sector is
nearing completion. The Bank has also assisted with development of medium-term expenditure
frameworks (MTEF) for health, education, and transport, and MTEF support is envisioned for the

- 46 -

APPENDIX II

agriculture-livestock-fisheries sector. Planned activities during FY06-07 include a Country Economic
Memorandum on growth and a Public Expenditure Review.
C.

IMF-World Bank collaboration

6.
Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization
including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial stability and risk
management.
7.
Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in structural areas where both
institutions have conditionality, including cotton sector reform, privatization and regulatory reform
(telecommunications, banking, financial and energy sectors), and pension reform. The Bank also
leads in other areas such as: agricultural competitiveness/diversification; rural development
(irrigation, roads, support to producer organizations); private sector development (strengthening the
investment climate, access to business services, support to small/medium enterprises); urban
development (historic rehabilitation/ preservation, land/housing market development, water/road
infrastructure); transportation policy/infrastructure; energy sector reforms; and social sectors (health,
education and social protection, including HIV/AIDS). The Bank’s work in structural areas includes
analytical work and dialogue on trade and growth policies, which form part of the overall economic
policy dialogue. The Bank collaborates with other donors whenever possible (notably in health,
education, agriculture and cotton sectors), and is pursuing a harmonized approach for donor support
to health and education reforms as well as on budget support more broadly.
Areas of shared responsibility. Both Bank and Fund collaborate in assessing performance of HIPC
resource use. Both also monitor progress on budgetary and public expenditure management, yet
emphasize different aspects of the government’s reform program in the respective support operations.
The Bank emphasis in this area is on strengthening all phases of the public expenditure system—
budget preparation, budget execution, and budget controls—to support the government’s objectives
of progressive shifts toward result-based budgeting and improved effectiveness of expenditures. Bank
support is at the national level in the finance ministry (global MTEF, integrated information
technology system, audit capabilities, budget reporting) and sector ministries (selected sector MTEFs,
inter- and intra-sectoral allocations), as well as at de-concentrated levels (budget nomenclature, IT
system, capacity building). The Fund’s emphasis is on fiscal management, expenditure management
(including financing of transfers to parastatals), revenue enhancing measures, and audit capabilities.

APPENDIX III

MALI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 21, 2005)
1. Mali’s statistical database is adequate for program monitoring. However, there is
considerable scope for improving the quality, timeliness, and availability of economic
and financial data. Mali has been participating in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since September 2001 and has advanced the implementation of its short- and
medium-term plans for improvement. The metadata posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB), last certified in June 2003, require updating.
Real sector
2. There are weaknesses in the accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of national accounts
data. The main reason is the inadequacy of the real sector databases, owing to the
inadequate funding and technical staffing of the National Directorate of Statistics and
Data Processing (DSDP). Staff have discussed revisions to the calculation of GDP
deflators, the treatment of agricultural stocks and expenditure estimates of GDP.
3. In collaboration with other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
member countries, the DSDP has been compiling and publishing a harmonized consumer
price index (CPI) for Bamako, on a monthly basis since early 1998. Index weights and,
possibly, extension of coverage to additional cities is under review.
Government finance statistics
4. As part of the process of economic integration among the member countries of the
WAEMU, Mali has made progress in bringing its fiscal data in line with the common
framework that has been developed with technical assistance from the Fund (the
harmonized table of government financial operations – TOFE). However, efforts need to
be made to improve the timeliness of the TOFE. Work is progressing with the assistance
of AFRISTAT to expand the coverage of the TOFE to public agencies and local
governments. Staff have begun discussions with the Ministry of Finance on issues
relating to the adoption of the revised 2001 GFS methodology.
5. Public debt statistics are prepared and monitored by separate agencies: external debt
by the National Public Debt Directorate (NPDD) and domestic debt by the National
Directorate of the Treasury and Government Accounting. The NPDD uses CS-DRMS
accounting software. Debt data and projections are of generally good quality, although
there is scope for improving the coverage of debt relief (multilateral and bilateral) and the
presentation of passive debts. A procedure for regularly updating exchange rate
projections is needed.
6. Fiscal data are posted on the BCEAO website, but not on a timely basis. The Ministry
of Economy and Finance is preparing to launch a website in 2006.

-49-

APPENDIX III

Monetary data
7. Preliminary monetary data for Mali are prepared by the national agency of the Bank
of Central African States (BCEAO) and released officially by the headquarters of the
BCEAO. The dissemination of monthly monetary data from the BCEAO takes from four
to six weeks consistent with GDDS recommendations. Data are posted on the BCEAO
website with a considerably longer time lag.
8. In June 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of currency in
circulation in member states. The revised method, based on updating sorting coefficients
(“coefficients de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003. The revised
estimates increased the export of CFA franc banknotes from Mali to other member states,
from 2003 resulting in a reduction of currency in circulation and a reduction of the
counterpart net foreign assets in the BCEAO national balance sheet. Parallel revisions
were also made to the balance of payments. Nonetheless, the national BCEAO balance
sheets remain estimates based on the calculation of banknote movements and are
therefore subject to error.
Balance of payments data
9. In December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments statistics was formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation
adopted by the countries participating in the WAEMU. The BCEAO national agency
disseminates balance of payments statistics with a lag which is longer than the
recommendation of the GDDS guidelines. GDDS objectives to disseminate quarterly
balance of payments have progressed but are not sufficiently robust for publication.
10. The foreign assets of the private non banking sector are not well covered in the
financial accounts, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, obtained through partial
surveys of residents’ foreign assets. The BCEAO has recently implemented a compilation
system allowing commercial banks to report data on payments involving nonresidents;
however, these data are not used to produce annual balance of payments statistics.
11. The multi sector statistics mission that visited Mali during April 22-May 6, 2003
found that the balance of payments compilation system is generally sound and
encouraged the authorities to integrate banking settlement sources and disseminate the
Mali balance of payments within the recommended timeliness, as set by the GDDS.
12. Annual statistics on balance of payments and international investment position are
reported to STA on a regular basis.
Poverty Statistics
13. The PRS Annual Update identifies a key set of poverty indicators for monitoring of
the PRS implementation.

ATTACHMENT I

Bamako, December 7, 2005
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The Malian economy has experienced exogenous shocks that affected cotton
and oil product prices over the past year, and the 2004/05 production of food crops was
far from adequate, resulting in lower growth and higher inflation than envisioned under the
program. With the assistance of our external partners, we have put in place decisive policies
to adjust to these shocks and ensure macroeconomic stability and food security in the
medium term.
2.
The outlook for 2006 and for the medium term is encouraging. Agricultural
production, particularly cereals, should rebound in 2005/06 following adequate rainfall,
resulting in a reversal of recent inflation. The terms of trade have begun to improve, notably
with respect to gold prices. We remain fully committed to completing the privatization of
the Malian textile development company (CMDT) by 2008 and attach high priority to the
financial sector reforms, to strengthening fiscal policies and increasing the role of the
private sector in the economy.
MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
3.
Recent macroeconomic developments remain broadly consistent with
projections in the previous program review, although inflation has increased in 2005
because of the food supply reduction. We expect a recovery of GDP growth from
2 percent in 2004 to about 5.5 percent in 2005 on the basis of a normal 2005/06 harvest,
rising gold production, and modestly increased cotton production levels. Owing to good
rainfall the risks to growth are on the upside. Reduced cereal supply substantially increased
food prices in 2005, leading to average consumer price inflation of 5 percent and projected
year-end inflation of zero percent. In addition to the effects of the food shock, the upsurge
in petroleum product prices has reduced the current account balance. The fiscal position,
before grants, weakened temporarily, as we increased public spending to address losses in
the cotton sector and at the same time cushion the impact of lower international cotton
prices.
4.
For 2006, we expect economic growth to remain at 5-6 percent, underpinned by
improvements in the terms of trade, a narrowing of the current account deficit, low
inflation, and increased levels of public investment.

ATTACHMENT I

-52-

5.
Strict fiscal management has led to the maintenance, at end-2004 and endSeptember 2005, of an overall fiscal balance consistent with program projections. The
overall fiscal deficit, before grants, in 2004 stood at 6.6 percent of GDP, or 1 percent of
GDP less than estimated in the program, and is expected to rise to 8.8 percent GDP in 2005,
financed by increases in concessional loans and budgetary grants. Revenue objectives were
generally met, except shortfalls in nontax revenue (dividends and property taxes) and fuel
excises. Expenditure increased in 2005, reflecting higher investment, wages including
HIPC-financed wages, and lending to CMDT.

of BCEAO data.

6.
Monetary growth has slowed as a result of the less favorable external
environment. Following two years of rapid growth, the level of reserves declined in 2004,
reflecting current account weakness. Meanwhile, growth of credit to the economy declined
in 2004. This tendency could continue in 2005, partly reflecting efforts to strengthen the
credit portfolio. Based on data available through the third quarter of 2005, broad money is
expected to increase by about 6.5 percent in 2005 and 6.2 percent in 2006.
7.
In the banking sector, system-wide liquidity remains high, even though there is
only partial compliance with the prudential ratios. Credit is still concentrated in the
cotton sector. Moreover, the quality of loan portfolios should be improved, particularly in
the area of real-estate loans. Steps are under way to restructure the housing bank to protect
its depositors, and the audit of the loan portfolios of other commercial banks is nearing
completion.
8.
To sustain GDP growth at an average of approximately 6 percent per annum
over the medium term, we will focus our policies and reforms mainly on improving
efficiency and competitiveness, particularly through structural reforms in the cotton and
banking sectors and the strengthening of public finances and public institutions. The

-53-

ATTACHMENT I

successful implementation of these reforms will rest on broad consultation with the
stakeholders and on technical and financial support from our development partners. We
expect the current account deficit to narrow after 2005 as the terms of trade gradually
improve and gold exports increase as a result of the opening of new mines. With the
recovery of exports and growth, our external debt sustainability indicators will continue to
improve.
9.
The second progress report on implementation of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), approved in August 2005 and drafted in consultation with external
partners and other stakeholders, emphasizes the need to ensure coherence between the
annual budget and the medium-term expenditure framework for poverty reduction spending
under the PRSP. Preparation of our second PRSP, covering 2007–11, is under way, and will
be submitted to the National Assembly. The PRSP will focus on matching identified
budgetary space with the costs of those interventions that will enable us to make concrete
progress toward achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Account will
be taken in the 2007 Budget Law of the PRSP objectives.
PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
10.
Financial program performance at end- September 2005. Program
implementation at end-September was satisfactory. We met the quantitative performance
criteria regarding net domestic financing, nonaccumulation of external payment arrears, and
external borrowing terms and maturities at end-September. We also met the performance
indicators with respect to the floor on tax revenues and the ceiling on the wage bill, and
exceeded the basic balance, excluding HIPC-financed expenditure (Annex I).
11.
Our structural reform program experienced a number of delays (Annex II), as
follows:
•

We conducted an actuarial study of the civil service pension fund (CRM) in
July 2005, with a six-month delay owing to bidding procedure issues. The draft
study is now complete, and we will start a consultative process as soon as possible
on the parametric reforms, with a view to placing the pertinent draft law before the
National Assembly along with the 2007 Budget Law.

•

On May 2, 2005 we announced a base seed cotton purchaser price for 2005/06 of
CFAF 160/kg, pursuant to the government-CMDT-producers memorandum of
understanding on the cotton pricing mechanism, to minimize budgetary risks and
taking into account world price projections. We maintained the base cotton price in
August 2005 in accordance with the memorandum of understanding. In addition,
steps are being taken to bring CMDT accounts into balance.

•

The plan to complete the sale of the government’s shares in the Banque
Internationale du Mali (BIM) was delayed by circumstances beyond our control, in
particular a court case contesting the validity of the government’s shareholding in

-54-

ATTACHMENT I

the Bank. The privatization process will resume immediately after the Supreme
Court ruling on the case, expected in November 2005. Our PRGF-supported
structural reform program for 2006 is also attached to this letter.
12.
On the basis of the policies described in this supplementary letter of intent and its
annexes, we request the completion of the second and third reviews of the PRGF-supported
program. The following prior actions were undertaken in anticipation of the review: (i) the
revision of aspects of the taxation on petroleum products, in order to reduce the
differentiation of excise taxes by route of importation, in accordance with regional policies
(adopted by decree on July 11); (ii) submission of a fully financed draft 2006 Budget Law
to the National Assembly, in accordance with the macroeconomic framework of the PRGF
(submitted September 18); and (iii) elimination of the temporary VAT exemptions for rice
and maize.
13.
We request a waiver for nonobservance of the structural performance criterion
related to beginning an actuarial study of the civil service pension fund (CRM), for the
announcement of a base cotton producer price for 2005/06, and for the acceptance of
financial bids for the sale of the government’s shares in the BIM. The fifth and sixth
disbursements under PRGF will be subject to reviews expected to be completed on or after
April 15, 2006 and October 15, 2006 respectively. We will continue to consult the Fund in
advance of any change to our policies that could affect the implementation of our economic
and financial program.
Program Policies for 2005–06
2005 Budget
14.
We remain committed to fiscal discipline and to not seeking financing through the
use of domestic credit and treasury bills, except where necessary to meet within-year
requirements and unforeseen shortfalls in budgetary grants or loans.
15.
The risks to the 2005 revenue outlook include weak nontax revenue
mobilization, lower hydrocarbon taxes, delays in payment West African Economic and
Monetary Union duty compensation, and delays in the implementation of fiscal
measures. To cover budgeted spending, particularly for poverty reduction, we have:
•

Reduced the differentiation across petroleum product excise taxes with a view to
improving revenue efficiency, in accordance with the regional legislation (prior
action);

•

Strengthened administrative measures. The Tax Department’s action plan will be
given high priority, and the on-site audit system was strengthened in the last quarter.
We have requested but not yet identified technical assistance to strengthen the Land
and Property Department (DNDC). The Customs Department has increased import
inspection and fraud detection;

-55-

ATTACHMENT I

•

Eliminated the temporary VAT exemptions for rice and maize imports as products
from the latest harvest arrive on the market; and

•

Made every effort to ensure the collection of dividends in respect of profitable state
enterprises, notably the telecommunications company (SOTELMA).

16.
On the expenditure side, we will submit to the National Assembly revisions to
the 2005 budget that take account of net lending to the CMDT. The pertinent amount
budgeted will be increased from CFAF 13.8 billion to CFAF 28.5 billion. This increase is
less than estimated in the program, partly because the operating deficit for the 2004/05
season was narrower than anticipated. We also expect to realize savings of CFAF 8 billion
relative to the estimates for a number of items (in particular, elections and electricity
subsidies) in the 2005 budget.
17.
To cover shortfalls in nontax revenues, hydrocarbon taxes, and higher spending
needs, we have identified additional budgetary assistance of CFAF 9 billion for 2005,
thereby closing the expected financing gap.
2006 Budget
18.
We submitted a fully financed 2006 Budget to the National Assembly in
September 2005. The principal measures underpinning the 2006 budget revenues are:
(i) computerization of the Tax Department, leading to improved domestic VAT collections;
(ii) full-year effects of measures implemented in late 2005, notably elimination of the VAT
exemption on new vehicles effective November 1, 2005, introduction of a simplified tax
regime for small and medium-sized businesses, and elimination of the agricultural bank tax
exemptions; (iii) taxation of imports from WAEMU countries produced under economic or
conditional relief arrangements; (iv) the introduction of regulations for prudent
implementation of the revised investment code to limit tax losses. We will study, with
technical assistance, different options to reform the petroleum product pricing mechanism
and palliative measures to protect vulnerable groups of the population. On this basis, we
will introduce a price mechanism before end-March 2006 linking pump prices to
international prices, compatible with fuel excise estimates in the 2006 Budget (new
structural benchmark). In the meantime, the fuel excise will be broadly compatible
with 2006 budget projections.
19.
Our spending is aimed at increasing investment financed by higher aid inflows.
Nominal wage spending increases by 6.2 percent on account of HIPC-financed wages and
wage adjustments, while spending on goods and services increased by 7.4 percent. The
capital budget is intended to cover increased appropriations for [health, education, roads,
and institutional capacity building. The budget also includes provisions totaling
CFAF 8.2 billion that could be spent in the event realized fiscal revenue were to exceed the
estimates. These provisions would be used to deal with unexpected exogenous shocks.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Budget Law, the government will reduce spending if the
rate of revenue realization is unsatisfactory.

-56-

ATTACHMENT I

20.
Projected gross financing from external grants and loans will increase
substantially in 2006. Largely on account of a shift toward sectoral budget support
(1.6 percent of GDP), which will help increase assistance execution rates. Total aid support
is projected to reach 11.1 percent of GDP, including the equivalent of 2.8 percent of GDP
(CFAF 80 billion) in general budget support linked to implementation of the economic
reform program, particularly in the cotton sector, and the maintenance of macroeconomic
stability.
21.
We welcome the proposals for multilateral debt cancellation from the IMF, the
World Bank and the African Development Fund. Such cancellation and the potential
increase in external assistance would help create additional budgetary space and progress
toward the achievement of the MDGs. Cancellation would also reduce debt service by about
0.6 percent of GDP per year over the medium term. Should cancellation occur in 2006, we
will either submit supplementary spending programs to the National Assembly or increase
the unallocated provisions in the budget. Debt cancellation could also serve to cover
possible external assistance shortfalls.
Fiscal structural measures
22.
As we work with international partners to move from project support to
sectoral and general budget support, we are reforming public finance management.
The government has adopted an action plan for improving and modernizing public finance
management. We will focus on strengthening the revenue collection agencies (taxes,
customs), the audit function, procurement, extending the Treasury’s computer network,
broadening the scope of the budget accounts to local governments and autonomous public
agencies, and increasing accountability.
23.
Concerning expenditure management, we began a study of the system of salary
allowances and bonuses in October 2005 to assess incentives for the deconcentration of
government services; we expect the study to be completed by year-end. With a slight delay,
we completed a report in October 2005 on the review of the criteria used for allocating
resources for the principal social safety net.
24.
The provisional actuarial study of the civil service pension scheme (CRM)
shows that without reform the operating deficit will rise to unsustainable levels from
the 2005 budget level of 0.6 percent of GDP. We have begun consultations with the
stakeholders on a range of parametric reform options that will restore the CRM to
equilibrium. We have asked the consultant to provide a wide range of options, including
simulations for reaching operational balance after 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years. In view
of the importance of the parametric reforms to the CRM for the medium-term budgetary
outlook, the government will identify a package of parametric reforms that will gradually
reduce the projected deficit of the CRM from the present level over the medium term (new
performance criteria for end-March 2006). In addition, the government will submit to the
National Assembly, in the context of the 2007 Budget Law and by end-September 2006, a

-57-

ATTACHMENT I

draft law authorizing the above mentioned package of parametric reforms (new structural
benchmark).
Strengthening the financial system
We remain committed to our program of strengthening the financial system by increasing the
role of the private sector in the banking system and improving presentation of the balance
sheets of banks and nonbank institutions.
25.
Preparations for the sale of government shares in the commercial banks have
taken longer than expected:
•

Banque Internationale du Mali (BIM). We have received expressions of interest
for the acquisition of the government’s 61.5 percent stake in this bank. The tender
offer for a majority shareholding in this bank (end-April 2005 benchmark) has been
delayed by a Supreme Court case contesting the validity of the government
shareholding. Once the Court has ruled on the matter (expected in November 2005),
and providing no legal impediments remain, we expect to launch a tender by endMarch 2006 (reset structural benchmark).

•

Banque de Développement du Mali (BDM). Pending agreement on the parallel
sale of the shares held by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the
divestiture of the government’s 20 percent share in Mali’s largest bank is on hold.
The BDM remains profitable and plays a pivotal role in the banking consortium for
cotton export financing.

26.
We are implementing, with World Bank support, a plan to restructure the
housing bank, Banque de l’Habitat du Mali (BHM). The audit of the BHM portfolio by
a firm of external auditors has been used as the basis for the measures in the restructuring
plan. The plan centers on a recapitalization operation led by the government, to be
completed by end-June 2006, with the objective of ensuring significant private sector
involvement (new structural benchmark). To succeed, the above-mentioned recapitalization
is preceded by measures aimed at strengthening the financial position of the bank. The
recapitalization will take the form, in the short term, of a conversion of the government
deposits into equity. The government will sell equity as new shareholders are identified and
the financial position of the bank improves.
27.
An audit of the nonperforming loan portfolio of commercial banks has begun
to yield results. The proposals for the settlement of these claims, recommended in the final
report, will be examined by the parties (government-banks-World Bank) during the first
quarter of 2006, in a consultative framework.
28.
As regards microfinance, the task of supervising microfinance institutions has
been transferred to the Ministry of Economy and Finance in conformity with the
WAEMU law governing microfinance institutions. In addition, the high level of

-58-

ATTACHMENT I

nonperforming loans in the microfinance sector indicates there is a need to strengthen the
supervisory capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
COTTON SECTOR REFORMS AND PRIVATIZATION
29.
A revised timetable for the cotton sector reform process, postponing
privatization of the CMDT to 2008, was approved by the Council of Ministers in
February 2005. This timetable announces the signing of a memorandum of understanding
by the government-CMDT-producers on the producer price mechanism. It provides for a
series of measures aimed at completing privatization of the CMDT in 2008.
30.
A base price for cottonseed purchases from producers for the 2005/06 season
has been set at CFAF 160/kg, in accordance with the memorandum of understanding on
the pricing mechanism signed in January 2005, with a view to keeping to a minimum the
risks related to budget support to the cotton sector for the 2005/06 season. This price is at
the floor of the range for the base price and was reaffirmed in August 2005. In light of the
program estimates regarding international cotton prices and exchange rates, we expect the
CMDT operating balance to move from a loss of 1.8 percent of GDP (CFAF 50.3 billion)
in 2004/05 to a gross profit equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP (CFAF 16 billion) in 2005/06
(subject to a considerable margin of forecasting error).
31.
The short-term financial situation of the CMDT remains difficult and poses
a fiscal risk. These difficulties result from the partial recapitalization for 2004/05 losses
(incurred in 2004) and receivables for cottonseed sales. Arrears with respect to external
payments on medium- and long-term loans have been accumulating since April 2005. The
finalization of the 2005 accounts by end-June 2006 will be key in resolving the financial
problems. In the interim, the government, as the major shareholder, will set up a committee
for the regular surveillance of cash flow operations (structural benchmark for endDecember 2005) with a view to progressively reducing payment arrears. Such monitoring
will be based on an audit and a payment plan for receivables, cost savings, and disposal of
noncore assets, efforts to increase shareholder capital, and refinancing. In the interests of
financial transparency, a plan will be submitted to the relevant stakeholders.
32.
We continue to reflect on the best approach to privatization of the CMDT. The
discussions center on whether to sell assets by zoning or equity in new subsidiary
companies, creating a regulatory framework, and strengthening the role of cotton producers
in downstream activities. In light of these discussions and delays in implementing the
reforms planned in the revised privatization timetable, we recognize that a new political
impetus is needed to move forward on the reforms, with the support of external partners.
Accordingly, by end-December 2005 a definitive strategy for privatization will be adopted
by CMDT shareholders (new structural benchmark). The strategy will be based on the
agreed positions of shareholders concerning the management of the privatization procedure,
notably the number of private companies to be created, shareholder interests, as well as the
proposed management of privatization receipts and the clearance of CMDT liabilities. By

-59-

ATTACHMENT I

end-September 2006, a detailed technical operational plan for privatization will be adopted
by the Council of Ministers (new structural benchmark).
33.
The privatization of other nonfinancial sector companies is proceeding, albeit
with some technical delays: In June 2005, the sale of the bulk of the government’s shares
in the cottonseed mill (HUICOMA) to a private operator was finalized against a payment
equivalent to CFAF 9 billion or 0.3 percent of GDP. Preparations are continuing for the sale
of 80 percent of the government’s shares in the national telecommunications company
(SOTELMA), and we expect to conclude this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2006.
A medium-term privatization plan for the period through 2008 will be devised by end-2006.
34.
In the electricity sector, we agreed in October 2005 with the strategic partner to
restructure ownership, with the government taking a controlling stake of 66 percent.
By January 1, 2006 we will recruit specialized international experts to support the new
management team. By end-May 2006, we will conduct a management audit, an assessment
of the financial situation, and a review of the pricing mechanism, with a view to resolving
the cash flow operating problems (new structural benchmark). We remain committed to
private management of the company, based on the above-mentioned studies and reports.
Very truly yours,
/s/
Abou-Bakar Traoré

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MALI
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) 12
December 7, 2005
1. This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and
benchmarks for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement. It also sets out the frequency and deadlines for data reporting to the
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for program-monitoring purposes. This
memorandum consolidates the TMU in Country Report No. 04/184 and its addendum in
Country Report No. 05/129, from 2005 onwards. It also adds a data requirement relating to
the CMDT treasury operations in the data provision summary table.
DEFINITIONS
2. Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central administration of the
Republic of Mali and does not include local administrations, the central bank, or any other
public entity with autonomous legal personality that is not included in the table of
government financial operations (TOFE).
3.
The definitions of "debt" and "concessional loans" for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as follows:
(a)

Debt is defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (see Decision of the Executive Directors of the IMF No. 12274-00/85,
August 24, 2000).

(b)

A loan is considered concessional if, on the date the contract is signed, the ratio of the
present value of the debt, based on the reference interest rates, to the nominal value of
the debt is less than 65 percent (i.e., a grant element exceeding 35 percent). The
reference interest rates used in this assessment are the commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). For debts with a maturity exceeding 15 years, the ten-year
reference interest rate published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant element.
For shorter maturities, the six-month market reference rate is used.

12

This memorandum consolidates the TMU in Country Report No. 04/184 and its addendum
in Country Report No. 05/129. It adds a data requirement relating to the CMDT treasury
operations in the data provision summary table.

- 65 -

ATTACHMENT I
ANNEX III

I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government
4.
The key quantitative performance criterion is net domestic financing of the
government, defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to government, as defined below,
(ii) other government claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions, and
(iii) nonbank financing of the government.
5.
Figures on net bank credit to government as calculated by the BCEAO, and on
nonbank financing as calculated by the public treasury, are final in the context of the
program.
6.
Net bank credit to government is defined as the balance between government debts
and government claims vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of net
bank credit to government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)
and is consistent with established Fund practice in this area. It implies a broader definition of
government than that specified in paragraph 2 by also including local governments, and
selected autonomous government agencies and projects. Government claims include the
CFA franc cash balance, postal checking accounts, secured liabilities (obligations
cautionnées), and all deposits with the BCEAO and commercial banks of public entities, with
the exception of industrial or commercial public institutions (EPICs) and public enterprises,
which are excluded from the calculation. Government debts to the banking system include all
debts to these same financial institutions. Deposits of the cotton stabilization fund and
government securities held outside the Malian banking system are not included in the
calculation of net bank credit to government.
7.
Nonbank financing of the government include, in particular, government bills and
bonds held outside national banking institutions and proceeds from the sale of government
assets. The receipts from sale of government assets are defined as the proceeds from the sale,
effectively received by the government during the fiscal year, of all or part of the shares held
by the government in privatized enterprises. In the event that payments in respect of these
sale transactions are expected to extend beyond the fiscal year, the residual will be included
in the calculation of nonbank financing of the government in each of the subsequent years, in
accordance with the annual scheduling of the expected payments.
Adjustment factor
8.
The ceiling on the change in net domestic financing of the government will be
adjusted if external budgetary assistance exceeds or falls short of the program amount.
Budgetary assistance is defined as grants, loans, and debt relief (excluding project loans and
grants, IMF resources, and debt relief under the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries). The adjustment factor is capped at CFAF 25 billion. These ceilings and program
budgetary assistance are set in Annex I to the December Letter.

- 66 -

ATTACHMENT I
ANNEX III

9.
The ceiling on the change in net bank credit to government and net domestic
financing will be adjusted by the difference between the amount of HIPC Initiative resources
in the program and the amount actually spent. If the amount actually spent exceeds (or falls
short of) the program amount, the ceiling will be reduced (increased) by the difference
between the actual amount and the program amount.
B. Nonaccumulation of External Public Payments Arrears
10.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of external payments due and
unpaid for external liabilities of the government and foreign debt held or guaranteed by the
government. The definition of external debt provided in paragraph 3(a) applies here.
11.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate external payments arrears,
with the exception of arrears arising from debt under renegotiation or being rescheduled. The
performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears will be applied
on a continuous basis throughout the program period.
C. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt with a Maturity of One Year or More
Newly Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government and/or Public Enterprises
12.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Borrowing (Executive Board
Decision No. 6230-(79/140), amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85)
(8/24/00)), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has yet
been received.
13.
The concept of government for the purposes of this performance criterion includes
government as defined in paragraph 2, administrative public institutions (EPAs), scientific
and/or technical public institutions, professional public institutions, industrial and/or
commercial public institutions (EPICs), and local governments.
14.
Starting with the program approval by the Executive Board of the IMF, a ceiling of
zero is set for nonconcessional borrowing. This performance criterion is monitored on a
continuous basis.
15.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee external debt with a maturity
of one year or more and a grant element of less than 35 percent (calculated using the
reference interest rates corresponding to the borrowing currencies provided by the IMF).
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Borrowing, adopted by the Executive Board on
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has
yet been received. However, it does not apply to financing granted by the IMF and treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) regional market.

- 67 -

ATTACHMENT I
ANNEX III

D. Ceiling on Short-Term External Debt Newly Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Government and/or Public Enterprises
16.

The definition in paragraph 12 applies to this performance criterion.

17.
Short-term external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year. Importrelated credit, CMDT foreign borrowing secured by the proceeds of cotton exports, and debtrelief operations are excluded from this performance criterion. Treasury bills issued in
CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market are also excluded.
18.
In the context of the program, the government and public enterprises will not
contract, or guarantee, short-term external debt.
19.

This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

20.
The program also includes indicators on government tax revenues, the civil service
wage bill, and the basic fiscal balance.
A. Floor for Tax Revenues
21.
Government tax revenues are defined as those that figure in the Table on government
financial operations (TOFE). The government shall report tax revenues to IMF staff each
month in the context of the TOFE. Quantitative performance indicators for tax revenues are
set in Annex I to the December Letter.
B. Ceiling on the Wage Bill
22.
The wage bill includes all public expenditure on wages, bonuses, and other benefits
or allowances granted civil servants employed by the government, the military, and other
security forces, and includes expenditure with respect to special contracts and other
permanent or temporary employment with the government. The government shall report the
wage bill to IMF staff each month in the context of the TOFE. The quantitative performance
indicators for the wage bill are set in Annex I to the December Letter.
C. Floor on the Basic Fiscal Balance, Excluding HIPC Initiative-Related Expenditure
23.
The basic fiscal balance is defined as the difference between total revenues,
excluding grants and privatization receipts, and total expenditure plus net lending, excluding
capital expenditure financed by foreign donors and lenders and HIPC Initiative-related
expenditures. The floors for the performance indicators for the basic fiscal balance,

MALI
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by a staff team from the Afican and
Policy Development and Review Departments, and the World Bank
Approved by Benedicte Vibe Christensen and Matthew Fisher
December 15, 2005
External Debt Sustainability Assessment
1.
Since the 1994 CFA franc devaluation, which increased debt and debt service
indicators substantially, Mali has benefited from a series of debt relief measures that have
reduced debt service, including the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. The
HIPC Initiative reduced debt service to sustainable levels as defined by a specific threshold
for the NPV of debt to exports (200 percent original HIPC Initiative and 150 percent for the
enhanced HIPC Initiative). Despite the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and
prudent debt management, the capacity to repay debt remains subject to moderate risks from
natural and commodity price shocks. Accordingly, lessening the exposure to such shocks
through diversification and improving productivity remains key to lessening medium-term
debt vulnerabilities.
2.
This DSA applies the low income country template to the staff’s baseline projections,
and applies various robustness checks.1 The analysis shows that external debt sustainability
is broadly achieved under baseline projections in relation to the policy dependent debt
burden thresholds. However, adverse external and internal shocks could result in breaching
debt-to-exports and debt-to-GDP thresholds over the medium term. Accordingly Mali is
assessed as a having a moderate risk of debt distress. Accelerating export growth and
maintaining highly concessional loan assistance are important factors in maintaining debt

1

The low income debt sustainability framework compares debt burden indicators to
indicative policy-based thresholds. The thresholds are based on the empirical finding that
low-income countries with stronger policies and institutions tend to have a higher debt
carrying capacity. See IDA and IMF, “Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability
Assessments in Low-Income Countries—Further Considerations” (IDA/R2005-0056),
April 2005.

sustainability. The multilateral debt reduction initiative (MDRI) expected to be implemented
in 2006 is also projected to improve the debt ratios significantly over the medium term.
A. Baseline projections
3.
The DSA focuses on the external debt situation, since the existing domestic debt
stock is negligible (less than 2 percent of GDP) while projected budgetary financing needs
are likely to be covered by external grant and concessional loan assistance for the foreseeable
future.

Mali’s external debt ratios have improved compared to the projections made at the
completion point (2003) mainly reflecting a CFA franc appreciation against the U.S. dollar
that has lowered the ratio of external debt to GDP, and better-than-expected US dollardenominated exports in 2004 that has improved the debt service ratio and the NPV of debtto-exports ratio. The NPV of debt-to-GDP in 2004 has dropped from 33 percent at the
completion point to 25 percent in the DSA. The NPV of debt-to-exports in 2005 is reduced
from 118 percent to 106 percent while the debt service ratio is unchanged at 6 percent in both
analyses.
5.
Macroeconomic projections are based on 2004 actual data, 2005 estimates for debt
and the principal macroeconomic indicators. Projections for key macroeconomic variables
have not been substantively changed compared to enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point
projections made in March 2003. Under the baseline scenario, projected GDP growth rises
gradually compared to the ten-year average of 5.5 percent (1995-2004), from 5.6 percent
during 2005-10 to 6 percent during 2011-25. The improvement in growth reflects an
assumption that a gradually increasing role of the private sector leads to more efficient
investment and production decisions, as well as gradual improvements in the quality of
human capital. The key sector developments incorporated in this scenario are: (i) broadbased production growth—agriculture (reflecting both increased planted area and yield),

-3-

cotton processing, energy, trade, and services; (ii) a projected decline in gold output
after 2008, followed by an assumed leveling off of production from 2014 onward (at 50 tons
per year equivalent to 2005 estimated production); and (iii) increased growth in nonmining
exports over the longer term, helping to offset the substantial slowdown in export growth
in 2010 and subsequent years as a result of the fall in gold production (Box 1). This
improvement results from diversification engendered by removing impediments to trade and
investment at the country and sub-regional level, and a gradual improvement of financial
intermediation by the banking system.

Real GDP is projected to grow by 5.6 percent per annum 2005-10 and 6.0 percent on
average during 2011-25.
Inflation remains at about 2.5 percent during the projection period.
Government revenue is stable at about 19 percent of GDP.
The fiscal deficit, excluding grants, declines to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and to less
than 6 percent thereafter. Including grants, the deficit declines to less than 3.7 percent
of GDP.
The noninterest current account deficit averages 8.0 percent of GDP during 2005-10
then weakens to 9.3 percent of GDP during 2011-25.
The volume of exports grows by about 9 percent during 2005-10; given the expected
decline in gold exports, it averages 4 percent thereafter. The terms of trade and real
exchange rate are projected to remain unchanged from 2010 onwards.
The volume of imports is projected to grow in line with real GDP.
Public sector external borrowing averages 4-5 percent of GDP a year; loans are
assumed to have an average maturity of 28 years, a grace period of 7 years, an average
interest rate of 0.7 percent, and a grant element of 50 percent. It is assumed that
65 percent of the new borrowings will come from multilateral sources and the
remaining 35 percent from bilateral sources. IDA disbursements are assumed to be
loans.
Net private capital inflows are assumed to average 2½ percent of GDP a year
(compared to 2.3 percent over the period 1995-2003).
A uniform discount rate of 5 percent is used for NPV calculations.

6.
Mali’s external debt ratios are projected to remain below, or close to, applicable
debt thresholds over the period 2005-25 (Box 2, Figure 1, Table 1). Based on the 2004
World Bank Country Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings, Mali is classified as a
medium performer, which determines the relevant debt thresholds. In particular:
•

the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall from an average of 28 percent
during 2005-10 to 22 percent in 2025, as a result of steady GDP growth;

-4-

•

the NPV of the debt-to-exports ratio increases over the projection period, particularly
after 2010 as export growth slows, and breaches the threshold level of 150 percent by
a moderate amount at the end of the projection period; and,

•

the debt service-to-export ratio is projected to decline marginally during the
period 2005-2010, and is projected to stabilize from 2010 onwards;

B. Standard and bound tests for baseline
7.
The standard set of sensitivity checks on the evolution of debt ratios suggest that
Mali continues to be vulnerable to external shocks over the period 2005–25 (Figure 2,
Table 2). Under an alternative scenario which sets key parameters to their historical average
values, debt to GDP and the NPV of debt to exports rise above the relevant threshold levels
by 2010, although owing to a high degree of concessional loan assistance, the debt service
ratio remains below the threshold. The key factor in the historical scenario is the high
noninterest current account deficit (14.3 percent of GDP compared to projections of around
9 percent of GDP). In a second scenario, with public sector loans at less favorable terms, the
external debt stock ratio indicates that Mali becomes at risk of debt distress by the end of the
projection period, underscoring the importance of retaining high levels of concessional
assistance (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 1).
8.
The bound sensitivity tests, assume adverse shocks to key parameters first
separately, and in some cases jointly. The main results of these sensitivity tests are that
despite improved GDP growth and containment of inflation, Mali remains vulnerable to
exogenous shocks, particularly:
•

a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline would result in a
sharp increase in the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio in 2006, which would cross the threshold
by 2007 placing Mali at risk of debt distress until 2022; and,

-5-

•

a temporary shock on export growth of one standard deviation is significant in magnitude
owing to the high standard deviation of exports. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
reaches 153 percent in 2007.

9.
Based on these findings, this analysis suggests that Mali has a moderate risk of
debt distress. The baseline scenario indicates that the debt-to-exports ratio is marginally
above the debt burden threshold toward the end of the projection period. Stress testing results
in the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports indicators exceeding thresholds over the medium
term (for export shocks, a 30 percent devaluation scenario and using historical averages of
key data), though the debt service-to-exports indicator remains well below the 20 percent
threshold in all cases. The low level of the debt service-to-exports indicator in both the
baseline and the stress testing highlights the importance of maintaining a high degree of
concessionality in future lending to Mali. Risks would clearly increase if, over the medium
term, the level of concessionality were to decrease.
C. Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
10.
Debt sustainability was also assessed under a Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) scenario. The MDRI scenario assumes a cut-off date of January 1, 2005 for IMF
and African Development Fund debt, and January 1, 2004 for IDA (International Development Association) loans. The scenario assumes an implementation date of January 1, 2006
for IMF and AfDB and July 1, 2006 for IDA. The projected loan disbursements from
multilaterals are assumed to be somewhat lowered relative to the baseline as a result of
MDRI, reflecting the amount and distribution of compensatory financing for IDA and the
AfDB relative to debt service relief. Nonetheless, net transfers from multilaterals would
increase as a result of MDRI over the medium term. This scenario results in a halving of the
debt-to-GDP ratio in 2006 and reduces the debt service ratio by half over the medium term to
a range of 3-5 percent of exports. However, over the longer term (twenty years) the MDRI
scenario debt indicators approach those in the baseline scenario (determined by new borrowing over the period 2005-25). The risk of debt distress in the MDRI scenario is low over
the medium term, but in the long term would return towards the moderate risk level assessed
in the baseline scenario. The scenario is based on current assumptions and may need to be
revised when the institution-specific terms of MDRI are finalized.
D. Conclusion
11.
The analysis indicates that external debt sustainability is broadly achieved under
baseline projections in relation to the policy dependent debt burden thresholds. However,
adverse external and internal shocks could result in breaching debt-to-exports and debt-toGDP thresholds over the medium term. Accordingly Mali is assessed as a having a moderate
risk of debt distress. Accelerating export growth and maintaining highly concessional loan
assistance are important factors in maintaining debt sustainability. The multilateral debt
reduction initiative (MDRI) expected to be implemented in 2006 is also projected to improve
the debt ratios significantly over the medium term.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second and Third Reviews
Under Mali's PRGF Arrangement and Approves US$3.8 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the second and third
reviews of Mali's economic performance under an SDR 9.3 million (about US$13.5 million)
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 05/55).
The completion of the reviews enables the release of a further SDR 2.7 million (about
US$3.8 million), which will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR
5.3 million (about US$ 7.7 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board granted waivers for the nonobservance of
performance criteria.
Following the Board discussion of Mali on December 19, 2005, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Malian authorities are to be commended for the continued implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies in the face of significant exogenous shocks. These policies have
supported macroeconomic stability, limited the deterioration of public finances, and maintained a
focus on reducing the incidence of poverty. The gradual pace of structural reform
implementation does give rise to some concern, however, since it could constrain Mali’s
potential for robust economic growth and accelerated progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals.
“Mali remains vulnerable to further shocks, linked to weather conditions and a volatile terms of
trade. Accordingly, it may be necessary to further strengthen adjustment efforts, in particular by
maintaining a prudent fiscal position and allowing domestic prices to adjust to changes in
international prices. This will require the continued pass-through of increases of international oil
prices to pump prices and the continued implementation of a flexible producer price mechanism
for cotton that limits the risks of budget support to the sector, while also protecting farmer
interests. While the policy response to food shortages in 2005 was commendable, the authorities
need to examine impediments to food trade, particularly at a regional level.

-2-

”Ongoing public finance management reforms need to forge ahead, and medium-term budgetary
policies relating to pensions, the efficiency of spending, and social safety net payments will
continue to require attention.
“Despite the privatization of the cottonseed oil company, continued delays in the government’s
disengagement from the cotton, banking, and telecommunications sectors raise concerns over its
commitment to private sector development. The long-term development of the cotton sector
requires concrete steps to open up the sector to private capital, strengthen financial management,
and other operational reforms. The 2006 program of structural reforms regarding privatization
and management of state enterprises appropriately addresses the key challenges. The full
implementation would provide a clear signal of the authorities’ policy priorities.
“Determined reforms to improve the investment environment and competitiveness are needed to
boost productivity and the growth potential of the economy. Indeed, the authorities may wish to
include an explicit growth strategy in the Poverty Reduction Strategy being developed next year.
“The CFA franc peg to the euro continues to underpin low inflation and interest rates in Mali.
Moreover, the West African Economic and Monetary Union’s economic convergence criteria are
a useful discipline on the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies. Surveillance of the financial
sector needs to be strengthened while, at the same time, steps need to be considered to
reinvigorate financial intermediation and private sector lending.
“Mali’s eligibility for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative will substantially reduce the risk of
debt distress over the medium term. In view of the country’s continued vulnerability to shocks
and substantial external financing needs, preserving debt sustainability will require limiting new
borrowing to highly concessional loans,” Mr. Carstens said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, or PRSP. This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies,
to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, and
are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Mali
On December, 19, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mali.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF has a mandate to exercise
surveillance over the economic, financial and exchange rate policies of its members in order to
ensure the effective operation of the international monetary system. The IMF’s appraisal of such
policies involves a comprehensive analysis of the general economic situation and policy strategy
of each member country aimed at helping member countries achieve orderly macroeconomic and
financial conditions and sustainable economic growth. IMF economists visit the member
country, usually once a year, to collect and analyze data and hold discussions with government
and central bank officials. Upon its return, the staff submits a report to the IMF’s Executive
Board for discussion. The Board’s views are subsequently summarized and transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Mali
December 19, 2005

I. Introduction
I would like to thank staff for a comprehensive set of papers on Mali’s recent economic
developments and prospects. Mali has demonstrated over the years strong political will to
achieve high and sustainable economic growth through the implementation of a wide range
of reforms notwithstanding repeated adverse economic shocks. My Malian authorities are
very appreciative of the assistance provided by its development partners. Going forward,
external assistance remains crucial for the successful implementation of well-conceived and
designed poverty-reducing measures. In this regard, my authorities are thankful to the G-8
member countries, the IMF, and the international community for the adoption of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The implementation of this initiative scheduled to
take place early in 2006 will contribute to assist Mali in its efforts to implement sound
policies, while further reducing the country’s debt burden, and enabling the authorities to
make more tangible progress toward achieving the MDGs.
Following a difficult year of low cotton prices, high oil product prices, and insufficient
production of food crops in 2005, more recent macroeconomic developments are
encouraging. The economy is recovering with a likely outturn of real GDP growth of 5.5
percent in 2005, owing to a return to normal harvest in the second half of the year and
increasing production of both gold and cotton. However, inflation has risen, notably on
account of reduced food supply and skyrocketing oil product prices. The fiscal outlook has
slightly deteriorated, but only temporary and on account of fiscal efforts to curb the effects of
adverse shocks in the cotton sector.
Looking forward, the economic outlook is positive, and with good rainfall, agricultural
production should rebound and inflation decline in 2006. Improving terms of trade, closing
current account deficit and increased public investment will add to the authorities’ reform
program aimed at strengthening the banking sector and promoting the development of the
private sector to give a new impetus to Mali’s growth prospects. It is important that the Fund
and the international community continue and strengthen their support to Mali. Increases in
concessional loans and budget grants, which have proved critical to the country’s fiscal
sustainability efforts, should be maintained and supplemented by innovative sources of
financing that do not undermine the country’s economic fundamentals. On their part, my
authorities will continue to do their utmost efforts to mobilize non-banking domestic
resources to meet their macroeconomic and development objectives.
II. Performance Under the Program
Fiscal Performance
Despite an adverse environment that has necessitated significant budget outlays, my
authorities have managed to maintain an overall prudent fiscal management, which has

-2resulted in a fiscal position in 2004 and 2005, consistent with the program objectives. All
quantitative performance criteria at end-June and end-September 2005 have been met,
including on the ceiling on net domestic financing, the nonaccumulation of external
payments arrears, external borrowing concessionality and short-term external borrowing. In
addition, they have observed all three financial performance indicators on cumulative tax
revenues, cumulative wage bill and overall basic fiscal balance.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector
Mali’s monetary policy, which is conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank of West
African States (BCEAO), in the context of a fixed exchange rate regime, continues to serve
the country’s economy well. Inflation is kept at sustainable levels, despite the supply shocks
and high oil product prices.
As regards the banking sector, liquidity remains high. Indeed, bankable projects being
limited, credit is consequently concentrated in a few sectors, notably the cotton sector which
experiences some difficulties with the decline in exports prices. With regard to compliance
with prudential norms, my authorities are aware that some banks are falling short of
prudential requirements set out by the regional supervisory body. As a measure to deal with
this issue, they have undertaken a review of commercial banks’ loan portfolios which will
provide the basis for actions to strengthen the banks. Steps have also been taken, in order to
restructure the housing bank.
External Sector
The deterioration of the external environment due in particular to the surge of oil prices, and
the slump in cotton exports has led to a further weakening of the current account deficit.
Moreover, the protracted crisis in Côte d’Ivoire continues to impact negatively on regional
trade in general and affecting Mali, in particular. However, due to the authorities’ persistent
pursuit of good policies, the external sector remains fairly resilient with external reserves
stabilized at a level of 6 months of imports coverage.
Structural Reforms
The structural reform program has experienced delays, many of which are results of factors
which are out of the government’s control. Indeed, while all structural prior actions for the
second and third reviews of the program were executed, the implementation of structural
performance criteria and benchmarks has been less successful. The criterion on the cotton
producer price was met, and that on the announcement of a base cotton producer price for
2005/06 aimed at reducing the risks for the budget was observed just two days after the
intended day. The beginning of actuarial studies on the Caisse des Retraités du Mali (CRM)
and audit of INPS contributions and beneficiaries – criterion not met on time – was
subsequently observed, as was the benchmark on the social safety net. In addition, three
criteria and benchmarks were not observed on account of factors that are not under the
authorities’ control: (1) a court case contesting the government shareholding has delayed the
closing date for acceptance of final bids for the sale of the government’s share in the Banque

-3Internationale du Mali (BIM), and (2) the required technical assistance to complete a study
aimed at strengthening the collection of nontax revenues by the Ministry of Property and
Land Affairs was not available. Finally, the completion of a study intended to describe the
appropriate rate structures of electricity rates and to propose a mechanism to support the poor
has been postponed to May 2006, with a larger scope for the study.
In view of the overall good track record of Mali, and given the adverse economic
environment faced by this economy as well as the country’s capacity constraints, my
authorities are requesting a waiver for nonobservance of structural performance criteria. They
are fully aware of the need to improve Mali’s administrative capacity, in order to strengthen
structural program implementation. T/A is highly needed.
III. Program Policies Looking Forward
Cognizant of the challenges still lying ahead, my authorities remain committed to the
implementation of their comprehensive medium-term economic program. They intend to put
emphasis on policies and reforms aimed at improving economic efficiency and
competitiveness through strict fiscal management, structural reforms in the cotton and
banking sectors, and the strengthening of public institutions as well as other capacity
building. This will sustain GDP growth at levels consistent with poverty reduction objectives
and the attainment of the MDGs. The program laid out in their previous Letter of Intent
(LOI) and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) is reinforced in the
current LOI. This program is ambitious, including in the cotton sector reform, but remains
realistic and reflects my authorities’ determination to move forward.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal discipline, even though difficult in the context of the adverse economic environment,
remains the motto of the fiscal policy stance over the medium-term. The budget will not be
supported by use of domestic credit or treasury bills, except if required to counter unforeseen
shortfalls in budgetary grants or concessional loans and meet current-year obligations.
Already for ending 2005, the authorities have identified additional budgetary assistance of
CFA Francs 9 billion to cover shortfalls in revenue and higher spending needs with a view to
close the previously anticipated financing gap.
As regards 2006, a fully financed draft budget was submitted to the National Assembly in
September 2005. This budget contains important measures meant to improve revenue,
including the strengthening of collection units and import taxation as well as regulatory steps
for a prudent implementation of the revised investment code that will prevent tax losses. The
authorities also envisage to establish a petroleum product price mechanism by end-March
2006 allowing a certain pass-through of the international oil prices to pump prices.
On the spending front, the authorities aim to focus on health, and education sectors, as well
as roads and institutional capacity building. They stand ready to cut back on spending, should
revenue realization falls below target. Gross financing from external partners is expected to
increase substantially in 2006. As stated above, this assistance is crucial for Mali and we call

-4on the donor community to meet their financing commitments. In the same vein, the
upcoming multilateral debt cancellation under the MDRI debt relief to which Mali is eligible
and qualifies will create budgetary leeway enabling further progress towards the MDGs.
Financial Sector Strengthening
My Malian authorities have made clear that they will keep focus on the strengthening of the
financial system through increasing the weight of the private sector in the banking system
and improving banks and non-banks’ management. The government divestiture from two
important banks, namely Banque Internationale du Mali (BIM) and Banque de
Développement du Mali (BDM) is waiting court ruling and an agreement on the parallel sale
of shares by the Central bank of West African States (BCEAO). As regards the housing bank
( Banque de l’Habitat du Mali, BHM), the authorities are implementing a restructuring plan
centered on recapitalization following measures to enhance its financial position. This
restructuring will be followed by a sale of government’s equity to the shareholders. Other
efforts to revitalize financial intermediation will include a settlement of claims of commercial
banks on government as well as the strengthening of the supervision of microfinance
institutions which has been transferred to the Ministry of Economy and Finance and , thus,
requires the improvement of the latter’s supervision capacity.
Structural Reform Program
In light of past fiscal shortfalls, the authorities are reforming public finance management.
Notably, they will firmly implement an action plan with a focus on strengthening the
agencies in charge of collecting taxes and customs, improving procurement, extending the
computer network of the Treasury, and improving accountability.
While privatization of the Compagnie Malienne pour le Développement du Textile (CMDT)
has been slower than planned, it is important to seek for the best approach possible and take
into account the interest of Malian cotton producers. Progress has been made with the
adoption by CMDT’s shareholders for a definition of a strategy for privatization by endDecember 2005. The privatization of other non-financial companies is also ongoing, notably
the cottonseed oil company (HUICOMA) which was completed in June 2005 and the
telecommunications company (SOTELMA) which conclusion is expected by the fourth
quarter of 2006. The authorities are committed to design by end-2006 a medium-term
progress through 2008.
Finally in the electricity sector, the authorities confirm their commitment to private
management of the electricity company, although the government will keep a strategic
majority stake.
IV. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
The fiscal leeway that will be derived from the expected debt relief under the MDRI will
enable further progress in poverty reduction and more broadly in achieving the MDGs. The

-5authorities are preparing their second PRSP covering the period 2007-11, which will focus on
matching identified budget room with the costs of poverty reducing efforts.
V. Other Important Issues
In addition to the debt cancellation under the MDRI, other actions are highly needed to
enable Mali to meet its economic growth and socio-development objectives, notably capacity
building and improved conditions for free and equitable trade.
Difficulties in implementing the structural reform program have highlighted the crucial need
to strengthen capacity building in Mali. My authorities are very much appreciative of donors’
support through technical assistance, which nevertheless requires to be increased and well
focused. We also call on the rapid decision regarding the request made by the authorities for
a FSAP. Finally, the selected issues paper makes evidence on the importance for growth of
infrastructure building, which is a crucial component of capacity building.
On the trade issue, we would like to renew our call for international trade, free of subsidies,
including in the agricultural sector and quantitative impediments to market access. Countries
like Mali have been harshly affected by such restrictions and shocks to the cotton sector. We
call on a successful conclusion of the Doha Round.
VI. Conclusion
My Malian authorities are strongly committed to continue implementing their program of
sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, with a view to make important steps
towards sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs. In this
regard, they appreciate the support provided by the international community, which is crucial
to the success of their development efforts, and they call on the continuing financial and
technical assistance from the country’s development partners.
In light of the progress made thus far and taking into account the tremendous difficulties
facing Mali, I call on the Executive Board to support my Malian authorities’ request for
waivers for non observance of structural performance criteria and conclude the second and
third reviews under the PRGF-supported program.
