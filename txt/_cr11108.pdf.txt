Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Luxembourg
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Jan Kees Martijn
April 27, 2011
Executive Summary
Growth prospects: Growth is projected to slow to 3¼ percent in 2011, reflecting prospects in core
Europe, ongoing bank restructuring, and the withdrawal of fiscal support. Economic activity could be
stronger if global financial markets avoid severe turbulence and growth in core Europe proves robust.
But downside risks prevail. These risks are associated with ongoing concerns regarding sovereign debt
in the EU periphery, feedback interactions with the banking sector, and knock on effects on economic
activity in core Europe.
Limiting financial sector vulnerabilities: The financial sector has stabilized but banks remain exposed
to liquidity and counterparty risks stemming from large exposures to their parent banking groups. Bank
exposures to sovereign risk from the EU periphery are also significant, including indirectly through their
parent banks. To improve the financial stability policy framework, the FSAP recommended further
enhancing on-site supervision and increasing the supervisor’s operational independence. There is also a
need to strengthen Luxembourg’s financial safety net by improving the institutional setup and enhancing
the bank resolution toolkit. Still, a number of critical financial policy areas fall beyond the purview of
the Luxembourg authorities. They are thus urged to maintain an active involvement in relevant
supervisory colleges and continue to pursue pragmatic steps facilitating international collaboration in the
area of burden-sharing arrangements for the resolution of cross-border banks.
Achieving sustainable fiscal consolidation: The 2011 budget appropriately begins fiscal consolidation,
but the bulk of the adjustment stems from a cap on public investment. In the medium term, this cap
should be replaced with current spending cuts—notably by rationalizing social transfers and subsidies—
to bolster growth prospects. Fiscal consolidation can be also supported by a full-fledged medium-term
budgetary framework with binding multi-year expenditure ceilings. Regardless, should growth slow
more than expected, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate up to the Maastricht limit.
Reforming the pension system: Parametric reforms are needed to gradually increase the effective and
statutory retirement ages to reflect life expectancy gains and align contributions and benefits. The
authorities are also urged to expeditiously implement recently approved health care reforms. Putting in
place reforms early will facilitate phasing-in adjustments, and establishing periodic automatic reviews of
the social security’s financial viability would enable timely adjustments.
Boosting competitiveness: Besides continued attention to infrastructure and education, revamping the
system of social transfers and subsidies will be needed also to limit adverse work incentives and support
investment in human capital. In addition, even though eliminating wage indexation remains advisable in
the medium term, excluding food and fuel prices from the reference index would improve the alignment
of real wages and labor productivity. Continued efforts are also a need in the short run to curb automatic
wage increases to safeguard competitiveness.

An externally-driven economic recovery
has continued gathering strength in 2010.
Following a smaller-than-expected contraction
in 2009—two-thirds of which associated with the
financial sector—a sharp recovery has ensued
mirroring developments in core Europe. Early
in 2010, activity was supported by restocking, which
has ended, and investment. Exports have increased
strongly since the third quarter as financial services,

primarily associated with the investment fund industry, and exports of metal products

3.
The financial sector has stabilized in 2010. No further financial institution has
failed, and restructuring has continued, including in the context of EU-approved
reorganization plans. Reflecting ongoing deleveraging, bank balance sheets have contracted
by 2½ times GDP in 2010 and declined further in early 2011. In aggregate, bank
capitalization has increased and appeared broadly adequate but remained uneven across
banks. Interest margins have remained compressed, but bank profits have increased due to
strong commission and fee income and lower provisioning needs. In turn, the investment
fund industry has experienced a fast recovery, with total assets surpassing their pre-crisis
peak (Box 1). Meanwhile, credit conditions in Luxembourg have remained stable with
moderate increases in consumer lending spreads, but no widespread tightening in lending
standards.
4.
Price pressures, while still moderate, have picked up. Headline inflation has
increased in the second half of 2010 reflecting global food and fuel price developments and
adjustments in some administered prices. Core inflation has trended up more moderately in
the face of a sluggish labor market, averaging about 1½ percent in 2010 and a bit higher in
early 2011 (Figure 2). Employment growth has gained pace, particularly for temporary
workers. Still, the unemployment rate has stabilized at about 6 percent (Annex I). Moreover,
official unemployment statistics do not reflect workers participating in employment support
schemes—about 2 percent of the labor force—nor do they include cross-border job losses,

5
which represent the most variable part of the labor market.4 Labor costs have remained
subdued despite some increases in layoff compensation, particularly in the banking sector.
Average wages have grown well below their historic pace in 2010, but picked up more
recently. The latter has resulted from the automatic backward-looking wage indexation
adjustment in mid-2010—Luxembourg is one of the few EU countries with such an
indexation—and an increase in minimum wages in early 2011.
5.
Fiscal policy has continued to support the economy in 2010. Following substantial
fiscal support in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the fiscal deficit widened from
1 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 1¾ percent of GDP in 2010. In part, this was driven by
public investment and enhanced labor market support measures, including an expanded list
of eligible sectors and temporary measures to reduce effective labor costs. Still, the fiscal
deficit was about 2 percent of GDP lower than budgeted due to higher-than-expected
revenues. Strong direct tax collections were partly due to lags in the calculation of taxes—
reflecting buoyant pre-crisis profits—combined with the authorities’ efforts to clear corporate
tax arrears as well as increases in subscription tax revenues from investment funds. Indirect
taxes also surprised on the upside, primary VAT revenues that more than offset weaker-thanexpected taxes on international transactions.
6.
Led by financial service exports, the current account surplus increased in 2010.
Export growth has outpaced the euro area while deficits in income and trade accounts
widened. In large part, this has reflected the fact that Luxembourg’s exports are dominated
by services—notably financial services—which together with metal products and
intermediate capital goods have experienced strong demand, particularly from Germany and,
to a lesser extent, Asia. Reflecting the investment fund industry developments, portfolio
investment flows surged in 2010 despite a slowdown in the third quarter. Although
competitiveness has improved modestly in 2010—partly due to unwinding of crisis-related
labor hoarding—Luxembourg has lost competitiveness over the past decade (Box 2).

4

Unemployed cross-border workers register in their home countries and are not entitled to full payments from
Luxembourg’s unemployment insurance scheme. Instead, Luxembourg contributes with three months of
unemployment benefits to the country of origin computed according to the benefits in that country. They do,
nonetheless, qualify for other specific labor market programs and related assistance.

6
Box 1. Recent Developments in Luxembourg’s Investment Fund Industry
Luxembourg’s investment fund industry has rebounded vigorously following the peak of
the global financial crisis. Having declined by almost 20 percent in 2008, the total value of
investment funds’ assets increased by an accumulated 44 percent in 2010–11 and posted
uninterrupted net inflows in the last
seven quarters. As a result, the total
Luxembourg: Investment Fund Industry
value of assets under management has
surpassed the €2 trillion mark attained
before the crisis, helping consolidate
Luxembourg investment fund
industry’s leadership in the EU in
terms of fund domiciliation. This
reflected strong investor demand,
migration of funds from other
jurisdictions, and valuation changes—
the latter accounting for about ⅔ of the
cumulative increase in assets. The bulk
of Luxembourg’s investment funds are distributed in Europe through an extensive use of the
UCITS European brand. Moreover, following years of active promotion in other regions, there is
a strong association between Luxembourg’s investment fund industry and the UCITS brand,
particularly in Asia.

Linkages between investment funds and their sponsoring banks entail liquidity, market,
and credit risks with some ameliorating factors. Interconnections between banks and their
sponsored funds are multiple. These include banks’ proprietary investments into their funds;
banks’ financial commitments to their funds (either contractual or associated with reputational or
legal concerns); and funds’ holdings of bank liabilities. In Luxembourg, exposures between
investment funds and their sponsoring banking groups seem to be limited. For the ten largest
funds, banks’ proprietary investments represent less than 1 percent of the funds’ net asset values
(NAV). In turn, banks’ lending is less than 0.2 percent of their sponsored funds’ NAV and funds’
holdings of bank liabilities are low both in terms of their NAV and in terms of the liabilities of
their sponsoring banks. While banks’ liquidity assistance to their sponsored funds would likely
increase under distressed market conditions, the possibility of closing funds’ redemptions and
suspending NAV calculation represent risk-ameliorating factors. Also, investment fund portfolios
seem to be well diversified geographically—roughly 50 (16) percent of portfolios are invested in
the Euro Area (U.S.)—and by asset classes. The bulk of the portfolios are in fixed income
assets—including deposits—and equities. Likewise, exposures to sovereign risk are diversified,
with Germany, U.S., and France constituting the bulk of these securities.
In past few years, increased activity has taken place in structured strategies offered under
the UCITS framework. Since the onset of the crisis, demand for exchange traded funds (ETFs)
has grown worldwide and so has product complexity. In Luxembourg, more exotic products that
provide leverage under UCITS-compliant ETFs have grown quickly, albeit from low levels.
Since 2008, these new funds have attracted inflows of about €35 billion, and Luxembourg
domiciled products account for about ½ of total alternative UCITS assets and net inflows in 2010.

7
Box 2. Evolution of Competitiveness
Luxembourg’s competitiveness has worsened over the past decade despite a small narrowing
in the competitiveness gap in 2010. This reflects primarily spillover effects from rapid financial
sector growth as well as automatic wage indexation that have not been fully matched by
productivity gains. Still, some gains in competitiveness can be seen in unit labor cost-based REERs
estimates and the average CGER-based competitiveness gap in 2010. In part, this reflects the
unwinding of labor hoarding that had been prevalent in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
But also this reflects a more favorable (larger surplus) outlook for Luxembourg’s medium-term
current account balance, which is now projected to be closer to its NFA stabilizing level. These
gains, however, could easily vanish going forward given the volatility in investment income and
financial service exports projections.

II. OUTLOOK
7.
Export-driven growth is envisaged to slow in 2011. In line with prospects in core
Europe, growth is projected to decline from about 3½ percent in 2010 to about 3¼ percent
in 2011. Also, increases in the value of managed portfolios in the investment fund industry
are likely to lose steam and banking sector restructuring and deleveraging will likely
continue. Domestic demand is expected to strengthen modestly, as growth in private
consumption is partially offset by fiscal consolidation, and private investment is projected to
remain sluggish as installed capacity has yet to be fully utilized.
8.
Inflation is projected to increase, but a weak labor market will keep a lid on
price pressures in 2011. Driven by global food and fuel developments, headline inflation on
average is expected to rise from about 2¾ percent in 2010 to about 3½ percent in 2011. Still,
core inflation is likely to remain moderate in line with low wage pressures as social partners
have agreed to defer automatic wage indexation increases to the fourth quarter of 2011.
9.
While there is a potential for more positive developments, the balance of risks
remains tilted to the downside. Luxembourg could experience stronger growth should
global financial markets avoid extreme turbulence and growth in core Europe proves robust.
But downside risks prevail. These risks are associated with Luxembourg-based banks’
exposure to counterparty and liquidity risks stemming from large cross-border intra-group
transactions (Figure 3) and lingering fiscal solvency concerns in the EU periphery.5 Holdings
of bonds of EU sovereigns are material in some banks and they also face indirect risks from
exposures of their parent banking groups, particularly those incorporated in the distressed
countries.6 Renewed problems in sovereign debt markets or concerns on the financial
soundness of parent banks could be transmitted into the domestic banking system. In turn, a
sudden loss of investor confidence could trigger outflows from the investment fund industry.
While the likelihood that this would affect the local banking sector appears limited,
international spillover effects could be amplified given Luxembourg’s fund pivotal
international role in investment funds.
10.
The authorities broadly agreed, but saw the risks to be more balanced in 2011.
While recognizing the heightened uncertainties, the authorities were more sanguine regarding
potential upside risks in activity in core Europe. They also noted that domestic demand could
be stronger than projected by staff as public investment would increase slightly in nominal
terms and private investment is likely to grow, albeit moderately. Regarding downside risks,
5

The interbank positions of Luxembourg-based banks represent about ½ of their assets and liabilities, with
roughly ⅔ are cross-border intra-group operations.

6

Luxembourg-based banks’ exposure to sovereign risk from Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were
equivalent to about ½ of banks’ own resources system wide and exceeded ¾ of the own resources in a group of
institutions jointly accounting for about 14 percent of system assets. As a mitigating factor, about ½ of
Luxembourg-based banks’ exposure to these five countries was to Italy.

9
the authorities noted that some banks have lowered their direct exposures to EU-periphery
sovereign debt, including at the supervisor’s request, but recognized the indirect risks
stemming from the exposures of their parent banks.
III. POLICY CHALLENGES
11.
Against this backdrop, Luxembourg faces the challenge of limiting financial
sector vulnerabilities while promoting sustainable growth and employment.
Forthcoming changes in the global regulatory landscape will likely impact Luxembourg’s
financial sector. In this regard, the consultation focused on preserving financial stability,
addressing fiscal challenges, and fostering competitiveness and labor market flexibility.
A. Safeguarding Financial Stability
12.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) found that the banking
sector’s main risks reflect their large intra-group exposures and sovereign bond
holdings. Stress test results indicate that parent bank failures could trigger instability in
Luxembourg’s banking system through counterparty and liquidity risks. Tail risks were
associated with a scenario of protracted slowdown in economic activity in core EU,
particularly if combined with sovereign debt problems in the EU periphery. In such a
scenario, the adverse effects for Luxembourg would be magnified by the size of its financial
sector relative to the economy. Fiscal contingencies stemming from banking sector problems
could be substantial given the financial sector’s size and the lack of a well-defined
framework for cross-border bank resolution and burden-sharing mechanisms. Still, public
assistance would likely be circumscribed to a handful of institutions that are active in the
domestic retail market.7
13.
In the investment fund sector, the systemic importance of Luxembourg as a
global hub introduces potential cross-border spillover risks. The likelihood of contagion
triggered by large outflows from the investment fund industry to the domestic banking
system appears small due to limited balance sheet exposures. However, as observed in other
jurisdictions, sudden redemption pressures may entail liabilities for sponsoring banks. More
broadly, global investor confidence in Luxembourg’s investment fund industry could be
affected by perceptions of a tarnished European UCITS brand name. In this regard, it is
important for the authorities to monitor rapidly growing UCITS products—particularly
leveraged structured products—and ensure that these continue to be sold only to investors
that fully comprehend and are able to bear their risks. In turn, a loss of confidence in

7

Staff calculations suggest that, in an extreme adverse scenario, contingent public liabilities stemming from
support to these banks could reach 15 percent of GDP. This should not threaten Luxembourg’s fiscal
sustainability.

10
Luxembourg’s funds may trigger knock-on effects on other European financial systems, and
beyond, given the global asset allocation of these funds.
14.
Supervisory effectiveness and consistency with best practices—drawing also on
the lessons from the crisis and building on recent reform efforts—would entail further
improvements to the financial stability policy framework (Box 3). Specifically, the FSAP
recommended:


Further enhancing financial sector supervision. The FSAP saw merit in revising the
legal statutes of the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) to
increase its operational independence from the Ministry of Finance and focus its
mandate on the preservation of financial stability. The FSAP also noted undue delays
in the presentation and follow-up of on-site findings, due to the relatively modest
number of on-site inspectors and gaps in CSSF’s internal review and decision making
processes. The FSAP also saw merit in strengthening the sanction regime and the
enforcement and severity of corrective actions.8 In addition, the FSAP recommended
clarifying the respective roles of the Central Bank of Luxembourg (BCL) and CSSF
as regards liquidity risk supervision.



Strengthening Luxembourg’s financial safety net. As for the institutional setup and
toolkit for bank resolution, areas for improvement include allowing for an earlier
control of problem banks and facilitating their restructuring on a going-concern basis.
The draft law revamping the deposit insurance scheme and introducing ex-ante
funding is welcome and awaits the issuance of the corresponding EU directive.
Finally, given potentially large liabilities from emergency liquidity assistance to
Luxembourg-based banks, safeguarding the BCL’s capital remains important.

15.
A number of critical financial policy areas, however, fall beyond the purview of
Luxembourg’s authorities. Even though the authorities have taken and, should continue to
take, appropriate actions, the presence of large foreign banking groups and sizable crossborder exposures challenge supervision and crisis resolution. Assessing banks’ risk profiles
at the consolidated level hinges on joint home and host supervisors’ work. The authorities are
thus encouraged to continue their active involvement in relevant supervisory colleges, which
may require additional resources. Regarding the lack of ex-ante burden-sharing arrangements
for the resolution of cross-border banks and pending the completion of EU reforms, the
authorities should continue to pursue pragmatic steps facilitating international collaboration
in this area.

8

For example, in some cases capital add-ons still resulted in regulatory capital requirements well below actual
own funds.

Luxembourg has made rapid progress in addressing key shortcomings in its
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework. The authorities have speedily implemented a remedial action plan to address the
numerous shortcomings noted in the FATF’s February 2010 review. Luxembourg has thus
been removed from the International Cooperation Review Group process recently. Going

12
forward, the effectiveness of the new measures will be monitored in the regular FATF
follow-up process.
17.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and policy advice. They
acknowledged that cross-border contagion from parent banks is a major risk to Luxembourgbased banks. The authorities stressed that they monitor these risks closely and remain ready
to take further actions on a case-by-case basis. Also, they noted that a CSSF circular is being
prepared that will require stronger risk management practices, especially as relates to arm’s
length relationships between local subsidiaries and their foreign parent banks. More broadly,
the authorities stressed ongoing work in the context of EU supervisory colleges, and
reiterated their commitment to enhance cross-border collaboration relating to financial
supervision and crisis resolution. They also noted the recent preparation of a draft law aimed
at strengthening the CSSF’s sanctioning and enforcement powers as well as their intention to
adjust the legal framework in order to better guarantee the CSSF’s operational
independence—thereby addressing two key FSAP recommendations. The authorities
indicated that they intend to move ahead with the approval of the new law on Luxembourg’s
deposit insurance scheme later this year—should the issuance of the new EU directive be
further delayed—and increase the BCL’s capital.
B. Fiscal Consolidation and Pension Reform
18.
The 2011 budget has appropriately initiated fiscal consolidation. The budget
targets cutting the deficit from 1¾ percent of GDP to about 1 percent, with the consolidation
being predominately expenditure-based. A cap on public investment to 2009 levels accounts
for about ⅔ of the adjustment. On the revenue side, the budget includes measures directed at
upper-income households and, to a lesser extent, corporations. Specifically, a new crisis tax
of 0.8 percent on personal income has been levied on all households earning more than the
minimum wage. Also, the solidarity tax and the top marginal personal income tax rate have
been increased (Table 4). While fiscal consolidation is fitting to the stage of the cycle, should
economic activity slow more than expected, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate up to the Maastricht limit.
19.
Current expenditure compression—particularly social transfers and the public
sector wage bill—should be central to fiscal efforts. The brunt of the 2011 adjustment
falls, however, on public investment, with further reductions of about ¾ percent of GDP on
average in the next five years. The budget’s tight investment envelop could serve to improve
the prioritization and efficiency of public investment projects in the short run. But sustained
declines in public investment may harm growth prospects and there will thus be a need to
replace the cap with current expenditure cuts over time.
20.
Going forward, fiscal prospects are clouded by the lack of pension reform and
uncertainties associated with a changing financial regulatory environment. Luxembourg
faces the largest age-related expenditure increases in the EU. Official projections show that

13
age-related expenditures are set to double to 40 percent of GDP by 2060, of which ¾ stem
from old-age pension benefits. A surge in age-related spending is projected from 2020
onwards associated with accrued pension benefits combined with an aging population
(Figure 4). Official projections foresee pension reserves to be depleted by about 2035 and
continue deteriorating sharply thereafter. In addition, forthcoming financial regulatory
changes may serve to erode Luxembourg’s medium-run tax revenues.
21.
In this regard, the authorities have been pursuing a two-pronged strategy.
Specifically,


Stop-gap measures to contain age-related spending starting in 2011. They have
divided the 2-percent pension benefit increase scheduled for 2011 into two tranches,
with the second tranche delayed until January 2012 (lowering expenditure by about
0.1 percent of GDP in 2011). On the health care front, increases in co-payments and
contributions, combined with revisions to hospital charges were approved by
parliament in late 2010.9 The authorities have also introduced a flat 1¼ percent health
insurance premium for workplace injuries replacing the existing risk-based scale, in
effect increasing the premium on the financial sector.10 This has been part of a broader
health care system reform that envisages a welcome establishment of a binding twoyear budget for hospitals.



Reaffirming their medium-term fiscal target of a balance in 2014. Abstracting from
fiscal consequences of aging, this would stabilize medium-term debt at about
30 percent of GDP.

22.
There remains nonetheless a pressing need to articulate a lasting fiscal
consolidation strategy. On current policies, the projected fiscal balance in 2014 would fall
short of the authorities’ target by about 1½ percent of GDP, including the need to eliminate
the investment cap and replace transitory revenue measures. The authorities have not detailed
fiscal consolidation measures to achieve their medium-term target. In this regard,
establishing a medium-term budgetary framework could help prioritized public spending.
While pursuing potential efficiency gains in other current spending, the emphasis should be
on rationalizing social transfers and subsidies that are generous even by European standards
(Figure 5). A comprehensive review of social transfers and subsidies—needed also for social
justice—should proceed to improve their effectiveness, discard programs that are no longer
justified, and ameliorate adverse work incentives. Besides the aforementioned room to cut

9

The 2011 budget does not reflect this adjustment estimated to be about ¼ percent of GDP (€107 million).

10

The increase in premiums paid by the financial sector is equivalent to roughly 1 percentage point of their
overall personnel expenses (0.1 percent of GDP)

14
current spending, tax increases also should be viewed with caution in current global financial
environment.
23.
Fiscal sustainability will ultimately hinge on reforming the pension system and
implementing recently-approved healthcare reforms. Notwithstanding its current surplus,
Luxembourg's old-age pension system runs one of the EU’s largest actuarial deficits. In
addition, the large and volatile share of cross-border workers in the labor force, and their
current role as net pension contributors, introduces an additional element of uncertainty in the
system’s long-run finances. In the context of tripartite discussions, the authorities have
proposed a number of parametric changes to old-age pensions, notably increasing the
effective retirement age. Implementing these proposals would go a long way to protect
Luxembourg’s old-age pension system and putting these in place early would facilitate a
desirable phasing in of reforms. In addition, limiting pension benefit indexation to no more
than cost of living adjustments will be needed to address the burden on the system’s finances
from existing retirees and entitlements. On the health care front, recent reforms are welcome
and should be expeditiously implemented. Moving ahead promptly on both fronts can avoid
the need for radical measures as the peak of the fiscal impact of aging nears.
24.
While agreeing that fiscal consolidation was appropriate, the authorities were
reluctant to allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully, should growth slow more than
expected. Besides the negligible fiscal multipliers in a small open economic, political
realities introduce an asymmetry in the cycle whereby it was exceedingly difficult to
consolidate during an upswing. They stressed nonetheless their commitment to achieve a
balance by 2014. The authorities concurred with the need to replace the investment cap with
current expenditure cuts and rein in social transfers. In this connection, they will conduct a
comprehensive review of the existing social programs to assess their effectiveness and
minimize adverse work incentives. They noted ongoing work to reform budget procedures
and address the public wage bill, and they did not see the need for further tax increases.
25.
They also broadly shared concerns regarding aging-related expenditure
pressures. The authorities noted an increasing awareness throughout society regarding the
need to reform old-age pensions. They have publicly announced their intention to introduce
parametric reforms to better align benefits and contributions by extending the number of
working years required to receive a full pension. Regarding unfunded liabilities arising from
existing retirees and entitlements, the authorities were still formulating their policies but
noted that, if needed, social contributions could be raised. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to continue looking for a set of parametric adjustment that would place the
system on a firm financial footing, but discussions with social partners will remain difficult.

15
C. Long-Run Challenges to Financial-Sector Led Growth and Competitiveness
26.
Luxembourg’s financial-sector based growth model will be challenged by
forthcoming changes to the international regulatory framework. In light of the level and
quality of banks’ capital, the new international capital regime is unlikely to pose major
difficulties for Luxembourg-based banks. While forthcoming changes and their
implementation schedules have yet to finalized, changes to the liquidity regime—critically if
intra-group exposures are subject to tighter restrictions—could potentially have a significant
impact on Luxembourg-based banks’ ability to serve as liquidity conduits in the medium
term. The financial sector, in particular the banking sector, will also continue facing
headwinds from ongoing global deleveraging and an international push to harmonize taxation
and enhance transparency.

The economy’s ability to adapt to a changing environment will hinge on
regaining lost competitiveness, fostering real wage flexibility, and addressing
mismatched skills. Rapid growth of the financial sector has hurt competitiveness by pushing
up wages throughout the economy without corresponding productivity gains (Box 2). This
has been amplified by automatic backward-looking wage indexation and increases in
minimum wages. The adverse impact of losses

indexation—including by excluding food and

view of eliminating indexation in the medium
term. In addition, there is a need to bolster the

demanded by the labor market. In this regard,
the system of direct transfers—geared at
lowering poverty and income inequality—should be revamped to limit its adverse work
incentives and support human capital formation and develop skills demanded by the labor
market.
28.
The authorities broadly agreed with the challenges facing Luxembourg and
recognized the need to further reform the economy. They were nonetheless guardedly
optimistic regarding Luxembourg financial center’s medium-term prospects given the
11

Recently, backward wage indexation has been shown to significantly increase wage rigidity (Lunnemann and
Wintr, 2010). Annex III provides empirical evidence of the adverse impact of wage rigidity on price
competitiveness in Luxembourg, particularly in manufacturing.

16
availability of highly-qualified professionals and supporting infrastructure. Indeed, the
authorities noted that the overall decline in bank balance sheets experienced so far had been
driven by about only 40 percent of the banks, with most banks experiencing increases. The
authorities recognized that automatic wage indexation has eroded competitiveness, but
stressed that competitiveness trends differed across sectors, with manufacturing suffering the
most. In this regard, they noted that wage increases will be reined in by the postponement in
wage indexation this year and by the agreement to try to avoid another wage indexation
tranche should it be triggered in less than 12 months. Also, the authorities viewed favorably
dropping fuel prices from the reference index and stressed their intention to revisit
employment support programs to assess their effectiveness and reduce adverse effects on
work incentives.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The challenge facing Luxembourg is to continue limiting financial sector
vulnerabilities while promoting sustainable growth and employment. The financial
sector has stabilized but the banking sector remains vulnerable to risks associated with large
intra-group exposures and sovereign bond holdings. The economy has begun its recovery but
growth will likely slow in 2011 and remain below its pre-crisis pace. Headline inflation will
continue to increase although increases in core inflation will likely remain moderate
reflecting delays in wage indexation and slack in the economy. The unemployment rate has
risen and stabilized despite gradual increases in employment growth and labor support
programs.
30.
For the financial sector, the challenge entails improving the financial stability
policy framework. The FSAP stressed that this will require further enhancing financial
sector supervision by increasing the operational independence of supervisors and
strengthening on-site supervision. Exposures to parent banks should also continue to be
closely monitored, and the authorities should take further actions to limit such exposures
when necessary. In addition, Luxembourg’s financial safety net should be strengthened by
facilitating an earlier control and restructuring of problem banks on a going-concern basis
and allowing the use of deposit insurance funds in bank resolution on least-cost principle.
Should there be further delays in the new EU directive on deposit guarantees, Luxembourg
would benefit from reforming its deposit guarantee system as envisaged in the draft law.
31.
A number of critical financial policy areas, however, fall beyond the purview of
the Luxembourg authorities. Even though the authorities have taken and should continue to
take appropriate actions, the presence of large foreign banking groups and sizable crossborder exposures challenge supervision and crisis resolution. The authorities are thus
encouraged to continue their active involvement in relevant supervisory colleges, which may
entail additional resources. Lacking ex-ante burden-sharing arrangements for the resolution
of cross-border banks and pending the completion of EU reforms, the authorities should also
continue to pursue pragmatic steps to facilitate international collaboration in this area.

17
32.
On the fiscal front, the challenge involves implementing sustainable
consolidation. With the recovery taking hold, the expenditure-based fiscal consolidation
focus of the 2011 budget is appropriate. While the budget’s investment cap can help to
prioritize projects in light of competing demands on the public purse in the short run, there
will be a need to replace the cap with current spending cuts to bolster growth prospects.
Regardless, should growth slow more than expected automatic stabilizers should be allowed
to operate up to the Maastricht limit. Care will be needed, nonetheless, to ensure that a purely
cyclical change in the deficit does not become structural because of policy decisions that lead
to an entrenchment of cyclical spending.
33.
In this regard, there is a pressing need to rationalize current spending. This will
require formulating specific measures to replace temporary measures, safeguard public
investment, and achieve the authorities’ medium-term fiscal target. The focus must center on
rationalizing social transfers and subsidies while curtailing other current spending, including
increases in the public sector wage bill. Expenditure prioritization can be supported by
establishing a full-fledged medium-term budgetary framework with binding multi-year
expenditure ceilings.
34.
In addition, reforming the old-age pension system is long overdue. Fiscal
consolidation cannot substitute for reforms given the magnitude of aging-related expenditure
increases. Parametric reforms are needed to gradually increase the effective and statutory
retirement ages to reflect life expectancy gains and align contributions and benefits. This will
require working longer to earn a full pension and, to address the inherited burden on the
system from existing retirees and entitlements, limiting pension indexation to no more than
cost of living adjustments. Also, the authorities are urged to expeditiously implement
recently approved health care reforms to ensure the system’s sustainability. Putting in place
reforms early will be desirable to facilitate phasing-in adjustments, and establishing periodic
automatic reviews of the social security’s financial viability can enable timely adjustments in
light of future economic and demographic developments.
35.
More broadly, sustainable growth and employment hinge on boosting
competitiveness and promoting labor market flexibility. Success in adapting to the
changing global financial environment will entail fostering a competitive and flexible
economy. Besides continued attention to infrastructure and education, it is important to
revamp the system of social transfers and subsidies in order to limit adverse work incentives,
address mismatched skills, and support human capital investment. Also, even though in the
medium term eliminating wage indexation remains necessary, the authorities are urged to
exclude food and fuel prices from the reference index. In the short term, there is a continuing
need to curb nominal wage increases to avoid eroding competitiveness.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Luxembourg be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Moreover, long run unemployment and
reclassified workers have increased, thus
highlighting the labor market’s structural
problems. Long-time unemployed workers suffer
an erosion of their skills that, coupled with a lack
of specific skills demanded by the labor markets,
make finding a job exceedingly difficult. In
addition, unemployment benefits have the
unintended consequence of providing
disincentives to work. While the external
reclassification scheme has been intended to
support disabled workers, its generosity could be
abused by unscrupulous individuals.

Jan-08

The unemployment rate has remained high
nonetheless despite various employment
support schemes. An increasing number of
workers have been covered by employment
support schemes. Partial unemployment
compensation has also helped contain
unemployment by doubling the length of time
allowed to work on temporary contracts to
12 months.

Growth of Employment by Sectors (YoY)
10

Mar-08

Employment growth has picked up gradually
but unevenly across sectors. Industrial workers
were most severely impacted during the crisis. As
economic growth has returned, employment
growth started gaining pace, mainly in the
construction, real estate and trade sectors. Still,
employments in industry and banking sectors have
remained weak in 2010. The crisis had also
significantly slowed employment growth of cross
border workers (Figure 2).

29
Annex II. The Authorities’ Supervisory Response to the Global Financial Crisis
The crisis highlighted the risks associated with cross-border intra-group exposures with parent banks
as well as flaws in governance and risk management practices of subsidiaries and related supervisory
shortcomings. In these areas, the authorities’ response included:


Enhancing liquidity monitoring by creating a macro-financial stability unit in the BCL and
revising the institutional framework for the supervision of liquidity risk, thereby entrusting
the BCL with a role in market liquidity monitoring and assessing liquidity management by
financial institutions. The BCL has implemented a system of daily, forward-looking liquidity
reporting, and developed a battery of quantitative tools to support on- and off-site assessment
of liquidity.



Adding liquidity risk management regulations on qualitative aspects by formalizing the
organizational structures dedicated to on-site supervision, and sharpening supervisory focus
on banks’ governance structures and risk management practices. These have been aimed at
strengthening the role and responsibilities of local bank managers. In line with the CEBS
guidelines, the CSSF introduced a more formal Supervisory Review Process, requiring banks
to introduce an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).



Stepping up supervisory scrutiny of bank leverage and sovereign risk exposures, and
focusing on institutions operating in domestic retail market. As a result, capital add-ons were
requested in a few banks and gradual reductions in sovereign exposures were encouraged.

30
Annex III: Understanding Luxembourg’s Competitiveness and Its Impact on Exports2
Luxembourg’s exports are characterized by the prevalence of service exports and, despite a
broadly stable overall world share, a secular decline in goods exports. This should not be
surprising as it mirrors the size of the financial center relative to the economy. But it does suggest
that understanding Luxembourg’s export performance will require discerning between two sets of
factors underlying exports.

Exports of Goods/GDP

Sources: IFS; and IMF staff calculation

Sources: IFS; and IMF staff calculation

The evidence underscores the differences between service and goods exports. Specifically, in the
long run


The elasticity of overall exports to world demand is roughly unitary but that of service
(goods) exports is about ½ (1½). In other words, all else equal, Luxembourg’s service exports
growth will tend to be outpaced by that of goods exports as the global economy recovers.
Likewise, when the global economy contracted, Luxembourg’s service exports were expected
to be exhibit more resilience than goods exports.



ULC-based real exchange rates are relevant indicators of competitiveness for both service and
goods exports, in particular the measure based on manufacturing costs. In addition, service
exports are sensitive to export unit cost based REER measures. In contrast, goods exports
seem to be affected by CPI and WPI-based REER.



The positive trend in overall exports mainly reflects a persistent increase of non-price
competitiveness in service exports. Moreover, this positive trend in service exports would be
consistent with financial innovation discussed in EUR’s 2007 REO.

Luxembourg’s export developments, particularly financial services may have reflected nonlinear effects during the crisis. The recovery of goods and service exports has benefited from the
pickup of global activities, with goods exports also gain from mild competitiveness improvement.
Nonetheless, service exports have been subject to volatile short term developments and potential
accelerator effects stemming from the global financial turmoil; these are not explained by standard
fundamental variables. Likewise, the strong recovery of service exports continues to reflect
Luxembourg’s favorable market power in exporting its financial services that is not fully captured by
fundamentals.

In addition, deteriorating price competitiveness has significantly hurt Luxembourg’s goods
exports while service exports have benefited from increasing non-price competitiveness. Exports
of manufacturing goods would have been significantly higher had wages grown in line with the euroarea average. Assuming the same productivity growth, the lower wage increases from 2001:Q1
to 2010:Q2 would have resulted in a real exchange rate appreciation about 10 percent less than that
observed. This would translate into about 7 percent higher than actual exports of goods. In contrast,
the simulated and actual exports of services differ only marginally. This confirms that non-price
competitiveness gain has masked the adverse effect real exchange rate appreciation (loss of price
competitiveness) has had on exports of manufacturing goods.

The empirical evidence discussed above stems from standard economic models designed to
tease out long- and short-run dynamics. Specifically, export equations have been estimated using
error correction models. In the long run, the specific models posit that export volume—measure
either as total, service, or goods exports—depends on world demand, a trend to capture financial
innovations, and a price competitiveness measure. The latter is proxied with five alternative
measures, namely, unit labor cost total economy, unit labor cost manufacturing, consumer price,
export unit value, and wholesale price based REERs. In the short run, the lag structures have been
determined using standard lag length tests (AIC and SIC criteria). Using data from the first quarter
of 1999 to the second quarter of 2010, estimation follows Engle and Granger’s two-step procedure.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Luxembourg’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies. Luxembourg has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4,
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision
No. 144 (52/51).
VIII.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently concluded that Luxembourg has largely
addressed the major shortcomings identified in its AML/CFT framework. In its
February 2010 mutual evaluation report on Luxembourg, the FATF identified numerous
shortcomings, judging that overall Luxembourg’s AML/CFT efforts were not proportional to
the risks associated with its role as a key international financial center. As a result,
Luxembourg was placed under enhanced scrutiny by the FATF’s International Cooperation
Review Group (ICRG). Since then, the authorities implemented a speedy remedial action
plan, including the adoption of AML/CFT legislation addressing deficiencies in financial and
nonfinancial sector areas, and increased supervisory actions in the financial sector. At its
latest plenary meeting, the FATF noted that authorities have responded rapidly and agreed to
remove Luxembourg from the ICRG process, although the effectiveness of these newly
implemented measures has not yet been ascertained. Luxembourg will continue to provide
updates on its progress as part of the regular FATF follow-up process for assessed members.

ANNEX II. LUXEMBOURG: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 5, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Central Service for Statistics and
Economic Studies (Statec) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data
and provides an advance release calendar for main statistical releases at:
http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/agenda/calendrier-diffusion/index.html.
On-line access to Statec’s databases and those of other jurisdictions is available to all users
simultaneously at the time of release through the Statistics Portal of Luxembourg.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
Statistics Portal of Luxembourg.................................http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/
Statec ..........................................................................http://www.statec.public.lu/fr/index.html
Central Bank of Luxembourg ....................................http://www.bcl.lu/en/index.php
Ministry of Finance ....................................................http://www.mf.public.lu/
National Accounts: Luxembourg avails itself of the SDDS special flexibility for the
timeliness of the national accounts, and generally disseminates national accounts data not
later than four months after the reference period (the SDDS timeliness requirement for the
national accounts is three months). Reduction of the reporting lag would aid surveillance.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May
12, 2006. Uses SDDS flexibility options on
the timeliness of national accounts and
analytical accounts of the central bank.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Luxembourg
On May 13, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Luxembourg.1
Background
Luxembourg’s economy has begun its recovery. Mirroring developments in other advanced
European countries, Luxembourg experienced stronger-than-expected growth in 2010. Besides
fiscal stimulus, economic activity was initially underpinned by investment and restocking. But
exports have increased markedly since the second quarter of 2010, notably financial services
and metal products. Private consumption has also begun to gradually recover despite moderate
increases in consumer lending spreads. Employment growth has been gaining pace but,
despite enhanced employment support programs, the unemployment rate has not eased. Weak
wage growth has tempered core inflation even though headline inflation has been boosted by
global commodity price developments and administered price increases.
The financial sector has stabilized. The investment fund industry has experienced a fast
recovery with total assets surpassing their pre-crisis peak, reflecting strong investor demand as
well as market valuation gains. In the banking sector, there were no further failures after the
peak of the crisis and restructuring has continued, including in the context of EU-approved
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

reorganization plans. Overall bank capitalization has increased and appears broadly adequate,
but remains uneven across banks. Aggregate bank balance sheets have continued to shrink
through early 2011. While interest margins have declined, bank profits have increased due to
commission and fee income and lower provisioning needs.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) identified the main financial risks as liquidity
and credit risks related to intra-group exposures and sovereign bond holdings. Luxembourgbased banks generate structural excess liquidity from their operations, which is channeled to
parent banks abroad. These intra-group activities, given their size and concentration, entail
liquidity and solvency risks for Luxembourg-based banks. In addition, some institutions maintain
large direct exposures to sovereign risk from the EU periphery. Stress tests suggest that in a
scenario of protracted slow growth in core Europe and renewed deterioration in market
perceptions of sovereign risk, banks would also face indirect risks originating from exposures of
their parent banking groups, particularly those incorporated in the distressed countries.
Growth is projected to slow from about 3½ percent in 2010 to about 3¼ percent in 2011 in line
with prospects in core Europe. Inflation is projected to increase in 2011 reflecting global food
and fuel price developments. But price pressures will likely remain subdued given slack in the
economy and delays in automatic wage indexation increases.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued strengthening of Luxembourg’s recovery and the
authorities’ supportive fiscal policy in 2010 as well as their role in stabilizing the financial
sector. Looking ahead, Directors concurred that the key challenges are to address remaining
financial sector vulnerabilities, maintain a sustainable fiscal position, and bolster
competitiveness and employment creation.
Directors welcomed the FSAP update, and commended the authorities’ intention to strengthen
the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, in particular given the financial sector’s exposure to
liquidity and credit risks stemming from large intra-group exposures and sovereign bond
holdings. Directors noted the plans to strengthen the powers of the supervisory authority
(CSSF). They stressed the need to increase its operational independence, as well as to clarify
the roles of Central Bank of Luxembourg and the CSSF regarding liquidity risk supervision.
Directors highlighted the importance of strengthening the financial safety net to facilitate
restructuring of problem banks on a going-concern basis, and to revamp the deposit guarantee
scheme.
Directors recognized that, given the prevalence of foreign subsidiaries in Luxembourg, a
number of key financial policy areas hinge on EU-level decisions. They encouraged the
authorities to remain actively involved in relevant supervisory colleges. In the absence of ex-

3
ante burden-sharing arrangements for the resolution of cross border banks, Directors stressed
the importance of seeking pragmatic solutions to facilitate cross border bank resolution,
including through effective coordination between home and host authorities. They welcomed the
authorities’ swift progress in improving their AML/CFT framework.
Directors supported the authorities’ decision to begin fiscal consolidation in 2011 and target a
balanced budget by 2014. They considered that consolidation should focus primarily on the
expenditure side, and advised the authorities to replace the public investment cap with current
spending cuts to protect growth prospects. Directors highlighted that a medium-term fiscal
framework could support consolidation by facilitating expenditure review. Given the magnitude
of aging-related costs, they stressed the importance of pension and health care reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ proposal to increase the effective retirement age, and
encouraged them to expeditiously implement recent health care reforms.
Directors noted that Luxembourg’s growth prospects would hinge on continued efforts to
promote competitiveness. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to revise the
backward-looking wage indexation mechanism and revisit employment support programs to
limit adverse work incentives. Continued investment in skills development will also be needed.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Luxembourg,
and Dirk Mevis, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 13, 2011
We would like to thank staff for the fruitful and constructive dialogue during the 2011
Article IV mission and the Financial Sector Assessment Program Update (FSAP). The
Luxembourg authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis.
The real economy has strengthened in 2010 and the outlook is mildly positive.
In the last quarter of 2010, the Luxembourg economy grew by 1.7 percent on a quarterly
basis. For 2010 as a whole, growth reached 3.5 percent reflecting mostly a bounce back in
growth from the crisis. The increases were strongest in those sectors that lost the most during
the crisis e.g. manufacturing. Transportation and trade have also gained strongly. External
demand from Europe and household consumption are driving the recovery. In this context,
manufacturing has benefitted from partial unemployment schemes that were extended by the
government in 2009 and which helped the industry to maintain the workforce and respond
quickly to a resurgence of external demand. For 2011, the statistical office predicts growth
just above 3 percent. Employment is picking up, with employment growth of 1.6 percent in
2010 and a slight decline in the unemployment rate in the first three months of 2011.
Fiscal policy will be an important challenge going forward.
In the context of an unexpectedly strong growth rebound in 2010, the fiscal deficit reached
1.7 percent of GDP, far lower than the expected 3.9 percent of GDP. For 2011, the
authorities plan to exit from countercyclical fiscal policy and a deficit of 1.2 percent is
foreseen. The budget includes a consolidation package amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP
(1.1 percent expenditure, 0.4 percent revenues). It will yield savings of 1.4 percent of GDP in
2012.
Our authorities are skeptical of the staff’s suggestion to let the automatic stabilizers operate
fully up to the Maastricht limit. In their view the fiscal multiplier in Luxembourg is rather
low. Moreover, the authorities are well aware of the political difficulty of rolling back fiscal
deficits.
The medium term fiscal objectives include a balanced budget for 2014. In the medium term,
a structural surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP should partially pre-fund the anticipated large
ageing-related increase in public expenditures. Furthermore, the authorities intend to reform
the budgetary framework. First steps of this reform will be introduced before 2014.

2
Social Security systems need to be prepared for demographic ageing.
In December 2010, parliament approved a health care reform which is intended mainly to
reduce costs and improve efficiency in the Luxembourg health care system. The reform
includes increases in contributions by 0.1 percentage points and the creation of a general
spending envelope for hospitals. The authorities are committed to implement this reform
immediately. In March 2011, the government has approved the principles of a parametric
pension reform and launched a process of consultation of the social partners. The main
proposed features include incentives to increase career duration. A reform of long-term care
insurance is planned for 2012. The authorities are acutely aware of the challenges that
demographic ageing is posing and stand ready to implement further reforms to ensure fiscal
sustainability.
Other structural reform needs are being considered as well.
The automatic wage indexation remains a much debated subject in Luxembourg. A number
of proposals, e.g. excluding certain components from the indexation basket or capping the
level of income to be indexed, are being discussed by the social partners.
The banking sector is recovering in a heterogeneous manner.
The banking sector in Luxembourg is still adapting to a post-crisis context. While profits rose
in 2010, this is almost exclusively due to lower provisioning needs. Revenues on interest rate
margins declined in the current low interest rate environment. Balance sheets continue to
shrink, mostly as a consequence of reductions in portfolio asset values, reductions in
interbank exposures and a decrease in holdings of certain types of assets (e.g., sovereign
debt).
From a more structural perspective, while some banks with certain profiles are retreating
from the Luxembourg financial center – mostly as a result of restructuring measures imposed
by the European Commission on rescued banking groups – large banking groups have taken
decisions in favor of the Luxembourg location with its vast experience as a hub for backoffice and custodian services to the group. Private banking is also undergoing a
transformation, becoming more service oriented and catering increasingly to a more
sophisticated clientele.

3
Banks have stabilized.
Solvency, Tier 1 capital and liquidity indicators are traditionally high in Luxembourg,
although the picture varies at the micro level. Only 6 percent of banks have a solvency ratio
between 8 and 10 percent in 2010 whereas on the other extreme 68 percent of banks have a
solvency ratio above 15 percent. The average Tier 1 capital ratio has been 15.3 percent in
2010 and almost 85% of total own funds are core Tier 1 funds. Sovereign exposures to
peripheral European countries amount to less than Euro 20 billion and have decreased
continuously over the past year – including at the request of the supervisor. Stress tests
performed by Fund staff and staff of the Supervisor (CSSF) during the FSAP mission
confirm the relative resilience of Luxembourg banks to sovereign stress but also the absence
of contagion effects in the Luxembourg banking sector from shocks affecting solvency and
liquidity elsewhere.
Macro-stress tests carried out by the Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) demonstrate
that, despite differences at the individual bank level, Luxembourg banks are sufficiently
capitalized. They show that under the severe scenario of a prolonged recession, the
Luxembourg banking sector remains robust. The BCL’s liquidity stress tests show that the
Luxembourg financial sector remains robust not only in the face of peripheral European
sovereign stress, but also to a contemporaneous interbank shock.
The local retail market has remained stable throughout the crisis. While private real estate
prices have been high and increased strongly before the crisis, they have remained fairly
stable – with slight declines in certain segments – since 2009. Nonetheless, the CSSF is
monitoring the situation closely and has intervened to make sure the banks apply sound and
prudent lending criteria.
The Investment Fund industry is very dynamic and balance sheets are recovering.
The investment fund industry has largely recovered. In March 2011 the net asset value
(NAV) of the industry as a whole amounted to Euro 2.2 trillion. This is a result of both
revaluation of assets held and new inflows. The number of investment funds has increased by
204 units between end 2009 and end 2010 (from 3463 to 3667). Anecdotal evidence also
suggests that funds that used to be offshore before the crisis are now seeking the safety of a
regulated product like the UCITS brand and redomicile in Luxembourg. Overall, it seems
that the Luxembourg fund industry is exiting the crisis in a relatively unscathed manner –
both from a financial stability point of view and with regard to its reputation as a well
regulated product.

4
Regulatory challenges are being addressed rapidly.
The authorities have quickly addressed issues of concern raised by the FATF review in
February 2010 and the corresponding legislation has passed parliament in November 2010.
Also, some of the recommendations from the 2010 FSAP regarding the governance of the
CSSF have already been addressed and the corresponding legislation has been adopted or has
been introduced into the legislative process.
Draft legislation on a new deposit insurance mechanism is awaiting the finalization of
discussions at the European level, before being submitted to parliament. In this context, the
BCL has proposed a Financial Stability Fund combining a deposit insurance mechanism and
a bank resolution fund. In March 2011, the government decided to increase the capital of the
BCL, including for IMF purposes. In an effort to strengthen financial stability further, the
BCL and CSSF continue recruiting highly qualified staff.
At the international level both the CSSF and the BCL are engaged in exchange, discussion
and analytical work in the new European supervisory infrastructure EBA and ESRB. In
addition, exchange of supervisory information and home-host coordination takes place at the
level of Supervisory Colleges and Cross Border Stability Groups for all important banking
groups with cross border activities.
