STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is projected to continue growing above potential in 2011, at a time
when overheating pressures have already emerged. Supportive macroeconomic conditions
will contribute to inflation of close to 10 percent this year and a widening external current
account deficit. While the banking system remains sound, risks are increasing, mainly as a
result of very rapid credit growth (40 percent), particularly credit in foreign currency
(58 percent). Economic policies need to be geared toward reducing overheating pressures
and protecting financial sector stability.
Monetary policy. Given current stimulative monetary conditions, tightening needs to
continue. The menu of options should include higher reserves requirements, especially to
address the very rapid expansion of credit in foreign currency. Continued exchange rate
flexibility would also help reduce inflationary pressures.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is adding stimulus to activity and should become at least
neutral. It is important to contain current expenditure growth and save any revenue
overperformance. Pressures to further loosen fiscal policy ahead of the 2013 elections also
need to be resisted.
Macro-prudential and financial sector policies. Macro-prudential measures would help
address financial sector risks while contributing to reducing credit growth. Higher specific
provisions and stricter limits on loan-to-income ratios would help deal with very high
consumer credit growth and currency mismatches. It is also important to continue moving
forward with efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision of cooperatives, and address
legal constraints that limit a more effective risk-based supervision for banks.
Monetary policy framework. The recapitalization of the central bank (BCP) is crucial to
increase monetary policy’s room for maneuver. The recent decision to adopt inflation
targeting calls for increased efforts to clarify the BCP’s operational framework, including by
limiting FX intervention and thus sending a clearer signal that inflation is its main objective.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

PARAGUAY

I. BACKGROUND
1.

Paraguay weathered the global

economic crisis well, supported by an
appropriate policy response. The authorities
responded to the crisis through
countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies
while bolstering financial sector supervision.
Output contracted by 3¾ percent in 2009,
though this reflected mainly the effects of a
severe drought that hit the agricultural sector.
The country’s relatively low public debt ratio
was broadly unchanged, as the fiscal accounts
still recorded a small surplus; the external
adjustment was smooth, aided by a flexible
exchange rate regime; and the financial
system remained sound, with adequate
capital levels and low non-performing loans.
2.

Economic growth rebounded

strongly in 2010, and the economy has
started showing signs of overheating
(Figure 1). Real GDP grew by 15 percent,
driven by a record crop, strong monetary
stimulus and credit growth, and a favorable
external environment. The non-agricultural
sector expanded by 8½ percent, while
domestic demand grew by 17 percent. The
output gap for the nonagricultural sector is
estimated to have closed in mid-2010 and
stood at 1¾ percent at end-year. Inflation
has picked up from 2 percent in 2009 to
8¾ percent in June 2011, reflecting strong
domestic demand growth and rising
commodity prices. Core inflation as measured
by the authorities (i.e., excluding the most

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

volatile food items) has experienced a similar
increase and stood at 9½ percent in June.
3.

Despite very favorable terms of

trade, the external current account
weakened in 2010, driven mainly by rapid
domestic demand growth (Figure 2). The
current account deficit rose to 2¾ percent of
GDP (from near balance in 2009), reflecting
very rapid import growth and a drop in
remittances. However, with strong private
capital inflows (notably foreign direct
investment, FDI), the Central Bank (BCP)
continued accumulating international
reserves, which rose to US$4.2 billion
(23 percent of GDP) at end-2010. The real
effective exchange rate appreciated slightly
during the year, driven by the strengthening
of the guarani against the U.S. dollar.
4.

Against the backdrop of rising

inflation and rapid credit growth, the BCP
started to tighten monetary policy in mid2010 (Figure 3). The central bank has raised
policy interest rates by 775 basis points since
mid-2010 (375 basis points this year), starting
from a level close to zero. Real policy rates,
however, have remained in negative territory,
and given weaknesses in the monetary
transmission channel, deposit and lending
rates have increased only modestly in real
terms. In this context, credit growth has
remained very high (40 percent y/y in May),
especially credit in foreign currency
(58 percent). The latter reflects its relatively

Box 1. Measuring the Fiscal Stance in Paraguay

impulse, defined as the change in a cyclically-adjusted balance, is commonly used to assess the impact of
fiscal policy on domestic demand. Several alternative measures of adjusted balances can be used for

Paraguay: (i) the structural primary balance (SPB), which adjusts revenues by the output gap; (ii) the SPB
excluding electricity royalties and foreign grants; and (iii) the SPB corrected for the cyclical deviations of
domestic absorption from its trend. These structural balances can be used as complementary measures of
the fiscal stance. An additional indicator is given by comparing growth of real primary spending with
potential output growth.
The SPB excluding electricity royalties and grants could provide an appropriate measure of the fiscal
stance for Paraguay. It is

superior normalization option, and the output gap for the non-agricultural economy is more appropriate
to correct for the cycle. Estimates based on this measure show that in 2010 fiscal policy withdrew stimulus
by 1½ percentage points of non-agricultural GDP. This measure points to a positive stimulus of 1¼ and
1 percent of non-agricultural GDP for 2011 and 2012, respectively.
The SPB could also be corrected for temporary deviations of domestic absorption from its trend.2 This
is particularly relevant for the current cycle in Paraguay, given the strong domestic demand growth,
including from imports, which provide a significant share of tax revenue. This measure shows similar results
to the previous one, except for 2010, where the withdrawal of stimulus is now significantly lower, reflecting
the large expansion of imports that took place that year.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Paraguay: Use of Macro-prudential Tools
Macro-prudential (MaP) policy instruments have been widely used across emerging
markets in recent years. They should be used to address financial stability concerns and can,
under certain conditions, complement traditional macroeconomic policies. International
experience has shown that periods of high favorable terms of trade and strong capital inflows
can mask underlying macroeconomic imbalances and financial sector vulnerabilities. Current
account deficits and exchange rate volatility can exacerbate these vulnerabilities if capital
inflows suddenly reverse or the terms of trade decline, potentially causing boom-bust cycles.
With credit expanding at 42 percent, substantial capital inflows, and favorable terms of
trade, MaP policies could be used be used in Paraguay to help deal with risks to
macroeconomic and financial stability. Combined with further monetary tightening, a less
stimulative fiscal stance, and continued exchange rate flexibility, MaP measures could help lower
financial stability risks and bolster financial sector cushions. They would also contribute to
achieving a faster deceleration of credit growth and reducing overheating pressures. MaP
measures could play a particularly important role in complementing monetary policy in
Paraguay, given a weak monetary transmission channel, with a slow and limited pass-through
from policy rates to market rates. Furthermore, they could contribute to limiting incentives to
carry-trade oriented capital inflows that can further complicate macroeconomic management.
Paraguay has made some use of MaP measures in recent times. Measures already in place
include reserve requirements (RR) on bank deposit liabilities, with different rates being applied
to deposits in local and foreign currencies. In April, these were raised to pre-crisis levels from
15 to 18 percent for domestic-currency deposits and from 21 percent to 25 percent for foreigncurrency deposits. The BCP has also set limits on banks’ net open foreign exchange positions,
which were tightened in August 2010. From January 2012, the central bank is also raising
general provisions and minimum capital, as well as tightening the definition of overdue loans.
However, there is scope for greater use of MaP instruments. An expanded toolkit could
include: (i) tighter loan-to-value and debt service-to-income ratios to make access to credit for
durable goods and housing more stringent; (ii) RR on external credit lines to banks; (iii) higher
RR on foreign-currency deposits, given the very high growth in credit in US dollars; (iv) higher
capital requirements and increased provisions to lower the pace of consumer credit growth and
currency mismatches; and (v) introduction of dynamic provisioning. Currently, RR on local
currency deposits are applied to sight deposits only, and are broadly in line with regional levels
(see chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper). Nevertheless, with credit in guaranies still
expanding at close to 30 percent, there is a case for raising them further. Unlike other countries
in the region, term deposits in local currency are exempt from RR. While they constitute a
relatively small share of total deposits (around 30 percent), there is also a case for subjecting
them to RR.

Box 3. Paraguay: Recapitalization of the Central Bank
International experience suggests that financially weak central banks suffer from higher inflation rates. Concerns
about the impact of interest rate decisions on central bank balance sheets undermine central bank credibility and
effectiveness and increase the costs of inflation stabilization in terms of output losses.1 A credible path toward central bank
recapitalization is needed to stabilize inflation expectations and to support the implementation of an effective monetary
policy strategy.
The monetary policy operations of the BCP have been severely hampered by its negative capital position. The BCP’s
negative capital is a legacy of the past, reflecting non-performing claims related to loans to the public and to the financial
sector that were largely incurred before the BCP’s 1995 charter prohibited such practices. Carrying costs on NIR (the interest
differential between BCP sterilization papers and NIR yields) have also contributed to BCP losses, though to a lesser degree.
As a consequence, monetary policy steps have at times lagged the underlying economic cycle.
Differences in the speed of economic recovery with respect to advanced economies pose particular challenges for the
BCP, as diverging policy rates exacerbate pressures on its balance sheet. In line with regional trends and responding to
inflationary pressures, the BCP has appropriately embarked on a monetary tightening cycle, raising policy rates on its
sterilization instruments (LRM) from close to zero to between 8.0 and 9.0 percent during the past 12 months. Given that
interest rates of reserve currencies remain subdued, the BCP’s carrying costs on NIR and non-yielding domestic assets are
projected to rise substantially during 2011 and possibly beyond. Resolving the pending balance-sheet issues of the BCP is
vital for sustaining monetary policy credibility and increasing its effectiveness.

A BCP recapitalization law was approved in April 2010, and the Ministry of Finance and the BCP are working on its
implementation. The law authorizes the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to issue and transfer to the BCP securities in the amount
of up to 6.25 percent of 2009 GDP (4,419 billion guaranies, equivalent to about US$1 billion). In return, the BCP’s nonperforming claims against public entities will be extinguished, and any remaining legal claims on guaranties by third parties
to the BCP will be conveyed to the MoF. Interest rates and maturities on the bonds to be transferred will be defined between
BCP and MoF. Both institutions are currently working on defining the financial conditions of the transfer.
Besides the need for prompt and effective implementation of the law, to guarantee the success of the operation the
recapitalization bonds should possess certain properties:



The securities should be marketable and defined in line with the terms of existing treasury securities that are traded in
the market, with a maximum maturity of five years. This is necessary so the BCP can use these securities as collateral for
reverse repo operations within the financial system.



Willingness to roll-over expiring securities should be guaranteed by the BCP. Rollover dates should be set according to
discrete time intervals, to avoid bunching of the rollover at one particular date.



The transfer could be phased in according to a strict and credible time schedule, to facilitate the inclusion of interest
payments on the securities in the central government budget.

from the CGER’s equilibrium exchange rate approach, and suggest a small overvaluation as of

Paraguay experienced during 2004-08 reflected mainly a stronger net international position and
positive productivity developments. The subsequent decline in the equilibrium rate in the context
of the global crisis seems to be associated with a weakening of the terms of trade and a negative
shock to productivity .

Paraguay: Real Sector Developments

After contracting in 2009, the economy rebounded strongly in 2010, growing at 15 percent. The recovery was driven by a
record harvest, an improved external environment, and continued monetary stimulus. Excess demand pressures and rising
commodity prices have led to a significant increase in inflation.
The economy recovered swiftly in 2010 after the 2009
recession.

Paraguay: Balance of Payments Developments

Driven by rapid domestic demand growth, imports recovered strongly in 2010, offsetting a large export rebound and leading
to a weakening of the current account. However, high private capital inflows allowed the central bank to continue
accumulating reserves.
The current account deficit widened in 2010….

Monetary Developments

The authorities started withdrawing the monetary stimulus provided during the global crisis very slowly, which led to
monetary policy turning procyclical in 2010. Credit growth accelerated sharply, contributing to excess demand pressures and
a large increase in inflation, which is now well outside the BCP's target range.

remains relatively high.

Fiscal policy exhibited a countercyclical tone in 2010. Growth of real primary spending declined sharply, while revenue
growth accelerated, driven by a buoyant domestic demand and improvements in tax administration. With the fiscal
accounts in surplus, public debt continued its declining trend.

denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.

37

4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of

Paraguay (BCP) was subject to a full safeguard assessment in respect to the arrangement approved
on May 31, 2006. A safeguards assessment of the BCP was completed in October 2006. The report
stated that while the BCP has made some progress in strengthening the safeguards framework since
the 2003 safeguards assessment, vulnerabilities remain in certain areas such as financial reporting
and program data reporting to the Fund.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Paraguay
On July 29, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Paraguay, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without
a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis2.
Background
Paraguay weathered the global crisis well, supported by an appropriate policy response.
Countercyclical macroeconomic policy cushioned the effects of lower external demand. While
GDP still contracted in 2009, this owed mainly to a severe drought. Growth rebounded strongly
in 2010, with real GDP expanding at 15 percent, driven by a record crop, high credit growth, and
favorable external conditions.
Reflecting the using up of slack capacity, overheating pressures have emerged. Inflation rose
from 2 percent in 2009 to 8¾ percent in June 2011, driven by excess demand pressures and
higher commodity prices. Despite very favorable terms of trade, the external current account
weakened to 2¾ percent of GDP in 2010 (from near balance in 2009), reflecting very rapid
import growth and a drop in remittances. With strong private capital inflows (notably foreign
direct investment), however, the Central Bank (BCP) continued accumulating international
reserves, which rose to US$4.2 billion (23 percent of GDP) at end-2010.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that
a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
Against a backdrop of rising inflation and rapid credit growth, the BCP started tightening
monetary policy in mid-2010, raising interest rates by 775 basis points over the last twelve
months (375 basis points in 2011), starting from a level close to zero. Real policy rates,
however, remain negative, while deposit and lending rates have increased only modestly in real
terms. Credit growth has remained very high (40 percent y/y in May), especially credit in foreign
currency (58 percent). The BCP also raised reserve requirements (RR) effective in May,
bringing them back to their pre-crisis levels.
The BCP has allowed the guarani to appreciate substantially in recent months, while intervening
in the foreign exchange (FX) market. As of end-May, the guarani had risen by over 10 percent
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (13 percent in real effective terms) compared to end-2010. The
appreciation reflects mainly improved terms of trade, higher private capital inflows, and
seasonal liquidation of export proceeds. The BCP stepped up its purchases of FX in April, trying
to contain appreciation pressures, but as the guarani stabilized, it reduced its intervention in
May and did not intervene in June.
Fiscal policy remained countercyclical in 2010, while public debt continued on a declining path.
Real growth of primary spending decelerated significantly, while tax revenue increased sharply
reflecting strong activity and import growth, and improvements in administration. In cyclicallyadjusted terms, the primary balance (excluding electricity royalties and grants) strengthened by
1½ percent of non-agricultural GDP, implying withdrawal of most of the stimulus provided in
2009. Public debt declined by over 4 percentage points to 19 percent of GDP.
The banking sector remains generally sound. The overall capital adequacy ratio for banks
remains above the regulatory level, although it is somewhat lower (by about 3 percentage
points) when Basel I definitions are used. The nonperforming loan (NLP) ratio is low (1½
percent in May) and declined slightly over the last year, but the level of NPLs is growing fast (17
percent y/y in May) and provisions are low. Profitability has remained very high. In late 2010,
the Superintendency approved measures to strengthen financial system buffers, including
higher generic provisions and minimum capital, which will become effective in January 2012.
In 2011, real GDP growth is projected at 6¾ percent, reflecting solid agricultural growth,
stimulative macroeconomic conditions, and strong confidence. Inflation is projected to remain
well above the BCP’s target range, at close to 10 percent for year-end. The external current
account deficit would widen to 3¾ percent of GDP, led by strong import growth, a less favorable
services account, and lower remittances. The overall fiscal balance is projected to swing into a
deficit of ½ percent of GDP, implying a fiscal impulse of 1¼ percent of non-agricultural GDP.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Paraguay, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
An appropriate policy response helped Paraguay weather the global crisis. Countercyclical
macroeconomic policy cushioned the effects of lower external demand. While GDP still
contracted in 2009, this owed mainly to a severe drought and the nonagricultural sector still
experience modest growth. Despite significant stimulus, public debt remained broadly
unchanged, given the strong initial position of the fiscal accounts, while a flexible exchange rate
regime helped a smooth external adjustment. The financial system was unscathed, with
adequate capitalization and low NPLs.
The strong rebound of economic growth in 2010 has given rise to overheating pressures. GDP
grew by 15 percent in 2010, reflecting a record harvest, strong credit growth, and favorable
external conditions. Driven by excess demand pressures and higher commodity prices, inflation
has risen sharply over the last year, while the external current account has deteriorated
substantially, despite term-of-trade improvements. Fiscal policy was appropriately
countercyclical in 2010, withdrawing most of the stimulus provided in 2009. Monetary policy
remained accommodative, however, with real policy rates well in negative territory and
abundant liquidity.
Macroeconomic policies are currently expansionary. Despite a large increase since mid-2010,
real policy rates remain negative, while real deposit and lending rates have increased only
modestly and credit growth is still very high. Reflecting strong expenditure growth, fiscal policy
is being expansionary, with the structural primary balance projected to weaken by 1¼ percent of
nonagricultural GDP in 2011. There is also the risk that the fiscal stance remains loose in 2012
as pressures to increase spending rise ahead of the 2013 general elections.
Policies need to adjust further to ensure a soft landing of the economy. Policies should be
geared toward moderating domestic demand pressures and returning to a more balanced
growth path, in order to reduce inflation, contain the external current account deficit, and
preserve financial stability. Monetary policy tightening should continue without delay, with the
menu of options including further increases in RR, particularly on foreign currency deposits. The
fiscal stance should become at least neutral, but preferably countercyclical. To this end,
constraining current expenditures and saving any revenue over-performance, including from the
potential approval of revenue measures currently in congress, will be critical. It would also be
important to avoid loosening the fiscal stance in 2012, given a positive output gap and an
inflation rate above the BCP’s target. Broadening the use of macro-prudential policies (MaP)
measures would help protect financial stability going forward while contributing to a faster
reduction of credit growth.

4
The banking system remains sound, but there is a need to guard it against emerging risks. Bank
financial soundness indictors are generally strong, including very high profitability. However,
provisions are low overall and the level of NPLs is growing rapidly. Very high credit growth,
particularly in foreign currency, and currency mismatches pose considerable risks that should
be dealt with immediately. Macro-prudential measures, such as higher specific provisions and
stricter limits on debt-to-income ratios, would help contain such risks and strengthen buffers.
Developments in construction and mortgage lending, as well as in real estate markets, warrant
close monitoring, including by improving the compilation of statistics. Staff welcomes the
existing program to strengthen regulation and supervision and to set up a financial safety net in
the cooperative sector. It encourages the authorities to also move forward with changes to
legislation required for a more effective risk-based supervision for banks.
The monetary policy framework should be strengthened further to support the move to an IT
regime. Many necessary components for this step are already in place, thanks to long-lasting
and continued reforms and institutional strengthening at the BCP. Swift implementation of the
recapitalization of the BCP and better liquidity management are also needed to further enhance
the credibility of the central bank and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. It would
also be important for the BCP to strengthen and clarify its operational framework, including by
limiting (and sterilizing) interventions in the FX market and thus sending a clearer signal that
inflation is its main objective.
Higher tax revenues are needed to address important deficiencies in infrastructure and basic
social services. Staff supports government efforts to implement the personal income tax without
further delay and continue improving tax administration. It will also be essential to ensure sound
management of increased revenues from Itaipú energy sales. Staff supports the authorities’
proposal to safeguard the additional revenues by placing them in a special fund, and suggests
allocating a significant part of these revenues to build up a countercyclical reserve.
There is scope to strengthen the fiscal framework. Plans to expand the role of public-private
partnerships (PPPs) in the provision of infrastructure services are welcome. It would be
important to strengthen the legal framework governing concessions and develop a more
comprehensive PPP framework, while increasing the MoF’s role in assessing and approving
PPPs to achieve value for money and manage fiscal risks. There is also room to strengthen the
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), including by integrating it to the budget, adopting a
systematic reporting and assessment of fiscal risks, and setting up a medium-term expenditure
framework. A fiscal rule targeting the structural primary balance (excluding revenue from
electricity royalties and grants) could serve as an anchor for the MTFF and facilitate its
integration to the budget.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
