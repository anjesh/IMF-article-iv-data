STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth is moderating and credit growth has declined, but significant
vulnerabilities remain. International reserves are inadequate by several internationally
comparable metrics, the exchange rate remains overvalued, credit risks are rising, and
high public debt requires attention. The authorities place a high priority on strong
growth with macroeconomic stability. Policy corrections initiated over the past year were
broadly in line with Fund advice, but should be further strengthened.
Outlook and risks. A moderate further cooling down in economic activity is expected,
but the external position will remain fragile. Fiscal expansion, a sharp regional growth
slowdown, and deteriorating terms-of-trade and capital inflows are the key risks.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit has declined in 2014, but on current policies, is set to rise
going forward. Stronger revenue efforts and expenditure rationalization are necessary to
ensure continued consolidation. The tax base should be broadened and administration
improved, along with containing public wages, and rationalizing off-budget capital
spending and unproductive current spending.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. Greater exchange rate flexibility is necessary to
absorb external shocks and facilitate reserves buildup. Reducing excess liquidity will help
contain inflation, prevent excessive credit growth, and support interbank market
functioning.
Financial stability. Immediate foreign-currency liquidity risks have receded, but bank
balance sheets have weakened. Recognizing NPLs, phasing out regulatory forbearance,
strengthening sound lending practices and supervision, and recapitalizing state-owned
banks will support macro-financial stability.
Long-term growth. Much progress has been made in recent years on product and
labor market openness, and poverty reduction. Further trade integration will improve the
business climate, and promote private investment and institutional reform. Upgrading
health and education infrastructure will raise the growth potential and reduce inequality.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

CONTEXT
1.
The economy has been moving toward a “soft landing,” with the key priority now to
strengthen the external position and preserve financial stability. GDP growth is moderating
from 8 percent in 2013, partly from fiscal tightening, and credit growth has abated from excessive
levels. Inflation has declined. Significant gains in poverty reduction over the past decade have been
preserved, though inequality has increased slightly (Box 1). However, external vulnerabilities remain
a concern. The current account continues to be in large deficit and international reserves remain
inadequate for precautionary needs. The economy is exposed to downside external shocks, notably
a regional growth slowdown and a deterioration in terms-of-trade and capital inflows. Following
years of rapid credit growth, bank balance sheets are showing signs of weakness, raising financial
stability concerns. Public and publicly guaranteed debt has risen to a level that requires attention.
2.
The authorities have placed a high priority on strong growth with macroeconomic
stability. The government recognized that fiscal policy was sharply expansionary and procyclical in
2013, and started to tighten in 2014. The medium-term GDP growth target has been lowered to
7½ percent per annum, from 8 percent. Additional fiscal consolidation efforts, greater exchange rate
flexibility, tighter monetary conditions, and prompt efforts to address banking sector vulnerabilities
would support the authorities’ agenda to entrench stability and put growth on a sustained, robust
path. Accelerating compliance with WTO and ASEAN commitments would promote trade
integration and private sector-led growth, especially in the nonresource sector.
3.
The change in policy direction was consistent with past Fund advice, but policies
should be further strengthened to reduce vulnerabilities. The authorities have made progress on
priorities outlined in the last Article IV consultation. Fiscal consolidation has commenced, mainly
through curbs on civil service compensation and capital spending cuts. Public investment cuts have
limited the BOL’s quasi-fiscal lending and lowered credit growth. Strict enforcement of regulation on
banks’ net open foreign exchange positions and the limits on foreign-currency lending has helped
reduce foreign-currency liquidity risk at banks. However, excess kip liquidity in the banking system
has risen; greater exchange rate flexibility, observed in the second half of 2013, has not resumed; the
authorities remain convinced that, measured against their preferred metric, international reserves
are more or less adequate; and policies to strengthen banking sector soundness could be
accelerated, particularly in light of worsening conditions at state-owned and some private banks.
IMF technical assistance (TA) has increased in the areas of revenue administration, monetary
operations, banking supervision, and government finance and external sector statistics.

MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
4.
Growth is moderating, though still high, and inflation has declined. Real GDP growth is
projected at about 7½ percent in 2014, supported by external demand and foreign direct
investment (FDI). With initial fiscal consolidation efforts underway, domestic activity has slowed, led
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by construction. Mining production continues to weaken, the result of a moratorium on new mines
and the decline in global metal prices. Imports data indicate that nondurable consumption and
investment growth continues to moderate. Inflation has fallen to 3 percent (October 2014) from
6½ percent at end-2013, largely from food and fuel prices (Figure 1).
5.
Fiscal policy tightened in 2014. The deficit declined to 4¼ percent of GDP in FY2014 from
5½ of GDP in FY2013, mainly from expenditure consolidation. Current spending (including arrears
payment of ½ percent of GDP) was close to budget, thanks to efforts to contain the wage bill.
Capital expenditure came in higher than planned, as the government paid down arrears by
1½ percent of GDP. Revenue collection rose by 15 percent (y/y), though tax revenues fell short of
budget by about 2½ percentage points of GDP on account of weak mining profit tax collection and
overly optimistic budgeted revenue. While still tight, the treasury’s liquidity position has improved,
with deposits covering 1½ months of current spending (Figure 2).
6.
While credit growth has declined, central bank balance sheet expansion continues to
be brisk. Cuts in public infrastructure projects have allowed credit growth to decline to 16 percent
(y/y), from 35 percent (y/y) at end-2013. However, a sharp expansion in the BOL’s net domestic
assets has contributed to rapid reserve money and deposit growth. As a result, banks’ excess
reserves have risen to 7 percent of GDP, from 5 percent of GDP at end-2013, pressuring profitability
and potentially leading to easier lending standards down the road (Figure 3).
7.
The external position remains highly vulnerable, and international reserves do not
offer adequate protection against external shocks (Box 2). The current account deficit is expected
to remain large at 25 percent of GDP in 2014, with improvement in the nonresource current account
balance, consequent of tighter fiscal policy and a pickup in export growth. Declining mining exports
contribute to a slight worsening of the resource current account from last year. While FDI and longterm loan inflows are robust, particularly for export-oriented resource projects, the portion of the
current account deficit financed by other, traditionally more volatile flows remains high at 7 percent
of GDP (Table 2). The BOL has been intervening to keep the USD/kip exchange rate stable at slightly
below the band’s mid-point, resulting in an appreciation of 3½ percent (y/y) in nominal effective
terms (Figure 4). The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 5 percent compared to a year ago,
and the CGER-type analysis and broader trends in the balance of payments suggest that the kip
remains overvalued by 10–20 percent relative to the level implied by medium-term fundamentals.
Gross international reserves are estimated at 1 month of prospective imports of goods and services
(US$0.7 billion, August 2014), a slight increase from 0.8 month of import cover during the last
Article IV. External debt, mostly long-term, rose to 84½ percent of GDP in nominal terms
(83½ percent of GDP in present value terms) from about 80 percent of GDP the previous year
(76 percent of GDP in present value terms). Even though the risk of external debt distress remains
moderate, it has increased compared to the last Article IV, verging on a transition to high risk (Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA)).

8.
The implementation of recent policy measures has reduced immediate foreigncurrency liquidity risks, but bank balance sheets have weakened in the past year (Financial
Stability Map and Table 6). Limits on foreign-currency lending, supply of foreign exchange by the
BOL and a leading state-owned bank, and robust foreign-currency deposit growth, have allowed
banks to rebuild U.S. dollar liquidity buffers from very low levels. The USD/kip bid-ask spread has
narrowed, and the previously sizable parallel foreign exchange premium has become negligible.
Nevertheless, measured credit risks have risen. Accumulation of public infrastructure arrears has led
to losses in the business sector, with knock-on effects on banks. The system’s nonperforming loan
ratio (NPL) is estimated to have doubled during the first half of 2014, cutting into bank profitability
and capital cushion. In the same period, state-owned banks’ average NPL is reported to have
increased from 2 percent to about 8 percent, with average capital-to-asset ratio (CAR) declining to
3 percent. Reflecting partial dollarization in the economy (almost exclusively US dollar and Thai
Baht), direct exposure to foreign currency through lending and deposits remain high, with the
foreign-currency shares in total lending and deposits standing at 48 percent, down from 50 percent
in 2013.

9.
A moderate further cooling down in economic activity is expected in the near term,
but external vulnerabilities will remain elevated. As growth continues to moderate, inflation is
projected to remain in the mid-single digits. The current account deficit is projected to improve
gradually to about 21 percent of GDP, but with lower capital inflows, reserves would rise only slightly
to 1¼ months of imports by end-2015. Over the medium term, growth is projected to be close to
the official target of 7½ percent in the baseline, supported by strong resource-related FDI, a gradual
pickup of investment inflows into nonresource sectors, and accommodative monetary and fiscal
policies. Long-term purchase agreements governing tariffs and volumes will help insulate power
export income from fluctuations in energy prices, and as large-scale power projects come on line,
lifting exports and moderating resource imports, the resource current account would turn into
moderate surplus. However, with the overall current account weighed down by the large deficit in
the nonresource sector and reserves projected at around 2 months of imports, the external position
would remain fragile and a significant risk to sustained growth. A more robust and sustainable
growth path would require medium-term fiscal consolidation, greater exchange rate flexibility, and
tighter domestic monetary conditions, in line with staff’s advice (Alternative scenario, Table 7).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

10.
Under the baseline, downside risks continue to dominate. A more expansionary fiscal
stance would worsen the external position. With a very thin international reserves cushion, shocks
that have been common in the past, such as terms-of-trade deterioration or a decline in capital
inflows, could force large movements in the exchange rate. Such sudden and large exchange rate
depreciation could lead to debt defaults, given high external debt, deteriorating net foreign asset
positions at banks, and sizable domestic foreign-currency lending. This could precipitate a loss of
confidence in the banking system, and trigger deposit flights. With an economic slowdown and
bank recapitalization needs, public debt sustainability would be undermined (see DSA). A protracted
growth slowdown in China, Thailand, and Vietnam would lower export growth, investment inflows,
grants and remittances, as well as fiscal revenues (Figure 5).

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment that the economy was adjusting in the right
direction. They broadly concurred with the near-term macroeconomic and financial sector outlook,
and are concerned about weaker mineral export prices and potential capital flow volatility triggered
by China’s slowdown and tighter financial conditions in the United States, respectively. Nevertheless,
the authorities considered international reserves to be adequate, based on their preferred metric, at
close to the target of 5 months of official merchandise imports associated with non-FDI activities—a
significantly lower amount than those used in the staff’s metric based on trading partners’ export
statistics (Tables 2 and 5). In addition, they pointed out that the nonbank private sector was already
highly dollarized, reducing the need for international reserves holding for precautionary reasons.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussion focused on continued fiscal consolidation, greater exchange rate flexibility, and tighter
domestic monetary conditions to entrench macroeconomic stability, build international reserves, and
address rising public debt; as well as measures to strengthen sound lending practices and crisis
prevention to safeguard macro-financial resiliency. If implemented, this policy package would result in
somewhat lower near-term growth than the baseline, but it would reduce near-term vulnerabilities
and support robust, medium-term growth.

A. Fiscal Policy
12.
Staff estimates that fiscal policy will ease slightly in FY2015 from weak mining revenue
and a strong uptick in nonwage current spending. The deficit is projected to rise to 4¾ percent
of GDP in FY2015 from 4¼ percent of GDP in FY2014, with the nonmining deficit largely unchanged
at 6¼ percent of GDP. Revenue is budgeted to grow by 20 percent over the previous year’s outturn,

by 7 percent compared to last year’s outturn to
accommodate career promotion and a small net new intake, and capital spending would rise by
8 percent. While these efforts are expected to produce 1¾ percentage points of GDP in fiscal
savings, a large budgeted increase in nonwage current spending would reduce fiscal savings by
1 percentage point of GDP, yielding a mildly contractionary expenditure stance.
13.
Unless revenue efforts are strengthened and expenditure rationalization intensifies,
consolidation efforts would weaken over the medium term. The identification of remaining
arrears is proceeding slowly, and plans to address them remain unclear. Staff’s baseline fiscal
projection assumes ½ percent of GDP in arrears payment in FY2015 and an additional 1½ percent of
GDP over the medium term. On current policies, the deficits are expected to deteriorate beyond
5 percent of GDP in the medium term, with the nonmining deficit averaging at 7 percent of GDP.
14.
Public and publicly guaranteed debt (excluding unidentified arrears) is projected at
60 percent of GDP in 2014 (52 percent of GDP in present value terms), requiring immediate
attention. Longer-term public debt dynamics have worsened compared to the previous year, raising
the risk of debt distress. Maintaining the current policy trajectory would increase public debt to
about 65 percent of GDP in the medium term, making it infeasible under reasonable medium-term
consolidation policies to achieve the authorities’ target of 40–45 percent of GDP by the mid-2020s

(Table 5 and DSA). Moreover, mobilization of new capital for state-owned banks could potentially
add to future public debt. Owing to significant reliance on external borrowing, public debt is also
sensitive to large, abrupt exchange rate movements.

16.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation should be based on stronger revenue efforts and
expenditure rationalization. A strategy anchored around a nonmining deficit target of no more
than 5 percent of GDP would reduce near-term external vulnerabilities and lower public debt in the
medium-term. On top of efforts to contain the public wage bill, more emphasis will be needed on
revenue mobilization, controlling off-budget capital spending, and rationalizing non-essential
current spending. To enhance fiscal credibility, the government should explain deviations from
budget targets in the mid-term budget review to the National Assembly and outline corrective steps
to get back on track.
17.
Tax-base broadening and administration improvement have the potential to yield
substantial additional revenues (Box 3). Proposed revenue measures include: (i) broadening the
tax base by eliminating exemptions (mainly in CIT and VAT), flattening the PIT rate schedule; and
introducing taxes on property value; and (ii) strengthening administration, notably by establishing a
large taxpayer unit and increasing technical capacity to raise mining revenues, and raising the
threshold at which VAT registration becomes compulsory. To help support medium-term revenue
mobilization, it would be useful to undertake a comprehensive review of the tax system.
Strengthening control over spending and cash resources (treasury single account (TSA)), revenue
forecasts, and recording and processing of arrears would improve public sector financial
management. A TSA would also facilitate BOL’s liquidity management. These priority areas could be
further developed in close cooperation with the IMF.
18.
Expenditure strategy should focus on three elements: (i) containing the public wage bill
in a sustainable way, including by accelerating civil-service reform; (ii) curtailing non-essential
current spending; (iii) controlling off-budget capital spending and targeting capital expenditure to
support the growth potential, in line with implementation capacity. The potential savings would

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

provide scope for raising the shares of health and education spending in the budget, paying down
arrears, and addressing possible contingent liabilities from state-owned bank recapitalization.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities agreed with staff’s fiscal assessment and recommendations, though
successful implementation would require time to upgrade technology and staff capacity.
More revenue efforts will be required to ensure continued consolidation, which is central to
restoring macroeconomic stability. The government is undertaking investment to upgrade
technology and staff capacity to strengthen tax administration. Significantly larger yields are
expected from a focus on large taxpayers and taxes on vehicles, petrol, and luxury goods, as
collection will be based on transaction prices instead of outdated reference prices. More use of
electronic declaration and payments at customs check points, intensified efforts to counter
smuggling, and electronic tax payments to enhance compliance are underway. Expenditure would
be set based on more conservative revenue projections. The public sector wage bill would be
contained through limits on new intake, and capital spending and off-budget expenditure
rationalization remains a priority. A high-level committee has been established to quantify and
resolve arrears and debts related to public infrastructure projects, and resolution could take several
years. The National Assembly would welcome further fiscal transparency, and the authorities would
welcome consultation with the Fund on expenditure rationalization experience in other countries.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
20.
The commitment to keep the exchange rate within a reasonably wide and adjustable
band has provided an anchor for macro-financial stability, and merits staff’s support. Making
full use of this flexibility is important to help buffer external shocks. In addition, it will become
increasingly risky to maintain a tightly managed peg to the U.S. dollar while the recovery in the
United States firms up and the Fed exits from unconventional monetary support, given the
overvalued real exchange rate, loose domestic monetary conditions, and the thin reserves cushion.
21.
Greater exchange rate flexibility, tighter macroeconomic policies, and higher
international reserves would bolster the exchange rate anchor. Staff recommends allowing the
USD/kip exchange rate to move more flexibly within the official +/–5 percent band, with tighter
fiscal and monetary policies supporting a gradual buildup of reserves to around 4 months of import
cover. Occasional, modest intervention in the foreign exchange markets will be warranted to prevent
rapid exchange rate movements and anchor expectations. This approach would help avoid the risk
of a sharp, potentially destabilizing devaluation, particularly in light of the risks from currency
mismatches.
22.
Draining excess kip liquidity from the banking system will enhance the BOL’s
monetary and inflation control. Doing so would further limit the exchange rate pass-through to
consumer prices, mitigating the risk of inflation resurgence as the exchange rate adjusts toward
equilibrium (Box 4). Absorbing excess liquidity is also important for a functioning interbank market,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

and would enable the BOL to move toward targeting a short-term interbank rate in the medium
term. Options include the resumption of BOL bill issuance, raising the reserve requirements on kip
deposits, and accelerating the unwinding of quasi-fiscal lending. Ongoing collaboration between the
BOL and IMF experts to develop the interbank market should help strengthen liquidity management
and forecasting.

Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agreed on the key objectives of low inflation and external stability, but
were not convinced about the need for monetary tightening and greater exchange rate
flexibility. The BOL views inflation control as a priority, and notes from experience that movements
in the kip vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and the Thai baht could strongly influence domestic prices. While
they agree that greater exchange rate flexibility would promote reserves accumulation, an outcome
they desire, well-anchored exchange rate expectations are important to keep import cost and
inflation in check and avoid capital outflows. The authorities are aware that tighter US monetary
conditions could cause capital flow reversal and lower net inflows to Lao P.D.R., and are monitoring
financial markets closely. They expect gross international reserves to rise in 2015 from government
foreign-currency revenues sale and local governments’ loan repayment to the BOL. Draining excess
liquidity is not a near-term priority as credit growth is already declining, though more government
bond issuance for liquidity management purposes could be considered in the future.

C. Financial Stability Issues
24.
Financial stability concerns are rising. Despite lower credit growth, measured credit risks
have increased as the corporate sector has become more leveraged over the past few years
(Paragraph 8). Rising NPLs—reportedly concentrated in public infrastructure-related activity—have
cut into bank profitability and capital cushion. Financial institutions have been granted forbearance
on compliance with key prudential norms as they restructure delinquent loans. Looking ahead,
growing excess liquidity gives banks scope to expand credit, potentially leading to easier lending
standards in times of fewer investment opportunities and heightened near-term macroeconomic
risks.
25.
Efforts to review asset quality at undercapitalized state-owned banks are welcome, but
a more comprehensive agenda is needed. Principal elements include: A more expeditious
recognition of NPLs, supported by diagnostic assessments of systemic banks conducted by
appropriate experts; ensuring that all banks achieve the minimum-mandated CAR of 8 percent in a
prompt, time-bound manner after the diagnostic assessments have been performed; developing
resolution options to deal with NPLs; strengthening financial supervision, with a timeline for phasing
out regulatory forbearance. Staff encourages preparation of a contingency plan for the banking
sector in the event of financial distress, including strengthening the institutional setup for crisis
management with resolution authority, a sound emergency liquidity assistance framework with
appropriate safeguards, a bank resolution framework, and a communications strategy. The IMF is
ready to provide further TA on financial sector supervision, crisis management, and stress testing.

26.
Putting in place key elements for sound lending practices would enhance macrofinancial resiliency. This includes a clear and uniformly applied accounting framework, strong
supervisory oversight and enforcement, a credit culture built on transparency, creditors’ rights,
independent and objective credit analysis, and an effective debt resolution process. International
experience shows that moving in this direction would enhance the benefits from financial deepening
and improve financial access by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Staff welcomes the
recent approval of the AML/CFT law by the National Assembly and the authorities’ commitment to
implement all remaining items in the action plan as agreed with the Financial Action Task Force to
ensure a robust operating environment for banks.
27.
A number of measures have been taken to reduce exchange rate risks on bank and
corporate balance sheets. These include strict enforcement of banks’ compliance with the
regulation on net open foreign exchange positions, the limits on foreign-currency lending to
borrowers without sufficient foreign-currency income, and cash-on-hand requirements. Access to
foreign-currency swap facilities with other central banks could mitigate the vulnerability of the
banking system to foreign-currency liquidity shocks. Additional measures, such as maximum credit
exposures in relation to capital, would help ensure sufficient loss absorption capacity. Collecting
corporate and household balance sheet information and TA on assessing the balance sheet risks in
the banking system would improve the BOL’s ability to monitor and manage the economy’s
exposure to exchange rate risks.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment, and plan to move toward risk-based
supervision in the medium term. The entry of foreign and private banks in recent years has
expanded access to banking services, and helped create a more commercially oriented banking
sector. The depth of the financial system has increased significantly, though financial access by SMEs
remains limited. External auditing requirements and a depositor protection system have contributed
to financial system stability. To ensure that supervisory and bank risk management capacity can
keep pace with financial deepening, the authorities have suspended banking license issuance to
review progress and address weakness. They emphasized strong regulatory enforcement to enhance
credit quality and lower foreign exchange risks, and planned to build the framework and capacity for
risk-based supervision. The BOL and the Ministry of Finance are coordinating to prioritize fiscal
arrears settlement to limit new NPLs. Options to strengthen state-owned banks are under review.

productivity improvement. Despite this progress,
future productivity growth could be constrained by low vocational and tertiary education enrollment
rates. Wage inequality is relatively low, and is partly accounted for by gender disparities and ethnolinguistic differences.

30.
A steady focus on financial market development, education and training, statistics,
and infrastructure upgrades would promote competitiveness and growth inclusiveness.
Upgrading the quality, coverage, and publication of basic economic and financial data will improve
the analysis of risks and policy formulation. Ongoing revisions to trade-related laws and regulations
to meet WTO and ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) commitments would support international
trade integration, improve the business climate, and promote private investment and institutional
reform. An agenda could be developed to improve social safety nets for vulnerable workers,
including those with less formal work arrangements. This would offer potential to make growth
more productivity-driven, broader-based, and more inclusive.

Authorities’ Views
31.
There was broad agreement between the authorities and staff on policy priorities for
longer-term growth. The authorities are making significant revisions to trade-related laws and the
regulatory regime to promote trade integration under the WTO and AEC. Efforts are being made to
enhance SMEs’ financial access and promote private investment as a key growth driver. Public
investment in health and education is expected to increase gradually, with priorities given to rural
health clinics and vocational training to satisfy market demand. Decisions on public infrastructure
investment are increasingly based on efficiency and social return. The authorities will continue to
make use of IMF TA to upgrade national accounts, prices, government finance statistics, and balance
of payments statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Lao P.D.R. has made progress in macroeconomic stabilization in the past year. The
fiscal deficit and credit growth have been reduced, and a measured cooling down in activity is
expected in the near term. Inflation has eased, largely from food and fuel prices, and should remain
in the mid-single digits barring major supply shocks. The immediate stress in foreign exchange
funding has receded, thanks to measures to contain foreign-currency lending.
33.
Nevertheless, the external position remains fragile, and financial stability concerns
have increased from last year. International reserves remain inadequate by several internationally
comparable metrics, and the real effective exchange rate is estimated to be overvalued by 10–
20 percent. The large current account deficit and the tightly-managed, overvalued exchange rate are
constraining reserves accumulation, leaving the exchange rate anchor vulnerable to shocks and
negative macro-financial feedback. The economy is also vulnerable to spillovers from other external
shocks, including a slowdown among regional trading partners. Public debt is rising to levels that
could reduce fiscal space necessary for social and capital spending, and while the risk of external
public debt distress is moderate, risks are increasing compared to last year. After a period of credit
boom, signs of bank weakness are emerging, potentially constraining future growth and adding to
public debt.
34.
Steady fiscal consolidation is necessary to reduce external vulnerabilities and put
public finances on a sustainable footing. A medium-term plan anchored around a nonmining
deficit target of no more than 5 percent of GDP would help reduce the current account deficit and
support international reserves buildup. Fiscal consolidation should be implemented in a manner that
supports the growth potential. Raising revenue is central to this plan, achievable with a strategy to
broaden the tax base and strengthen administration. Accelerating civil service reform would contain
the public wage bill more effectively. Along with this, intensified efforts to curtail non-essential
current outlays and off-budget capital spending would allow for faster arrears clearance and
necessary social and capital spending to promote longer-term competitiveness and inclusive
growth. Communicating this commitment clearly and further enhancing fiscal transparency will
facilitate adjustment by other economic sectors and support future debt issuance.
35.
Greater exchange rate flexibility and tighter domestic monetary conditions will help
strengthen international reserves and keep inflation in check. Allowing the kip to move more
flexibly within the official band, as the BOL did in the second half of 2013, will facilitate a gradual
buildup of international reserves to four months of import cover. Tighter kip liquidity in the banking
system, along with occasional, modest intervention in foreign exchange markets, will help prevent
rapid exchange rate movements and anchor expectations. This approach is necessary to avoid a
sharp, potentially destabilizing devaluation. Absorbing excess kip liquidity would further limit the
exchange rate’s influence on consumer prices, affording the BOL greater monetary and inflation
control, and support interbank market functioning. Steps could also be taken to strengthen liquidity
management and forecasting to support effective monetary policy implementation.

36.
A comprehensive approach to sound lending practices, banking sector supervision,
and bank restructuring is critical to safeguard macro-financial resiliency. Over-reliance on
liquidity provision, forbearance, and unsafe lending practices charts a risky course that could lead to
significant asset deterioration and an adverse feedback between financial and macroeconomic
fragility. NPL loss recognition, supported by diagnostic assessments of systemic banks, would
provide recapitalization cost estimates and restructuring options. Ensuring that all banks achieve the
mandated minimum CAR, phasing out regulatory forbearance, and strengthening supervision would
improve confidence and allocation of financial resources. Over time, an agenda based on adopting a
clear and unified accounting framework, strengthening creditors’ rights and rigorous credit analysis,
financial transparency, and an effective debt resolution process would help enhance the benefits of
financial deepening and financial access by SMEs. The IMF is ready to further assist the authorities in
developing detailed plans to address supervisory weaknesses as well as a crisis contingency plan for
the banking sector.
37.
Accelerating trade integration and increasing education and health spending would
build on existing strength, and promote competitiveness and growth inclusiveness. The
authorities have achieved progress on product and labor market openness and made significant
gains in poverty reduction. Further trade integration will improve the business climate, and promote
private investment and institutional reform. Formal social safety nets for vulnerable workers and the
marginalized rural poor and ethnic minorities would ensure that future growth benefits are better
shared.
38.
More attention and resources need to be devoted to improving the quality and
publication of basic economic and financial data. Significant constraints are imposed on
surveillance by weak data, inadequate reporting, and minimal progress has been made since the last
Article IV consultation. Shortcomings are largely due to lack of capacity. The national account,
government finance, monetary and financial sector, as well as external sector statistics are the key
areas of deficiencies. A focus on these priority areas will help mitigate current vulnerabilities and
improve overall public policies and services. Success will require a commitment to implement the
Strategies for the Development of the National Statistical System, including through sustained
dedication to capacity improvement and better coordination among agencies. The IMF stands ready
to provide further TA to address specific needs, with active support from the technical assistance
office in Bangkok and the recently established IMF office in Vientiane.

It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Lao P.D.R.: Poverty Reduction, Inclusive Growth, and Challenges Ahead1
Lao P.D.R. has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last two decades. The challenges ahead
will involve tackling rural poverty and containing the rise in inequality.
The poverty rate, measured using a “basic needs” poverty line adjusted for inflation, was halved from
46 percent in the early 1990s to 23 percent in 2013, allowing Lao P.D.R. to achieve this MDG goal ahead of
schedule. Significant steps have also been made toward increasing household asset ownership, improving
living conditions, and expanding access to healthcare facilities, electricity, and other amenities. These efforts
have contributed to a dramatic decline in maternal and child mortality rates as well as mortality from malaria
and tuberculosis, and the country being on track to achieve gender parity in primary education (Table 8).
Nonetheless, a large fraction of households remain close to or below the poverty line and vulnerable to
macroeconomic shocks. These households tend to be in the rural, northeastern and southern areas, isolated
from main markets, belong to ethnic minority groups, and headed by persons with low education
attainment. A large school enrollment gap also exists between children from poor and nonpoor households,
indicating that poverty is persistent across generations. This education gap is particularly pronounced at the
lower secondary level, with the net enrollment rate among poor children aged 11 to 15 years registering at
28 percent, compared to 57 percent among nonpoor children in 2013.
Over the years, remittances from migrant workers in large cities or neighboring countries have increasingly
become an important source of economic support, and poverty rates are significantly lower among
households receiving remittances. This success has brought some additional challenges, however. While
remittances have facilitated consumption growth, uneven consumption growth patterns between the poor
and the nonpoor households have contributed to a rise in inequality. The Gini coefficient was 36.2 in 2013,
comparable to that of other countries in the region, rising marginally from 32.5 in 2003.
Based on cross-country experience, the following policy actions may facilitate further progress toward
poverty reduction and serve to promote inclusive growth in Lao P.D.R.:



Establishing a policy framework that ensures macroeconomic stability and reduces vulnerabilities to
shocks.



Supporting productivity growth, particularly in rural areas, through improvements in literacy and
education, access to markets, health services and sanitation, and the investment climate. Targeting
resources toward the rural poor and ethnic minorities would help address inequality of
opportunities.



Strengthen social sustainability through policies directed to inclusive growth and fair resource
allocation, in particular, land.



Providing employment opportunities to generate income-earning capacities for farmers, including
by training, equipping, and educating them, in order to raise crop yields and conserve natural
resources and the environment.



Targeting the social spending and assistance for the vulnerable, and extending coverage beyond
basic education and health services to enhance resilience to macroeconomic shocks.



Improve data monitoring, data quality, and publication to ensure information accuracy and
reliability.

Staff’s overall assessment is that the external
position is highly vulnerable and requires
strengthening. Fiscal consolidation, tighter
domestic monetary conditions, a more flexible
exchange rate, and higher reserves would
reduce near-term vulnerabilities. Over time,
structural reforms to improve productivity,
particularly in the nonresource sector, will be
needed to bolster external competitiveness.

Box 3. Lao P.D.R.: Measuring the Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Inflation1
The influence of exchange rate movements on domestic inflation in Lao P.D.R. is limited and comparable to
other countries in the region.
Monetary policymakers in small open economies pay attention to the impact on domestic inflation from
exchange rate movements. This box investigates the extent to which domestic inflation in Lao P.D.R. is
affected by changes in the exchange rate over the operational horizon of monetary policy (eight quarters),
and how the measured pass-through compares with selected regional economies.
A Bayesian Vector Autoregression model (BVAR) was estimated using quarterly data over 2000–13,
controlling for changes in producers’ marginal cost through international commodity, fuel, and food prices.
The BVAR is used to mitigate small sample and endogeneity problems in exchange rate pass-through
estimation.2 Estimated coefficients were significantly lower than those estimated using ordinary least square
(OLS), indicating the presence of endogeneity.
Pass-through in Lao P.D.R.
(In percent)







Exchange rate pass-through in Lao P.D.R. is
partial and limited. The inflation response from
1 percent depreciation is less than one-tenth of a
percent over the first two quarters. The passthrough elasticity peaks in the sixth quarter, after
which it declines. The bilateral USD/kip and
THB/kip exchange rates have similar passthrough over time.
The pass-through elasticity in Lao P.D.R. is in line
with regional comparators, ranging from 0.15 in
Indonesia to around 0.3 in the Philippines. Lao
P.D.R.’s median pass-through was about 0.2, but
the margin of error in estimation is also high.3
The dynamics of the inflation adjustment vary
across countries. Inflation response in Myanmar
and Thailand is swift, declining after just two
quarters, whereas for other countries, the inflation
response can take two years to reach full impact,
for instance in the Philippines.

Box 4. Lao P.D.R.: Tax System Productivity1
Room for tax productivity improvement and revenue collection is substantial—up to twice or three times
today’s levels—in corporate income tax (CIT), personal income tax (PIT) and the value-added tax (VAT).
A productive tax system can raise substantial revenue through a broad tax base, allowing tax rates and
compliance costs to be kept low. This box provides a high-level profile of the structure and performance of

Lao P.D.R.’s tax revenue effort compared well with the LIC3 average at about 15½ percent of GDP in 2012,
but underperformed when viewed against the regional4 and world averages of 17 percent and 19 percent,
respectively.
Key findings: At 35 percent, the CIT rate is higher than the LIC average (29 percent), the neighboring
countries (24 percent), and the world average (24 percent). Notwithstanding this high rate, CIT collection
comes in at the LIC average of 2½ percent of GDP, faring worse than regional and the world averages
(5¾ and 3⅓ percent of GDP, respectively). At Vietnam’s CIT productivity level, Lao P.D.R.’s CIT collection
would almost triple, ceteris paribus.
PIT productivity is well below regional average, partly due to excessive segmentation of the tax rate
schedule. The lack of a dedicated office to deal with large taxpayers hampers compliance work. PIT
collection would almost double if productivity reached the average levels observed in the region, ceteris
paribus.
With a similar VAT rate as regional peers, revenue collection is substantially poorer due to a low tax
registration base and widespread use of exemptions and zero ratings. At Vietnam’s productivity levels, Lao
P.D.R.’s VAT collection would almost double, ceteris paribus.

Credit growth has recently declined, thanks partly to
restraints on public investment.

But, as funding remains strong, excess liquidity is rising,…

…given a sharp rebound in reserve money growth.

Nominal interest rates have been more or less stable.

Figure 4. External vulnerabilities are elevated.
The USD/kip exchange rate has been stable within the
band since early-2014.

The real exchange rate continues to appreciate.

Export competitiveness—particularly the ability to
penetrate new markets—has weakened.

Nevertheless, slower import growth helped improve the
nonresource current account position in 2013.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and Chris Lane (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (World Bank)

Prepared By
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

The risk of Lao P.D.R. facing external debt distress remains moderate, but it is on the cusp of a
transition to high risk, with heightened vulnerabilities for public debt.2 External debt distress
indicators are more elevated than in last year’s DSA, owing to the higher initial external PPG debt
stock and projected debt flows to support public investment, and less concessional borrowing terms
over time. Buffers are very limited in the case of adverse shocks. Given the considerable share of
foreign currency denominated debt, large and sudden exchange rate depreciation could significantly
raise the debt-to-GDP and the debt service-to-revenue trajectories for external and public debt;
though revenues from large resource projects are expected to mitigate risks over the long term. While
the change in external risk rating is not warranted at this time because baseline breaches of the
thresholds under both the traditional and probability approaches are minor and temporary, the
breaches do suggest heightened vulnerabilities, which should be addressed through fiscal
consolidation, as recommended by staff, and by strengthening public investment management
capacity.

This DSA has been prepared by IMF and World Bank staffs, in consultation with the Lao P.D.R. authorities.

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to
manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are policy-dependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a
country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and
classified into three categories: strong, medium, and weak. Lao P.D.R.’s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged
3.37 over the past three years. Since its average CPIA index has been above 3.25 for three years in a row, Lao P.D.R.’s policy
performance remains classified as medium according to the “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries” (www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/012210.pdf). Therefore, the relevant
indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports
ratio, 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt
service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

vulnerabilities for public debt. The indicative debt
distress thresholds remain unchanged from the 2013 Article IV DSA. Under the baseline scenario of the
current DSA, some of the external and public debt distress indicators breach the policy-dependent
indicative thresholds for some years, the PV of external debt follows a downward trend and returns to
levels below the respective thresholds in the medium term. Given the traditional approach classifies the
debt distress risk as borderline high/moderate, a probability approach is adopted. The results of the
probability approach suggest moderate debt distress risks, since all the indicators remain under their
corresponding thresholds, with the exception of debt-to-GDP ratio, which breaches the threshold for a
brief period.

investment in power generation projects. Thus,
the PPG external debt rose from 47.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to 48.3 percent of GDP at end-2013. The
corresponding net present value (PV) of PPG external debt was 39.8 percent of GDP, a significant increase
from 32.5 percent of GDP at end-2012, primarily because the amortization schedule of existing debt puts
the larger part of principal repayments on more recent years compared to the last DSA.

4.
Bilateral creditors have taken a larger share than multilateral creditors in 2013, and this
trend is expected to continue in the projection period. Bilateral creditors—mainly China, Russia,
Thailand, Japan, and Korea—account for 64 percent of total external PPG debt at end-2013. Multilateral

projection period in the baseline. However, given
almost half of total external PPG debt is contracted in U.S. dollars and declining concessionality of new
borrowing under the current DSA assumptions, the debt to GDP and debt service ratios of external PPG
debt are most sensitive to large sudden currency depreciation shocks. Given very thin buffers, other
adverse shocks, including delayed fiscal consolidation, could push the stock of external PPG debt beyond
sustainable levels, with some debt distress indicators breaching their respective thresholds.
7.
The rising external debt-to-GDP ratio and near-term threshold breaches underscore the
need to strengthen debt management capacity. This includes ensuring that debt sustainability
considerations are taken into account when contracting new debt, particularly because the country is
expected to shift from concessional to more market-based terms as it graduates from Least Developed
Country (LDC) status. Additional near-term external borrowing, for example to finance mega-projects,
could push the debt-to-GDP ratio over the indicative thresholds for a protracted period, potentially
jeopardizing debt sustainability. A mitigating factor for Lao P.D.R.’s external debt burden lies in the
prospective returns on the hydropower and mining projects that have been financed in part by the external
PPG debt. The long-term power purchase agreements that are singed for these projects and the resulting
government revenues in the form of royalties, dividends, and profit tax payments help reduce the risk of
debt distress in the long run.
8.
Recorded domestic PPG debt (excluding arrears) declined marginally from 12 percent of
GDP in 2012 to about 11 percent of GDP at end-2013.4 Domestic debt consists of commercial bank
lending and bond holdings as well as Bank of the Lao P.D.R.’s direct lending to local government’s offbudget infrastructure projects. Given higher costs of domestic borrowing, the share of domestic PPG debt
remains relatively small. Going forward, however, as domestic financial markets deepen, the share of
domestic public debt is likely to increase. Financing through arrears accumulation allows total domestic and
external PPG debt to remain at about 59 percent of GDP at end-2013, similar to the year before.

reverting toward 7.5 percent in the medium
term. Average real GDP growth over the projected period is expected to be lower than in 2013 DSA, in
large part due to lower projected mining sector growth. GDP deflator growth (in USD terms) is projected to
be about 1 percent, lower than in 2013 DSA, on account of the subdued global commodity and import
price outlook and moderately lower real GDP growth. The bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis USD is expected
to depreciate by about 3.5 percent year-on-year starting in 2016 and thereafter, consistent with the
authorities’ exchange rate band of +/-5 percent.
10.
Compared to the 2013 DSA, the baseline projects slight improvement in the external
position, but deterioration in the fiscal position. The current account deficit is projected to improve over
the forecast period and also compared to the 2013 DSA. On the fiscal side, the primary deficit is expected
to deteriorate in the medium term, worse than 2013 DSA.
11.
As a result, a higher level of financing than last year is assumed. To meet the country’s
financing needs, a higher level of new borrowing is projected to finance investment that would support the
country’s ambition to graduate from the LDC status by 2020. External financing is assumed to remain
largely on concessional terms in the near future. Going forward, however, the new disbursement schedule
is assumed to rely less on multilateral creditors, and more on bilateral and commercial creditors. In this vein,
the share of commercial borrowing is projected to reach about 10 percent of total new disbursements in
the long term. Multilateral assistance will slowly shift from grant- to credit-based conditions, and AsDB and
the World Bank Group are expected to remain the principal suppliers of multilateral credit, with IDA loans
slowly phasing out and replaced by IBRD loans with less concessional terms. The level of grant financing is
projected to decline from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 3.5 percent of GDP in the medium term,
adding to the higher projected borrowing needs, which are estimated to be higher than the authorities’
disbursement projections. Interest rates on bilateral and commercial loans are expected to increase with
libor, in line with the assumptions from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, and stabilize at a higher level in
the medium term. As the domestic financial market deepens, the private sector is assumed to rely more on
domestic sources of financing, lowering the need for foreign borrowing in the long term.

Box 1. Baseline Scenario – Underlying Assumptions (2014–34)
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes neutral fiscal stance in the medium-term, followed by some
consolidation, and accommodative monetary conditions. Although long-term growth is still anchored by the
vigorous energy production sector, vulnerabilities remain heightened.
Real GDP growth is projected to average 7.5 percent during 2014–19. Growth has slowed in FY2014, partly
due to fiscal tightening and lower mining production. In the medium term, some fiscal easing and higher
growth in the resource sector, driven by the commencing of operation of some power projects, will return
growth to about 7½ percent. This outlook also relies on continued accommodative monetary policy,
vigorous resource-related FDI inflows, rising electricity demand from neighboring countries, and a gradual
pickup of investment inflows into nonresource sectors following Lao P.D.R.’s recent WTO accession. Over the
longer term, successful structural reforms would create a better environment for private investment,
broadening the sources of growth. Real GDP is expected to moderate to 6.3 percent on average during
2020–34, as production in the resource sector reaches maturity. Graduation from Least Developed Country
status is projected around early-2020s.
Inflation (measured by GDP deflator in USD terms) is projected to average about 1.5 percent in 2014–34.
Price growth is expected to remain subdued, owing to weaker food and fuel price growth outlook and
declining domestic pressures.
The balance of payments continues to be driven by developments in the resource sector, which has an
important bearing both the current account and the capital and financial account. The current account
deficit is estimated to have narrowed slightly to about 28.9 percent of GDP in 2013 and is expected to
decline to 25 percent of GDP in 2014, as the nonresource deficit remains elevated and the resource deficit
temporarily increases before large-scale power projects come on stream in 2015–16. FDI inflows are
assumed to be vigorous, driven by growing investment inflows into both resource and nonresource sectors
following Lao P.D.R.’s recent WTO accession. The current account is projected to improve over medium and
long term, assuming that nonresource exports and services will gradually pickup driven by solid recovery in
advanced economies, strengthened regional integration, supported by improvements in the investment
climate, streamlining of business regulations, and the prevalence of trade commitments.
External financing is assumed to remain largely on concessional terms in the near term. In the longer-run,
however, the degree of concessional financing decreases with economic development, while new
disbursement schedule will shift from multilateral to commercial and bilateral creditors.
Multilateral creditors: Projected loan disbursements in the medium term are relatively low, since IDA and
AsDB have a pipeline of operations financed on grant terms, which are forecast to roll over into loans with
decreasing levels of concessionality going forward. Over the longer term, project loans are assumed to
increase moderately, but the share of multilateral loans in total disbursements are expected to decline over
the long run.


Under the IDA pipeline, half of new disbursements starting in FY 2014 are expected to be financed
through grants and half through loans on concessional terms. Given the expected graduation of Lao
P.D.R. from the LDC status, beginning in FY 2021 half of the disbursements are expected to be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

financed under IDA terms and half under IBRD terms, and starting in FY 2024 all financing by the
World Bank Group is expected to shift to IBRD terms with less concessional conditions.


AsDB loans are expected to remain on concessional terms. New projects for 2015 to 2035 are
assumed at US$85 million per year, which is the average of Lao P.D.R.'s indicative lending
allocations as set out in the Work Program and Budget Framework for 2015–17, with the addition of
US$27 million per year for additional allocation for subregional project, based on the annual
average of 2013–14 subregional allocations.

Bilateral and Commercial Creditors: For 2014–19, project loan disbursements also increase, as donors
provide support to the government’s development agenda. Over the medium and longer term, greater
participation by new emerging market creditors results in an increased role for bilateral finance, including
on-lending to state-owned enterprises. As Lao P.D.R. exits from low income country status, larger share of
external borrowing is expected to shift from multilateral to bilateral and commercial creditors, with lower
degree of concessionality on market-based terms. The share of commercial creditors is expected to increase
over the projection period to about 10 percent of total new borrowing. Given the anticipated increase in
global interest rates due to the exit from unconventional monetary policy in the US, interest rates for
bilateral and commercial borrowing are expected to start rising in 2015 in line with the World economic
Outlook’s libor forecasts. DSA assumptions also incorporate historical and projected bond issuance initiative
in the Thai market. So far, a 50-million USD bond has been issued in May 2013, two bonds totaling
US$100 million have been issued in December 2013, and a 170 million USD bond has been issued in
October 2014.
Fiscal policy is projected to be neutral in the medium-term. The primary deficit is projected to peak at
3.6 percent of GDP in 2016 and remain at about 3.4 percent of GDP on average over the medium term, then
decline gradually to around 1.4 percent of GDP on average. Over the long-term the primary deficit is
expected to stabilize at around 0.7 percent as improvements in non-mining revenue collection are
counteracted by declines in mining and resource related revenue, while capital expenditure is expected to
decline and other expenditure categories are expected to remain constant as a percent of GDP.
Domestic debt is expected to increase over the long-term as the country relies more on domestic funding.
Going forward, as global interest rates are projected to rise and domestic financial markets deepen a larger
share of financing needs is likely to be satisfied by domestic creditors.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
12.
Under the baseline scenario, the PV of external debt to GDP ratio is projected to be above
the policy dependent indicative threshold and decline in the medium term (Figure 1), indicating that
the debt distress risk is more elevated than the 2013 DSA. The change is driven primarily by the higher debt
stock at the end of 2013, and higher projected new borrowing, with less concessional terms going forward
as Lao P.D.R. graduates from the LDC status. As a result, the current DSA forecasts a breach in the PV of
external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio until 2018. Other debt and debt service indicators remain below the policydependent indicative threshold during the entire forecast period under the baseline scenario.
13.
Under the historical scenario, in which key variables are set at their historical averages, debt
dynamics become unsustainable for all debt stock indicators. The historical scenario is based on 10year averages of higher current account deficit, real GDP growth, and growth of exports of goods and
services than assumed under the baseline, requiring higher debt accumulation rates and putting debt
dynamics on an unsustainable path.
14.
Debt dynamics continue to be markedly worse under the alternative scenarios, with the
exchange rate depreciation risk having the largest impact. Abrupt exchange rate depreciation remains
the most important risk to sustainability, given a large share of foreign currency debt and a very thin
international reserves cushion. A potential trigger is an increase in global interest rates, as advanced
economies exit from unconventional monetary policies. As shown in Figure 1, a one-off 30 percent
depreciation shock would cause the breach of the indicative threshold of the PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-torevenue, and debt service-to-revenue ratios over a prolonged period. While the PV of external PPG debt
declines over the projection period, liquidity indicators worsen, as indicated by the increasing debt service
ratios. This raises concerns about possible foreign-currency liquidity crunch. However, given the expected
increase in revenues from hydropower production, which are not fully captured by fiscal revenues, debt
service-to-exports ratio, rather than debt service-to-revenue ratio, is a more appropriate indicator. A
somewhat worse debt trajectory emerges as a result of an assumed negative shock to FDI inflows––a
scenario with net official transfers and net FDI falling in 2014-15 below their historical averages—in which
case Lao P.D.R. would be forced to reduce its current account deficit in order to avoid worsening the
external debt position.
15.
The borderline high/moderate case issue was addressed with the probability approach,
which suggests moderate risk of debt distress, but verging on a transition to high risk. Given the
small breach under the baseline and multiple breaches of thresholds under the alternative scenarios, the
debt distress risk is classified as high/moderate. To address the borderline issue, a so-called probability
approach was adopted. The key difference is that the probability approach incorporates a country’s
individual CPIA score and average GDP growth rate, whereas the traditional approach uses one of three
discrete CPIA values (for weak, medium, and strong performers) and an average growth rate across LICs.
Under the baseline scenario, the probability of debt distress is lower than the threshold for all indicators,
with the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio breaching its threshold only briefly. The risk of debt distress is sensitive to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

significant exchange rate depreciation and under a historical scenario, in which case the stress tests result in
multiple breaches of thresholds. This is consistent with moderate risk of debt distress.

B. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
16.
The PV of total PPG debt in percent of GDP and in percent of revenue are both projected to
remain elevated over the long run under the baseline scenario. Current public sector debt dynamics
show a worsening situation than in 2013 DSA. The PV of public sector debt was estimated at 50.5 percent
of GDP in 2013 and is expected to remain high and above the threshold until the end of the projection
period in the baseline scenario. The breach is primarily driven by faster amortization schedule on existing
2013 debt and higher projected disbursement schedule necessary to support growth in the conditions of
fiscal easing and limited public investment management and implementation capacity. Given the
underlying assumptions of the eventual shift from concessional to market-based borrowing terms and
higher borrowing interest rates over time, Lao P.D.R.’s PPG debt-to-GDP, debt-to-revenue, and debt
service-to-revenue ratios are expected to increase over the projection period.
17.
The worsened baseline and the alternative scenarios from last year’s DSA highlight the
growing risk of debt distress and point to the importance of fiscal consolidation over the medium
term. As shown by the fixed primary balance scenario, which assumes unchanged primary balance from
2014 for the entire projection period, the PV of the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios would be
higher than the baseline in the second half of the projection period.
18.
Owing to significant reliance on external borrowing, the PV of public debt remains sensitive
to large, abrupt exchange rate depreciation. A sudden 30-percent depreciation of the kip against the
U.S. dollar would immediately raise the PV of public debt-to-GDP in the medium-term, with unfavorable
implications for debt sustainability.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
19.
The authorities broadly agreed with the overall assessment, emphasizing that the
government does not foresee difficulties in servicing debt, and expect lower new borrowing than
the DSA assumes. Given the expected strong royalty, dividends, and profits, the authorities do not
anticipate any difficulty finding creditors and servicing outstanding loans. A relatively long maturity profile
of loans, as well as U.S. dollar returns of the exporting sectors, would help mitigate the risks of debt distress.
The authorities anticipate an increase in disbursements of new funds from some bilateral donors between
2014 and 2019, and that borrowing would not expand at the rate assumed in the DSA given a number of
current regulations restricting new external commercial borrowing to no more than 25 percent of
government revenue. Restrictions on borrowing for infrastructure and social development purposes also
allow financing only on concessional terms with interest rates below 3 percent and long-term maturity.
Nevertheless, the authorities indicated that these guidelines could be modified should financing needs and
financial conditions change. Borrowing is expected to shift from external to domestic sources over time, as
domestic financing becomes cheaper. Better access to nonconcessional loans is also expected in the future.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

20.
The authorities highlighted that a significant part of the external debt is related to viable,
large resource projects. They believe that energy sector projects will generate high and stable economic
returns upon completion. While going forward, the authorities felt that external borrowing from China will
decline, as lending will focus on the energy sector and on guaranteed terms only.

CONCLUSION
21.
Although Lao P.D.R.’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate, it is on the cusp of a
transition to high risk, with heightened vulnerabilities for public debt. While debt service ratios remain
within the policy-dependent indicative thresholds in the baseline, primarily because of the still high
concessionality of official borrowing, the PV of external debt to GDP ratio breaches the indicative threshold
for some years, leaving almost no buffers in the case of adverse shocks. Given that the traditional approach
identifies the risk of debt distress as borderline between moderate and high, a probability approach is
adopted, using Laos-specific indicators. The results show that the debt distress probability remains below
the threshold in the baseline for all indicators, except the external debt to GDP ratio, which breaches the
threshold for a brief period. Also, given the considerable share of foreign currency denominated debt, a
large sudden exchange rate depreciation could significantly raise the debt-to-GDP and the debt service-torevenue trajectories for external and public debt. In that event, the elevated private external debt would
also raise concern. Large sudden exchange rate depreciation would put public debt dynamics on an
unsustainable path well above the baseline. While the external risk rating does not warrant a change at this
time because baseline breaches of the thresholds under both the traditional and probability approaches
are minor and temporary, the breaches do suggest heightened vulnerabilities, which should be addressed
through fiscal consolidation, as recommended by staff, and by strengthening public investment
management capacity.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure arrangement is floating. The kip slightly depreciated against the U.S. dollar within a
1 percent band from November 2013 to November 2014. Therefore, the de facto arrangement is
reclassified retroactively as crawl-like from its previous classification as stabilized. The authorities’
objective is to limit currency fluctuations vis-à-vis major currencies, including the U.S. dollar and
Thai baht, within ±5 percent per annum. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BOL) sets a daily official
reference rate, which is calculated as a weighted average of the previous day’s interbank rates.
Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required to maintain their buying and selling
rates within ±0.25 percent of the BOL’s daily reference rate for the U.S. dollar. For the euro and
baht, the buying and selling rates may not exceed a margin of 0.5 percent. For other currencies, a
margin of 2 percent applies.
On May 28, 2010, Lao P.D.R. accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4,
following the elimination of one restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII arising
from a requirement to obtain tax payment certificates for some transactions. Lao P.D.R. now
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions, except for restrictions imposed solely for the preservation of
national or international security notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during August 28–September 12,
2013 and were concluded by the Executive Board on November 15, 2013. The staff report (Country
Report No. 13/369) was published on December 20, 2013.
Technical Assistance
Over the past three years, Lao P.D.R. has received technical assistance in the areas of customs and
tax revenue administration; price statistics; external sector statistics; and the national accounts. A
Bangkok-based IMF office was set up in September 2012 to facilitate technical assistance to Lao
P.D.R. as well as Myanmar.
Resident Representative
Mr. Sanjay Kalra assumed the Resident Representative post for Vietnam and Lao P.D.R., based in
Hanoi, on October 16, 2011.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The World Bank and the IMF country teams for Lao P.D.R. met on October 21, 2014 to discuss
economic issues and outlook and to coordinate the two teams’ work for FY2015. The teams were led
by Mr. Alain W. D’Hoore (Senior Country Economist, Macro and Fiscal Management Global Practice,
World Bank), and Mr. Ashvin Ahuja (IMF Mission Chief for Lao P.D.R.).
The teams agreed that although Lao P.D.R. had made progress on macroeconomic stabilization,
significant vulnerabilities remain. While fiscal consolidation has been initiated, more efforts could be
made to reduce external vulnerabilities and restore fiscal sustainability. Tighter fiscal and monetary
policies, a more flexible exchange rate and strengthened banking supervision will be needed to
build international reserves and ensure macro-financial stability. In the longer run, a key challenge is
to promote inclusive growth and poverty reduction through more diversification into nonresource
sectors and sustainable development of natural resources. Much progress has been made in recent
years on product and labor market openness and poverty reduction. Further trade integration will
improve the business climate, and promote private investment and institutional reform. Upgrading
health and education infrastructure will raise the growth potential and help reduce inequality.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012-2016 is
aligned with the government’s Seventh Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan,
2011–2015. It promotes inclusive and sustainable growth and poverty reduction through (i)
engagement in four priority sectors (agriculture, natural resources and rural development;
education; energy; and water and other urban infrastructure and services); and (ii) more effective
private sector development, gender equity, public sector management and regional cooperation
and integration as crosscutting concerns. The CPS aims to maximize efficiency and sustainability
through larger operations implemented over a longer period; maximize synergies with the
implementation of Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) strategic framework 2012–22; and also
increase responsiveness to emerging issues in a rapidly changing economy. The performance-based
allocation of the Asian Development Fund (ADF), based on the country performance assessment
(CPA) finalized in 2012, provided Lao P.D.R. with an ADF allocation in the amount of US$156.01
million for the biennial period 2013–14. The CPA for the next allocation period (2015–16) will be
finalized by the end of 2014.
As of end-2013, outstanding loans/grants approved stood at US$715.0 million, of which amount of
US$368.3 million was awarded for contracts. During 2013, US$76.4 million was disbursed and
US$102.6 million of contracts were awarded. ADB approved three new loan projects and four new
technical assistance (TA) projects for a total of US$115 million and US$2.5 million in 2013
respectively, including water supply and sanitation, GMS rural infrastructure development and
private sector development program; TA projects related to health and road sector governance,
smallholder, and support for improved aid effectiveness.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

As of December 3, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance, especially

regarding national accounts, government finance, monetary and financial and external sector
statistics. These shortcomings are mostly due to lack of capacity, which could be addressed through
further efforts on the part of the agencies involved. The IMF is conducting technical assistance (TA)
and training programs to address the specific needs with a focus to mitigate near-term risks,
covering the areas of national accounts, prices, government finance statistics, monetary and financial
statistics, and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts (NA) comprise annual estimates of GDP by activity at current
and constant prices (base year=2002), broadly following the System of National Accounts (SNA)
1993. Lao P.D.R. participated in the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) project to implement the SNA
and International Comparison Project (ICP), funded by the government of Japan through the Japan
Administered Account for Selected Activities (JSA), and has received technical assistance (TA) to
improve annual national accounts and develop quarterly national accounts (QNA). Under this
project, Lao PDR made some methodology improvements in the annual GDP by activity estimates,
including good progress in updating the base year from 2002 to 2010, and has moved closer to
completing a new annual expenditure measure of GDP and a preliminary GNI series, Some progress
had also been made toward the development of a new quarterly GDP series. Under a new JSA
funding Project, a Real Sector Statistics Advisor for Lao P.D.R. and Bangladesh, stationed in the latter
country, was appointed in January 2014 to assist with the improvement of national accounts.
Price Statistics: Lao P.D.R. compiles a monthly CPI (December 2010=100) using weights based on the

2007/08 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey. An update on the weights is expected for this
year to be implemented in 2016 CPI collection. A producer price index (PPI) is under development
and is planned for availability in March 2015. Data from the 2012 economic census will be used to
develop its weights and as the basis for selecting a sample of establishments. The PPI coverage is
currently restricted to mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and electricity and will be progressively
expanded to cover tourism, construction activities, agriculture, services and other activities.
Government Finance Statistics: Government finance statistics remain weak. The timeliness of fiscal
reporting needs significant improvement. Off-budget activities are not included in the fiscal data,
although they have expanded rapidly in recent years. Annual budget and outturn data formats do
not follow international standards for government finance statistics. Except for the annual data
disseminated in the Official Gazette, no fiscal data are disseminated in the country. A mission took
place during March 2014 funded by the Government of Japan through the Japan Administered
Account for Selected IMF activities (JSA) to further assist the Fiscal Policy Department (FPD) of the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) in upgrading the compilation and dissemination procedures of GFS data
for Lao P.D.R. in line with the ongoing migration to the GFSM 2001. The JSA has also financed a
resident advisor to assist and guide the updating and implementing of the GFSM 2001 (GFSM 2014)
migration action plans by providing training on GFS, by promoting interaction of government

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

agencies in the development of GFS, and by coordinating the GFS reporting with other fiscal
reporting activities. The authorities will be assisted in disseminating GFS data on their websites and
reporting the data for publication.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The classification of monetary data by institutional sector and by
financial instrument as well as valuation principles need to be strengthened. The latest monetary
data reported to STA refer to December 2010. The Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which embody
the IMF-recommended framework for compiling monetary statistics, have yet to be introduced. STA
conducted a one-week training course for the Bank of Lao in February 2014, to build the capacity of
the monetary compilers.
Financial sector surveillance: Financial sector surveillance: Lao P.D.R. does not produce Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) yet.

External sector statistics: STA appointed an External Sector Statistics (ESS) Advisor to the Technical
Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar (TAOLAM) in February 2014. Since then, the Advisor
has conducted three missions, which focused mainly on trade. The missions assisted in reconciling
the discrepancy between imports data published by the Bank of Lao and imports derived from
partner countries’ data in the Direction of Trade Statistics and found that the use of minimum prices
to value vehicles and petroleum imports might explain some of the differences. In addition, several
balance of payments components are missing due to the lack of source data. The BOL balance of
payments compilers have designed an FDI survey questionnaire in the context of the World Bank’s
LAOSTAT-Strengthening the National Statistical System Project. Coordination on FDI is needed as
the European Union has also appointed an expert to assist on FDI statistics. Implementation of the
new international transactions reporting system (ITRS) is ongoing and testing of the new ITRS is
expected by June 2015. The BOL does not yet compile an international investment position
statement.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Lao P.D.R. is currently not a General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) participant. The
government has expressed its intention to
collaborate with the IMF in moving Lao’s
macroeconomic statistics closer to the
international standards, including to join the
IMF’s GDDS, and use it as a framework for
development of the national data compilation
and dissemination practices. No Data ROSC
mission has been conducted.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Lao People’s Democratic Republic
January 14, 2015

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board on December 17, 2014. This information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Real GDP growth was 7.8 percent (y/y) in fiscal year 2014 (October 2013–September
2014). For calendar year 2014, growth is estimated at around 7½ percent, broadly in line with
staff’s forecast.
3.
Inflation edged down slightly on a year-on-year basis to 2.8 percent in November
(3.0 percent in October), reflecting slowing nonfood price increases and lower energy prices.
Inflation in 2014 is likely to be slightly lower than staff’s forecast.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 26, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Lao People’s Democratic
Republic
On January 14, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
Real GDP growth is expected to moderate from 8 percent in 2013 to 7½ percent in 2014.
Domestic activity has slowed, and credit growth has declined from excessive levels. Inflation has
declined to 3 percent from 6½ percent at end-2013, largely due to weaker food and fuel price
momentum. However, the current account deficit is expected to remain large at 25 percent of
GDP in 2014; and, at 1 month of prospective imports of goods and services, international
reserves (US$0.7 billion, August 2014) do not offer adequate protection against external shocks.
Bank balance sheets are showing signs of weakness, with rising nonperforming loans (NPL) and
weaker capital and profitability. Public and publicly guaranteed debt (excluding arrears) is
projected at 60 percent of GDP in nominal terms (52 percent of GDP in present value terms) in
2014.
As growth continues to moderate in the near term, inflation is projected to remain in the midsingle digits. The current account deficit is projected to improve to about 21 percent of GDP in
2015, but with lower capital inflows, reserves would rise only slightly to 1¼ months of imports.
Risks are on the downside. A more expansionary fiscal stance would worsen the external
position. The economy is also exposed to external shocks, notably a regional growth slowdown
and a deterioration in terms-of-trade and capital inflows. With a thin reserves cushion, these
shocks could force large movements in the exchange rate, leading to debt defaults, and
undermining growth, financial stability, and fiscal sustainability.
Following a sharply expansionary and procyclical stance in 2013, the authorities started to
tighten fiscal policy in 2014, mainly through curbs on civil service compensation and capital
spending cuts. Public investment cuts have helped limit the Bank of Lao P.D.R.’s quasi-fiscal
lending and lower private credit growth. Strict enforcement of regulation on banks’ net open
foreign exchange positions and the limits on foreign-currency lending has helped reduce foreign1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

currency liquidity risk at banks. However, excess kip liquidity in the banking system has risen,
and greater exchange rate flexibility, observed in the second half of 2013, has not resumed.
After years of rapid credit growth, financial stability concerns are coming to the fore.
Accumulation of public investment arrears has led to losses in the business sector, with impact
on banks. The system’s nonperforming loan ratio (NPL) is estimated to have doubled during the
first half of 2014. In the same period, state-owned banks’ average NPL is reported to have
increased from 2 percent to about 8 percent, with average capital-to-asset ratio declining to
3 percent. Direct exposure to foreign currency through lending and deposits remain high, with
the foreign-currency shares in total lending and deposits standing at 48 percent, down from
50 percent in 2013.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors welcomed policy corrections initiated by the Lao P.D.R. authorities and
the progress made in macroeconomic stabilization in the past year. Directors nevertheless noted
that the economic outlook remains clouded by significant vulnerabilities in the external, fiscal,
and financial sectors. A regional growth slowdown, deterioration in global metal prices, and
capital flow volatility continue to pose external risks. To address these vulnerabilities, Directors
emphasized the need for continued fiscal consolidation, greater exchange rate flexibility, tighter
monetary conditions, strengthened financial supervision, and improved bank resolution and crisis
prevention frameworks.
Directors considered that a more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation anchored around a
nonmining deficit target of no more than 5 percent of GDP would help strengthen the external
position and reduce public debt. While welcoming recent progress in fiscal consolidation,
Directors stressed the need to ensure steady consolidation into the medium term and create space
for well-targeted social and capital spending and possible banking sector contingent liabilities. In
this regard, they recommended further revenue mobilization, the rationalization of current and
off-budget capital expenditures, and containing public sector employee compensation, including
by accelerating civil service reform. Directors also encouraged enhanced fiscal transparency and
strengthened public financial management, including the elimination of fiscal arrears.
Directors recommended letting the exchange rate move more flexibly within the official band,
supported by the tightening of kip liquidity, with interventions limited to preventing excessive
exchange rate volatility. They noted that this approach would avoid a potentially destabilizing
devaluation, given the risk from currency mismatches; help contain inflation; and support
interbank market functioning.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors welcomed measures to improve foreign currency liquidity at banks, but noted
increasing financial stability concerns from growing credit impairment and undercapitalization at
state-owned banks. They recommended prompt recognition of nonperforming loans, the phasing
out of regulatory forbearance, strengthening supervisory and lending practices, and recapitalizing
state-owned banks to help safeguard macro-financial stability. Technical and capacity-building
assistance from the Fund would be helpful in this regard. Directors welcomed the passage of the
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) law, and advised
full implementation of the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force.
Directors emphasized the need for more resources to enhance the quality, availability, coverage,
and publication of economic and financial data, and encouraged the authorities to request further
Fund technical assistance in this regard.
Directors welcomed progress on product and labor market openness and gains in poverty
reduction. To support more inclusive and broad-based growth, they recommended further trade
integration and improvements in education and health infrastructure. Directors noted that the
benefits of financial deepening and financial access by small and medium-sized enterprises could
be enhanced through the adoption of a clear and unified accounting framework; strengthened
creditors’ rights, credit analysis, and financial transparency; and implementation of an effective
debt resolution process.

Statement by Mr. Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Lao P.D.R. and
Mr. Ram Kharel, Advisor to Executive Director
January 14, 2015
Background
1.

On behalf of the Lao authorities, we would like to thank the mission team for the
constructive policy discussions and invaluable advices provided during the 2014 Article
IV consultation. As the country’s seventh five-year National Social and Economic
Development Plan (7th NSEDP, 2011-15) will end this year, the policy discussion
remains extremely useful not only to strengthen macroeconomic stability, but also to
frame a new plan so as to overcome remaining obstacles to achieve the 2015 MDG
targets and graduate the country from the LDC status by 2020 (Vision 2020).

2.

The staff appreciates the authorities’ effort of maintaining strong growth over the years
while preserving macroeconomic stability. They also outline economic challenges and
risks facing the country and the appropriate policy measures to be considered in the
report. Our authorities broadly agree with the major thrust of the staff’s appraisal
contained in the report and will thoughtfully consider the recommendations therein. In
general, they remain committed to pursue structural reforms and enhance business
environment so as to foster private and foreign investments. They are also mindful that
the broad-based and inclusive growth underpinned by domestic and external
macroeconomic stability play important roles in raising general living standards,
achieving further progress in poverty reduction and meeting the MDG goals.

Recent Economic Development and Outlook
3.

Despite the weaker global growth and external uncertainties, Lao PDR has been able to
maintain strong growth since a decade on the back of flourishing mining sector and
hydropower projects, attracting large foreign investment inflows. Economic growth,
however, has slightly moderated to 7.8 percent in FY 2014, from 8.0 percent in 2013
and 7.9 percent in 2012 on the account of weakening mining sector due mainly to
moratorium of new mining projects coupled with declining global metal prices. Fiscal
consolidation policies, together with tightening credit expansion, have played important
roles to moderate growth in 2014.

4.

The economic growth in 2015 is projected at 7.5 percent on the account of increasing
industrial and service sector by 9.0 percent and agriculture by 3.0 percent, closed to the
staff’s projection of 7.2 percent. On the other hand, the CPI inflation had been under
control at 2.8 percent in November 2014 from 6.6 percent a year ago, largely due to
weaker food and fuel prices momentum. It is expected to moderate at 5.6 percent in 2015.

5.

Fiscal consolidation remained a priority in 2014 given stress in foreign exchange reserves
and rising public debts. As such, budget deficit declined to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014
from 5.6 percent of GDP a year ago given the authorities effort of maintain public

2
spending close to the target and strengthening public revenue. They plan to maintain the
budget deficit around at 4.7 percent of GDP in 2015 by mainly containing recurrent
expenditure, stepping up efforts in improving tax administration and strengthening public
financial management system.
6.

Given the BOL’s prudent monetary policy with foreign exchange market intervention
when necessary, the exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years. As such,
the Kip has appreciated only by 3.5 percent in nominal effective term and 5.0 percent in
real term in 2014 compared to that a year ago. The authorities confirm that the
appreciation is broadly in line with the movement of regional currencies and remains
flexible within the target band. They have also carefully monitored and observed the
phenomenon in the parallel exchange market, which has been traded at a premium over
the Bank of the Lao PDR’s reference rate since August 2013.

7.

Because of authorities’ focus on strengthening export together with moderating import
growth due to slow down in bank credits, the current account deficit has been gradually
decreased from 30.2 percent since 2012. It is expected to come down to 25 percent of
GDP in 2014 and further to 21.3 percent of GDP in 2015 respectively. It will help to
strengthen the foreign exchange reserve to a more comfortable level in the medium term.

8.

The authorities reiterate their commitment to pursue structural reform and attract quality
foreign investments in order to drive sustainable development and more diversified
economy. In conjunction with this effort, the government has suspended temporarily
new land concessions for gold and copper mining projects until the review and
evaluation of the existing projects are completed. Such assessment will ensure
compliance with regulations and maximize its benefit to meet socio-economic
development objectives.

9.

The authorities share staff’s views that several emerging challenges could pose
downside risks to the economic outlook, and put macroeconomic and financial stability
in the high priority agenda going forward. They generally agree that policy tightening
may be warranted to address potential pressures on the external position. To this end, the
authorities will stay vigilant on any possible external shocks and stand ready to respond
as appropriate.

Fiscal Policy
10. The Lao authorities recognize the importance of fiscal prudence and concur that fiscal
consolidation is crucial for preserving macroeconomic stability and public debt
sustainability. They are mindful that steps to rebuild fiscal buffers are needed to ensure
fiscal sustainability. In this regard, they have adopted expenditure rationalizing measures
together with introducing a series of other fiscal measures to address fiscal challenges,
initiated by amending value-added tax and accounting laws, revising customs and
budget laws, and related rules and regulations.

3
11. On the expenditure side, curtaining the recurrent expenditure and fostering capital and
social expenditure remain key priorities of the authorities. In this regard and given
higher rise in wages and salaries than expected in late 2013, they have suspended wage
rise in civil services that was initiated earlier and also set quota for new recruitment in
public services. They have constituted a high level committee to quantify and resolve
arrears and debts related to public infrastructure projects so as to streamlining expenses.
12. On the public investments, the government has streamlined expenditures by avoiding
low-priority current expenditures and restrained state infrastructure development
projects that are commissioned by local governments, financed by private contractors
and repaid by the government upon completion of the projects. The authorities are in the
process of reviewing procurement procedures and strengthen project management
regulations according to the State Investment Law.
13. On revenue front, the authorities are in the process of mapping out strategies to intensify
its revenue collection and widen tax base. Revenue collection has been strengthened by
enforcing compliance with investment promotion law regarding tax and duty exemption
and VAT deductibles, as well as focusing on large taxpayers and taxes on vehicles,
petrol and luxury goods.
14. Over the medium-term, the authorities recognize that challenges remain in securing a
more sustainable revenue stream especially from non-resource sectors and enhancing the
capacity on public financial management. In this regard, they have undertaken sizable
investments to upgrade technology in the tax offices and enhance staff’s capabilities so
as to strengthen revenue mobilization. They have also recently changed valuation
method for automobile, fuel imports and luxury goods from reference price system to an
actual transaction price system which, together with effective tax surveillance, is
expected to enhance revenue mobilization going forward.
15. The authorities are committed to keep public debt on a sustainable path and target to
reduce level of external debts to be less vulnerable to external shocks. The Debt
Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) have been rolled out to enhance
public debt data recording and strengthen debt management capacity. The Presidential
Decree Law on Public Debt Management is also expected to be approved by the Lao
National Assembly.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
16. The BOL aims to attain the price and exchange rate stability with setting annual target
band for the exchange rates and the reference rates for commercial banks. In doing so,
the BOL aims to limit currency fluctuations vis-à-vis major currencies within
±5.0 percent per annum. Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required
to maintain their buying and selling rates within ±0.25 percent of the BOL’s daily
reference rates for US dollar, within ±0.5 percent for Euro and Thai Baht and within
±2.0 percent for other currencies.

4
17. The authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the BOL’s commitment to keep the
exchange rates within a reasonably wide and adjustable band has provided an anchor for
macro-financial stability. However, they are cautious with the staff’s recommendation to
tighten monetary conditions given slowdown in credit growth from 34.5 percent of GDP
in 2013 to 15.7 percent in 2014 with having relatively low level of inflation.
18. Realizing the importance of safeguards against external uncertainties, the BOL has
continued stepping up their efforts to strengthen international reserves. Measures that
have been implemented include suspension of foreign currency lending to local
governments and state-owned enterprises since last few years, collecting outstanding
loans, and intensifying enforcement of foreign currency related regulations. In addition,
the authorities are taking steps to enhance the mechanism for regulating foreign exchange
transactions to be able to monitor daily trading activities in a more real-time basis.
19. As the current account deficit has been reducing gradually since 2012, the authorities are
optimistic in maintaining adequate foreign exchange reserves to cover imports at least
for 5 months by the end of 2015. While actual data is not comprehensive, the authorities
urge staff to be cautious in using trading partners’ export data as proxy for Laos’ import,
as a significant part of the unrecorded import content is re-exported to other countries.
That said, the authorities agreed that there could be scope for exploring the discrepancy
in the measurement of imports and enhancing the authorities’ data collection system.
Financial Sector
20. Banking sector in Lao PDR remains sound with strong capital base, ample liquidity,
andlow level of NPLs. While the credit growth has significantly slowed down in 2014,
the BOL is aware of potential risks from rapid credit growth in the past, thus has
tightened prudential regulation for banks to closely monitor credit quality and to ensure
good quality underwriting standard, especially for banks with NPL ratio of more than
3%. Regulations to control single lending limits to mitigate concentration risk and
prohibit connected lending to shareholders, directors and subsidiaries have also been
issued.
21. The authorities are in the process of adopting Basel II capital standard with
technicalsupport from the WB and the Bank of Thailand. In this context, supervisory
capacity and regulatory framework are being strengthened to preserve a safe and sound
banking system. These efforts along with ongoing enhancement of the regulatory
framework under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework will help to improve
banking capacity and enhance financial stability. More importantly, the AML/CFT law
has recently been approved by the National Assembly, which has helped to enable
business environment and strengthened public confidence in the banking system.
22. Improving money and capital market remain priority to strengthen transmission
mechanism of monetary policy. In this context, our authorities are in the process of
creating FX trading monitoring system, promoting active interbank market, and
strengthening financial market. They have introduced End of Day Liquidity Management

5
Program (EoDLMP) since May 2014 so as to ensure adequate liquidity in the banking
system. Introducing regulations related to the derivative markets are underway.
23. Taking into account of the growing numbers of banking institutions with limited
regulatory and supervisory capacity at the BOL, the authorities have temporarily
suspended new licenses to private banks until 2016, when the overall performance
assessments of the banking sector and craft new licensing policy are completed.
Structural Reform
24. The authorities have made significant progress on structural reforms in recent years
where several laws and regulations including those related to AML/CFT, import
licensing, custom valuation, investment, technical barriers to trade, as well as
intellectual property right have been enacted. The authorities also continue their efforts
in simplifying business start-up procedures, notably with the establishment of a one-stop
shop to coordinate the application for foreign investment in the country. Electronic data
interchange system has been modernized to better facilitate cross-border trades. Our
authorities believe that these initiatives will create conducive business climate to more
broad-based and inclusive growth.
25. Lao authorities are paying attention to strengthen macroeconomic and financial sector
statistics for conducting economic surveillance to formulating appropriate and timely
policy responses. Efforts have been made to improve the compliance with international
guidelines in official statistics and the reporting system. In this regard, the authorities
welcome the Fund’s technical assistance to enhance statistical capacity going forward.
Conclusion
26. With the most successful implementation of the 7th national socio-economic plan, our
authorities are in the process of crafting new plan to address the remaining bottlenecks
in achieving LDC graduation by 2020. The authorities are, however, aware of many
challenges ahead and intend to gear up the efforts to embark from the LDC by
enhancing business environment, improving efficiency of public services, and reforming
public financial management. They also intend to build up necessary fiscal and
monetary policy space as well as strengthen banking regulatory and supervisory
framework together with enhancing access to financial services.
27. Finally, our authorities welcome constructive policy dialogue with the mission team and
wish to thank the Mission Chief, Mr. Ahuja, and his team for the comprehensive reports
and useful policy suggestions. On behalf of the authorities, let me also express high
appreciation to the Fund for their continuing support to the authorities.
