STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Singapore economy had a stellar performance following the global crisis,
but now faces a less supportive external environment and vexing domestic challenges:
growth is slowing on weak external demand; inflation remains elevated amid low
global interest rates and buoyant asset prices and labor costs; labor productivity has
slowed; and income inequality is rising.
Outlook and risks. Against tepid world demand, domestic growth is expected to
weaken in 2012 and recover just modestly in 2013, while inflation will remain around
4½ percent. Significant downside risks from shocks abroad would hit growth through
trade and financial channels. However, Singapore has ample buffers and policy room to
dampen the impact.
Impact of government’s productivity push. The authorities expect slower foreign
worker inflows and inducements for technology upgrading and training to generate
higher real wages and faster medium-term productivity growth. In the near term,
potential growth will slow, and frictional unemployment and inflation will increase.
Contain inflation expectations. Inflation should be permitted to increase temporarily
to accommodate relative price changes from the structurally tighter labor market. To
anchor expectations, the current restrictive monetary and fiscal policy stance should
continue to be supported by macroprudential measures to contain asset prices.
Financial sector risks. Sizable capital and liquidity buffers and proactive prudential
oversight underpin financial sector strength. However, continued vigilance is needed
over funding risks from European bank deleveraging; currency and maturity risks from
rapid local bank expansion into Asia; and risks from high exposure to real estate.
External sector assessment. Singapore’s external position is stronger than warranted
by fundamentals. Tighter foreign worker inflows and increased public spending on
infrastructure and social safety nets, along with rapid population aging and appropriate
adjustments in other countries, should help narrow the large current account surplus.

BACKGROUND
A. The economy has fared well in the post-Lehman period
1.

Following a drop of 9 percent during 2008-early 2009, output recovered strongly. In

Q1:2012, GDP stood about 18 percent above the pre-crisis level. Reflecting its role as host to
numerous export-oriented hi-tech multinationals—and consistent with its ranking among the
globally most-competitive countries—Singapore’s recovery was initially led by net exports.1 More
recently, as world demand began to slow, causing Singapore’s growth to also moderate, fixed
investment has been the main driver. Nonetheless, growth averaged nearly 10 percent
during 2010−11 and resident unemployment is at an historic low of 3 percent.
2.

Despite frequent bouts of global volatility, Singapore’s large financial sector has

remained resilient. The banking system—centerpiece of the large financial sector that serves as a
regional center and has strong links to global markets—is large at nearly seven times GDP by assets.
The financial sector contributes about 12 percent to annual GDP. Global reallocation of financial
flows to Asia since the onset of the financial crisis, the relative resilience of Singapore’s financial
institutions during the crisis, as well as robust domestic and regional economies have propelled the
sector. Notwithstanding rapid credit growth in recent years, financial soundness indicators for the
big 3 domestic banks (about one third of the sector by assets) remain strong, with high capital
adequacy and earnings ratios, and all three banks carry high investment ratings.
3.

Household and corporate sector balance sheets are robust. Households’ net asset

positions are buttressed by a high saving rate, reflecting in part mandatory contributions to the
Central Provident Fund (CPF) and large housing wealth (accounting for about 50 percent of total
household assets at current prices). And while gross debt rose quickly in 2011, ratios of aggregate
household debt to assets and to GDP remain low at 15¼ percent and 70 percent, respectively, and
below their holdings of cash and deposits.2 Corporate balance sheets are also strong, with the
overall leverage ratio for publicly-listed firms around 30 percent. Moreover, simulations by the
authorities indicate earnings would exceed interest payments even if interest rates were to rise by
300 bps.3
1

Singapore ranks second on the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s 2011−12 Global Competitiveness Index.

Information on the distribution of assets and liabilities across households is not available.

Based on earnings before interest and taxes. Interest cover is especially high in the property sector, despite its

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

These favorable outcomes are due in no small measure to an entrenched framework of

prudent macroeconomic and financial policies. This includes persistent fiscal surpluses and a
large stock of public sector external assets,4 a track record of low inflation under an exchange rate
based monetary policy, and proactive and comprehensive oversight of the financial sector. Sound
policies, combined with political stability and an effective rule of law, have made Singapore a safe
haven for regional and international investors. However, if excessive, these flows could bring their
own policy complications.

B. However, new challenges have emerged
5.

House price and consumer price inflation have risen in recent years. Demand for

housing by locals and foreigners has been buoyed by negative real interest rates and Singapore’s
status as a regional safe haven. As a result, prices of private houses have risen by a cumulative
55 percent since the 2009 trough, although they recently leveled off in response to the authorities’
policy measures and weaker sentiment throughout the region. Headline inflation at the consumer
level has ratcheted up from less than 2 percent prior to the global financial crisis to around
5 percent since mid 2011 (Box 1), on large contributions from imputed rent on owner˗occupied
housing (fueled in turn by rising house prices) and steep increases in the cost of vehicle ownership
permits (COEs) on tight supply. But core inflation (which excludes accommodation and private
transport costs), has also picked up, pointing to broader-based price pressures that are likely due to
rising unit labor costs and pass-through of higher business costs for transport and real estate.5
6.

The previous growth model has been difficult to maintain. Singapore’s economy has

long relied on very large inflows of foreign workers, allowing rapid labor force growth despite slow
growth of the domestic working-age population (Box 2). While this fueled strong economic growth,
it also contributed to congestion, strains on public services and infrastructure, and slow overall
growth of factor productivity.6

4

Government outstanding gross debt of about 100 percent of GDP is issued to develop local-currency capital markets
and to provide an investment vehicle for the CPF, the mandatory defined-contribution saving scheme. Gross assets
are larger than gross debt.
5

Consistent with this, increases in nontradable prices (notably for education and healthcare services) have also
accelerated.

6

This is especially the case in labor-intensive sectors such as construction and food and beverage. This is also
consistent with the WEF’s assessment that Singapore should do more to encourage adoption of the latest
technologies and enhance the sophistication of its companies.

Box 1. Singapore: A Long View of Real Exchange Rate and Inflation Trends
Despite a doubling of Singapore’s NEER since the
early 1980s, and the fact that the CPI-based real
effective exchange rate (REER) shares a similar
low-frequency cycle, the REER has appreciated by
only 20 percentage points on a cumulative basis
over the period. This modest real appreciation
contrasts with the predictions of the
Balassa˗Samuelson hypothesis that suggests that
countries with large productivity gains in the
tradable sector (relative to the nontradable sector
and partners) should expect large increases in
their CPI-based REER.
The very limited real appreciation reflects
consistently-lower inflation in Singapore than in
all its trading partners and competitors, with the
exception of Japan.
Following a 20 percent increase since 2005, the
REER is approaching its previous historical peak,
seen in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.
This increase reflects a faster pace of NEER
appreciation and higher inflation in Singapore
than in most other countries.

7.

As in many countries, income inequality has risen. At more than US$50,000 in 2011,

average per capita income is high. However, income dispersion is wide. According to Boston
Consulting Group, Singapore has the highest proportion of households (15½ percent in 2010) with
US$1 million or more in liquid assets. On the other hand, incomes of the lowest decile of households
stagnated during the previous decade. As a result, the Gini coefficient rose rapidly in the early part
of the 2000s. While it has moderated recently and is somewhat lower once net government benefits
and employers’ CPF contributions are included, it remains among the highest in Asia. Singapore’s
high degree of openness to trade and labor flows in the context of skill-biased technological

Box 2. Singapore: Macroeconomic Implications of Reliance on Foreign Workers
Background. To overcome domestic constraints on labor supply, Singapore has relied on large inflows of nonresident foreign
workers (NRFWs), who now account for about one-third of the labor force (including highly-skilled permanent residents, the
share rises to 40 percent). This is one of the highest shares in the world, with the exception of the Gulf countries. As a result,
and despite slow growth of the local working-age population, Singapore’s total labor force was among the fastest-growing in
Asia during the past decade. NRFWs are regulated through a system of levies and quotas (dependency ratio ceilings)
differentiated by skill level and sector of activity, with less-skilled workers subject to higher levies and stricter rules. As a share
of employment, NRFWs have a very large presence in manufacturing and construction, but in absolute numbers, their
presence is greatest in services (nearly half the total number, and thought to be predominantly in hospitality, domestic
service, and retail).

Macroeconomic Implications.



Low productivity. The contribution of total factor productivity to GDP growth declined steadily during the previous two
decades, while labor’s contribution to growth increased
sharply. This may reflect that the large number of lessskilled workers obviated the need for efficiency-enhancing
technologies and practices.



Expand the wage distribution. International competition for
highly-educated professionals has aligned wages for
foreigners and locals at the top-end of the income scale
with those in other advanced economies. Meanwhile,
recourse to the deep pool of less-skilled workers within
Asia is thought to have pulled down the lower-end of
Singapore’s wage distribution toward levels prevailing in
source countries. Also, given the very large pool of lessskilled workers, the supply of this type of labor in
Singapore is likely to be highly elastic, suggesting that wages for workers in these segments may not be very responsive to
domestic conditions.



Subdue inflation and real appreciation. Absorption of large numbers of less-skilled FWs in the nontradable sector restrained
real unit labor costs, despite sizable wage increases in tradable sectors accompanied by large productivity gains. As a result,
the path of the CPI-based real exchange rate was dampened.

change may have contributed to rising income inequality through a skill premium.7 Growing
inequality, and rising living costs and house prices were prominent issues during the May 2011
general election campaign, which saw the governing People’s Action Party securing its lowest-ever
share of the popular vote (60 percent).

NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Balance sheet repair in advanced economies and lingering risk aversion are contributing to a subdued
growth baseline, and downside risks are elevated.
8.

Against the baseline of tepid global demand, the Singapore economy is projected to

slow in 2012. Following a strong outturn in Q1:2012 (10 percent, q/q s.a.a.r.), reflecting global
restocking and recovery from regional supply disruptions, Singapore’s high-frequency indicators
have since moderated sharply, alongside weakening global activity and resurgent financial strains.
Consistent with the current WEO baseline of temperate global demand during the remainder
of 2012 and in 2013, domestic demand is projected to be the primary near-term driver of
Singapore’s growth, underpinned by low unemployment and negative real interest rates. As a result,
staff projects annual growth to slip from about 5 percent in 2011 to just below 3 percent in 2012,
and to pick up modestly to near 3½ percent in 2013. The current account surplus is expected to
narrow slightly, to about 21 percent of GDP, as weaker net exports are largely offset by better terms
of trade.
9.

Under this baseline, consumer price inflation is projected to remain elevated. Core

inflation will be fueled by wage pressures from more limited inflows of foreign workers (staff’s
baseline incorporates the effects of the authorities’ policies in this area) amid a modestly positive
output gap and an already tight labor market. Moreover, persistent increases in imputed rent8 and a
limited number of car permits available for auction will continue to pressure headline inflation. Staff
projects inflation to average 4½ percent in 2012 (slightly down from the highs of 2011, largely on
base effects), and remain broadly unchanged in 2013, with core around 3−3½ percent in both years.

7

See “Growing Inequality in OECD Countries: What Drives It and How Can Policy Tackle It?,” OECD (2011) for a
discussion of the factors that have contributed to the global rise in inequality.
8

While house price increases have recently eased, the impact on inflation will be lagged as imputed rent is based on
existing rental contracts, which are renewed on a rolling basis.

SINGAPORE

With several economic flashpoints abroad now looming, downside risks for the

Singapore economy are large (Appendix I). With trade in goods and services more than three
times GDP, activity is very sensitive to cycles in world demand and swings in global sentiment. While
severe global financial stress would trigger outflows from Singapore, a more contained event could
conceivably induce safe-haven inflows into Singapore, cushioning the impact on growth, but
possibly at the cost of reigniting domestic credit growth and real-estate prices. On the other hand,
the trade channel would be unambiguously negative. Therefore, despite minimal direct exposure to
peripheral euro area assets and little reliance on funding from euro area banks, an extreme euro
event could impact Singapore on a scale similar to the Lehman episode. A combination of downside
scenarios (significant escalation of the euro crisis, sharp slowdown in emerging markets, including
China, and the U.S. fiscal cliff) remains an extreme—but plausible—tail risk for Singapore.
Authorities’ Views
11.

The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s views on the near-term outlook. In light

of the strong expansion in the first quarter of 2012, they expected growth for the year to come in at
1−3 percent. This would be underpinned on the supply side by robust expansion of services with a
domestic or regional orientation (including tourism and finance), while manufacturing activity would
be more sluggish. The authorities expect core inflation to remain elevated, with tight resource
constraints pushing up prices, particularly in labor-intensive services, and with headline inflation also
fueled by persistent increases in private transport and accommodation costs. For 2012, they are
projecting headline inflation to be within 3½−4½ percent, with core inflation in the range of
2½−3 percent.
12.

The authorities consider developments in Europe the main risk to the outlook.

Because the situation in the euro area has unfolded gradually, they noted that market participants
have had time to build buffers and reduce positions, with the result that the global credit crunch
would unlikely be as severe as in late 2008-early 2009. While seen as a low probability event, the
authorities consider a protracted period of depressed growth as most worrisome. A sharp slowdown
in China would also be problematic through trade and tourism channels, but the authorities view a
soft landing as their base case.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MACROECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE
AUTHORITIES' PRODUCTIVITY PUSH
In 2010, the government initiated a program to reinvigorate labor productivity, which had grown
much more slowly during 2000−10 than in previous decades.
13.

Productivity strategy. The 2010 report by the Economic Strategies Committee identified

growth through skills and innovation as the most suitable approach to deliver sustainable and
inclusive economic development. Implementing this strategy entails the following elements:


Managing the dependence on foreign workers. Since 2010, the authorities have raised in a
series of steps the levies firms pay on their nonresident foreign workers. In addition, the 2012
Budget lowered the ceiling on the share of nonresident foreign workers permitted in each firm
(“dependency ratio”).9 Firms have until June 2014 to comply with these new quotas for their
existing foreign workers, but are not allowed to bring in additional foreign workers beyond the
new ceilings from July 2012. This tightening will affect mostly low-skilled foreigners and small,
labor-intensive firms. The levies and quotas are intended to bring the growth rate of foreign
workers into line with the much slower increase in the resident labor force, keeping the
economy-wide foreign worker share around the current one third. While higher levies appear
not to have dampened demand for foreign workers,10 the authorities expect that lowering
quotas will be more effective. They also anticipate that the resulting tighter labor market will
raise real wages and that, in turn, will support productivity gains by encouraging investment in
physical and human capital, as well as other labor-saving techniques.



Complementary policies. Numerous supporting programs have been adopted to incentivize
companies—especially SMEs—to upgrade technology and employees’ skills, and to encourage
workers to seek additional training. These include rebates and tax relief for firms for purchasing
productivity-enhancing capital goods and for various skill-upgrading programs, and subsidies
and/or stipends for workers participating in numerous government-organized specialized
training programs targeting the employed and the unemployed.

9

The dependency ratio was reduced from 65 percent to 60 percent for manufacturing firms and from 50 percent to
45 percent for service-sector firms.

10

This may reflect that levies were insufficiently high to offset the cost advantage for employers of not having to
contribute, in the case of foreign employees, to the Central Provident Fund (CPF, Singapore’s mandatory
defined˗contribution pension scheme). Also, to the extent that employers have monopsony power, at least part of
the levies could be passed on to workers in the form of lower net wages, thereby mitigating the impact on
employment costs.

Amid a tight labor market, these policies will have wide-ranging macroeconomic

effects. Achieving the anticipated productivity gains will be critical to the long-term success of the
strategy; however, these gains may not fully offset the effect on potential growth from the muchslower labor force expansion under the new policy. The timing of the productivity gains will also be
key, with important macroeconomic effects taking place during the transition:
During the transition, real and nominal wages—especially for lower-skilled employees—will rise



as the rate of increase in the labor supply is curtailed. With productivity gains occurring only
with a lag, potential growth will be scaled down and unit labor costs will increase. Therefore, the
output gap will be larger than otherwise and, despite weak aggregate demand, core inflation will
remain elevated.11 The current account surplus will narrow as higher wages and prices of
domestic goods raise demand for imports and weaken demand for exports.
Over the longer term, higher real wages and policies to support training, automation, and



efficiency can be expected to boost capital accumulation and total factor productivity. This will
lead to some recovery in potential growth (although it is likely to remain below the level
achieved under the previous labor-intensive growth model) and moderation of unit labor costs.
Thus, the output gap will narrow and core inflation will subside. Nonetheless, compared with the
counterfactual where the labor force continues to grow rapidly, the level of the real exchange
rate will be permanently more appreciated, helping to narrow the current account surplus.12
15.

Policies should aim to contain the costs of transitioning to the new growth model.
Only a modest number of firms and workers are likely to be directly impacted by the tighter
quotas on foreign workers. However, owing to the resulting increase in wages, the effects will be
felt more broadly, with an increase in frictional unemployment as firms with relatively more
elastic demand for labor shed workers to firms whose labor demand is less elastic. The size and
duration of frictional unemployment will depend on how much wages increase (which will tend
to be larger when unemployment is low, as at present), the efficiency of job search by laid˗off
workers, and how quickly productivity gains are achieved.

11

However, headline inflation moderates in the near term on slowing real estate price growth.

12

Because most foreign workers are treated as residents for balance of payments purposes, their compensation is
not recorded in the primary income balance of the current account. Only money they remit abroad is it recorded (as
a transfer outflow in the secondary income account). Despite the large share of foreign workers in the labor force,
related current account outflows were a modest 4.7 percent of GDP in 2011. With the share of foreign workers to be
kept broadly constant under the new policy, the sum of income and transfers is forecast to moderate by only
0.2 percentage points of GDP (to 4.5 percent of GDP) by 2015, and to stabilize at that level thereafter.

Provided they are well targeted, the authorities’ complementary measures promoting upgrading
of skills and technology will facilitate firms’ and workers’ adjustment to the higher wage setting.
Consideration could also be given to introducing a modest, means-tested and publicly-funded
unemployment protection scheme, with benefits ideally linked to job search and/or training. This
would enhance efficiency by encouraging workers to seek alternative employment better suited
to their skill set, while also limiting the social cost of transitioning to the new growth model.
Introducing a publicly-funded pension system for the elderly poor would help cushion the social
impact on older workers laid off in the restructuring.

Authorities’ Views
16.

The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of the economic effects and

transition costs of the new growth model. Slowing the intake of foreign workers was seen as
necessary to alleviate overcrowding and consistent with the focus on productivity-driven growth,
which will concurrently support sustainable wage growth, in particular for lower-income
Singaporeans. This is also expected to better align the skills of labor force entrants with Singapore’s
innovation-based economy. They noted the sizable productivity gap relative to other advanced
economies, especially in the labor-intensive sectors. Closing this gap over a decade was seen as
delivering productivity growth of 2−3 percent per year, significantly higher than the rate of the
previous decade. While slower labor force growth would dampen potential GDP growth to
3−5 percent, productivity improvements would contribute a larger proportion of GDP growth and
support wage growth.
17.

The authorities have put in place measures to help companies and workers adjust, as

well as to mitigate transition costs, and are prepared to consider further measures if
necessary; however, they are not in favor of institutionalizing publicly-funded unemployment
and old-age pension benefits, as called for by staff. The authorities instead emphasize education,
skills upgrading, and job creation to ensure that the number of unemployed workers remains low,
thereby preserving resources for helping unemployed workers train and find jobs quickly. As for
old˗age pension benefits, the authorities highlighted that the Workfare Income Supplement
bolstered pension savings, while existing policies to promote home ownership and encourage the

elderly to move into smaller homes so as to monetize part of their housing assets provides an
additional nest-egg in retirement. There are also schemes to provide additional financial assistance
to unemployed workers and the elderly, but these are not granted automatically and must be
applied for. The authorities thus see their approach as one that targets resources where they are
most needed and provides assistance in a manner that avoids reliance.

SAFEGUARDING MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
STABILITY AMID ABUNDANT REGIONAL LIQUIDITY
A. Macroeconomic Policies
Macro policies confront the challenge of containing inflation expectations while accommodating the
authorities’ productivity push against a backdrop of loose international monetary conditions.
18.

Context. A restrictive policy stance is appropriate during the next few years under the

baseline scenario of a positive output gap. However, some temporary increase in core inflation
should be allowed to accommodate the increase in relative prices (in the context of downward price
rigidity) coming from the tighter foreign worker policy in order to signal resource scarcity and
stimulate behavioral shifts.13 Nonetheless, given the risk of second round effects through
entrenchment of higher inflation expectations, it is essential that other sources of inflation, including
from real estate and transport costs, be forcefully tackled through macroprudential policy and more
predictable supply of housing and car permits in order to limit speculative behavior. In the near
term, fiscal policy should contribute to the restrictive policy stance in order to ease the burden on
monetary policy in the context of ample global liquidity.

13

If, on the other hand, inflation was not permitted to rise in response to the labor supply shock and at a time of
broad-based price pressures and tight factor markets, this would require compressing aggregate demand below the
now-lower level of potential output. The permissible increase in core inflation (relative to the counterfactual of no
change in the foreign worker policy) depends on the marginal contribution of unit labor cost increases to inflation in
the absence of an offsetting monetary policy response.

Monetary policy. The authorities’ April 2012 decision to tighten by modestly increasing the

pace of NEER appreciation (to around 2.5−3 percent per annum) and narrowing the band reverses
the loosening introduced at the time of the global financial turmoil of late 2011 (Box 3).14 In view of
the subdued outlook for demand, and despite the tighter labor supply conditions that will restrict
potential output, this policy stance is sufficient to keep the output gap contained while limiting
second round inflation effects. However, upside risks to inflation will remain in a setting of loose
global monetary conditions and domestic supply constraints on housing and car permits. Calibrating
monetary policy would be more challenging if tightening (through faster appreciation) were to
attract additional yield-seeking inflows that fuel asset prices and subsequently spill over to
generalized inflation.15 The authorities’ approach of complementing monetary policy with
macroprudential tools is therefore appropriate, and consideration should also be given to more
active use of liquidity-absorbing instruments.
20.

Fiscal policy. The FY 2012 Budget appropriately entails a slightly restrictive fiscal stance (a

negative impulse of ⅓ percent of GDP). In addition, the Budget contains several new spending
initiatives in support of the authorities’ productivity push and to strengthen the social safety net for
the poor (including new permanent income support payments and expanded subsidies for
healthcare and education). Over the medium term, a permanently looser structural fiscal stance is
warranted to help narrow the current account surplus and to accommodate further expansion of the
social safety net to reduce inequality. Some increase in spending will come endogenously as rapid
population aging raises demand for public spending. The government’s intention to increase
spending over the medium term is therefore a positive step, provided it is not offset by higher
structural operating revenue.16

14

With the exchange rate close to the middle of the band (and still weaker than in August 2011), the decision did not
immediately impact the exchange rate. However, relative to the counterfactual, a steeper slope—combined with the
narrower band—implies a more appreciated future exchange rate path.

15

Monetary tightening is more likely to lead to additional inflows when: (i) the tightening is not synchronized with
other countries in the region; and (ii) (as is currently the case) when nominal interest rates are very close to the zero
bound, thereby limiting scope for the uncovered interest rate parity-implied decline in the nominal interest rate.
16

Given the tendency to run budget surpluses (based on standard fiscal accounting conventions), there is room to
increase spending without raising taxes while still adhering to the fiscal rule that requires avoiding a cumulative
deficit over the term of any one government.

Box 3. Singapore’s Monetary Policy Framework
Features. Since 1981, monetary policy has focused on managing the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) using a
basket-band-crawl (BBC) approach, with the primary objective of “maintaining price stability conducive to sustainable
growth of the economy.” The key parameters of the framework—none of which are publicly disclosed—are: (i) the
basket (a trade-weighted set of currencies); (ii) the band
width within which the NEER is allowed to fluctuate; and
(iii) the crawl or slope (the rate by which the band’s limits
and mid-point change—typically appreciate—over time).
Policy adjustment. Monetary policy decisions are
typically taken bi-annually, in April and October. However,
off-cycle decisions can be made at any time. Policy
changes are effected by altering the slope, width, and/or
center of the band. For instance, a policy tightening might
entail steepening the slope and/or re-centering the band
in the direction of more appreciation. On the other hand,
widening (narrowing) the band is done to allow more
(less) flexibility in times of heightened volatility (relative
calm). The MAS’s public statement accompanying its policy decision describes in qualitative terms the changes to the
BBC parameters (e.g., increase the pace of appreciation of the band,” “narrow the band,” “re-center the band
upwards”), but the specific magnitudes are not revealed.
Implementation. Exchange rate policy is implemented through sales and purchases of U.S. dollars (US$) in the spot
and forward FX markets. Intervention occurs not only at the edges of the band, but also in the interior, for example, to
reduce exchange rate volatility. Some FX intervention is sterilized through cross-currency swaps (a combination of spot
and forward FX transactions). More generally, the MAS manages S$ liquidity using standing facilities, as well as
collateralized and uncollateralized money market operations (lending/borrowing in the interbank market,
sales/purchases of government paper and MAS bills, and repos/reverse repos).
Benefits. In Singapore’s small and highly-open economy, the exchange rate has a significant influence on inflation and
growth. This occurs through: (i) the direct effect on import prices, and hence near-term inflation; and (ii) changing the
price of domestically-produced goods and services relative to those produced abroad that, in turn, affects domestic
and external demand for products made in Singapore, and hence activity and inflation over the medium term.
Ultimately, the framework should be assessed based on Singapore’s inflation and growth performance: between 1981
and 2008, CPI inflation averaged less than 2 percent (although it has been higher more recently), while real GDP
growth averaged 7 percent. Unemployment has also been
low.
Possible shortcomings. Consistent with the monetary
policy trilemma, in the context of an open capital account,
targeting an exchange rate path implies ceding control of
interest rates. Hence, S$ interest rates are largely
determined by US$ interest rates and investor
expectations of future changes in the Singapore dollar.
Therefore, with US$ LIBOR rates currently close to the
zero bound, short-term S$ interest rates are at historical
lows, and the swap-offer rate (SOR, the cost of
synthetically borrowing S$ by borrowing US$ and
swapping into S$) even turned negative on occasion
in 2011 when the MAS increased the pace of
appreciation. Thus, tightening monetary policy by steepening the slope of the exchange rate band may reduce
domestic interest rates and could stimulate interest-sensitive demand, including for assets.1/ To offset this effect,
macroprudential measures are used to moderate demand for real estate and credit.
________________________________________

Similarly, note that under an interest rate-based monetary policy, tightening by raising the interest rate is expected to lead to faster
subsequent depreciation, thereby mitigating some of the initial tightening brought by the higher interest rate.

Authorities’ Views
21.

The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s views on macroeconomic policies.

They intend to temper—but not fully offset—the inflationary impact of the tighter foreign worker
policy. They concurred that the low global interest rate setting has made policymaking more
challenging and, in response, the MAS has reacted more quickly and decisively to inflation pressures.
Nonetheless, monetary policy decisions remain focused on delivering the desired growth and
inflation combination, and are not subsumed by capital flow considerations, which are managed
with macroprudential tools. However, they noted that the 2010 introduction of short-term MAS bills
was in part motivated by the need to sterilize capital inflows. On fiscal policy, they noted the
Budget’s focus was not on short-term demand management, but on achieving longer-term
structural goals of enhancing productivity growth, reducing transition costs, and strengthening
social safety nets. To complement the numerous initiatives introduced in the 2012 Budget, the
government will be increasing fiscal spending by 1−2 percentage points of GDP over the next five
years (including doubling health expenditure, partly an endogenous response to population aging,
as well as significant increases on education, housing and transport infrastructure). The government
expects to have sufficient revenues to fund the expenditure growth for the next five years, but new
sources of revenue may be needed beyond that.

B. Financial Sector
Despite important strengths in the financial sector, vigilance is warranted to deal with remaining
domestic and cross-border risks. An FSAP Update is scheduled for 2013.

Property market. Real estate prices have stabilized since late 2011 following several rounds

of macroprudential measures and weakening local and regional sentiment (Text Table 1).


The large and variable share of foreign and corporate purchasers of housing indicates the
importance of external factors and capital inflows in the demand for, and prices of, Singapore
real estate (Appendix II). The imposition of additional stamp duty for foreigners and corporates
on the full price of the residential property, and at both buying and selling legs, appears to have
been effective at dampening foreign demand and stabilizing prices, as evidenced by the sharp
drop in foreign buyers so far in 2012, particularly from China. However, a similar trend was also
apparent in Hong Kong SAR, suggesting that external factors were also at play.

Loan-to-value (LtV) ceilings were lowered to 80 percent from 90 percent for all
housing loans provided by banks (including for HDB flats).

February 2010

A seller's stamp duty (SSD) was introduced on private residential properties sold
within one year of purchase at the rate of 1 percent for the first S$180,000,

LtV ceilings were reduced from 80 percent to 70 percent for buyers with at least
one existing mortgaged property..

August 2010

The SSD was extended to sales within three years of purchase, with rates
depending on the holding period (3 percent if sold within one year of purchase, 2
percent within the 2nd year after purchase, and 1 percent within the 3rd year after
purchase).
For buyers with at least one existing mortgaged property, the minimum cash

SINGAPORE

With resident households accounting for the majority of buyers of private and resale public
housing, real estate poses a concentration risk for banks and resident households. Propertyrelated loans account for about 40 percent of total loans of Singapore’s big 3 banks, and half of
household wealth consists of property. While the loan-to-value (LtV) ratio of bank mortgages
averages 42 percent (well below the regulatory limit of 80 percent for first properties and
60 percent for subsequent properties), this reflects in large part the automatic adjustment of
LtVs on the mortgage stock to increases in the house price index but does, nonetheless, provide
banks a sizable buffer in the event of house price declines. Housing affordability—as given by
the debt servicing ratio (DSR) on bank˗provided mortgages—has been supported by
historically˗low interest rates (currently 1⅓−2 percent). However, the recent surge in “shoe box”
apartments may be seen as a way to further increase affordability. Recent stress tests by banks
and the MAS suggest banks are buffered against a spike in interest rates and unemployment.
However, staff expects that mortgage quality is likely to be more vulnerable to a prolonged rise
in unemployment and fall in real wages.



If house prices were to reaccelerate, additional macroprudential measures should be introduced
that target demand at its source. In the case of externally-driven demand, which tends to be
foreign financed, a further temporary increase in stamp duties on businesses’ and foreigners’
real estate purchases and sales could subdue demand. On the other hand, in the case of local
demand that more typically depends on bank credit, household debt to income limits may be
effective. In addition, higher risk weights on mortgage loans, together with dynamic provisioning
of real estate loans or a countercyclical housing-sector capital buffer, would strengthen banks’
resilience to house price volatility.

23.

Regional credit expansion. While lending to residents by the big 3 Singapore banks has

slowed, their foreign-currency loans to borrowers elsewhere in the region, especially China, have
grown rapidly (although it eased in recent months) (Box 4). Most of these external loans are
trade˗finance related, denominated in U.S. dollars (US$), and with a maturity of 6 months or less.
These loans are funded mainly from banks’ ample Singapore dollar (S$) deposit base, which they
swap mainly into US$. As a result, local banks’ non-Singapore dollar loan-to-deposit (LtD) ratio has
increased to about 125 percent. To reduce overreliance on the foreign-currency swap market and
limit duration mismatch, at the urging of the MAS, banks have issued short- and longer-term
US$˗denominated debt in the capital markets. As domestic banks further expand their presence in
regional trade-related finance, this process should continue. While trade finance is typically
collateralized, lending to new markets may entail additional counterparty and settlement risk.

denominated in U.S. dollars.
Drivers. Several factors have motivated this growing
regionalization:



Mature domestic credit market and relatively under-banked
neighbors. Loans to Singapore residents are relatively high at
120 percent of GDP (including HDB mortgage loans), and
net interest margins have been compressed on strong
competition to below 1.9 percentage points, making further
credit penetration of the Singapore market less profitable.
By contrast, other countries in the region (particularly China
and Indonesia) have less-developed credit markets along
with dynamic economies. Greater focus on emerging Asia
also serves as a risk diversification strategy, although
interconnectedness among these economies is rising.



Trade interconnectedness. Growing trade linkages within
ASEAN, and between ASEAN and East Asia (notably China),
has increased demand for trade financing. According to
Fitch Ratings, the recent boom in Singapore banks’
cross˗border lending has been driven by short-term
(typically 180 days), collateralized, U.S. dollar-denominated
trade financing to top-tier and state-owned enterprises in
China.



Singapore banks’ excess liquidity and European bank
deleveraging. Singapore banks hold excess liquidity buffers
of more than 9 percent of qualifying liabilities (equivalent to
S$50 billion), mostly in Singapore dollars. At the same time,
the scaling back by European banks from trade finance
within Asia has provided an opportunity for Singapore banks
and others to increase their market share in the region.

Monetary policy tightening in China. Tighter administrative
limits on loan growth in China during 2010−11 caused credit demand from Chinese corporates to spill over to banks
abroad. In addition, market sources indicate that part of the U.S. dollar˗denominated trade credit activity was a form of
carry trade that provided the borrower a short US$ position secured against an RMB-denominated asset. This allowed
the borrower to benefit from the interest differential and expected appreciation gains on the renmimbi. Changing
economic conditions have recently reduced the attractiveness of this arbitrage play.

Financial sector’s exposure to Europe. Euro area banks’ involvement in Singapore banking

activity (directly, or via the interbank market) is limited, although euro area banks provide 7 percent
of loans to Singapore nonbanks (reduced by half from 2008).17 However, European banks more
broadly—including Swiss and UK banks—play a considerably larger role, primarily in the offshore
segment, where branches of foreign banks are key players. Since the onset of the global financial
crisis, European interbank lending to Singapore offshore banks has increased considerably, but
recent deleveraging pressure has resulted in a nearly 18 percent decline since September 2011. In
the event of renewed euro area turbulence that spills over to other European banks, further
deleveraging from Singapore is possible, even though European banks are likely to want to preserve
their presence in Asia. Going forward, funding conditions at foreign bank branches and at the
consolidated group level will require continued close monitoring and coordination with home
supervisors.
Authorities’ Views
25.

While continuing to closely monitor and respond preemptively to financial sector

developments, the authorities consider that financial sector risks are contained.


The stability of local banks is reinforced by their stable funding base, with nonbank deposits
accounting for 80 percent of total funding. Moreover, local banks are well capitalized and are in
a strong position to meet the Basel III capital requirements. In fact, local banks will be required
to meet these minimum capital requirements by the start of 2013, two years ahead of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision’s timeline.



The authorities noted that real estate exposure for the entire banking system (domestically
oriented and offshore banks) remains stable and low, at 28 percent of loans to nonbanks.
Excluding residential mortgage loans extended for owner-occupied property (representing
about 44 percent of total real estate exposure), which carries a lower risk profile, real estate
exposure of the banking system is about 15 percent of loans to nonbanks. The MAS estimates
that the mortgage DSR would remain in line with international benchmarks at 35−40 percent
even under a severe stress scenario in which interest rates rise above 7 percent. Nonetheless, the
authorities are committed to adopting, if needed, additional measures to promote a stable and
sustainable property market.

17

Euro area exposure accounts for less than 6 percent of Singapore banking system assets (of which the euro
periphery is less than ½ percent of total assets). The euro area supplies about 7½ percent of Singapore banks’ total
funding. However, euro area banks are large players in Singapore’s over-the-counter derivatives market, being
counterparties to 14 percent of contracts (with other European banks accounting for an additional 26 percent).

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE



2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

On credit expansion to the region, the authorities noted this reflects Singapore’s role as an
intermediary in ASEAN-China trade. Banks’ direct exposures are mainly to large, reputable
Singapore or multinational corporates, with credits generally well collateralized. The MAS is
engaging closely with the banks on their management of U.S. dollar liquidity risk.



Regarding risks from European bank deleveraging, the authorities stressed that they continue to
monitor very closely euro area banks and the financial positions of their local branches,
including the level of funding from Head Office and liquidity positions. The MAS has the
authority to impose additional prudential requirements on the foreign banks in Singapore (e.g.,
require branches to maintain assets against their liabilities by an appropriate margin).

C. Policies to Mitigate the Effects of Downside Events
Singapore has large buffers and significant policy room to dampen the immediate and longer˗term
effects of a sharp global slowdown or financial turmoil.
26.

As in 2008−09, the response should focus on preserving the private sector’s economic and

financial infrastructure to facilitate a rapid recovery when demand subsequently resumes, while
providing an adequate social safety net:


The exchange rate-based monetary policy and large stock of reserves provide flexibility. Various
forms of domestic- and foreign-currency liquidity support may be used to reduce financial
market stress.



A structural fiscal loosening should focus on preserving employment and access to credit
(particularly for SMEs), and providing temporary income support to poorer households.



In the event of extreme global financial stress, adequate legal and fiscal scope exists for a broad
set of crisis-management measures to support financial stability.

Authorities’ Views
27.

The authorities reiterated their view, expressed during the previous consultation, that

they have ample policy space and instruments to address the impact of negative shocks. They
noted their response would be carefully tailored and calibrated to the specific unfolding
circumstances, and hence may not necessarily duplicate their 2008−09 measures.

EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
28.

Background. Singapore has consistently run a current account surplus of 20 percent of GDP

or more, reflecting an even-stronger trade balance. In addition, Singapore has a large positive net IIP
position (268 percent of GDP), despite a sizable stock of inward FDI, owing to considerable official
foreign assets held in the form of central bank reserves and in two sovereign wealth funds (Text
table 2). The very large, short-term gross non-FDI liabilities of more than 450 percent of GDP could
nonetheless pose some vulnerability, although this is mitigated by large official reserve holdings
(95 percent of GDP) and other official liquid foreign assets.
29.

Assessment. Singapore is a very small, very open economy that serves as a regional financial

center. The resulting vulnerability to global cycles warrants large reserve buffers to prevent
disruptive adjustments in times of heightened volatility. Indeed, Singapore’s top sovereign
investment rating is predicated in part on its exceptionally strong external finances. Nonetheless,
current levels appear adequate, and there is no clear case for further reserve accumulation for
precautionary purposes. More generally, from a multilateral perspective, the external position
appears overly strong, with the real effective exchange rate around 0−15 percent weaker than
warranted by medium-term fundamentals (including rapid population aging) and desirable
policies.18 In addition to the strength induced by large fiscal deficits in major advanced economies,
the strong external position is driven by structural factors and policies that boost the private and
public saving rates.
30.

Adjustment involves policy changes domestically and abroad. Part of the needed

adjustment could come from fiscal consolidation in advanced economies. In addition, increased
public spending that is not compensated with higher tax revenue, and higher real wages for lower
income segments with higher marginal propensities to consume (as a result of slower inflows of
foreign workers) would help moderate the current account and slow accumulation of foreign assets.
Aging will also contribute to narrowing the current account over the longer run,19 as would a more
even distribution of consumption across generations.

18

This numerical range is based on Fund staff analysis in the Pilot External Sector Report (IMF Policy Paper,
July 2, 2012, http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/070212.pdf), and thus is preliminary.

19

Among a sample of 51 advanced and emerging market economies, Singapore has the highest projected aging
speed, defined as the expected change in the old-age dependency ratio over the next 20 years, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau.

Current account

Background. The sustained large surplus of 20 percent of GDP or more (and around 25 percent of GDP cyclically adjusted)
reflects an even stronger goods balance, that is partially offset by remittance outflows and a negative income balance (with the
latter resulting from income payments on the large stock of inward FDI minus income receipts, including from official-sector
assets held abroad).

The external position appears to be
stronger than what is consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies.

The current account surplus reflects the high rate of private and public sector saving as well as Singapore’s status as a financial
center.

In addition to the strength induced
by large fiscal deficits in major
advanced economies, the strong
external position is driven by
structural factors and policies that
boost the private and public saving
rate.

Assessment. A range of estimates suggest a current account surplus that is stronger than the level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies. While non-standard factors (see real exchange rate assessment below) make a quantitative
assessment of the current account difficult a sizable structural decline (on the order of 4 percent of GDP)1/ appears appropriate.
The cyclically-adjusted balance is expected to moderate over the medium term as aging-related and social spending increase and
plans to slow absorption of foreign workers are implemented.
Real exchange
rate

Background. The 15 percent real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation since 2005 has returned the REER to the level
of 1998.
Assessment. While non-standard factors (Singapore is a very small very open economy that serves as a regional financial center)
make quantitative assessment difficult, the real exchange rate appears around 0-15 percent weaker than warranted by mediumterm fundamentals (including rapid population aging) and desirable policies.1/

Capital account:
flows and
measures

Background. The financial account deficit tends to co-move with the global financial cycle (i.e. outflows are larger when financial
activity is strong). This reflects in part reinvestment abroad of income from the official sector’s foreign assets. Capital flows also
encompass large inward FDI and broadly offsetting foreign borrowing and reinvestment abroad by off-shore banks.
Assessment. The financial account is likely to remain in deficit as long as income from NFA (recorded in the current account) is
reinvested abroad.

FX intervention
and reserves

Overall assessment

Potential policy responses
From a multilateral perspective, and
consistent with the authorities’ plans,
increased public spending, a moreeven distribution of consumption
across generations, and recourse to
slower foreign worker inflows would
help to moderate the current
account and slow accumulation of
foreign assets.

Assessment. With the nominal effective exchange rate as the intermediate target, intervention is undertaken as required to
achieve monetary policy’s inflation and output goals.
Official reserves cover 50 percent of short-term external debt (at an original maturity basis), but are much higher than thresholds
for other traditional adequacy metrics. At end-2011 reserves were also a larger share of GDP than in other financial centers, but
this may reflect in part that most other financial centers are located in reserve-currency countries. While non standard factors
warrant generous reserve buffers, current levels appear adequate and there is no clear case for further reserve accumulation for
precautionary purposes.

Foreign asset
and liability
position

Background. Available data indicate that as of 2011, net IIP stood at 268 percent of GDP, rising 70 percentage points of GDP
since 2007.
Assessment. The international investment position is not a major source of risk. Very large short-term gross non-FDI liabilities of
466 percent of GDP could nonetheless pose some vulnerability, although this is mitigated by large official reserve holdings
(95 percent of GDP) and other official liquid foreign assets.

1/ This numerical estimate is based on Fund staff analysis in the Pilot External Sector Report (IMF Policy Paper, July 2, 2012, http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/070212.pdf), and thus is
preliminary.

Authorities’ Views
31.

The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment of the external sector and the

broad direction of needed policy changes. They agreed that the current account surplus will likely
narrow over the medium term, and expect the real exchange rate to continue to appreciate in line
with fundamentals and policy changes, including the shift to the new growth model.
32.

However, the authorities questioned the staff’s estimates of the valuation of the real

effective exchange rate (REER). The wide range of the estimated REER gap indicates a high degree
of imprecision associated with the quantitative assessments. The estimates also differed significantly
from year to year, even though underlying medium-term factors behind the projections have not
changed fundamentally.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.

Singapore’s GDP growth is expected to weaken in 2012, even as inflation remains

elevated. The strong global growth impulse seen earlier this year has given way to tepid world
demand. Meanwhile, Singapore’s low unemployment rate and negative real interest rates are
expected to sustain domestic demand. Under the benign global baseline scenario, growth is forecast
to soften this year to just below 3 percent, with a moderate increase in 2013. Nonetheless, inflation
is expected to remain under pressure from the tight labor market and lagged effects of higher prices
for vehicle permits and real estate on consumer prices.
34.

External downside risks loom large. Given Singapore’s pronounced trade and financial

openness, the impact of further euro area turmoil, abrupt fiscal tightening in the U.S., and/or a
severe slowdown in China would be substantial. However, a more contained event could induce
safe-haven inflows into Singapore, cushioning the impact on growth, but possibly at the cost of
reigniting domestic credit growth and real estate prices.
35.

The government’s policies to increase labor productivity could have important

macroeconomic effects. Slower foreign worker inflows will boost real wages and, if complemented
with well-targeted incentives for technology and skills upgrading, should with time support
productivity growth. The authorities also see these policies as essential to alleviate overcrowding. In
the near term, the strategy is expected to reduce potential growth and increase frictional
unemployment. It will also push up inflation and contribute to a permanently more appreciated real
exchange rate and narrower current account surplus. If prices and unemployment rise more sharply
than expected, consideration could be given to lengthening the phase˗in of the tighter limits on
foreign worker inflows. A means-tested, publicly-funded system of unemployment and old˗age

pension benefits could enhance the efficiency of job search and reduce the social costs of the
transition.
36.

Policymakers confront the challenge of containing inflation expectations amid a

testing environment. The tightening of monetary policy in April 2012 and the FY 2012 Budget’s
moderately-restrictive stance are appropriate under the baseline scenario to keep the output gap
contained as potential growth moderates. However, inflation should be permitted to rise temporarily
to accommodate the increase in relative prices of labor-intensive products resulting from the tighter
labor market conditions. To prevent inflation expectations from rising, other sources of inflation—
including from transport costs, credit growth and asset prices—should be forcefully tackled,
including through continued recourse to macroprudential tools. Consideration could also be given
to further absorbing liquidity.
37.

Singapore has ample policy space and large buffers to mitigate the effects a steeper

global growth slowdown or financial turmoil. As in 2008−09, the response should focus on
preserving the private sector’s economic and financial infrastructure to facilitate a rapid recovery
when demand subsequently resumes, while providing an adequate social safety net.
38.

Singapore’s dynamic financial sector has important strengths, but extensive

cross˗border linkages and large exposure to domestic real property pose risks. Sizable
deleveraging by European banks from Singapore since mid˗2011 has not created visible strains, but
close monitoring of funding conditions at foreign bank branches should continue. Rapid outward
expansion by domestic banks into the region entails currency and duration risk, and banks should
continue to build up and lengthen their on˗balance sheet U.S. dollar funding. Real estate poses a
concentration risk. While an escalating series of macroprudential measures, combined with
deteriorating regional sentiment, halted the rise in house prices in late 2011, a prolonged period of
high unemployment or fall in real wages could impair credit quality. Additional targeted
macroprudential measures are called for if property prices reaccelerate.
39.

From a multilateral perspective, Singapore’s external position is stronger than

warranted by fundamentals. In addition to appropriate adjustments in other countries, achieving a
more balanced external position in Singapore calls for raising private and public spending and a
more even distribution of consumption across generations. Rapid population aging, tighter
restrictions on foreign workers, and the government’s plan to increase social and infrastructure
spending over the medium term will help support this rebalancing.
40.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Singapore be held on the standard

12˗month cycle.

Shock

Strong
intensification of
the euro area
crisis

A marked
slowdown in
China

Combination of
shocks to global
growth
(escalation of
crisis in euro area;
hard landing in
China; renewed
slowdown in the
US, possibly from
abrupt fiscal
consolidation)

Likelihood

Medium

Transmission
Channels

Impact

Trade channel:
lower global
growth, particularly
in advanced
economies

Direct and indirect exports to
advanced economies are about one
fourth of total. Exports are over
210 percent of GDP, and trade
related sectors account for over
50 percent of GDP.

High. A 1 percentage point decline in
G˗3 final demand reduces Singapore’s
growth by about 2.3 percentage
points.

Financial channel:
Deleveraging by
European banks;
heightened risk
aversion with
capital outflows
and increased
volatility.

Financial sector generates 12 percent
of GDP. Exposure to Europe is
limited for onshore banks; but
significant for offshore banking
(about 15 percent of assets and
18 percent of liabilities).

Medium to high. Impact depends on
the extent of escalation. If less severe,
Singapore could even see safe-haven
inflows. Financial institutions’ own
liquidity buffers provide a significant
first line of defense. In an extreme
event, the strong official reserve
position provides and additional
cushion.

Direct and
intraregional trade
linkages

China is a key link in the regional
supply chain. Singapore’s exports are
driven by Chinese exports (with an
elasticity of 1.8) rather than Chinese
domestic demand (April 2012 REO).

Medium to high (depending on the
extent to which Chinese exportoriented sectors are affected).

Tourism

China is Singapore’s second largest
source of tourists. Total gross
tourism revenue in 2011 was
equivalent to 7 percent of GDP.
Tourism revenue and tourist from
China have risen in recent years.

Medium.

Financial channel

Domestic banks have actively
expanded lending to Chinese
corporates, but total amounts are
still relatively modest. Some of
Singapore’s major offshore banks are
likely to have significant exposure to
China.

Low to medium.

Protracted
stagnation of
global growth

Very high degree of trade openness
(see above on the trade channel
from an intensification of the euro
area crisis).

High. The elasticity of Singapore’s
growth with respect to global growth
is estimated at 1.8. A prolonged global
slump would lead to a sharp decline in
exports and domestic demand, and an
increase in unemployment. Firms may
reduce capacity, leading to a fall in
potential output.

Low

Low

Vulnerability

Singapore also hosts large currency
and interest rate OTC derivative
markets, in which European banks
are important counterparties.

1/ The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path—the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Appendix II: Singapore—Housing Market Structure
and Developments
Singapore’s home ownership rate, at 89 percent, is the highest in the world. The majority of
households (about 80 percent) live in
owner˗occupied flats built by the public sector’s
Housing Development Board (HDB), which offers
subsidized flats for sale at government-determined
prices under strict eligibility conditions (citizenship,
marital status, age, income). HDB flats must
typically be held for a minimum period (currently
five years) before they can be sold in the
secondary market. HDB also provides loans to
qualifying households (with a stock of 13 percent
of GDP), with the interest rate linked to the yield on individuals’ savings in their Central Provident
Fund accounts, although buyers may choose to
obtain a bank mortgage.
The government can affect the supply (and hence
price) of housing in the private-built market by
adjusting the amount of land released for private
development through the Government Land Sales
Program. In general, land availability for private
housing (as well as supply of new HDB flats) is
adjusted with the goal of maintaining property
price stability.1

Singapore,” National University of Singapore IRES Working Paper Series, April 2011.

Prices of private-built and HDB resale housing
tend to co˗move, although the former appear to
be more cyclically sensitive.2 The similarity of
longer-term price trends reflects that both types
of housing are fairly close substitutes for citizens.
However, only Singapore citizens (and in some
cases permanent residents) may own HDB flats.3
Thus, the price of private-built housing is likely to
be more responsive to external economic cycles
than is the price of resale HDB flats.

That foreign buyers may have considerable influence on the price of Singapore housing is evident in
their ownership share. Nearly one quarter of privately-built residential properties is owned by
permanent residents, foreigners, or companies (whose beneficial owners may be non˗Singaporean).
This share has risen steadily, from less than 20 percent in 2006. Foreigners’ (excluding companies)
share of transactions increased sharply in recent years, from around 11½ percent in early 2010
to 20 percent in late 2011.
Housing prices increased rapidly since 2008, reflecting historically low interest rates and ready
access to credit, favorable domestic economic prospects, supply that failed to keep pace with the
rapidly growing number of resident households, and foreign investor demand on account of
Singapore’s appeal as a investment destination. In fact, prices of private housing were closely
synchronized with the share of foreign buyers of property.

Data on prices of new HDB housing is not available.

However, a non-citizen or permanent resident may own an HDB flat jointly with a Singapore citizen of the same
nuclear family.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Alongside the rapid increase in house prices and
transactions, real estate-related bank loans increased,
and now account for about 40 percent of total bank
loans to nonbank residents. Loan-to-value (LtV) ratios
on the stock of bank mortgages have moderated,
reflecting the rise in house values in the case of
existing loans, as well as the MAS-mandated increase
in the minimum required down payment.
Indicators of housing affordability are mixed. House
prices have risen more quickly than median incomes,
especially for HDB resale housing. In addition, the
tighter LtV ceilings raise the bar on qualifying for a
housing loan. On the other hand, all-time low
mortgage interest rates (about 70 percent of which
are at floating rates, currently between 1⅓ percent
and 2 percent) have reduced debt servicing costs.
Following successive rounds of policy tightening,
together with external factors, home prices have
remained flat since end˗2011, while the volume of
transactions has declined noticeably. In particular, the
share of foreign buyers collapsed in Q1:2012 to
5½ percent as a result of new macroprudential
measures targeting foreigners and weakening external
investment sentiment, with buyers from China falling
by nearly 50 percent. The more-than-proportionate
decline in purchases by Mainland Chinese may reflect
the impact of the economic slowdown in China.
Transactions in the luxury market have also fallen.
However, the share in total transactions of “shoe box”
apartments (with an area of less than 50 square meters) doubled in Q1:2012 to close to 20 percent.
While this may reflect the characteristics of new supply coming on-stream, demand for such housing
is strong, possibly because of the reduced affordability of standard-size units.

Singapore’s exchange rate is classified as “other managed.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) monitors its value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to
maintain this value within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency.
Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore dollar credit facilities to,
and bond and equity issuance by, nonresident financial institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds
obtained by nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks, finance companies, and
hedge funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for equity listings or bond issuance
to finance activities outside Singapore must be swapped or converted into foreign currency upon
draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar credit facilities in

ANNEX II: SINGAPORE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to expand the
range of publicly available data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would enhance the basis for
macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the external and fiscal areas.
National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data sources and
methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted in 2006, resulting in
lower statistical discrepancies. (DOS) has completed the rebasing of the Singapore’s national accounts to
reference year 2005.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base year 2009. The CPI
is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and composition of goods and services
consumed by resident households.
Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published nor
provided to the Fund. The government publishes annually partial information on the interest and dividends on
these assets. Debt service payments on domestic debt made from the extra budgetary Government Securities
Fund are published on an annual basis. Data on the financial position of the consolidated public sector is not
published.
Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting data to be broken
down by instrument, sector, and currency.
Balance of payments: In February 2012, the DOS concluded the migration of the balance of payments accounts
to the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The main changes relative to the 5th edition include:
reclassification of repairs on goods and goods for processing to services (from goods); reclassification of
merchanting to goods (from services); and treating banks’ Asian Currency Unit (ACU) as residents (previously
they were regarded as nonresidents, and hence their transactions were excluded from the balance of payments).
Data on Singapore’s international investment position (IIP) is not provided on a disaggregated sectoral basis as
suggested by the Balance of Payments Manual. Also, the IIP position does not include all net foreign assets held
by Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation, although all associated flows are included in the balance of
payments data. The authorities reconfirmed their commitment to fully report the IIP data to the Fund by 2014.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and
meets all the SDDS specifications. These include the
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data;
and the dissemination of advance release calendars;
quarterly certification of the metadata posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board;
and provision of information to allow users to
assess data quality.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Singapore
On July 30, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation 1 with Singapore, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without
a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis. 2
Background
Singapore’s growth performance over the past year has been driven by global and regional
events. Thus, a poor second half of 2011, reflecting deteriorating global activity as well as
regional supply disruptions from natural disasters, was followed by a strong bounce back in the
first quarter of 2012, as the easing of supply disruptions propelled manufacturing exports. More
recently, the Singaporean economy is softening again on the back of weaker global demand
and heightened international financial strains. All along, domestic demand has remained
resilient, buoyed by a strong labor market and low interest rates, while the output gap remains
positive.
Headline inflation has fluctuated around an elevated path since early 2011, propped up mainly
by accommodation and private road transport costs. Core inflation, which excludes those two
components, picked up earlier this year, reflecting wage cost pressures amid a tight labor
market, but has eased recently, mainly on account of lower oil prices.
Global financial turbulence has over the past year continued to cause volatility in domestic
equity and currency markets. There has also been significant deleveraging by European banks
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

operating in Singapore, although the impact on funding has been offset by local and other
foreign banks. Overall, the local banking sector remains profitable and well capitalized. Credit
growth has eased, although the rapid expansion in foreign-currency lending to the rest of the
region by the large local banks has led to an increase in their U.S. dollar and overall
loan˗to˗deposit ratios. Housing prices and transaction volumes have moderated, particularly in
the private housing market, but local banks’ exposure to real estate is high.
Singapore’s external position remains strong, with the current account surplus remaining
broadly unchanged at about 21½ percent of GDP, and a large positive international investment
position reflecting large official foreign assets.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Singapore, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff appraisal as follows:
Singapore’s GDP growth is expected to weaken in 2012, even as inflation remains elevated.
The strong global growth impulse seen earlier this year has given way to tepid world demand.
Meanwhile, Singapore’s low unemployment rate and negative real interest rates are expected to
sustain domestic demand. Under the benign global baseline scenario, growth is forecast to
soften this year to just below 3 percent, with a moderate increase in 2013. Nonetheless, inflation
is expected to remain under pressure from the tight labor market and lagged effects of higher
prices for vehicle permits and real estate on consumer prices.
External downside risks loom large. Given Singapore’s pronounced trade and financial
openness, the impact of further euro area turmoil, abrupt fiscal tightening in the United States,
and/or a severe slowdown in China would be substantial. However, a more contained event
could induce safe-haven inflows into Singapore, cushioning the impact on growth, but possibly
at the cost of reigniting domestic credit growth and real estate prices.
The government’s policies to increase labor productivity could have important macroeconomic
effects. Slower foreign worker inflows will boost real wages and, if complemented with
well˗targeted incentives for technology and skills upgrading, should with time support
productivity growth. The authorities also see these policies as essential to alleviate
overcrowding. In the near term, the strategy is expected to reduce potential growth and increase
frictional unemployment. It will also push up inflation and contribute to a permanently more
appreciated real exchange rate and narrower current account surplus. If prices and
unemployment rise more sharply than expected, consideration could be given to lengthening
the phase˗in of the tighter limits on foreign worker inflows. Enhanced and targeted social safety
nets could improve the efficiency of job search and reduce the social costs of the transition.
Policymakers confront the challenge of containing inflation expectations amid a testing
environment. The tightening of monetary policy in April 2012 and the FY 2012 Budget’s
moderately-restrictive stance are appropriate under the baseline scenario to keep the output
gap contained as potential growth moderates. However, inflation should be permitted to rise
temporarily to accommodate the increase in relative prices of labor-intensive products resulting

3
from the tighter labor market conditions. To prevent inflation expectations from rising, other
sources of inflation—including from transport costs, credit growth and asset prices—should be
forcefully tackled, including through continued recourse to macroprudential tools. Consideration
could also be given to further absorbing liquidity.
Singapore has ample policy space and large buffers to mitigate the effects a steeper global
growth slowdown or financial turmoil. As in 2008−09, the response should focus on preserving
the private sector’s economic and financial infrastructure to facilitate a rapid recovery when
demand subsequently resumes, while providing an adequate social safety net.
Singapore’s dynamic financial sector has important strengths, but extensive cross˗border
linkages and large exposure to domestic real property pose risks. Sizable deleveraging by
European banks from Singapore since mid˗2011 has not created visible strains, but close
monitoring of funding conditions at foreign bank branches should continue. Rapid outward
expansion by domestic banks into the region entails currency and duration risk, and banks
should continue to build up and lengthen their on˗balance sheet U.S. dollar funding. Real estate
poses a concentration risk. While an escalating series of macroprudential measures, combined
with deteriorating regional sentiment, halted the rise in house prices in late 2011, a prolonged
period of high unemployment or fall in real wages could impair credit quality. Additional targeted
macroprudential measures are called for if property prices reaccelerate.
From a multilateral perspective, Singapore’s external position is stronger than warranted by
fundamentals. In addition to appropriate adjustments in other countries, achieving a more
balanced external position in Singapore calls for raising private and public spending and a more
even distribution of consumption across generations. Rapid population aging, tighter restrictions
on foreign worker inflows, and the government’s plan to increase social and infrastructure
spending over the medium term will help support this rebalancing.
