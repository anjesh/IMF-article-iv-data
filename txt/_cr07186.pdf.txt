Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Switzerland
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and G. Russell Kincaid
April 16, 2007

Executive Summary
The economy is performing well. In its fourth year of expansion, growth is balanced, inflation
low and the external position strong. Employment picked up and unemployment is low.
Cautious fiscal policies produced a surplus one year ahead of schedule. The outlook is
favorable with 2007 growth around 2 percent and inflation below 1 percent.
Focus of the policy discussions:
•

Potential growth. Ongoing reforms in goods and labor markets increased productivity
and facilitated above trend growth. The authorities agree that opening the labor market
to EU workers and stronger retail competition has kept inflation in check, but are
hesitant to assume permanently higher potential growth.

•

Monetary and exchange rate policies. The SNB continues normalizing interest rates.
Surprisingly, the tightening of monetary policy has coincided with a weakening of the
exchange rate—linked in part to carry trades. Given prevailing uncertainties, monetary
policy needs to remain flexible. Competitiveness is strong and the current account
surplus large.

•

Financial sector and FSAP update. The financial sector is performing well. In a
favorable setting, increasingly sophisticated and evolving risk exposures require close
monitoring. The FSAP update recommends a strengthening in the draft Act
establishing the unified financial market supervisor (FINMA). The authorities agree
with many of the FSAP Update’s findings, and that funding and regulatory
independence of FINMA are crucial.

•

Fiscal policies and sustainability. Fiscal policies have been strong, with help of the
debt brake, but the authorities are planning substantial extraordinary budgetary
expenditures outside of the debt brake in 2008. With strong revenues and positive
incentives from a new equalization system, the cantons are cutting taxes. The staff
recommends bringing the extrabudgetary expenditures under the debt brake to preserve
its credibility, and avoid procyclical policies. The authorities are preparing measures to
reduce long-term fiscal pressures, and a Long-Run Sustainability Report to inform the
public.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
The economy is performing well. The expansion is entering its fourth year with low
inflation and strong employment growth. Confidence is high, and growth is projected at
2.0 percent in 2007, exceeding trend. The budget moved to a surplus one year ahead of
schedule, and the external environment remains broadly favorable.
2.
Switzerland holds parliamentary elections in October. The election cycle is
subdued, but high fiscal revenues are inducing some expenditure pressures. The outgoing
parliament is not taking up new reforms, so the mission aimed the discussions and its
outreach at post-electoral progress.

3.
Stronger policies and global growth
have reactivated the economy. Performance
has long been hampered by sheltered sectors
(e.g., agriculture) that limited productivity
growth and contributed to a high domestic
price level. As a result, average per-capita
growth lagged peers for two decades through
2003 and Switzerland’s relative income
position declined. However, since 2004 the
economy has rebounded with stronger fiscal
policies (the debt brake) and reforms in retail
and labor markets—while taking advantage of
buoyant global activity (Figures 1 and 2).

4.
Growth accelerated and became broad based in 2006. Private consumption picked
up with rising employment, and business investment with high capacity utilization; construction rebounded from weather-related lows in 2005. Pharmaceutical, precision instruments,
and financial services’ exports boomed with the EU recovery and some weakening of the
franc. GDP growth of 2.7 percent in 2006 closed the output gap.

Full-time employment increased in manufacturing, construction, and the
financial sector. Unemployment fell to 3 percent recently and surveys suggest a further
decline ahead. Opening the labor market to EU workers helped to fill skill gaps and keep
wage growth down, underscoring the value of flexible labor markets and effective migration
policies (Figure 3).
5.

6.
CPI inflation and wage pressures have been low. Inflation was 1 percent in 2006
and real wages grew by 0.7 percent. Labor market openness, reduced exchange rate pass
through, rebounding productivity, lower oil prices, and increased domestic retail competition
together with higher policy interest rates contained inflation. February 2007 inflation even
dropped to zero. When excluding housing rents linked to rising policy interest rates, it was
negative. Nevertheless, producer prices are rising somewhat faster, consistent with the
weaker exchange rate (Figure 4).

added in the economy. Financial soundness indicators have improved and bank profitability
is strong. The two large banks (UBS and Credit Suisse) are global enterprises in wealth
management, derivatives markets, and as prime brokers to hedge funds and private equity
firms. The pension and life insurance sectors are recovering from balance sheet pressures,
low interest rates, and the downturn earlier this decade in financial asset prices. Real estate
prices have increased but remain well below their peak before the crisis of the mid-1990s—
there are no signs of price bubbles (Figures 7-9).
9.
The 2006 fiscal result exceeded the budget. With tight expenditure control and
buoyant revenues, the general government achieved a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP—versus
a budgeted 1 percent deficit. Together with the proceeds from Swisscom share sales, this
reduced gross debt to 48.2 percent of GDP.

10.
The outlook is favorable but tail-end risks warrant monitoring. External demand,
even discounting some slowing, remains supportive overall. Investment and consumption are
expected to remain buoyant (Figure 10). Staff projections are in line with consensus. While
low-probability events, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances or a shock from hedge
funds or private equity could have pronounced consequences given Switzerland’s large role
in financial intermediation. Another downside risk would include increased currency
volatility linked to Swiss franc carry trades. Upside potential could materialize if the franc
were to continue being weak or migration and employment growth accelerated further.
11.
The main long-run challenge for Switzerland relates to population aging, its
associated fiscal pressures and decline in potential growth. Driven by demographics, the
staff projects potential growth to slow to around 1¼ percent by 2020. Although there is
upside potential with improved competition and migration, unchanged fiscal policies would
nevertheless generate a large primary deficit from higher entitlement costs, as shown below.

6
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.

With the economy performing well, the mission focused on core issues:

•

Potential output: Reforms in goods and labor markets are bearing fruit with
increased productivity and lower inflation. Discussions focused on whether these
supply improvements could sustain more rapid growth without price pressures.

•

Monetary and exchange rate policies: The exchange rate has weakened despite the
SNB tightening and a growing current account surplus. These conditions, and
uncertainty about cyclical and inflation turning points, complicate monetary policy.

•

Financial sector: Switzerland would be sensitive to a disorderly resolution of global
imbalances. The November FSAP update mission assessed these and other risks.

•

Fiscal sustainability: The debt brake has limited spending in recent years, but the
authorities are now placing extraordinary spending off-budget. Also, the debt brake is
not robust to aging pressures, and measures to address these need to be formalized.
A. Potential Output

13.
The authorities were guarded about the possibility that potential growth had
increased. They estimate current potential growth of 1½ percent a year; the staff thought that
it could be closer to 2 percent for now. The authorities agreed that opening the labor market
and tighter domestic retail competition had facilitated the rebound, and that Switzerland was
a large beneficiary of globalization, putting downward pressure on domestic prices. Their
caution centered on whether improvements were temporary or permanent. There were
logistical and political limitations to (im)migration. Also, their analytical work did not yet
suggest higher potential. They would monitor indicators for policy implications because if
potential growth were higher, financial policies could be slightly easier.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
14.
The normalization of interest rates was close to ending. The SNB agreed that
short-term inflation pressures appeared absent, but (in their estimate) a positive output gap,
high credit growth, weak exchange rate, and falling unemployment signaled higher prices in
the medium-term. Exchange rate and wholesale price pass-through effects could reappear.
Moreover, monetary policy had been accommodative for a while—which would impact
expectations at some point. The staff considered that econometric modeling grounded in past
data would have difficulty picking up the benefits from reform on higher potential growth, as
these affect the economy in a forward looking way. Still, some of the SNB’s models
indicated a neutral rate of 2.5 percent (real 1.5 percent; inflation 1 percent), and the SNB
tightened further in March.

15.
While the SNB leaned toward further rate increases, they noted that upcoming
decisions were not clearcut. The SNB stressed foremost the need to stay ahead of inflation
expectations (the yield curve has flattened, Figure 5). On the exchange rate, as long as its
weakness did not affect expectations, it was not a concern. The policy stance would respond
flexibly to unfolding events.
16.
The monetary policy framework and communication strategy serve Switzerland
well. The SNB publishes every quarter a three-year inflation projection as a communication
device, which appears to have contributed to keeping financial markets well informed about
policy intentions. On a technical level, the staff continued to feel uneasy about the regulated
link between interest rates and housing rents, which creates a policy distortion (higher rates
causing rental inflation). Moreover, cantonal banks are under (local) political pressure to
keep mortgage rates stable as policy rates rise—evidence of a second distortion related to
public ownership of banks.

8
17.
The exchange regime is an independent float. The value of the franc is determined
by demand and supply. The SNB reserves the right to intervene, but has not done so in years.
The system is free of restrictions except for security reasons notified to the Fund.
18.
Competitiveness is strong and the external surplus large. Despite strong
fundamentals, the franc has depreciated by 2½ and 6½ percent in nominal and real effective
terms since 2002. Calculations using the Fund’s macroeconomic balance approach (CGER)
suggest the franc is 0-20 percent undervalued. The staff projects the current account surplus
to remain at 16-17 percent of GDP, in part reflecting earnings on Switzerland’s large foreign
assets from occupational pension funds, insurance companies, and corporate holdings
(Figure 11). Moreover, financial service earnings have grown fast as new IPOs and M&As
increased underwriting fees and commissions; natural disaster related premium adjustments
boosted insurance company receipts; and high commodity prices and trading activity raised
merchanting revenue. At the same time, the strong demand for precision instruments and
pharmaceuticals increased the merchandise trade surplus to 1 percent of GDP.1 The
authorities noted that the current account surplus largely went into direct investment
outflows, especially by foreign controlled holdings. Neverthless, interpreting the surplus is
complex, and its connection to domestic demand is not straightforward (Box 1).

Box 1. The Swiss Current Account Surplus
Interpreting the large current account surplus is complex. The (entirely private sector)
surplus reflects structural and cyclical components that have grown with globalization and
as Swiss multinationals expand. The surplus does not connect in a simple way to domestic
absorption, or even to Swiss nationals.
•

Net foreign assets exceeding 110 percent of GDP mostly reflect pension plans’
and Swiss multinational foreign assets. Even at moderate returns of some 6 percent,
these assets alone contribute (a structural) income of 7 percent of GDP.

•

Swiss multinationals are very profitable. The global upswing has boosted
profitability of Swiss firms in chemical, pharmaceutical, machine tool, and
financial services industries. They are world leaders in their field, conducting
mostly business overseas. In comparison with a small home base, their global
profits are structurally improving and also currently cyclically strong, thus exerting
a large impact on the Swiss balance of payments.

•

Merchandise trade account. The trade balance was around zero in the 1990s and
a small surplus more recently, reflecting slow average growth. Going forward,
absorption is likely to increase as the economy continues to strengthen, and
reforms further liberalize internal markets. Investment is picking up and
consumption taxes are low (see chart in para. 29), yet stronger absorption could
only reduce part of the large external surplus.

•

Foreign holding companies. Switzerland is home to foreign controlled holdings,
who are attracted by location, a stable political system, excellent legal, physical,
and financial infrastructure, and moderate tax regime. As residents, their profits are
in the Swiss balance of payments. Most of their earnings are in-and-out, but their
net retained earnings abroad are a Swiss surplus—these have grown from
-1 percent of GDP in 2001 to nearly 3 percent in 2006.

•

Not all of the surplus is “Swiss.” Balance of payments data reflect residency.
Many firms in Switzerland are fully (foreign holdings) or partially (foreign share
ownership in Swiss firms) owned by foreigners. A preliminary staff analysis based
on data received from the authorities suggests that nearly 7 pps of GDP of the
current account surplus in 2005-2006 is attributable to foreigners.

10

19.
The authorities agreed that it was unclear whether recent exchange rate
weakness would be sustained or was temporary:
•

•

•

Strong fundamentals and narrowing
interest differentials point to the franc
resuming its century long trend
appreciation at some point.
However, reforms that are lowering
nontradable prices are consistent with
a depreciating equilibrium exchange
rate (a “reverse” Balassa-Samuelson
effect).

REER appears to be off its long-run trend…

trades (contracting SwF mortgages in
Eastern Europe) may have contributed to weakening the franc. Even some exporters
have discontinued hedging their contracts. The limits to this process are uncertain, but
the SNB warned that carry trades were risky, and would remain alert for cross-border
spillovers (Box 2).
Box 2. Carry Trade Spillovers
Low interest rates and volatility have made the Swiss Franc the currency of choice for
mortgage and other private loans in Eastern Europe. This carry trade is growing rapidly,
particularly through Austrian banks, with a

banks is growing but represents only
½ percent of their international claims. To the
extent these funds are used to finance foreign SwF retail loans, a sharp appreciation of the SwF
could stress retail borrowers in Eastern Europe and reverberate back into Switzerland.
Moreover, some foreign banks directly place paper on the Swiss exchange and international
markets. Swiss policies or exogenous shocks that appreciate the franc could stress retail
borrowers and carry traders and eventually affect their SwF lenders.

11

•

The emergence of the euro (franc weakness is mainly against the euro) may have
reduced the safe-haven role of the franc (Box 3). Nevertheless, the authorities felt that
this effect, and low volatility, could be temporary—and that currency appreciation
would resume as risk appetites normalized.

The authorities agreed that a floating exchange regime was best to handle these uncertainties.
Box 3. Has the Swiss Franc Lost Its Luster?
The franc has weakened lately after appreciating by 0.7 percent annually in real effective
terms for a century.
One factor has been carry trades as the
yen and Swf were main funding
currencies (2006 BIS Annual Report).
Carry traders short low yielding
currencies, with the proceeds going long
on high yielding assets. SwF futures
contracts on the CME indicate a marked
increase in short positions since 2004.

Two, the Swf may have lost status as a
1.05
safe haven currency. In 2001, the Swiss
-70,000
1.00
constitution was amended to allow SNB
gold sales and, in 2005, a substantial
amount of gold was sold with the
proceeds distributed to government. The response of the Swf to gold prices appears to have
weakened recently, and global turbulence has not caused Swf appreciation as in the past.
-50,000

Three, the Swf has lost share as official reserve currency. As global reserve holdings
increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1990 to 10 percent in 2005, the Swf share has diminished
(BIS data). Given the more active reserves management, this might reflect low yields in
Switzerland, the currency’s decoupling from gold, and substitution to the euro as the new
preferred asset.

C. The Financial Sector and FSAP Update
20.
The authorities welcomed the FSAP update accompanying the consultation. The
FSAP team and SNB designed stress scenarios, including a weaker dollar and higher U.S.
interest rates that the large banks applied in their proprietary risk models. The banks and
supervisory authorities felt that the stress exercises were helpful, and would explore how they
could be used to improve risk management. The accompanying Financial System Stability
Assessment reports on the findings and recommendations in detail.

12
21.
The FSAP update found the financial system resilient to significant shocks, but
identified several areas for policy attention. An abrupt unwinding of global imbalances
could have strong effects because a large repricing of financial assets or currencies would
adversely affect banks and portfolios of insurance and pension funds. The growing
importance of hedge funds, private equity leverage, and derivatives trading merited closer
monitoring. Indeed, while challenging for a small country, it was crucial to maintain a
proactive supervisory stance to guard against falling behind in understanding the evolving
operating models and risk exposures in the large institutions. Counterparty default and ringfencing needed to be examined in stress testing models, complemented by targeted audits.
22.
The FSAP update felt that there was scope to strengthen the draft Act
establishing the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The FINMA will
become operational in 2009 and unify banking, insurance, securities, and anti-money
laundering supervision. The draft Act could be strengthened through additional budgetary
and policy independence, and by granting FINMA independent authority to impose civil
money penalties. The staff also recommends dealing with concerns about the costs of
regulation in the Guidelines for Financial Market Regulation, rather than explicitly in the law
itself, to avoid regulatory capture. The authorities agreed that funding and regulatory
independence are crucial, but were less concerned than staff about risks of regulatory
capture. They also noted that powers to impose civil money penalties already exist in the
Ministry of Finance and on the cantonal level (criminal prosecution), which they consider
sufficient.
23.
The implementation of Basel II capital adequacy was well advanced; now
additional efforts were needed to bolster liquidity supervision. Supervisors need to keep
an ongoing dialogue with the banks on Basel II, and internal models need to be continuously
evaluated given their high unweighted leverage ratios, and other risks not evaluated by the
stress tests including systemic events in hedge funds and the derivatives markets. Additional
on-site audits are underway and lead auditors are periodically rotated. After a delay, the
authorities are now updating their liquidity regulations along BIS standards.
24.
Reforms in transition through 2010 will move Switzerland’s insurance
regulation to international best practices. Through the application of the Swiss Solvency
Test (SST), the authorities are moving toward a risk-based system equivalent to EU solvency
II. Meanwhile, some weaknesses are present in the system, as several companies were found
to be too vulnerable to financial and real asset price drops. The authorities were considering
more focused inspections to assess and address risk exposures of these firms.

13

25.
The authorities noted that there was no political consensus to centralize pension
supervision. The FSAP update found that pension supervision remained fragmented and
uneven among cantons, carrying risks for fiscal sustainability and contingent liabilities. Also,
underfunding needs to be resolved and integrity standards and rules governing investment
structure upgraded. While the central authorities do not have formal jurisdiction over pension
supervision, a central High Supervisory Board would coordinate regulation, moving to a riskbased solvency system with higher valuation reserves and tighter integrity standards.
26.
The FSAP update recommended that cantonal banks focus on profit
maximization and be granted further operational independence. It found that cantonal
banks were less efficient than private banks, partly because they had to carry out social
functions with contingent risks. The authorities agreed that the banks needed to minimize
costs as their state guarantees could be withdrawn. Meanwhile, the banks had become more
efficient since the real-estate crisis in the mid-1990s. They also noted that social mandates
were decided by cantons that could not be revoked by national authorities.
D. Fiscal policies
27.
The authorities were satisfied with the operation of the debt brake, but
recognized its limitations. The staff agrees that the debt-brake, which seeks balance over the
cycle, has been instrumental in reaching the 2006 surplus. However, it applies only to the
confederation, excluding social security, and does not provide an anchor for long-term fiscal
sustainability. Long-term solutions would need to fit within the devolved federal system, but
significant progress was unlikely during this election year.
28.
Spending pressures were building but officials were confident that medium-term
offsets could be found. The budget aims at a surplus in 2007, but extraordinary off-budget
expenditures exceeding 1 percent of GDP were planned for 2008. These include the creation
of a new permanent off-budget infrastructure fund and funding of a public pension
obligation—all outside the debt brake.2 To compensate, the authorities cut discretionary
spending, were negotiating structural reductions in government tasks and subsidies, and
planning a VAT increase for the disability fund (see below).3 The staff expressed concern
about the extraordinary expenditures and that fiscal policy was becoming procyclical. The
authorities explained that their objective is to bring all outlays into the fiscal target over the
medium-term—safeguarding the spirit of the debt brake. However, they said that some
operations are lumpy and one-time and can not be accommodated in the annual debt brake
rule. They would continue debt reduction, including with further sales of Swisscom shares.
2

The authorities are also reducing taxation on couples, potentially lowering revenues by ¼ percent of GDP a
year from 2010, and considering eliminating double taxation on dividends.
3

The report on government tasks and subsidies, which parses government functions and subsidies, should be
ready by mid-2007, aiming at SwF 2.9 billion savings over 2008-10.

Goods and service tax revenue

The authorities saw cantonal tax competition as part of fiscal federalism. Cuts in

proceeds; robust cyclical revenues; and the

In the old regime, cantons with high tax rates tended to get more transfers; in the new system, incentives are to
moderate tax pressure. This effect is transitory until the new system is fully adopted.

15
30.

To cut long-term fiscal pressures, the government is working in several areas:

•

Health care. Use of generic drugs has increased, hospital budgets tightened, and
physician reimbursements linked to specific services rather than the length of stay.

•

Disability insurance. Eligibility is being tightened, and reintegration of the disabled
back into the workforce is showing early success.

•

VAT. The authorities plan to resubmit for approval the VAT increase of 0.8 pps,
earmarked to reduce debt in the disability insurance fund. They are also developing
plans for the unification of VAT rates and abolition of exemptions.

•

First pillar pensions. A proposal to raise the female retirement age from 64 to 65 is
in parliament, and plans are to raise the threshold for early retirement. In addition, the
CPI weight in pension indexation would be increased, moderating benefit growth.

•

Second pillar pensions. To cut underfunding, the conversion rate (translating capital
into a retirement annuity) and regulated minimum interest rate can be reduced.

Nevertheless, the authorities agreed that dealing successfully with population
aging would require further structural adjustments. To inform the public about needed
fiscal adjustments, so important in Switzerland’s referendum/political system, the authorities
are preparing a Long Run Sustainability Report (LRSR) for end-2007. It will contain the
baseline fiscal projections at unchanged policies. A follow-up report, including options to
address booming health care costs, is expected in 2008. The staff strongly supports these
efforts and noted that the LRSR could include a preliminary inter-temporal public sector
balance sheet (Table 4) to show that unfunded future liabilities are over 2 times the size of
today’s gross debt. Indeed, the mission’s projections suggest that government net worth
(including the implicit liabilities) is improving, but a large long-run shortfall still exists.

16
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The economy is doing well, growth prospects are positive, and risks appear
balanced. After two decades of sluggish performance, the economy has perked up,
benefiting from strengthened policies and a favorable external environment. The outlook
holds promise but care should be taken that fiscal policies do not become procyclical. Shortrun capacity appears stretched, but inflation is low as globalization and tighter domestic
competition limit pass-through and the opening to EU citizens keeps wage pressures in
check. Downside risks could emerge if external growth were to slow significantly or global
imbalances unwind abruptly. Continued weakness in the franc and accelerating employment
constitute upside risks.
33.
A key challenge is to avoid complacency and consolidate the good performance
with structural reforms. The expansion is in its fourth year, reflecting cautious monetary
and fiscal policies, and reforms can further support potential growth and lower prices.
Switzerland needs to seize this opportunity to address long-term structural and fiscal issues,
especially since population aging pressures are not resolved.
34.
Monetary policy needs to remain flexible in the face of greater uncertainty. The
SNB has anchored inflation expectations by tightening policies as the expansion progressed.
Judging the correct stance becomes more difficult going forward, however, as growth
appears to have peaked. Labor supply and productivity improvements suggest that growth
can be higher than in the past without generating inflation. Nevertheless, the SNB needs to
remain alert as weakness in the exchange rate could still affect costs.
35.
The recent Swiss franc weakness is a conundrum. Improving fundamentals (a large
external surplus and international investment position, and above average growth) point to an
appreciation in the franc. However, the strong euro as a competing safe-haven currency and
lower domestic prices point to a depreciation in the franc. Carry trades—which weaken the
currency—provide persistent noise. The floating exchange rate regime is best to handle this
uncertainty.
36.
Competitiveness is strong. Currency weakness, the large stock of NFA, and the
large financial companies play a key role in the strong external position. Switzerland’s
excellent conditions for the location of multinational holdings may also contribute to the
external surplus. Deeper internal reforms could further energize domestic demand and make
a contribution, appropriate to Switzerland’s size, to the reduction in global imbalances.
37.
The FSAP update found that the financial sector is performing well, but risks
persist. While stress testing indicates that the financial sector is generally resilient to shocks,
bank operations are increasingly complex, involving exotic instruments and high-leveraged
counterparties; some insurers remain vulnerable to asset price adjustments; and occupation
pension funds continue to experience underfunding and fragmented regulation. The main

17
downside risk is that healthy balance sheets and profits may be building a degree of
complacency, creating vulnerability to increased volatility or shocks.
38.
Therefore, regulatory and supervisory arrangements need to be first-best. The
new consolidated regulator (FINMA) needs to have the operational independence and
financial resources to be a constructive and appropriately forceful supervisor and regulator of
the very large systemic financial institutions. Continuing efforts are needed to evaluate the
large banks’ operating models and to ensure that liquidity and capital regimes are sufficient.
39.
Fiscal policies have been sound, generating a surplus one year ahead of schedule.
The debt brake has functioned well and the authorities are to be commended in their steadfast
implementation of the two sizable expenditure reduction programs. This strong record needs
to be extended into the medium term to meet the challenges of population aging.
40.
Procyclical fiscal policy should be avoided and the integrity of the debt brake
maintained. Fiscal policy for 2007-08 is projected to be expansionary, reflecting large
extraordinary expenditures and overdue pension funding outside the debt brake. These
expenditures should be compensated within the debt brake mechanism in the medium term.
Similarly, while cantonal tax cuts partly reflect the move to a new equalization system, they
demonstrate how Switzerland’s competitive federalism can generate procyclical tax cuts—in
the face of unresolved longer-term social security deficits.
41.
The main fiscal challenge is to resolve structural spending pressures. The debt
brake applies only to the confederation and is not robust to pressures from population aging.
The authorities have taken important steps to limit future obligations, but more will be
needed. The long-run fiscal sustainability report needs to offer insight into fiscal dynamics
under current policies and provide the public with clear tools to understand the impact and
distributional effects of possible solutions.
42.
Policy making requires timely statistics. Cantonal and local governments provide
fiscal data with long lags. Inflation assessments are hampered by inadequate wage data.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Switzerland be held on
the standard twelve-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign
exchange market, and therefore classified as an independently floating exchange rate regime.
The Swiss National Bank reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All
settlements are made at free market rates. Switzerland maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for restrictions in place for security reasons notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision
No. 144-(52/51).
On March 13, 2007, Switzerland notified the IMF of the exchange restrictions that have been
imposed against certain countries, individuals, and entities, in accordance with relevant UN
Security Council resolutions and EU regulations.
In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, restrictions are currently in place with
respect to specific individuals and entities associated with the former government of Liberia,
Iraq, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Al-Qaïda network, specific individuals and
entities posing a threat to international peace and security in Côte d’Ivoire, in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), impeding the peace process in Sudan, suspected of involvement
in the bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, engaged in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)–
related programs, ban on financing and financial services related to the provision of arms and
related materiel to Lebanon, specific individuals and entities involved in the nuclear and/or
ballistic missile programs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The lists of individuals and entities
against whom financial sanctions are in force are based on the decisions by the competent UN
Security Council sanctions committee and are amended regularly.

3
In accordance with EU regulations, restrictions are currently in place with respect to specific
individuals associated with the previous government of the former Republic of Yugoslavia,
Zimbabwe, Myanmar, ban on financing and the provision of financial services related to
military activities in Uzbekistan, specific individuals and entities associated with the
government of Belarus. The lists of targeted individuals are identical to the list in the
corresponding EU regulations.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

Switzerland is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The 2007 mission
visited Bern and Zürich during February 26–March 5, 2007 and held discussions with Finance
Minister Merz, Chairman Roth of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank (SNB),
Interior Minister Couchepin and other senior officials. Outreach activities included discussions
with members of parliament, NGOs, the private sector, and think-tanks. Messrs. Moser
(Executive Director) and Weber (Advisor) attended some of the meetings.
The mission comprised B. Traa (Head), K. Ross, and A. Carare (EUR). B. Johnston (MCM)
participated in meetings related to the FSAP update.
In agreement with the authorities, the mission focused on core surveillance issues. No
background papers have been produced.
The mission held a joint press conference on the concluding statement. The authorities have
agreed to the publication of the staff report.

Annex II. Switzerland: Statistical Issues
Switzerland generally publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full observance of SDDS
requirements, and it is availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options on dissemination of
production index data (for periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and earnings data (for
periodicity). However, a number of statistical gaps and deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a
lack of resources and the limited authority of the Federal Statistical Office (BfS) to request
information:
•

reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due to
delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;

•

internationally comparable fiscal statistics on an accrual basis are not available;

•

pension statistics are published with a long lag;

•

GDP by industry appears with a considerable lag;

To address deficiencies, the authorities are taking or intend to take the following steps:
The SNB launched in 2004 a quarterly survey on the cost of borrowing and completed the
pilot phase in June 2005. From July 2006, the SNB conducts the survey on a monthly basis. In
September 2005, the SNB started compiling more comprehensive statistics on mutual funds.
In October 2005, the SNB published, in collaboration with the Federal Statistical Office,
annual financial accounts for 1999-2003 (stock data). Data on financial flows and nonfinancial assets will be published in 2007.
Annual national accounts were upgraded in 2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004 data, the Secretariat for Economics (SECO)
revised accordingly its quarterly national account estimates. SECO started publishing in
March 2006 a quarterly production account. The main innovations in the new national accounts
were in investment (with detail on information and communications technology), private and
public consumption (hospitals were transferred to the private sector), and the use of chain price
indices (without adjustment for quality).
In 2004, a statistical cooperation agreement was concluded with the EU as part of Bilateral II
for the harmonization of several Swiss statistics with EU standards.

5
The Federal Finance Administration has started preparations for revamping fiscal statistics
with the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, the reform of the
accounting standards for cantons and communes (Weiterentwicklung der Rechnungslegung der
Kantone und Gemeinden) and the introduction of full accrual budgeting and accounting at the
level of the federal government (Neues Rechnungsmodell Bund) along the lines of the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Figures according to the new
accounting standards are expected in 2008. In the interim, government finance statistics for
publication in the GFS Yearbook will be reported on a cash basis but presented in the GFSM
2001 format.
Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled by
the SNB and meet international standards. However, monetary gold transactions relating to
sales of gold reserves not required for monetary policy purposes have not been correctly
reflected in the balance of payments. For legal reasons, and until the distribution of the
proceeds of gold sales between the SNB and the Federal Department of Finance was concluded
in February 2005, the proceeds of the gold sales not needed for monetary purposes were
considered as part of the official reserves in the balance of payments. After that date, they
appear in the position “other assets of the SNB” in the balance of payments.
Switzerland participated in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators of the
soundness of the financial system (for year-end 2005) will soon be posted on the IMF website.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On June 1, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Switzerland.1
Background
The economy is performing well. The expansion moved into its fourth year with above average
growth and employment, and few signs of inflation. This favorable outcome can be traced to a
vibrant external environment, including in global financial markets, strong macropolicies and key
structural reforms in retailing and labor markets.
The economy gathered speed in 2004-2005 and growth is estimated to have accelerated to
2.7 percent in 2006—thereby closing the output gap. Growth became broadly based in 2006,
with a pickup in consumption and investment and a marked increase in exports linked to the EU
recovery and weakness in the franc. With business and consumer confidence indicators
remaining high, economic growth is expected to remain strong but at a somewhat slower
pace—in line with developments in main trading partners—of about 2 percent. While the outlook
is favorable, the authorities need to remain vigilant to global economic and political
developments that could affect the economy, including through oil prices, and to (mostly
external) risks that could impact on Switzerland’s large financial sector.
Inflation was 1 percent in 2006 and is expected to be slightly lower in 2007. The opening of the
labor market to EU workers, reduced exchange rate pass through, increased productivity, lower
oil prices, and increased domestic competition and policy interest rates are containing inflation.
Although unemployment has fallen to 3 percent, wage growth pressures are expected to remain
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

contained. As a result, competitiveness has improved and the current account surplus has now
reached over 17 percent of GDP.
The SNB continued to normalize interest rates in 2006 and early 2007. With five quarterly step
increases of 25 basis points, the policy rate now stands at 2¼ percent or about 1¾ percent in
real terms, slightly above average for past cycles.
Aided by strong cyclical revenue, the 2006 fiscal balance exceeded the budget target. The
general government achieved a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP with balance in the social
security accounts and small surpluses in federal, cantonal and local governments. Together
with asset sales, gross debt fell to 48.2 percent of GDP.
The financial sector is performing well in a favorable cyclical setting. Bank profitability is strong
and financial soundness indicators have improved. The two large Swiss banks are global
players in wealth management and derivatives markets, and as prime brokers to hedge funds
and private equity firms--they need to watch global financial market volatility. Insurance and
pension sectors are recovering from previous balance sheet pressures and low interest rates.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Swiss authorities for their prudent economic management
and sound policy frameworks. In this setting, Switzerland’s economy continues to perform well,
with low inflation and strong employment growth backed by flexible labor markets, and the
short-term growth outlook is strongly positive. The main policy challenge going forward is to
seize the opportunities provided by these favorable developments to further strengthen potential
economic growth, and to address long-term structural and fiscal issues given population aging.
Directors commended the Swiss National Bank’s success in keeping inflation well under control
in recent years, and considered the recent gradual tightening appropriate. They recognized the
importance of ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored, especially in view of
the strong run-up in capacity utilization. In this context, Directors agreed that monetary policy
will need to remain flexible to respond appropriately to inflation signals. With the economy
possibly transitioning to a higher level of potential growth, and absent signs of inflation,
Directors considered that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) should continue to monitor economic
conditions closely, and be prepared to adapt policy as necessary. Directors also recommended
a removal of the regulated link between interest rates and housing rents, noting its distortionary
effects on inflation signals and for publicly-owned banks. Directors noted that the SNB’s
communications strategy, with its rolling three-year inflation forecast, continues to serve
Switzerland well.
Directors reviewed the factors affecting the recent weakness of the Swiss franc, despite rising
policy rates and strong fundamentals. They noted that carry-trades could be temporarily
weakening the franc to a level below its equilibrium, and considered that the present
independent floating exchange rate regime is best to handle these uncertainties. These
developments in carry-trades could also imply important spillover risks for other countries,

3

especially in Eastern Europe, where the Swiss franc—by virtue of its low volatility and the low
Swiss interest rate—is the currency of choice for loans that are contributing to rapid credit
expansion. Directors accordingly supported close monitoring of such lending to limit related
risks.
Directors noted that Swiss external competitiveness is strong. In addition, the large stocks of
foreign assets of domestic pension funds and high-earning multinational corporations in
Switzerland have contributed to a structurally large current account surplus. Thus, Directors
noted that interpreting the surplus is complex and its connection to domestic demand is not
straightforward. Going forward, Directors considered that deeper internal structural reforms
could strengthen domestic demand and potential growth, and make a contribution—appropriate
to Switzerland’s size—to an orderly resolution of global imbalances. In this context, Directors
noted the importance of further liberalization of sheltered sectors, including agriculture.
Directors welcomed the conclusions of the FSAP update that reaffirm the soundness of the
Swiss financial system, and supported its recommendations. The crucial importance of the
Swiss financial sector to both the domestic economy and the global financial system—as well
as its large size and increasing complexity—heighten the need for continued vigilance and for
the highest standards of financial supervision. In this context, several Directors welcomed the
tripartite arrangement for supervisory cooperation between Switzerland, the United Kingdom,
and the United States.
With regard to actions to strengthen financial sector supervision, Directors emphasized that the
new supervisory authority, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), should be
assured both financial and regulatory independence. Continuing efforts will also be important to
evaluate large banks’ operating models and to ensure that liquidity and capital regimes remain
appropriate to changing circumstances. Directors also encouraged the authorities to take the
opportunity of current favorable cyclical conditions to strengthen supervision for some insurance
companies for which heightened risks were identified in last year’s Swiss Solvency Test and to
address underfunding in selected pension funds.
Directors commended the authorities for their strong fiscal performance guided by the valuable
debt brake fiscal rule. Looking forward, they stressed that fiscal stimulus should be avoided and
the integrity of the debt brake maintained. In this regard, many Directors were concerned about
the large one-time expenditures in 2008 that would be treated outside the debt brake. They
therefore welcomed the authorities’ commitment to compensate for this spending in the medium
term. Also, several Directors suggested that, in the current conjuncture, it would be appropriate
that the cantons use their strong tax receipts to build up reserves to absorb future expenditure
needs related to population aging—rather than to cut taxes. Directors looked forward to the
publication of the long-run fiscal sustainability report, which should help to develop a consensus
on the key fiscal challenges and the needed actions.

4

Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the timeliness and quality of some key data
sources.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and
analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs
are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance
of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member
countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use
the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Switzerland is also
available.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Switzerland
June 1, 2007
1.
On behalf of my Swiss authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the stimulating
and constructive discussions and the useful reports. Both the staff report for the Article IV
Consultation and the Financial System Stability Assessment add considerable value to the
domestic policy discussions in Switzerland.
2.
The Swiss economy is in very good shape and the outlook is favorable. After three
years of solid recovery, growth is broad based and the economy is operating at full capacity.
The unemployment rate has fallen below 3 percent, inflation is well below 2 percent, the
budget is in surplus, and public debt has been reduced to less than 50 percent of GDP.
Moreover, as the staff’s Financial System Stability Assessment confirms, the Swiss financial
sector is performing well and strong financial soundness indicators reflect the resilience of
the financial system to the most relevant stress events.
Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
3.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has continued its monetary policy course of gradual
interest-rate normalization initiated in December 2005. The inflation forecast published at the
last quarterly review in March 2007 shows that a central target for the reference interest rate
(i.e., 3-month Libor) fixed at 2.25 percent is still somewhat on the expansionary side and that
the normalization process is not yet completed. Even though some of the SNB’s models
indicate a neutral interest rate of 2.5 percent, the SNB does not attach too much value to a
specific figure for the neutral interest rate, since such figures are very much model-dependent
and cannot be estimated with precision.
4.
The SNB agrees with the staff that the recent behavior of the exchange rate is difficult
to reconcile with fundamentals (i.e., high growth, low inflation, rising interest rates), and
they agree with the appraisal in paragraphs 34 and 35. However, the current weakness of the
Swiss franc needs to be qualified somewhat. While the franc is relatively weak against the
Euro and the pound sterling, it remains quite strong against the US dollar and the Japanese
yen, and the current fluctuations do not appear to be extraordinarily high by historical
standards. Moreover, as pointed out by staff, some depreciation might be due to enhanced
competition and productivity in the non-traded goods sector of the Swiss economy.
5.
The SNB is more cautious in assuming that the Swiss franc may have lost some of its
safe haven status. Over the last years there have hardly been any serious tests for such an
assumption. The SNB does also not believe that the currency’s legal decoupling from gold or
that gold sales diminished the franc’s safe haven status. De facto, the gold link was already
broken in the 1970s. As to the importance of carry trades and hedge funds in causing franc
weakness, the SNB does not have sufficient data to either confirm or reject this hypothesis.

2
6.
The Swiss authorities share the staff’s view that interpreting the large current account
surplus is complex and that the surplus does not connect in a simple way to domestic
absorption. Concerning the question of domestic versus foreign origin, it is indeed the case
that in 2005 nearly 7 pps of GDP of the surplus may be attributable to foreigners. However,
my authorities believe the figure for 2005 to be inflated as a result of unusually high direct
investment income of foreign holdings.
Fiscal policy
7.
The fiscal accounts at all levels of government benefited from strong revenue
performance in 2006, resulting in a general government surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP
according to latest estimates (compared with a budgeted deficit of 1 percent). My authorities
are particularly satisfied with the results at the federal level, where a surplus of 0.5 percent of
GDP allowed the target of a structural balance to be achieved one year ahead of schedule.
8.
Although the better-than-projected fiscal outcome is mainly the result of higher
revenues, expenditure growth continues to be contained. The debt brake introduced in 2003
remains the key instrument for achieving and maintaining a balanced budget over the cycle at
the federal level. It has strong support in the population and in parliament, and the binding
requirements of the rule have facilitated the effective implementation of recent expenditure
reduction programs. As noted by the staff, my authorities are currently considering ways to
further strengthen the debt brake by extending the application of rule-based expenditure
restrictions to areas not yet covered.
9.
One area of particular concern is the treatment of extraordinary expenditure due to
exceptional circumstances. Such expenditure is usually of a one-off nature and can be
substantial, and it would lead to an undue compression of regular spending if it had to be
accommodated within the annual spending ceiling of the debt brake rule. The conditions for
which exceptional circumstances can be claimed are specified in the budget law and have to
be approved by a majority in both houses of parliament.
10.
My authorities would like to emphasize their restrictive approach to extraordinary
spending. Particularly, they would like to dispel any notion that they are using the possibility
of extraordinary spending to circumvent the debt brake. The cumulation of such spending in
2008 is coincidental. Nevertheless, this cumulation has increased the awareness that such
expenditures could potentially undermine the spirit of the debt brake. The authorities are thus
considering ways to introduce a rules-based system to compensate extraordinary spending
with medium-term surpluses. The fact that the debt brake only applies to the Confederation is
less concerning to my authorities, since the fiscal accounts of lower levels of government
have traditionally been sound. Most cantons have various types of instruments to prevent
serious fiscal imbalances, such as fiscal rules and financial referenda.

3
11.
My authorities concur with the staff that they will need to pursue their work on the
long-term fiscal challenges listed in paragraph 30. The authorities would like to further
emphasize that the government has initiated two specific projects to advance this work. First,
in order to reveal the strains on public finances caused by demographic change, a long-term
Fiscal Sustainability Report is being prepared to present projections for the public sector (at
the federal, cantonal and local levels, including social security) up to 2050 under a no-policychange assumption, with sensitivity analyses for key variables such as productivity growth,
interest rates, and demographics. Second, based on the Fiscal Sustainability Report, a
separate document will discuss alternative policy options as part of the medium-term
financial plan of the Federal government. Besides, the ambitious project aimed at
systematically reviewing the full range of tasks of the central government should also help
reduce spending pressures.
Financial Sector
12.
My authorities would like to commend the staff for having set the right priorities in
the FSAP update, and they welcome the overall positive assessment of the health and
resilience of the Swiss financial system. They share the staff’s view that the size, complexity,
and systemic importance of the two large banks represent a major challenge. They concur
with the staff recommendations on enhancing systemic stability, which are being followed up
as a matter of priority:
•

The Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC) is conducting a thorough
assessment of the capital situation of the two large banks as part of the
implementation of the second pillar of Basel II, with a focus on stress tests.

•

The SNB and the SFBC will initiate a regulatory project to improve the supervision
and regulation of liquidity risk at the large banks. They consider it essential for the
stability of the banking sector to ensure that the large banks’ liquidity is
commensurate with their risks.

•

The SNB will endeavor to further improve international cooperation with its foreign
counterparts. The focus will be on the provision of liquidity in exceptional situations.
My authorities fully share the view that international cooperation among regulators
and central banks is important and can effectively contribute to reducing the
probability and costs of a systemic crisis.

13.
With regard to institutional reform, my authorities fully agree that the planned unified
financial supervisory authority (FINMA) should be strong and functionally, institutionally,
and financially independent and adequately staffed. The independence of FINMA is a
prerequisite for the agency to be able to fulfill its supervisory duties. My authorities do not
share the staff’s concerns as to the adequacy of the draft law in this regard, however:

4
•

FINMA will have a comprehensive and effective set of sanctioning measures. Under
the draft Federal Act on FINMA, the sanctioning regime has been harmonized,
streamlined and refined, and new instruments have been introduced (confiscation of
assets, occupational ban, and “naming and shaming”). As to civil money penalties,
the Swiss legal system does not allow for such penalties being imposed by the
supervisory authority. But the present system under which fines can be imposed by
the Federal Finance Department and the cantons (criminal prosecution) has proved
effective and no change is envisaged.

•

My authorities do not believe that there are any provisions in the draft FINMA Act
that impinge on FINMA’s operational independence or prudential powers. The
provisions aim for efficient and effective financial market supervision, taking into
account the principle of proportionality. The latter will not bar FINMA from issuing
adequate regulation and taking appropriate action.

14.
My authorities have a certain degree of dissent with regard to recommendation five of
the assessment. While they agree that there is scope for cantonal banks to strengthen their
governance structures, they do not see clear evidence of distortions in the market conduct of
cantonal banks, given the intensity of competition in Swiss retail banking.
15.
As to the insurance sector, my authorities share the staff’s view that significant
improvements have been made in the regulatory framework and that the financial difficulties
experienced by many large insurers in early 2003 have been overcome. They also concur
with staff that going forward the insurance supervisor should focus on those insurers for
whom heightened risks were identified by last year’s Swiss Solvency Test (SST) field test.
The supervisory authorities will also continue to consult with the reinsurance sector on the
introduction of the SST.
16.
On pension funds, it should first be noted that with an asset volume comfortably over
100 percent of GDP the Occupational Benefit Plan system in Switzerland is well endowed
compared with many other countries. However, there is broad agreement among the
authorities and the industry that pension funds should generally have a higher degree of
coverage and that valuation reserves should be increased further. On the latter, many pension
funds have recently significantly increased their valuation reserves. It should also be pointed
out that legal provisions require pension funds to notify any undercoverage, so as to initiate
corrective measures, on which reports (on implementation and effectiveness) must be
submitted annually to the Federal Council.
17.
While the staff prefers a more uniform and centralized approach to Switzerland’s
pension sector supervision, a decentralized and relatively liberal system is more in keeping
with Swiss tradition and Switzerland’s political system. A central supervisory authority, as
recommended by the staff, is thus currently not on the political agenda. However, significant
improvements with regard to the effectiveness of pension supervision will be achieved with

5
the strengthening of the existing federal supervisory authority. The envisaged new High
Supervisory Board will be able to issue binding standards and regulations and allowed to
carry out on-site inspections of the regional supervisory authorities. It will ensure that the
regional supervisory authorities conduct supervision in accordance with uniform procedures
and pre-defined standards.
