INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation, Fourth Review Under the ThreeYear Extended Credit Facility Arrangement, and Requests for Waivers of
Nonobservance and Modification of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Daniela Gressani and Dhaneshwar Ghura
June 14, 2012

Fund relations: A three-year SDR 77.28 million (120 percent of quota) arrangement
under the ECF was approved on March 15, 2010. Mauritania’s outstanding loans from
the Fund were SDR 54.5 million (84.6 percent of quota) as of May 31, 2012.
Discussions: The team comprised A. Mati (head), Y. Zouhar, R. Blotevogel (all MCD),
and C. Ebeke (SPR). T. Najeh (Resident Representative) assisted. Discussions were held
in Nouakchott during April 29–May16, 2012. The mission met with the president, the
governor of the central bank, the ministers of finance, economic affairs and development,
energy, fishing, and of rural development, other senior officials, and representatives of
the corporate and banking sector, the diplomatic and donor community, civil society,
academia, and a wide spectrum of political parties.
Fourth program review: Based on the strong performance under the program, staff
recommends its completion with one waiver for the nonobservance of the continuous
performance criterion on nonconcessional external debt. Most of the structural reform
agenda is progressing well, although three structural benchmarks were missed because of
delays in administrative and procurement procedures.
Focus of the Article IV consultation: Discussions centered on the authorities’
immediate challenge of maintaining macrostability in the face of the drought and on
building inclusive growth in the medium term.
Exchange rate regime: The exchange rate is de facto classified as other managed
arrangement. Mauritania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3,
and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mauritania’s economy has performed well in 2011, despite significant challenges.
Helped by appropriate policies and high metals prices, real GDP grew 4 percent, inflation fell
back below 6 percent, and record fiscal and external buffers were built. This performance
materialized even though Mauritania faced a severe drought, a slowdown in Europe, and high
international fuel and food prices.
Economic activity will pick up this year and in the medium term thanks to new projects
that will temporarily worsen the external deficit. The rebound in cereal production and
major infrastructure projects will lift growth above 5 percent, while inflation will remain
contained. The external position will significantly deteriorate due to one-off effects linked to
major energy investments and the construction of the new airport—before recovering as new
mineral production comes on line and nonmetals commodity prices fall.
Notwithstanding the favorable outlook, Mauritania faces important short- and
medium-term policy challenges, notably in the social area, where progress in reducing
poverty has been slow and unemployment is still high:


In the short term, maintaining macrostability is essential. While a modest fiscal
loosening is appropriate to accommodate pressing social needs in the aftermath of the
drought, accelerating the phasing out of ill-targeted subsidies is essential to safeguard
fiscal sustainability. To guard against upside inflation risks, the authorities will introduce
a new T-Bill maturity that is under the sole control of the central bank—but paid for by
the Treasury—to gradually absorb excess liquidity. Inflationary pressures from
infrastructure projects and exchange rate depreciation should be closely monitored.



Over the medium term, Mauritania needs to diversify away from commodity exports to
make growth inclusive. Anchoring fiscal policy on non-mining aggregates, creating a
mining fund, strengthening social safety nets, deepening the financial sector, and
persevering with the structural reform agenda are necessary to reduce poverty, create
employment, and reduce the economy’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.

Performance under the ECF-supported program remained strong. All quantitative
performance criteria for end-December 2011 were met with a relatively large margin. The
continuous performance criterion on the contracting of nonconcessional external debt was
missed because of delays in the parliamentary calendar. The structural reform agenda is
progressing according to plan, with the exception of the three benchmarks on public
enterprise audits, external debt strategy, and IFRS quantification, which were missed.

5
I. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Mauritania staged a solid recovery from the global crisis, while confronting
several exogenous shocks. The commodity price boom of the past two years, combined
with prudent policies helped Mauritania restore macroeconomic stability and build reserve
and fiscal buffers. Good progress on structural reforms also contributed to this performance,
which materialized even though Mauritania faced a severe drought and high international
fuel and food prices.
Box 1. Drought: Impact and Emergency Response so Far
Mauritania is being hit hard by the Sahel drought. Wheat production is currently 55 percent below
historical average, and the shrinking of available pastures caused important losses among cattle, which led
to severe wealth and income loss for farmers. As a result, the number of people living in food insecurity has
tripled to 800,000 (25 percent of the population) over the past year, with more than 40,000 children
suffering from acute malnutrition.
Timely government response and better coordination with development partners has been crucial to
reducing the impact of the drought. Early adoption of the emergency response in the 2012 budget and a
revolving trade facility for the public food import company (SONIMEX) have helped rapidly scale up relief.
So far, more than 100,000 tons of wheat and fodder have been distributed to the affected areas, but
additional aid is needed to expand free food distribution, replenish food stocks in rural areas, and implement
cash transfer programs. Following the government’s emergency call last November, the international
community has generously mobilized (about $50 million), leaving a remaining gap of 35 percent of
identified emergency needs not covered by the budget or donors. In view of the urgency of this situation and
while awaiting new donor funds that will be directly channeled through aid agencies, the government has
decided to further increase its contribution to the emergency program (see Section II below).
The response to the drought is further complicated by logistical issues and the massive inflow of
refugees from Mali. Seaport congestion, a weak internal transport system, and insufficient storage capacity
have complicated relief delivery, which has not always been able to keep pace with the large scale of the
response. In addition, the unstable situation in Mali has increased the flow of refugees settling in the SouthEastern part of Mauritania to about 60,000. While development partners (aid is usually channeled through
the HCR, UNICEF, and WFP) currently provide and finance all refugee relief operations, scaling up of the
emergency program may be necessary to meet the needs of an ever-increasing refugee inflow.

2.
Vast challenges, notably in the social area, loom ahead. Given that growth has
been concentrated over the past two years in capital-intensive industries (such as mining and
telecommunications), progress in reducing poverty has been slow and unemployment is still
high. Poor infrastructure and constrained access to finance continue to undermine privatesector development.

3.
Political tensions have recently increased, as the opposition has become more
vocal in the wake of the Arab Spring. New elections in 2009 led to a stable reform-minded
government coalition. The government launched a process of inclusive dialogue with civil
society and the opposition, which led to new constitutional amendments, revision of the
electoral code and, a new independent electoral commission. However, lack of improvements
in general living conditions and perceived governance issues have increased social
discontent, which ultimately led to the largest demonstration in years last March. The
postponement of the legislative elections, possibly to later this year, generates additional
uncertainty and tension.
4.
At the time of the 2009 Article IV discussions, the IMF Executive Board urged the
authorities to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary policies, greater exchange rate flexibility
and broad-based structural reforms to strengthen the financial sector and promote privatesector development. The authorities’ policy response and reform agenda were broadly in line
with these recommendations. Continued implementation of these policies is needed to
enhance the economy’s resilience to external shocks.

also contributed to this performance.


Headline inflation was contained to
5.7 percent (y-o-y), a full percentage point
below expectations, mostly because of
low pass-through of international food
and energy prices. Notwithstanding this
trend, core inflation (excluding food and
energy) has picked up recently, but is not
likely to reflect rising demand pressures
as these are due to one-off adjustments in
administered prices (transport) and excise
duties.

The positive terms of trade shock
associated with the run-up in metals
prices (iron, gold, and copper) during
the first three quarters of 2011 helped
narrow the current account deficit,
albeit by less than programmed, mostly
because of the unexpected decline in
metals prices in Q4 2011. Nonetheless,
gross foreign reserves doubled in 2011
to a recent high of $501.6 million, about
3.6 months of imports.

third year in a row, with the basic
non-oil deficit (excluding grants, interest on external debt, and foreign financed
investment) declining to 0.2 percent of non-oil GDP (about 1.5 percentage point
better than programmed). Higher mining revenues and strong tax collection more than
offset the cost of the emergency program put in place in 2011 to alleviate the impact
of higher commodity prices on the most vulnerable. With a smaller financing
requirement and excess liquidity in the banking system, T-bill yields fell to
unprecedented lows of just below 3 percent.


Monetary policy was accommodative, although the excess liquidity in the banking
system, associated with the unsterilized accumulation of net foreign assets, has not
translated into high private sector credit growth, which remained subdued at just over
10 percent (y-o-y).

III. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook and Risks
6.
Following a difficult year, a pick-up in economic activity—accompanied by
moderately paced inflation and a wider current account deficit—is expected in the
medium term. The rebound in cereal production and major construction projects will offset
the expected decline in demand from Europe and delays in expanding gold production, thus
lifting growth above 5 percent in 2012. Thereafter, expanded mining capacity and large
investment projects already in the pipeline will sustain growth above 5 percent, while
declining international energy and food prices will help contain inflation. After a temporary
and significant widening of the current account deficit (to about 20 percent of non-oil GDP in
2012) because of one-off effects—such as the drought (2.6 percent), major energy
investments, and the construction of the new airport (2 percent)—the external position will
recover through rising mineral production and lower nonmetal commodity prices.

7.
The authorities shared staff’s analysis on the outlook. They pointed out that the
large current account deficit this year would amount to only 8 percent of GDP, after
excluding FDI-financed mining imports. Repatriation of mining proceeds, new concessional
loans and external credit lines (including those for the new airport) will help finance other

9
import needs. As a result, gross foreign reserves are still expected to cover an unprecedented
4.8 months of imports by 2017.
8.

The economic outlook in the short term is subject to the following risks:



A deteriorating external environment: Mauritania’s narrow export base (the mining
sector represents nearly 75 percent of exports) keeps its economy highly vulnerable to
a fall in metals prices and shifts in global demand, particularly from Europe (Box 2)
and to a lesser extent China. The authorities recognized these risks but pointed out
that the baseline scenario already incorporates a 25 percent fall in metals prices; the
authorities expect the buffers accumulated over the past two years to make them more
resilient to a sharp fall in demand (for the impact of a more severe downside risk
scenario, see Box 2 of IMF Country Report No. 11/362).



Additional increases in international food and fuel prices will worsen the external
position, and will place an additional burden on the budget, particularly if it requires
new emergency mitigating measures. An inadequate social safety net would also
negatively affect social stability.



A shortfall in donor assistance, particularly for food aid and refugee assistance
(in case of sustained refugee inflows).



Persistence of the drought. Another rain deficit would further aggravate the nearterm prospect for agriculture and livestock industries, further reducing the income of
the rural poor.



Political context. A flare-up in domestic social unrest or yielding to spending
pressures ahead of the legislative elections could jeopardize macroeconomic stability.

9.
Lack of diversification of the economy and low job creation are key longstanding
concerns. Staff’s baseline scenario is predicated on reforms that generate inclusive growth
and diversify the economy. Implementation shortfalls will impede the authorities’ pro-poor
growth agenda, particularly if actions to address internal bottlenecks, improve governance,
and orient new investments towards developing a domestic industrial base slow down. On the
upside, growth dividends of the ongoing public investment projects could be higher than
assumed in the baseline scenario.

10

Box 2. Mauritania: Spillovers from Europe1
As a small open economy, Mauritania remains highly vulnerable to developments in Europe
through the trade channel. Mauritania’s exports to Europe, which are mostly metals, represent close
to 30 percent of GDP, the highest among LICs. Contagion from Europe through remittances or
financial sector links is limited, although Mauritania is still vulnerable to a shortfall in aid flows from
the continent. That said, when combining all these indicators, Mauritania still appears more
vulnerable to Europe than the typical LIC.

The interconnectedness of Mauritania’s
economy with Europe has increased in recent
years. Staff’s analysis shows that co-movements
with Europe rose markedly from 2000 onward as
mining and fishing started to play a larger role in
the economy. As a result, staff estimates that a
1 percent decrease in Europe’s real GDP growth
lowers Mauritania’s exports by 3.2 percent
(in volume terms).

B. Short-Term Challenge: Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability in the Face of the
Drought and Large Infrastructure Projects

these programs in 2012 should be approved in a revised budget law, remain linked to the
current food crisis and not become a permanent entitlement. To strengthen the targeting, the
existing monitoring system should regularly provide a report on beneficiaries of aid.
11.
Additional mining proceeds will limit the deterioration of the fiscal deficit in
2012. In a repeat of last year’s experience, higher mining revenues (including additional
exceptional dividends from the state-owned mining company amounting to about 2 percent
of non-oil GDP) and stronger tax collection will help pay for a more comprehensive
emergency drought-relief response and higher subsidy payments to the energy sector
(including large arrears repayment). They will also partly compensate the revenue loss
arising from the delay in renewing the fishing agreement with the EU (LOI, ¶9–10). As a
result, the basic fiscal deficit in 2012 will only worsen to 1 percent of non-oil GDP,
0.3 percent of non-oil GDP higher than programmed.
12.
This modest loosening of the fiscal stance is appropriate to face the urgent social
needs caused by the drought. However, staff cautioned against ballooning subsidy
payments, which have increased for two years in a row as a result of various emergency
programs—and amount to 8 percent of GDP in 2012 (as high as the wage bill). Staff urged
1

Non-oil GDP is used to maintain continuity of program targets. However, given that oil resources are small
and that mining industries are increasingly important economically (with new discoveries), focusing on
nonextractive industries is more appropriate (as advocated for the medium term).

12
the phasing out of these programs as soon as possible (see below). It also cautioned against
financing additional expenditures through volatile mining revenues, which is not sustainable
in the long term.
13.
The authorities were adamant that the construction of the new international
airport—a priority project listed in the last two PRSPs—does not entail new fiscal risks
(Annex I and LOI, ¶12). Existing contracts showed that potential financial risks for the new
airport will be borne by the private consortium constructing it. The authorities argued that the
gradual transfer of land to the consortium in exchange of a new airport is a win-win situation
since the government could not sell the land to other parties at a higher price (due to
limitations in existing government regulations). They pointed out that no guarantees or tax
incentives were granted to the private operator, thus preventing revenue loss and potential
contingent liabilities. They disagreed with staff’s notion that it would have been better to use
a bidding process to attribute this market as that is the procedure currently used by the
government to sell land. In the absence of an independent cost-benefit analysis, staff has not
been able to form a view as to whether the fair value of the land will be worth more or less
than the new airport. That said, staff’s baseline macroeconomic scenario accounts for the
largest cost estimate provided for the airport ($300 million, of which two thirds are
imports—see Annex I).
14.
Unwinding excess liquidity in the banking system will enhance the traction of
monetary policy and reduce macroeconomic risks. Bank liquidity, measured by free
reserves, persists at high levels, while T-bill yields are stuck at around 3 percent. Both staff
and the authorities agreed that inflationary pressures could emerge if banks started to rely on
their liquidity cushions to lend more aggressively. Meanwhile, the CBM’s ability to influence
banks’ lending activities is limited (Box 3). To guard against upside inflation risks and
enhance the traction of monetary policy, the authorities will introduce a new short-term
monetary policy instrument that is under the sole control of the central bank—but paid for by
the Treasury—to gradually absorb excess liquidity over the coming 12 months, as
recommended by Fund TA (see Annex II and LOI, ¶14). The CBM also agreed to closely
monitor inflationary effects from large construction projects (notably the new airport and
electricity plant), exchange rate depreciation, and increases in administered energy prices. It
stands ready to raise the required reserve ratio if the new instrument cannot be phased in
quickly enough to remove the excess liquidity.

13
Box 3. Monetary Policy (In)Effectiveness in Mauritania1
Three of the four traditional channels of monetary policy transmission—interest rates,
asset prices, and the exchange rate—are unlikely to be very effective in Mauritania, as
the institutional prerequisites of these channels are missing: (i) consumers and companies do
not have significant savings that would allow them to adjust their consumption and
investment patterns over time; (ii) asset markets with real-time price information do not
exist; and (iii) the closed capital account prevents the exchange rate from adjusting to
monetary policy changes.
This potentially leaves the banking sector as the fourth channel. Staff’s analysis of the
behavior of six Mauritanian banks over the past six years finds that banks’ decision to lend
more did not depend on exogenous increases in their available liquidity. This testifies to a
weak monetary policy transmission mechanism—an experience shared by other low-income
countries (see FO/Dis/12/66).
The bank lending channel would become more effective if liquidity were scarce.
Although there are several binding constraints that undermine monetary policy effectiveness,
absorbing excess liquidity would make the CBM’s policy rate more relevant and stimulate
interbank transactions. The forthcoming new monetary policy instrument (7-day maturity
T-bill) will therefore ultimately put the CBM in a better position to affect bank lending.

The structure of Mauritania’s
economy is a key constraint for poverty
reduction and employment creation.
Mauritania’s productive sectors and export
base have become increasingly concentrated,
with growth over the past decade mainly
driven by the good performance of the mining
sector (particularly iron ore, copper, and gold),
construction and telecommunications
industries. However, these activities have low
employment generation capacities, while
agriculture, which remains the most important
employment and poverty-reducing sector,
continues to be constrained by the lack of a
coherent government strategy, and by
insufficient financing.

Sources: UNCTAD statistics; and IMF staff calculations.

18.
Against this background, both staff and the authorities agreed that Mauritania
needs to diversify its economy away from commodity exports to reduce vulnerabilities
to exogenous shocks and make growth more inclusive. Main strategies include
maintaining macroeconomic stability, creating fiscal space for priority expenditures,
strengthening social safety nets, deepening the financial sector, and pressing ahead with
structural reforms.

15
Fiscal policy remains dependent on mining revenues and needs to be better anchored to

medium term. They aim to gradually reduce the nonmineral deficit to 4 percent of nonmining GDP in 2017, which will help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 54.5 percent of GDP
(a 25 percent of GDP debt reduction after excluding debt relief from Kuwait, see below).
Such a strategy permits for scaling up social and investment spending while saving a fraction
of windfall mining revenues. Fund TA for the creation of a stabilization mining fund later
this year will help in this area.

20.
Subsidy reform and wage bill containment are the cornerstone of the adjustment
strategy (LOI, ¶22–33), which would still allow for higher social and infrastructure
spending. Fiscal consolidation through 2017 will mainly be achieved through:


Subsidy reform (Box 4). The increases in administered diesel prices during 2011
were not enough to eliminate ill-targeted subsidies by early 2012, as planned because
international fuel prices turned out higher than envisaged. However, staff welcomed
the authorities’ introduction of the new petroleum price structure and formula, which
should facilitate the move toward international prices by end-2012 (thus leading to
savings of about 0.4 percent of GDP) and help depoliticize the price setting process.
The mission urged the authorities to put a cap on the monthly increase to ensure that
large international price hikes do not lead to excessive retail price volatility that
would undermine political support for the automatic fuel price formula. Additional
reduction in subsidies will follow the planned increases in electricity tariffs (for large
consumers) and gas prices (LOI, ¶21 and ¶34).



Social safety nets. The scaling up of cash transfer schemes (Box 4), in which the
targeting is benefitting from new poverty and vulnerability studies, should help
protect the poorest from the impact of subsidy removal. The mission also
recommended the use of these new targeted schemes to gradually replace the
―subsidized food shops,‖ which are not always located in the most vulnerable areas
and do not reach the poor who have no disposable cash. It underscored that a
successful subsidy reform strategy must be accompanied by a communication
campaign that explains its benefits to the population.



Civil service reform. The authorities have recently reconciled the civil service
census with the payroll file, and expect to use a unique payroll database as of June
2012. Going forward, the wage bill will be contained at the regional average (about
7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2017). A better human resources framework and a new
organizational audit will also help, with some savings generated by the replacement
of retirees by younger qualified personnel.



Social and investment spending. The authorities and staff agreed on the need to
protect social and investment spending. Capital expenditures averaging about
10 percent of non-oil GDP over the period, which are increasingly domestically
financed, allow for large infrastructure projects planned in the areas of energy, road
infrastructure, water and agriculture. Staff estimates that this increase is realistic and
in line with Mauritania’s implementation capacity, which has improved considerably:
as 98 percent of total investment spending was executed in 2011.

17
Box 4. Mauritania’s Progress in Diesel Subsidy Reform
While gasoline products are not subsidized in Mauritania, the government remains committed
to phasing out inefficient diesel subsidies, which benefit mostly the rich. However, the steady
1.5 percent monthly increase in diesel prices observed since January 2011 was not enough to
completely eliminate subsidies in 2012, as the latest wave of international fuel price increases
widened the price gap.

A simplified price formula for petroleum products will allow for a faster alignment of fuel retail
prices with international levels. This new formula, in effect since May 2012, has been agreed with
petroleum distribution companies, and will help reduce the current price gap by one third. Additional
ad hoc price increases—about 10 percent—over the next six months should eliminate the remaining
gap. Once that is closed, the automatic formula will start being applied on a biweekly basis.

Concurrently, the government is finalizing, with the assistance of the WFP, a cash transfer
program. This program, which was rapidly put in place, targets 10,000 vulnerable households in
Nouakchott identified through the recent poverty survey. Each household will receive UM 15,000
monthly (equivalent to half of the legal minimum wage) via a bank transfer. A positive side effect is
that beneficiaries will also gain access to financial services. The program was extended in June to
15,000 households in four rural areas deemed of high food insecurity, with the targeting to be
improved later in the year once the poverty survey for the rest of the country is completed.

18


Public financial management (LOI, ¶27–30). Greater spending should be
accompanied by more transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the use of public
resources. Recognizing this requirement, the authorities introduced a functional
budget classification, created a Treasury Single Account, and committed to limiting
the use of treasury advances. The government also made an inventory of domestic
arrears, which will be repaid over a three-year period. This repayment plan
complements the clearing of arrears in the energy sector, of which 1 percent of GDP
is scheduled for 2012.

Staff agreed with the authorities’ intention to consider options that will enhance
revenues from the extractive industries. Progress made in recent years to augment nonmining revenues should be sustained,

weakened Mauritania’s mining taxation
regime, which today mobilizes less
revenue for the state than in other resource-rich countries.
22.
The government and staff agreed that new mining contracts should not grant
new exemptions and instead be directly governed by the mining code. However, any
intention to renegotiate existing contracts should be explored prudently, and only in a
mutually agreed process with the foreign investor so as to protect Mauritania’s business
climate. Staff recommended closing the existing loophole that allows the transfer of mining
assets (to a nonresident) without any tax incidence (LOI, ¶23–24). In the meantime,
Mauritania has become a fully compliant member under the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), which should help transparency.
23.
The authorities shared staff’s debt sustainability concerns, and underscored
their commitment to rely on concessional borrowing. After declining by over
70 percentage points following the 2006 MDRI initiative, and by another 8 percentage points
following debt cancellation from Algeria and Libya in 2010, the PPG debt ratio is hovering
around 83 percent of GDP at end-2011. Stress test scenarios indicate that Mauritania’s risk of
debt distress is moderate. Continued fiscal prudence and debt relief from Kuwait are
necessary to improve the medium-term debt outlook (see DSA). Development and adoption

19
of a medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) will guide the authorities in their
future borrowing decisions.
Financial sector: Pushing for further deepening
24.
The banking system remains relatively stable. Mauritanian banks have large
liquidity cushions and are adequately capitalized. Their profitability, while weak, has not
been significantly affected by the decline in T-bill yields last year. The main concern is weak
asset quality, although risks are somewhat mitigated by high provisions, particularly for
legacy loans, which account for the bulk of nonperforming loans.

The authorities view the financial sector as a fundamental driver of growth.
They recently finalized a comprehensive financial sector strategy, which includes a wellsequenced reform plan. In line with the plan’s strategic priorities, the authorities are
continuing to focus on enhancing banking system stability (LOI, ¶16) by strengthening
banking supervision, establishing higher bank capital requirements, and overhauling the
regulatory framework. The mission also emphasized the need to closely monitor the risk
profile of the banking sector, which may change significantly in response to the decline in
T-bill yields and the possible entry of two new banks. It also encouraged the authorities to
carefully monitor banks’ compliance with prudential standards. Special attention should be

(see SIP) show that Mauritania’s private-sector credit as a share of GDP is above its
structural benchmark, the level remains below the regional average. Moreover, high
concentration risks in banks’ loan portfolios and widespread related-party lending imply that
banks only finance a limited number of economic activities and actors. Such business
strategies limit people’s access to banking services, a key ingredient for inclusive growth,
and reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy (see SIP). To encourage banks to develop
commercial relationships with a larger and more diversified customer base, the authorities
agreed that the priorities are to:


boost the potential for credit-worthy demand through more formalization of economic
activity (other factors such as growth in real economic activity would also need to be
present to make this channel effective);



reinforce the supply of credit through more effective implementation of concentration
and connected lending regulations; and



improve the institutional infrastructure, notably the interbank market and creditor rights.

Structural reforms: Improving the weak business environment to boost private-sector
growth and diversify the economy
27.
Structural impediments inhibit Mauritania’s growth over the medium term.
Mauritania’s concentrated export sector and underdeveloped manufacturing base limit
spillovers to more labor-intensive sectors. Moreover, businesses report that corruption,
regulatory quality, access to finance, costs of cross-border trading, and weak infrastructure
and logistic systems all hamper private-sector performance (Box 5). Businesses have also
regularly complained about the inadequacy of labor skills and rigid employment regulations.

21

Box 5. Business Environment and Governance
Mauritanian companies face severe bottlenecks when conducting business, particularly in accessing
credit and dealing with customs administration. However, new streamlined procedures for obtaining
operating licenses and recent reforms in tax administration and in construction regulations have
helped lift Mauritania’s ranking over the past five years (though from a very low initial level). The
Mauritanian press can operate relatively freely according to the 2011 Press Freedom Index compiled
by Reporters Without Borders. While other governance indicators are in line with income levels,
Mauritania is one of the few countries that have experienced a deterioration in the quality of
governance; particularly in the enterprise survey indicator that measures perceived corruption, which
has worsened over the 2000–09 period, although it improved slightly in 2009.

28.
The authorities are taking a number of steps to enhance the investment climate.
These involve the implementation of the new investment code and the establishment of a
one-stop shop for business registration. Moreover, while the mission welcomed the tax
administration’s collection efforts, it stressed the need to preserve taxpayers’ rights to ensure
that firms’ ability to function is not hampered. To that end, the authorities agreed
(LOI, ¶24–25) to modernize the appeal procedure, strengthen communications with the
private sector, and repay regularly tax credits due (including VAT refunds for mining
companies). The mission welcomed government steps to tackle corruption (LOI,¶38), but
urged more action on the governance front, particularly in (i) quickly drawing up and
implementing the action plan of their recently adopted anti-corruption strategy; and
(ii) systematically applying the new procurement code procedures to all public projects.
29.
Additional labor market policies are necessary to create a sufficient number of
employment opportunities. Rapid population growth and a relatively weak education
system make it difficult to absorb all new labor market entrants, thus keeping unemployment
high (Annex IV). The authorities recognized the challenges in the labor market but
underscored the importance of several initiatives underway: (i) a strategy that addresses the
skill mismatch in the labor market; (ii) new professional programs for the young and
unemployed; (iii) new investments and projects in the agricultural and fisheries sectors; and
(iv) new microfinance programs. Staff emphasized that addressing high unemployment and
poverty will require a more comprehensive reform strategy for the agricultural sector, given
its potential as an employment generator in Mauritania. A more depreciated exchange rate
could accompany agricultural reform to give greater incentives to domestic food processing
businesses that substitute basic food imports.
IV. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN
30.
Program implementation has been strong. All relevant performance criteria for
end-December 2011 were met by a relatively large margin except for one continuous
performance criterion (LOI, Table 1). The continuous criterion on non concessional external
debt was not observed because of a three-week delay in parliamentary approval of a
nonconcessional loan that was programmed to take place in 2011. Staff supports the granting
of a waiver as it considers the delay a minor deviation, which has no bearing on debt
sustainability. Most of the authorities’ ambitious structural reform agenda is progressing
well, although benchmarks up to March 2012 on public enterprise audits, external debt
strategy, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) quantification were missed,
partly because of delays in procurement and administrative procedures. (LOI, ¶2 and Tables
2a and 2b).
31.
Program design and monitoring remain broadly unchanged. However, the
authorities are proposing to revise downward the end-June performance criteria for NIR
accumulation by $33.5 million and increase the target for NDA by UM17 billion to account
for higher reserve buffer stocks in 2011, allow for lower metals prices in 2012, and

23
accommodate the rebound in economic activity (LOI, ¶41 and Table 1). The end-June fiscal
target will be revised upwards to account for higher mining revenues in Q2 2012. New
quantitative targets for end-2012 are set in the attached LOI (Table 1). Structural benchmarks
continue to focus on the following macro-critical areas: public financial management,
subsidy reform, banking supervision, and CBM transparency and accountability
(LOI, Table 2b).
32.
Capacity to repay and safeguards assessment. Mauritania’s capacity to repay the
Fund is adequate (Table 7). The move toward IFRS adoption has recently stalled but is
expected to accelerate once the exercise of quantification of differences between the IFRS
and Mauritanian standards in CBM’s 2011 financial statements has been completed. The
CBM is making some progress in removing the qualifications expressed in the 2010 audit
opinion regarding public-sector debt owed to the central bank. Meanwhile, the CBM’s
accounts and program targets will continue to be audited by an international firm, a key
recommendation of the 2010 safeguards assessment update.
33.
Data provision. It is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but data gaps,
linked to capacity constraints, still encompass many areas, including national accounts,
balance of payments and social and labor markets indicators. A plethora of new surveys
(including a replacement for the outdated CPI index and on employment), as well as
additional Fund and World Bank technical assistance, will help strengthen data quality
(LOI, ¶39).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Mauritania’s macroeconomic performance has been robust, but the outlook is
subject to significant external risks. Economic activity has been resilient, with the
commodity price boom of the past two years and prudent policies more than offsetting a
severe drought and high international food and fuel prices. The outlook for 2012 and beyond
is encouraging, but remains highly vulnerable to shocks in external demand, metals prices,
and donor support. Moreover, the persistence of high levels of poverty and unemployment is
a clear warning sign that the country’s productive and export bases need to become broader.
35.
Prudent monetary policy supported by a flexible exchange rate will be key to
containing inflation. Staff welcomes the CBM’s intention to guard against inflationary
pressures. The use of a new short-term monetary policy instrument will allow the CBM to
absorb excess liquidity, thereby reducing macroeconomic risks. Staff estimates the exchange
rate to be modestly overvalued, and the flexible exchange rate that has served Mauritania
well should be maintained and used to resist any bias against depreciation.
36.
The government’s fiscal consolidation strategy appropriately addresses longstanding vulnerabilities. In the near term, a modest loosening of the fiscal stance in 2012 is
appropriate, although relief expenditures will need to be quickly phased out once the drought
emergency lapses. Moreover, financing additional expenditures through volatile mining

24
revenues is not sustainable, and fiscal policy over the medium term should be delinked from
fluctuations in international commodity prices, notably through the envisaged creation of a
new mining fund. The ongoing subsidy reform, accompanied by the expansion of welltargeted social safety nets, as well as greater revenue mobilization, will generate the needed
fiscal space. Options to increase revenues from the resource-extractive industries should be
explored, although any renegotiation of existing contracts should be balanced so as to protect
Mauritania as a destination for foreign investors.
37.
Concessional financing and debt relief are critical for preserving debt
sustainability. Reaching agreement on outstanding debt relief is necessary to further reduce
Mauritania’s vulnerability to external shocks. The drawing up of a medium-term debt
strategy will guide the authorities’ future borrowing decisions. Care should be taken to guard
against any potential contingent liabilities or macroeconomic risks that could emanate from
large private infrastructure projects.
38.
Mauritania’s banking system has been stable, but financial intermediation needs
to deepen to make growth more inclusive. Staff is encouraged by the authorities’ ongoing
efforts to strengthen bank supervision, which is crucial at a juncture where banks’ risk profile
may evolve rapidly. Strictly applying recently improved regulations on connected lending
and concentration risk, encouraging potential borrowers to move into the formal economy,
and enhancing better creditor rights will help make growth more inclusive by giving people
access to financial services. In addition, these reforms will contribute to strengthening the
monetary policy transmission mechanism.
39.
Structural reforms will be essential to raise private-sector growth, boost job
creation, and diversify the economy. The implementation of the new investment code and
the establishment of a one-stop shop are welcome. Bolder and deeper reforms are needed to
preserve taxpayers’ rights, increase employment in the agricultural sector, and diversify the
economy with the emergence of a domestic industrial base. The authorities’ full compliance
with EITI is a welcome step in strengthening governance and transparency, but
implementation of the anti-corruption strategy should be pursued vigorously and the new
procurement code should be consistently applied to all public projects.
40.
Based on the strong performance under the program, staff recommends
completion of the fourth review under the ECF arrangement. It also recommends
approval of the request for modification of the end-June 2012 performance criteria, a waiver
for the nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on nonconcessional external
debt and the establishment of new performance criteria for end-December 2012.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held within 24 months, in
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles, Decision No. 14747–(10/96)
(9/28/2010).

ANNEX I: MAURITANIA—NEW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
The Mauritanian authorities have long considered the construction of a new
international airport in Nouakchott a strategic infrastructure investment. The need for
such a project was first expressed in 1975 as a way to address limitations of the current
runway and the airport’s proximity to the city. The authorities hope that the new airport will
become a hub for the sub-region, thereby boosting employment and tourism activity. This
reasoning explains why the last two PRSPs (2006–10 and 2011–15) list the airport as a
priority investment.
The government considered several financing alternatives over the last few years before
settling for a ―land for construction swap‖. First in 2005, several scenarios were presented
by a Chinese company for the construction of a new airport, with costs varying from
$460 million to $1 billion. Other companies were approached, but the government judged
offers too costly. As a result, the government agreed in a convention signed in November
2011 to cede to a local private consortium ENNAJEH Major Works (NMW SA)1—which
consists of a banking group (BNM) and Cement of Mauritania—lands totaling 451 hectares
(4.51 million m2) divided into a residential neighborhood (one third) and the old airport land
(two thirds). In exchange, the consortium committed to building within 24 months2 a modern
airport that can receive up to two million passengers a year and be fully in line with
international standards. The same public entity that is currently managing the old airport will
run the new one.
Work on the new airport has already started. One runway of the new airport has been
paved and ENNAJEH expects to complete construction works by January 2014. An
international cabinet has been hired by the authorities to ensure the new airport meets all
international standards (construction, safety). Data on the costs remains somewhat limited:


Airport cost: Assessments conducted in the past by Chinese and French consulting
firms have set the cost of a new airport between $0.4 and $1 billion. NMW SA
expects its cost to be between $200–300 million (60 percent for runway construction
and 40 percent for airport buildings). By prudence, staff’s macroeconomic scenario
assumes a cost of $300 million, of which about 40 percent will be borne the first year,
with the remaining 60 percent during the second year.

1

The project was granted to ENNAJEH without going through a public procurement process. According to
Mauritanian officials, this particular arrangement is not governed by the public procurement code since no
monetary transaction, external financing, or tax exemption were granted.
2

The old airport land is only expected to be transferred back to the private operator once the new airport is fully
operational (for a month).

42


Land valuation: No data on an independent land appraisal (including for the old
airport land) has been communicated to staff, which makes it difficult to measure the
financial merits of the land for airport swap. However, the government currently
considers the residential land to be worth only UM600 per m2, as was the case for
many similar transactions in the past and in conformity with prevailing regulations
(e.g., for some road construction). Such a price would have generated revenues of
UM2.7 billion (approximately $9 million or 0.2 percent of GDP). On the other hand,
the residential land (156 hectares) could be sold for at least UM18 billion3
($65 million) following some minor rehabilitation work by the private operator. The
value of the old airport land is not known, but private operators estimate that it could
be valued at an even higher price, thus reportedly ensuring a substantial profit for the
consortium once the international airport is operational.

The direct budgetary impact of the new transaction is expected to be minimal. The
current contract implies no direct on-budget costs (except for some minimal logistical costs
at the end of the project) and no contingent liabilities arising from the transaction—the
government did not provide any guarantee and is under no obligation to finish work. If the
construction halts: the contract explicitly states that the consortium would not obtain the old
airport land until they complete the new international airport. Moreover, the new transaction
would not impact the monitoring of the fiscal targets under the ECF-supported program,
which are measured under a modified cash basis and using GFSM 1986.4 However, the
exclusion of this project from the budget weakens transparency since parliamentarians did
not have a chance to approve this project.
Financing of the airport will be through land sale proceeds, operators’ own resources
and external financing; large associated imports will worsen the current account
deficit:


After some minimal rehabilitation, ENNAJEH has started to progressively sell off the
residential land (156 hectares) (for which demand from Mauritanian immigrants
abroad is reportedly high), up to as much as $100 million. Sales proceeds and
available own resources leave a shortfall of $180 million that the private consortium
expects to meet through trade financing facilities from EXIM banks in the GCC and
India (for about $100–$140 million), with the remaining coming from local
commercial bank loans (some banks not affiliated with the consortium have already

3

Assuming a conservative price of 11,000 UM/m2, which is prudent given that the first tranche of lands were
reportedly sold for 15,000 UM/m2.
4

Under GFSM 2001, the transaction will be recorded as a disposal of nonfinancial assets and the counterpart
will be an acquisition of a financial asset (shares), thus not affecting gross operating balance but improving the
net lending/borrowing balance.

43
expressed interest in financing the project). These loans are expected to be paid off
thorough proceeds from the sale of residential lands developed over the old airport.


In the short term, this project could create 600 jobs and boost growth by
0.2 percentage points. Import costs are likely to total $200 million over a two-year
period, thus worsening the current account deficit by about 2 percent of GDP in 2012
and 3 percent in 2013. Over the longer run, the authorities expect this project to help
develop tourism in the country while promoting much-needed modern urban
development.

44
ANNEX II: LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IN MAURITANIA
The Mauritanian banking system is in a state of excess liquidity. Banks’ free reserves
held at the Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM) rose to UM 33 billion by the end of 2011,
about 520 percent more than the 5-year average to end-2010. At the same time, T-bill yields
fell to unprecedented lows of just below three percent. The fundamental cause of the surge in
liquidity was an unsterilized influx of foreign exchange, which flowed into the banking
system through three channels, all approximately equally important:


Higher spending by mining companies. The producers of iron ore, copper, and gold
surrender a share of their export receipts to the CBM, mainly to cover their expenses
in local currency, which consist of: (i) salaries and fees of local employees and
service providers; (ii) domestic investment projects; and (iii) taxes and dividends to
local shareholders. These payments tend to be proportional to the turnover of these
companies, which reached record highs in 2011.



Reduced bank borrowing by the Treasury and state-owned enterprises. A
stronger fiscal position, increased settlement of government arrears, and timely
budget transfers to public enterprises have significantly lowered public sector
borrowing needs.



Entry of two banks in 2011. Externally-financed capital increases automatically
raise free reserves, which are the asset counterpart to capital.

So far, abundant banking sector liquidity has had no negative macroeconomic effects.
By end-2011, both 12-month inflation and credit growth have stayed relatively subdued at
5.5 and 10.1 percent, respectively. The main reason behind the benign unfolding to date is
that banks’ lending decisions do not seem, at the margin, to be driven by the amount of free
reserves in the system; instead, banks mainly do business with a small number of economic

45
actors active in a limited number of commercial activities (see Selected Issues Paper). In
addition, banks’ incentive to hold excess reserves has increased somewhat with the
introduction of a rule restricting the access to the foreign exchange market to 130 percent of
banks’ free reserves.
An adequate operational toolkit to drain the excess liquidity is currently lacking.
Historically, the main instrument for liquidity management has been T-bills, and the amounts
issued to the banking sector for budget financing purposes usually coincided with the CBM’s
sterilization objectives. Conflicting objectives only manifested themselves last year when the
Treasury was hesitant to issue T-bills solely for monetary purposes. However, the CBM was
unable to act independently as it did not have sufficient financial resources to conduct largescale sterilization operations. The only other two instruments left in its liquidity management
toolkit—foreign exchange sales and reserve requirements—were not deemed suitable as their
use would have either slowed reserve accumulation or created problems for a few individual
banks without surplus liquidity.
Recent Fund TA identified two main options for enhancing the liquidity management
framework. Option (i) is to introduce a new T-bill maturity that is under the sole control of
the central bank but paid for by the Treasury. Option (ii) is to recapitalize the CBM to a
degree that is sufficient for the CBM to pay for its own liquidity management instrument.
The advantage of option (i) is that it can be implemented in the very short term, while option
(ii) would require a lengthy political consultation process between the Treasury, CBM, and
parliament.
The authorities have chosen to implement the first option, which will require close
coordination between the Treasury and the CBM. A memorandum of understanding will
specify the technical details of the new framework and will be adopted by June (structural
benchmark). Operationally, this implies:


Regular coordination meetings: The Treasury and the CBM will meet once per
week at the Director General level to discuss total T-bill issuance. The Treasury
informs the CBM of the amounts needed for budget financing purposes, at which
point the CBM independently decides which residual amounts, if any, need to be
sterilized.



A new instrument: The amount corresponding to the CBM’s weekly sterilization
objective will be raised through the issuance of a new dedicated liquidity
instrument—a 7-day maturity T-bill.



A sterilization account: The issue receipts are credited to a sterilization account at
the CBM, to which the Treasury has no access. At maturity, the 7-day T-bills are

46
reimbursed by debiting the sterilization account for the principal and the Treasury’s
Single Account for the accrued interest.


Interest payments covered by the budget: To ensure transparency and
accountability, the CBM will provide to the Treasury at the time of the annual budget
preparation process the estimates of yearly sterilization costs that are consistent with
its monetary framework. These estimates will be fully reflected in the budget, and a
memorandum of understanding between the CBM and the Ministry of Finance will
summarize the operational details of the arrangement.

The new instrument will be introduced gradually to avoid destabilizing budget
financing. An upfront communication campaign explaining the modalities of and motivation
for the new instrument will be an integral part of the implementation of the new framework.
Concretely, the CBM will make clear that the amounts offered at the 7-day horizon will
initially be small to prevent banks from rebalancing their T-bill portfolio excessively towards
the new maturity. This will enable all market participants to gather experience with the new
instrument without negatively affecting the issuance of the traditional T-bill maturities for
budget financing purposes. Costs to the budget in 2012—assuming a sterilization objective
corresponding to a third of current levels of excess liquidity—would be manageable as it
represents less than 0.1 percent of GDP. If necessary, the CBM will conduct fine tuning
operations in between T-bill auctions to address excessive volatility in banks’ resources.
In the medium-term, the CBM could envisage greater independence by bearing all
monetary policy costs and issuing its own instrument. A prerequisite for this step is that
the CBM regains financial independence on a sustainable basis, preferably through a
recapitalization. From a technical perspective, the most straightforward way of transferring
the necessary resources to the CBM would be to restructure its large nonnegotiable claim on
the government at market conditions. This claim, which currently accounts for over a third of
the CBM’s balance sheet, carries nonmarket terms with an average yield of just over
3 percent and a weighted remaining maturity of 27 years. With its financial independence
assured, the CBM could then use the restructured marketable claims to conduct monetary
policy or develop its own instrument—remunerated term deposits, central-bank bills, or
reverse repos—depending on market conditions.

47
Annex III: External Stability
Mauritania’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated moderately over the
last three years. The driving force was an 18 percent slide in the nominal exchange rate,
whereas positive inflation differentials with the main trading partners in Europe and East
Asia (about 10 percent) limited the extent of the depreciation in real terms. Compared to the
beginning of the decade, the pace of the nominal depreciation has quickened in the last three
years as the authorities have started to move away from a managed float system that tried to
resist depreciation pressures and fluctuations of the ouguiya against the U.S. dollar.
Mauritania’s exchange rate appears to be modestly overvalued. The macroeconomic
balance approach suggests an overvaluation of 2.3 percent and 12 percent in the case of
CGER framework and Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011) methodology, respectively. The
external sustainability and equilibrium real exchange rate approaches indicate an
overvaluation of around 10–12 percent. The current account deficit over the medium term is
consistent with the current account norm.

Exchange rate movements are not a primary driver of export performance. Mauritania’s
strong export growth in 2011 was mainly due to strong global demand. As a resource-rich
country that almost exclusively exports mining products, oil, and fish, Mauritania currently
has little scope for product or price differentiation in global markets, as shown by the little
diversification of both export contents and their destinations, and by the lower degree of
sophistication of its exports. However, over the medium term, a more depreciated exchange
rate could help spur the development of new industries. Moreover, high dependence on
imports of basic consumption goods including food indicates a potentially important role of
import substitution industries in Mauritania’s development.

existing empirical studies on cross-country estimates of the marginal product of capital for
low-income economies like Mauritania),2 implying that reserve coverage in Mauritania is
still below its optimal level.
Mauritania’s current account deficit is mostly financed through concessional loans and
long term foreign direct investment in the mining sector. These relatively stable flows—
and a closed capital account—reduce the vulnerability of Mauritania’s economy to capital

Annex IV: Challenges in Tackling High Unemployment in Mauritania
Unemployment remains high in Mauritania, particularly among the youth and women.
Demographic dynamics, a severe skills mismatch, and a lack of labor intensive industries all
contributed to keeping unemployment high. Broadening production in the agricultural sector,
strengthening access to finance, and enhancing professional and technical education will
help develop new job opportunities.

Youth unemploynment rate

Unemployment in Mauritania is high, particularly among the young. Unemployment is
currently estimated at about 31.2 percent, slightly lower than in 2004, but higher than all

Tackling unemployment is likely to remain quite challenging. Pressures in the labor
market are likely to continue over the medium term because of:

young population (under

to 53,000 new job seekers each
year, which corresponds to a

most developed sectors of the
economy, such as the mining industry, have low spillovers to other sectors in the
economy and generate few jobs (less than 1 percent of total employment). Low
investment in the agricultural sector, which absorbs a quarter of all workers over the

51
last few years was associated with tepid growth, further complicating prospects for
new job seekers. Moreover, the lack of labor-intensive industries such as tourism and
garment-textile leads to even fewer employment opportunities. Most of these jobs are
however in the informal sector.


Skills mismatch. More than 60 percent of Mauritania’s SMEs rate job seekers’ lack
of skills as a severe obstacle to growth. This reflects the low education level of the
labor force, with Mauritania lagging significantly the region particularly at the
secondary and tertiary levels (see chart). Only 17 percent of the high school seniors
obtained the baccalaureate degree necessary to access higher education, and those
graduating with a technical and scientific degree represented less than one-third of the
total.

Looking ahead, the primary sector will remain the main employer in Mauritania. Few
job opportunities in the public sector (less than 2,000 workers are expected to retire in the
next five years) and the capital-intensive nature of the mining sector will put most of the
burden for absorbing new entrants in the labor force on the primary sector whose potential
remains unexploited. To keep unemployment rate at the same level (31.2 percent), the
primary sector will have to absorb 80 percent of new job seekers, implying that jobs in the
agricultural, livestock and fishery sectors should increase by 6.5 percent annually, which
corresponds to a 10 percent increase in their value-added (historical growth was 0.7 percent).
This latter result—arrived at using a moderate employment elasticity of 0.71—shows how
challenging the unemployment situation is likely to remain in Mauritania.
Mauritania already implemented a number of initiatives to boost job creation and
enhance youth employment. To make a dent in reducing unemployment, Mauritania has to

determinants, ILO 2005‖.

52
fully take advantage of its rich resources (underexploited fertile lands, lack of livestock and
fishery-related industries). Recent government initiatives include:


Rehabilitating about 6,000 hectares of agricultural lands and providing long-term
concessions, notably to some unemployed educated people,



Cleaning Nouadhibou seaport of wrecks, with the assistance of the EU, and build two
fishing ports, which will improve the fisheries infrastructure.



Creating a number of youth-oriented technical and professional schools, which will
help reduce skills mismatch.



Providing incentives to viable labor intensive industries, mostly in nascent industries
such as poultry farming, modern slaughterhouses and dairy production; and



Improving credit access, including by restructuring the agro-credit corporation
(UNCACEM) and through microfinance.

Over the medium term, strengthening the business climate and reforming the
educational system will be key to sustain job creation. Sustained growth will need to be
driven by the private sector. To this end, addressing business climate weaknesses and
infrastructure shortfalls, which hamper the development of high job generating industries
(agri-food, garment, tourism…) is crucial. Improving the quality of education through
reforming the teachers’ training system, and reorienting the education curricula towards
private sector needs would ultimately provide additional hiring incentives for firms.

APPENDIX I.
LETTER OF INTENT
Date: June 12, 2012
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700, 19th Street, NW
Washington, DC 20431
USA
Dear Madam Managing Director:
1.
The government successfully addressed the challenges of consolidating growth and
macroeconomic stability at a time of a severe drought, considerably higher food and energy
prices, and volatile metals prices, particularly for iron ore, at the end of last year. In addition,
the large influx of refugees from Mali has had a major humanitarian impact. By
implementing appropriate economic policies, consistent with the priorities set in our Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), we have been able to foster an environment of
macroeconomic resilience and maintain price stability, while renewing our efforts to improve
the living conditions of our most vulnerable people. Although considerable efforts have been
made to strengthen its ability to withstand exogenous shocks, the Mauritanian economy
continues to face high unemployment and poverty rates, especially in rural areas.
2.
Despite these difficult circumstances, we have met all the quantitative performance
criteria for end-December 2011 (Table 1), with the exception of the criterion on
nonconcessional external debt. This target was missed because of the busy schedule of the
Parliament, which took until January 2012 to approve the nonconcessional loan for the
electricity plant that already figured in the program targets for 2011. As a result, the
government requests a waiver for the nonobservance of this performance criterion.
Moreover, all structural benchmarks (Tables 2a and 2b) were met except for three whose
implementation depends on coordination with donors and other private institutions.
Concretely, these three structural benchmarks include the audit of public enterprises, the
external debt strategy, and the quantification of differences between IFRS and local
accounting standards in the CBM’s financial statement.
3.
This Letter of Intent (LOI) is based on the previous LOI approved by the IMF’s
Executive Board on December 12, 2011. Our macroeconomic policy program will continue
to balance our efforts to consolidate economic stability with the need to respond effectively
to the immediate challenges posed by the drought and high food prices. We are also
determined to fight unemployment and poverty. To achieve the program’s objectives, we are

54
committed to implement prudent, appropriate, and consistent macroeconomic policies, while
making growth more inclusive.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND THE PROGRAM FOR 2011
4.
The Mauritanian economy successfully withstood several exogenous shocks in 2011.
Annual economic growth was 4 percent. This was lower than forecast, but still one of the
highest rates in the Sahel subregion that was hit by the drought. Dynamic activity in the
fisheries, construction and public sectors, as well as in the services industry, partly offset the
large drop in cereal production (35 percent y-o-y). Despite higher international food and oil
prices, inflation was contained at 5.7 percent in 2011 (y-o-y) thanks to lower than expected
credit growth and a smaller pass-through from international prices. Higher costs for oil and
food imports were offset by rising export prices, which considerably reduced the current
account deficit. However, the decline in the current account deficit was less than expected,
owing to a drop in iron ore prices in the final quarter of 2011.
5.
Our performance under the program was satisfactory despite the difficult national and
international environment. All quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2011 were
met except for the one on nonconcessional borrowing:


The basic non-oil deficit, which stood at 0.2% of non-oil GDP, was better than expected
(the program target was 1.6 percent of non-oil GDP). This over-performance was due to
higher mining revenues and ongoing tax collection efforts, which more than offset
additional expenditure linked to rising subsidies for petroleum products and an
emergency program for the vulnerable. The government’s cash surplus reduced the need
to issue T-bills to the banking sector, sharply bringing down T-bill rates to just below
3 percent.



We have focused on the execution of poverty-related spending, which we consider a
priority; thus, the indicative target on pro-poor spending was met by a wide margin for
the second consecutive time.



Net international reserves well exceeded the program target due to high iron ore prices
and our desire to build external buffers that are sufficiently high. Official reserves
doubled in 2011, reaching an unprecedented $501.6 million, corresponding to 3.6 months
of imports.



Broad money grew by 20 percent y-o-y, in line with the program objectives. This enabled
us to meet the program target for net domestic assets.



Regarding the continuous performance criterion on nonconcessional external debt, a
slight delay in our Parliament's timetable held up approval of the nonconcessional loan
from the IsDB for the construction of an electricity plant that was part of the program for

55
2011. As a result, the loan did not become effective until January 2012, with a delay of
only three weeks.
6.
We made significant progress on a number of structural reforms. We achieved all the
structural benchmarks (Tables 2a and 2b) included in the program up to end-April 2012,
except for three: (i) the audit of public enterprises, which experienced some delays due to
donor approval procedures for the recruitment of auditors; the delays have been resolved and
the audits of the five companies will be completed by end-2012; (ii) the external debt
strategy; a first draft has already been prepared but we are counting on technical assistance
from the Fund and the World Bank, scheduled for early June 2012, to improve it and
complete a full medium-term debt strategy, which will be submitted to the Council of
Ministers for approval; and (iii) the quantification of differences in the CBM’s financial
statements between the IFRS and local accounting standards, which will be prepared together
with a new auditor by September 2012. As planned, we also completed the poverty and
vulnerability survey in Nouakchott at end-April, and we expect to extend it to the rest of the
country starting in June 2012.
II. PROGRAM FOR 2012
7.
In spite of the challenging outlook for the world economy, the Mauritanian economy
is forecast to recover strongly in 2012. Led by a strong recovery in agricultural production,
which will benefit from a normal rainy season, and the expected dynamism in the
construction sector, real GDP growth is expected to be 5.7 percent. This forecast already
reflects the slowdown in external demand from Europe and delays in the execution of
investment projects in the gold mining sector. Inflation will remain contained at 6 percent
(y-o-y), reflecting a consistent monetary policy stance and lower food and energy prices in
international markets. The current account deficit will worsen considerably due to the
combined effect of falling exports and sharply rising imports, resulting from the import needs
for the emergency program 2012 (EMEL), the construction of the new electricity plant, and
the new airport. That said, the Mauritanian economy will continue to increase its ability to
withstand exogenous shocks through the accumulation of official reserves (equivalent to
3.8 months of imports at end-2012).
A. The Macroeconomic Program
Fiscal policy
8.
Our fiscal policy for 2012 is based on the need to create additional fiscal space for
emergency spending while maintaining debt sustainability in the short and medium term. For
this reason, the 2012 budget as adopted by the Parliament established EMEL program to
respond effectively to the drought, improve non-mining tax revenue, and phase-out
nontargeted subsidies. Nevertheless, an amendment to the budget will be necessary to meet a
number of pressing needs:

56


Emergency program for the most vulnerable. The EMEL program, operational since
February 2012, has doubled the number of dedicated food shops in rural areas (areas at a
high risk of food insecurity), distributed livestock feed at subsidized prices, and begun
distribution of free food. The total cost of the program was initially estimated at
UM 43 billion, of which UM 23 billion was included in the 2012 budget law. Donors
were able to commit about UM 12 billion, of which less than half has been disbursed, to
be used mainly to supplement the free food distribution program and new cereal banks.
Until additional donor support is fully mobilized, there is an immediate need for
emergency spending of about UM 10 billion to cover deficits, in particular for the
program of replenishing village cereal banks (SAVS). The costs related to the Malian
refugees (currently more than 60,000) are borne entirely by development partners (HCR,
WFP and UNICEF).



Hydrocarbon subsidies. Despite our unwavering efforts to raise fuel prices, it will not
be possible to bring domestic prices to international levels before the end of 2012 owing
to soaring international prices (see below). Additional expenditure of at least 1 percent of
non-oil GDP for fuel subsidies is therefore necessary. In addition, we plan to pay the
subsidies associated with the last three quarters of 2011, which were delayed due to the
approval and payment procedures of the Ministries of Energy and Finance. The new
petroleum price structure, which came into effect in May 2012, immediately reduces the
corrective margin by one-third, thereby driving it to about 10 percent of the full passthrough price. (See section on subsidies below.)



Clearance of arrears: We have drawn up a plan for the clearance of domestic arrears
payable to service providers and petroleum distributers. These payments are scheduled in
2012 though not initially included in the budget and amount to 0.7 percent of non-oil
GDP. This amount also takes into account the early repayment of arrears for tax credits,
including those of mining companies.

9.
With regard to fiscal revenue, we intend to meet the target set in the 2012 budget,
despite the uncertainty over the renewal of fisheries partnership agreement with the European
Union that is currently being negotiated. In the spirit of prudence, and bearing in mind the
higher than expected record profits of the national mining company (SNIM), its board of
directors approved a dividend ratio of 25 percent. In addition, the company will make a
special one-off dividend payment of 7.5 percent of net profits to support the government's
needs, which would generate additional revenues of 1.3 percent of non-oil GDP. The
granting of free fishing licenses (0.6 percent of non-oil GDP), ongoing tax collection efforts,
which have led to a significant increase in taxpayers' declarations, and the increase in excise
duties on tobacco will help meet the revenue target, which will be 29.4 percent of non-oil
GDP. To simplify our tax system, we also intend to study the impact of eliminating the
general tax on income (IGR) with a view to removing it in the 2013 budget law.

57
10.
Taking all of the above developments into account, the fiscal position should register
a slight deterioration. Thus, the basic budget deficit should reach 1 percent of non-oil GDP,
compared with the programmed objective of 0.7 percent. The overall balance is also bound to
deteriorate and should reach 3.5 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012, compared to 1.5 percent in
2011. The worsening of the overall balance in 2012 is temporary, driven by the need to
address the urgent needs of the vulnerable in crisis year, and moderate compared to previous
crisis responses. Financing requirements will be largely met through nonbank financing and
concessional borrowing.
11.
Moreover, to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, we will continue to control
current expenditure through a number of actions, including by: (i) stabilizing the wage bill at
8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012 (see below); (ii) increasing medium-voltage electricity
tariffs following the tariff study planned in July 2012 (tariffs paid by the service sector
already rose in January 2012); and (iii) reducing the corrective margin for LPG. In case of a
revenue shortfall or the need to increase EMEL-related expenditure (which in any case is
temporary), we are committed to make cuts in nonpriority spending, particularly goods and
services.
12.
The construction of a new international airport in Nouakchott will not entail any
expenditure for the government, apart from the transfer of land and some minor expenditure
related to the operation of the airport. The decision to build the airport, which the PRSP
originally envisaged as a public-private partnership, was driven by the vision to create a
modern aviation hub that allows Mauritania to play a leadership role in the region. The
financing of this project (total cost are estimated at $200–300 million) will have no impact on
the public treasury, since the government’s payment consisted of a land transfer (including
part of the location of the old airport) to a private consortium. The government has not
provided and will not provide any guarantee or tax concessions to the consortium and the
land transfer will take place gradually as the project progresses. An international firm
specializing in airport construction is responsible for inspecting and certifying the
construction works. When the work is complete, the government will pay around $25 million
for navigation systems and the installation of public utilities. The private operator will not be
able to sell any of the old airport land (including forward transactions) to third parties until
the new airport is finished. Imports linked to this project (approximately $200 million over
two years) and other related transactions are all subject to the standard tax system.
Monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies
13.
Monetary policy will seek to ensure price stability and anchor inflation expectations.
The banking system continues to have abundant liquidity (mainly stemming from the good
performance of the export sector), but this has not been accompanied by a strong acceleration
in credit that would generate inflationary pressures. For 2012, monetary policy will remain
prudent, targeting a growth of money supply of 13 percent. This target accommodates a
modest pickup in credit linked to the construction of the new airport. The monetary

58
authorities are prepared to tighten monetary policy to contain any inflationary pressures by
using indirect instruments such as reserve requirements or T-bill issuances.
14.
We will work to strengthen the independence of the Central Bank of Mauritania
(CBM) by creating the preconditions for endowing it with a flexible and autonomous
monetary policy instrument. For this purpose, and in accordance with the recommendations
of the Fund technical assistance mission, we will introduce a new T-bill maturity (one week)
solely destined to sterilize excessive excess liquidity. The legal framework will be such that
the cost associated with the issuance of this instrument will be borne by the Ministry of
Finance. To make this new framework operational, a memorandum of understanding
between the Ministry of Finance and the CBM will be signed by June 2012 (new structural
benchmark). The CBM will conduct an information campaign for commercial banks to
explain the functioning of the new liquidity management framework. We also intend to
improve central bank operations by:


resuming the weekly meeting of the Coordination Committee between the CBM and
the Treasury. The committee will play a crucial role in the coordination of monetary
and fiscal policy;



improving liquidity forecasts by systematically integrating the cash flows forecasts of
the government and SNIM;



renegotiate the terms of the government debt owed to the CBM with a view to
recapitalize the CBM and provide it with substantial resources for the conduct of its
monetary policy. An agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the CBM will
be presented to Parliament during its next session.

15.
As regards exchange rate policy, we will endeavor to consolidate the recent
achievement that improved the functioning of the foreign exchange market. We are
committed to the swift execution of foreign exchange transactions of commercial banks in
accordance with regulatory time limits. Moreover, we adopted a new instruction aimed at
improving foreign exchange repatriations by the fisheries sector, which improves the
traceability of such transactions. In line with its mandate, the CBM will also continue its
efforts in enhancing the functioning of the foreign exchange market as well as the
transparency of its operations. In this context, it will continue to supply foreign exchange to
the market by regularly selling a portion of the repatriated mining revenues. Sales of foreign
exchange will take place during market sessions and off-market sales will be limited to
exceptional urgent transactions. A detailed summary of the transactions made in the foreign
exchange market will be published, together with a list of all foreign exchange operations
undertaken by the CBM.
16.
The reform of the financial system will be accelerated with a view to deepen financial
intermediation, safeguard financial stability, and address the weaknesses identified by IMF
technical assistance. Moreover, the recommendations of the comprehensive financial sector

59
reform strategy, prepared in collaboration with the World Bank and currently being
validated, will help us to decide on the priorities and sequencing of reforms. The minimum
capital requirement for banks, which was UM 5 billion in 2011, has been raised to
UM 6 billion by the end of 2012, including for the two new Islamic banks that have received
banking licenses by the CBM. Our focus will be on:


Development of long-term saving. To allow banks to mobilize stable resources, we
adopted a draft instruction aimed at removing the interest rate floor on savings
accounts for all accounts exceeding UM 5 million. Similarly, the instruction foresees
reducing the interest rate ceiling for small savers, which will now be linked to the
T-bill rate.



Continuous monitoring of risks. With the assistance of the World Bank, we have
launched the computerization of the credit bureau and initiated the setting up of a
database on default payments. The international audit of commercial banks, financed
by the World Bank, will be available during 2012 and will serve to monitor
developments in the nonperforming loan portfolio.



Related-party lending. In March 2012, we issued a new instruction, approved by the
Monetary Policy Council, on related-party lending (structural benchmark) and
assessed its impact on the banking system. In accordance with the instruction, the
three banks in breach with the new regulation will have until 2014 to bring
themselves into compliance.



Strengthening of banking system regulations and supervision. In collaboration with
the West AFRITAC technical assistance, the CBM has implemented a new
instruction to phase in a new capital adequacy framework consistent with Basel II. In
addition, a draft revision of the Banking Law in priority areas (in particular
reinforcing the independence of the CBM) is currently in preparation. In the short
term, the BCM will continue to strengthen the financial and human resources of the
banking supervision department and ensure that all banks respect the existing
prudential rules and regulations. Penalties for breaching thresholds on foreign
exchange positions will be increased if they turn out not to be stringent enough. With
the support of AFRITAC West, we will initiate a training program for our inspectors
responsible for on-site supervision.


Introduction of IFRS accounting. We have asked an audit firm to assist commercial
banks during the transition to IFRS accounting. The final report of this project will be
submitted at end-September 2012. As regards the quantification of the differences
between the CBM’s 201 financial statements under Mauritanian and IFRS accounting
standards, it did not take place as planned at end-March 2012 because of difficulties
in recruiting the auditor. However, we intend to ask the firm that is auditing
commercial banks to perform this exercise or, if not possible, another international

60
qualified audit firm, with the aim of having the audit finalized in the shortest possible
timeframe (new structural benchmark).


Enhancement of transparency. The detailed and consolidated survey of the banking
system is being posted on the CBM’s website on a quarterly basis to keep the
interested public informed about the situation of the banking system. In June 2012,
we will publish the CBM’s 2011 financial statements as well as the auditors' opinion.
The CBM will continue to have its accounts—including its reserves—audited by an
international audit firm selected through an international bidding process.

External sector and debt management
17.
The current account balance should widen to approximately 20 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2012, compared to 7 percent in 2011. This marked deterioration is due to a sharp
increase in imports as a result of the 2012 EMEL program, investment in the energy and
mining sectors, and the new airport, as well as the expected fall in iron ore exports. The
deficit will be mainly financed by higher external financing as well as by significant foreign
direct investment in the mining and oil sectors.
18.
We are committed to protect external debt sustainability and we are ensuring that it
stays at sustainable levels. To do this, we are committed to stepping up efforts to mobilize
sources of concessional financing for our public investment program, and we have been able
to mobilize two-thirds of the pledges at the Brussels round table in June 2010. We will take
into account the recommendations of the joint IMF and World Bank mission when adopting a
new medium-term external debt strategy by end-September 2012 (new structural
benchmark). We will also work to strengthen the National Debt Management Committee,
which will work in cooperation with other institutions (CBM, MAED, and MF) to coordinate
a strategy for managing domestic and external debt. We will continue to actively deploy our
best efforts to complete relief agreements with bilateral creditors. In this regard, we have
moved forward in the discussions with the Kuwaiti authorities to achieve an acceptable
treatment of the bilateral debt. With the support of international development partners, we
hope to conclude these discussions in the coming months.
B. Structural Reforms
19.
We attach considerable importance to structural reforms because of their positive
effect on improving the business climate, promoting growth, creating jobs, and reducing
poverty.
Strengthening the social protection system and gradually eliminating subsidies
20.
Our social protection strategy, designed in collaboration with UNICEF, is being
finalized. It has been validated at the regional level and will be adopted by the government
by end-June 2012. The launching of the strategy’s action plan will improve social security

61
coverage and better protect poor and vulnerable groups. Moreover, due to the negative
effects of the drought on the food insecurity, we adopted a national food security strategy as
well as an associated public investment program for the period 2015 to 2030 in March 2012.
We hope to obtain the support of our technical and financial partners (TFPs) for this strategy
and have requested financial contributions.
21.
Our policy of phasing out subsidies that are generally poorly targeted continues. For
this purpose, we have developed a new fuel price structure reflecting our goal of eliminating
fuel subsidies. The simplified structure includes: distribution margins set on a specific basis
and not linked to international prices, the exclusion of the minimum tax from the price
structure, shorter maturities for letters of credit (from 180 to 90 days), an automatic price
change every two weeks, and a pump price-smoothing mechanism. The Council of Ministers
adopted this new price structure on May 9, 2012. Full pass-through of international prices
will be applied to all large consumers by July 2012, and the corrective margin will be
eliminated by the end of the year. To ensure that the pricing formula can automatically be
applied if international prices increase sharply, a new instruction will establish a cap of
3 percent in the smoothing formula. In the same vein, to mitigate the impact of rising prices
on the vulnerable, we have undertaken a number of additional initiatives:


The evaluation of the 2011 food subsidy program (structural benchmark) allowed us
to improve the design and implementation of the EMEL program 2012, which is
currently in effect, including by reducing logistics costs and improving targeting in
rural areas.



We have also successfully completed the vulnerability and poverty survey among
vulnerable groups in Nouakchott led by the Food Security Commission (CSA) in
collaboration with World Food Program (WFP). We plan to extend this survey to the
whole country before end-2012. We have started with help of WFP to exploit the
results of this survey to initiate a cash transfer scheme for the 10,000 households
identified in Nouakchott. Another cash transfer mechanism will be introduced in June
2012 in rural areas (which WFP staff judge to be high risk areas for food insecurity),
pending the completion of the vulnerability survey for the rest of the country, which
will further improve the targeting mechanism.



We will strengthen, with help of developmental partners, existing conditional transfer
programs, such as programs on school cafeterias, food for work, and in support for
pregnant women.

Reform of government finances
22.
In February 2012, we finalized and approved the strategic public finance plan that
was prepared with the support of the development partners, including the IMF and the EU.
We will put in place all the resources necessary to implement this plan, including the creation
of the technical steering committee by end-June 2012.

62
Management of natural resources and mining taxation policy
23.
The government is committed to ensuring total transparency in the exploitation and
use of the financial resources originating from the mining industries. Our ultimate goal is to
maximize the positive impact of mining revenues on our people and to make growth much
more inclusive. Mauritania's membership of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) since 2005 resulted in full compliance status in February 2012. We propose to
increase awareness about EITI in the wider public to improve accountability. We also intend
to further improve the quality of the documents produced and broaden the coverage of the
initiative to new sectors, such as fisheries, and to issues related to the environment, which are
of interest to local people. In the near term, we plan to publish on a monthly basis tax and
nontax revenue from the mining sector (SNIM, TASIAST, and MCM) on the website of the
Ministry of Finance, as is currently done for the oil sector.
24.
The government will start discussing ways to further optimize the resources
originating from the mining sector. The Fund technical assistance mission concluded that the
Mauritanian mining sector remains under-taxed despite recent legislation introducing
progressive royalty rates. Thus, the government has decided to evaluate the prospects of
renegotiating the tax incentives in the mining sector with investors who so wish, while
maintaining the stability of the business climate. The priority for now is to:


Create an interministerial committee to improve coordination between the different
government agencies involved in the mining sector (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Mines and Petroleum, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development, the national
hydrocarbons commission, and the BCM).



Stop giving tax and customs advantages in new agreement with foreign investors, and
instead apply the current mining code. This would make tax and other granted advantages
more transparent and help us eliminate the asymmetry of the stability clause that allows
mine operators to benefit from any change in the legal framework that is favorable to
them.



Reimburse VAT credits due to mining companies. Thus, we intend to reimburse
UM 2 billion this year, establish an escrow account to reimburse VAT credits monthly,
and simplify our procedures by identifying two or three locally acquired assets that could
be exceptionally exempt from VAT.



Fill existing gaps in our tax code in order to tax capital gains as a result of transfers of
ownership of assets in Mauritania.



Create a mining fund by the end-2012, modeled on the example of the existing oil fund.
The idea is release saved resources in the event of exogenous shocks to finance urgent
development projects. An IMF mission scheduled in October 2012 will help us to put this
mechanism in place.

63
Improving revenue collection
25.
We are committed to improving tax collection. Thus, the tax department at the
Ministry of Finance (DGI) has made considerable progress in: (i) adopting the principle of a
Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) with national jurisdiction; (ii) significantly increasing tax audits;
and (iii) completing the census of approximately 20,000 potential taxpayers in Nouakchott.
In 2012, we intend to extend the Tax Identification Number (TIN) to all taxpayers identified,
increase the number of DGI staff and enhance their training, and improve the effectiveness of
the DGE by increasing its jurisdiction threshold to at least UM 300 million by September
2012. While stepping up our tax audit efforts, we will modernize our collection and appeal
procedures by November 2012 by creating independent joint committees to manage appeal
procedures.
26.
We will accelerate customs reform to strengthen its role in revenue collection,
facilitate trade operations, and combat fraud. In this regard, we intend to establish a valuation
office by end-2012 and, with French development assistance, operationalize the customs
intelligence office. Furthermore, to make best use of ASYCUDA++, a system of selective
inspection parameters will be established by end-June 2012, which should make customs
control more effective. To strengthen performance-based management, we intend to
introduce performance indicators for Customs staff (new taxpayers, recovery of arrears,
customs clearance times, and number of seizures). Synergies with the DGI will be developed
through a memorandum of understanding between the customs Department (DGD) and DGI
by December 2012 to formalize exchanges of information on taxpayers. Work on the draft of
the new Customs Code is at an advanced stage, which will allow the new code to be
submitted to the Council of Ministers by September 2012. The vocational training center that
became operational in 2011 will allow us to build human capacity at the DGD.
Managing public expenditure
27.
After closing all sub-accounts, we have placed their balances in the Treasury Single
Account, which became operational since end-2011. We have also taken, in consultation with
the CBM, all necessary steps for the Treasury to be admitted to the clearing house as a full
member. The Treasury/CBM computerized interface is close to fully functioning.
28.
With regard to budget preparation and execution, we have started to use functional
expenditure classification and itemized all subsidies included under the heading ―common
expenditures‖ (dépenses communes) in the 2012 budget law. We will continue to ensure that
the budget clearly spells out all transfers to public enterprises (including public transport
enterprises) as well as any new tax leveled on private companies. We will continue to avoid
using exceptional spending procedures (procédures dérogatoires) and cash advance
procedures, except in cases of extreme urgency. To this end, an inventory of existing imprest
accounts (régies d’avance) will be made by end-June 2012 and we will ensure that the status
of the General directorate of Treasury auditors will be adopted before end-September 2012.

64
We also intend to prepare a new organic budget law in 2013 with the help of IMF technical
assistance.
29.
To evaluate and solidify the financial situation of the government, we produced, as
planned, a report on the government's pending payment disputes with private- and publicsector entities in March 2012. The conclusion of the report is that the government owes a
sum of UM 6 billion, and a plan to settle these arrears over 2012–14 has been prepared. The
lists of beneficiaries and the action plan will be published in July 2012. The rejection of
applications for payments will be clearly explained to those concerned. Similarly, the
inventories of government guarantees and the repayment schedule for the subset of activated
guarantees will be established in 2012.
30.
A new public procurement code came into force in 2012. The relevant decrees have
all been adopted and implemented in early February 2012. Going forward, the code’s
provisions will be applied without exception to all contracts awarded by the public sector.
Awarding contracts through private negotiation will remain exceptional and continue to be
overseen by the monitoring committee set up by the new code. To encourage private-sector
involvement in major projects, we intend to prepare a draft law on public-private
partnerships.
Containing the wage bill and improving the quality of public services
31.
We have made a considerable effort to make up the delay in implementing the civil
service reform. We have reconciled the civil service database with the payroll file and crosschecked the entries that were the same in these two databases against the validated civil
service census. This led either to the removal from the payroll or to the regularization in the
civil service database. In the light of these results, we plan to have a payroll with a single
database aligned with the census by June 2012 (structural benchmark). This database will
feed into the forthcoming integrated system of human resources management that should
promote a decentralized system at line ministries level.
32.
We continue to ban any recruitment that is not governed by the civil service
regulations. In the short term, we are working to put in place effective and permanent
mechanism that controls the presence of civil servants and government employees in their
offices. To strengthen human resource management, we plan, with World Bank technical
assistance, to initiate an organizational audit of line ministries, beginning with the Ministries
of Education, Finance, and Health. Furthermore, a methodology for forecasting the wage bill
will be designed and implemented at the Ministry of Finance with assistance from AFRITAC
West. In particular, we plan to make the tracking of personnel expenditure more effective and
introduce forward-looking management of staffing levels. This will allow controlling the
replacements of departing personnel with new recruits to reflecting actual government needs.

65
Improving public enterprise performance
33.
To strengthen and improve the management of public enterprises, we are committed
to conduct, together with the World Bank, a technical and financial audit of public
enterprises. Unfortunately, these audits have not been carried out as planned in the program
due to delays in procurement procedures. Nevertheless, the audit reports must ready by end2012 so that we can start mending their financial positions and ensure that they are more
effectively managed, notably through performance contracts. We will pay special attention to
the new public transportation company to ensure that any budget impact remains minimal.
We also intend to monitor more closely the government’s wage payments to public
institutions and enterprises by carrying out a personnel census and producing a centralized
database of staff at the Department of Government Property. We will also organize regular
financial audits of public enterprises and improve coordination between the various
departments concerned.
Reforming the electricity sector
34.
The electricity sector is one of the government's major concerns. After recapitalizing
SOMELEC to the order of UM 20 billion in 2010, we formally adopted a restructuring plan
in 2011 and recapitalized SOMELEC a second time for an additional UM 13.6 billion. We
have adopted a plan for the repayment of government arrears to SOMELEC over two years
in four installments. At the same time, the government has begun paying its electricity bills
to SOMELEC on time and has paid a substantial proportion of the company’s operating
subsidy. The government has also made a commitment that the utility bills of all government
agencies will be paid regularly. We will support SOMELEC's efforts to recover unpaid debt
from other public entities. Furthermore, electricity tariffs for the service sector have been
aligned with the tariffs for medium-voltage electricity since early 2012. This has enabled the
company to limits its recourse to bank borrowing at high interest rates, which were a drain on
its finances.
35.
Additional measures will further improve SOMELEC's situation in 2012. In
particular, the new short-term credit line granted by the IsDB will considerably reduce the
company’s procurement cost of fuel and ease its financing costs. A tariff study, conducted by
an international firm, has been launched and the forthcoming report will probably lead to a
revision of electricity tariffs, particularly of those paid by large consumers, which may
increase as early as July 2012 (structural benchmark). Moreover, we have called on a
consulting firm to implement a performance contract between SOMELEC and the
government.
Promoting the private sector and employment
36.
We are determined to significantly improve the investment climate and to identify
constraints that hinder private-sector development, helping us to master the challenge of
creating employment for our young people. The approval of the new investment code in June

66
2012, later than expected, and the implementation of the one-stop shop will further simply
and shorten administrative procedures for new investments. The framework for coordinating
government and the private-sector investment activities will be further strengthened through
improved communication links.
37.
We will continue to rely on a multi-pronged strategy to promote employment. We
plan to introduce a national strategy for developing private-sector skills. This will accompany
our efforts to modernize vocational training programs for the young and enhance labormarket integration of unemployed young graduates. Steps undertaken in the agricultural
sector (such as the development of new irrigation areas) and a new strategic study of the
telecommunications sector will help create new jobs. To truly understand labor market
conditions and trends, we will complete studies on nationwide employment and the informal
sector in Mauritania in 2012. Our technical and financial partners (ILO and UNDP) will
assist us in the preparation of these studies.

Strengthening governance
38.
Fighting corruption remains a government priority. After adopting a national anticorruption strategy (SNLCC) in 2010, we organized a high-level meeting on combating
corruption in March 2012, with many experts from neighboring countries and international
institutions participating. In the meeting’s concluding declaration, we reiterated our
commitment to finalize, in collaboration with the UNDP, the SNLCC action plan by June
2012 that will take account of Mauritania's international obligations, in particular with regard
to the United Nations and African Union conventions on preventing and combating
corruption. To operationalize the SNLCC, we plan to present a draft law by end-2012 to
define the contours of the authorities' action against corruption. In addition, amongst other
actions, we intend to create a technical commission by end-2012 that will make
recommendations on streamlining the government’s control and computer system.
Improving economic statistics
39.
We are mindful of the crucial role of reliable statistical information in the preparation,
monitoring, and assessment of macroeconomic policies, PRSP implementation, and progress
towards the MDGs. Accordingly, we intend to launch a number of surveys in 2012: a
complete revision of the CPI, an update of the directory of industrial companies, an
employment survey (see above), and the fourth general census of household living conditions
(EPCV). We have requested World Bank support to build statistical capacity by pressing
ahead with the organizational and institutional reform of the national statistical office (ONS).
Also in this context, we intend to launch statistical functions in ministerial departments and
introduce training schemes.

67
C. Risks
40.
The rebound in economic activity augurs well for our performance under the program
in 2012. However, various risks may jeopardize our attainment of program objectives:
(i) another rainfall deficit in 2012; (ii) an acceleration of the cyclical downturn in external
demand and export prices (iron ore, copper, and gold) and volatility of import prices for
wheat, rice, and oil; and (iii) shortfalls in concessional external financing. The government
stands ready to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of such risks, should they
materialize. Any such corrective measures will be taken in consultation with Fund staff.
III. CONCLUSION
41.
As the principal objectives of the program for 2011 have been achieved (Tables 1 and
2a), the government requests approval of the fourth review of the program supported by an
arrangement under the ECF as well as the disbursement of SDR 11.04 million. To reflect the
better than expected program performance in 2011, the new external environment, and the
EMEL emergency program, the government requests modification of the end-June 2012
performance criteria relating to net international reserves, net domestic assets, and the non-oil
basic balance.
42.
We believe that the policies set forth herein are adequate to achieve the objectives of
the program, but stand ready to take any further measures that may become appropriate for
this purpose. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures and in
advance of any revision to the policies contained herein, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation. We will remain in close consultation with Fund staff and
provide timely information necessary for monitoring economic developments and
implementation of policies under the ECF-supported program. New performance criteria
have been proposed for end-December 2012 (Table 1). New structural benchmarks have been
proposed for 2012 (Table 2b). These quantitative criteria and structural benchmarks are
described in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The fifth and sixth
review under the program are expected to be completed on or after November 30, 2012 and
on or after March 13, 2013, respectively.
Very truly yours,
Sid’ Ahmed Ould Raiss /s/
Governor of Central Bank of Mauritania

68
ATTACHMENT I. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the definitions of the quantitative targets for the period
January 1, 2010–December 31, 2012, which are set forth in the Letter of intention (LOI) and
reported in Table 1. It also establishes the content and frequency of the data to be provided to
IMF staff for monitoring the program. For the purpose of this memorandum, the government
is defined to include only the central government.
2.
The quantitative targets are defined as ceilings or floors for cumulative changes
between the reference periods described in Table 1 and the end of the month indicated.
I. DEFINITIONS
A. Performance Criteria and Quantitative Benchmarks
3.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM) are
defined as the difference between the reserve assets of the CBM (i.e., the external assets that
are readily available to, and controlled by, the CBM, as per the 5th edition of the IMF
Balance of Payments Manual) minus the foreign exchange liabilities of the CBM to residents
and nonresidents. The gold holdings will be evaluated at the gold price in effect on
November 30, 2009 ($1,127 per oz.) and the U.S. dollar value of reserves assets (other than
gold) and foreign exchange liabilities will be calculated using program exchange rates,
namely, the November 30, 2009 exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the ouguiya
(UM/$262.0), the SDR ($/SDR 1.61), the euro (Euro/$1.49), and other nondollar currencies
as published in the IFS.
4.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBM are defined as reserve money minus net
foreign assets (NFA) of the CBM. Reserve money comprises: (a) currency in circulation
(currency outside banks and commercial banks’ cash in vaults); and (b) deposits of
commercial banks at the CBM. NFA are defined as gross foreign assets of the CBM,
including the external assets not included in the reserve assets, minus all foreign liabilities of
the CBM (i.e., NDA = Reserve Money – NFA, based on the CBM balance sheet). NFA will
be measured at the program exchange rates as described in Paragraph 3.
5.
Government balance is defined for program monitoring purposes as non-oil central
government basic balance excluding grants, which is equal to non-oil government revenue
(excluding grants) minus government expenditure (excluding foreign-financed investment
expenditure and interest due on external debt). The government balance will be measured
based on Treasury data. Revenue are defined in accordance with the Government Financial
Statistics manual (GFSM 2001), excluding the revenue related to oil- and other hydrocarbonrelated activities and transfers from the National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund (FNRH) to the
budget. They will be monitored on a cash basis (revenue recorded by Treasury). Expenditure
will be monitored on the basis of payment orders, including the interest on domestic debt
(paid by the Treasury or automatically debited from the treasury account at the CBM,

69
including but not limited to discounts on treasury bills held by banks and nonbanks and
interest charges on the consolidated debt of the government vis-à-vis the CBM).
6.
The new medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government, the CBM, and State Owned Enterprises (excluding SNIM) is
defined as debt to nonresidents, with maturities of one year or longer, contracted or
guaranteed by the government or the CBM with a grant element (defined as 1 minus the
NPV-to-face value ratio, and estimated on the basis of the currency and maturity specific
discount rates reported by the OECD (commercial interest reference rates) of less than
35 percent. This definition applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (IMF Executive Board
Decision No 6230- (79/140), Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009, and effective December
1, 2009 (Decision No.14416-(09/91); see Annex) but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The national industrial and mining
company (SNIM) is excluded from the ceiling on medium- and long-term nonconcessional
external debt because the firm does not pose fiscal risks and can borrow without government
guarantee.
7.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at
least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between
the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year average CIRR will be used to calculate the
PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same
margins for differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added
(0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years,
1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more). The calculation of
concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity,
grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.
8.
The short-term nonconcessional debt is defined as the stock of debt with
nonresidents, with original maturity of less than one year, contracted or guaranteed by the
government or the CBM. This definition applies to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
(Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000; see Annex). This definition excludes foreign
currency deposits with the CBM. It also excludes normal import-related credits.

70
9.
External payments arrears are defined as overdue payments (principal or interest)
on the external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or the CBM after the
expiration of the applicable grace period.
10.
Treasury float (outstanding payments at the Treasury) is defined as the
outstanding stock of payment orders registered at the Treasury and not yet executed by the
Treasury. Once the RACHAD payment module is implemented, the float will be defined as
the payment orders validated by the RACHAD payment module and not yet executed by the
Treasury.
11.
Poverty reduction expenditures will be estimated on the basis of the public
expenditure functional classification based on the recommendations of the January 2006
technical assistance mission report of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (―Les réformes en
cours de la gestion budgétaire et financière,‖ March 2006). This estimate will only take into
account domestically-financed expenditures.
B. Structural Benchmarks
12.

Structural benchmarks for the 2011 tranche of the program were:



Complete by end-December 2011 the issuance of new taxpayer identification
numbers. This benchmark aims at building a centralized taxpayers database and
provide each taxpayer with a single identification number.



Full implementation and use of ASYCUDA++ in major customs offices by endDecember 2011.



Introduction of a Treasury Single Account by end-December 2011.



Design by end-December 2011 an overall external debt management strategy
(differed to end-September 2012).



Increase by end-December 2011 bank minimum capital to UM 5 billion
($18 million).



Complete by end-December 2011 the study on the financial situation of major public
enterprises. This will be based on the financial audit of the following companies:
SOMELEC, SOMAGAZ, SNDE, MAURIPOST and SONIMEX (differed to endDecember 2012).



Complete by end-December 2011 a government arrears repayment plan for
SOMELEC.



71
13.

Structural benchmarks for the 2012 tranche of the program are:



Conduct an inventory of all domestic debt and formulate a plan to settle all domestic
arrears by end-March 2012.



Audit the CBM’s NIR and NDA data as of end-December 2011 by end-March 2012.



Complete by end-September 2012 (original test date was March 2012), the report
quantifying the differences between the CBM's 2010 financial statements under
national accounting principles with those under IFRS, prepared with the assistance of
an international audit firm.



Review the rules on connected lending practices and calculate the impact on banks of
a tightening in the definition of connected parties by end-March 2012.



Sign by end-June 2012 a memorandum of understanding between the Ministry of
Finance and the CBM, which puts in place a new liquidity management framework.



Conduct by end-April 2012, with assistance from the World Food Program, a poverty
and vulnerability survey.



Publish on the CBM’s website the audited financial statements together with audit
opinion for the year ended on December 31, 2011 by end-June 2012.



Update the payroll file with actual results from the census of employees by endJune 2012.



Review electricity tariffs, including an increase for large consumers, based on the
results of the tariff study by end-July 2012.
II. PROGRAM ADJUSTORS

14.
NIR and NDA targets are derived based on the projected amounts of the FNRH
contribution to the budget and of the net international assistance. The latter is defined as
the difference between (a) the sum of cumulative disbursements of official loans and grants
(budget support; excluding HIPC assistance and project-related loans and grants) in foreign
currency and of the impact of any additional debt relief obtained after June 30, 2006; and
(b) the total amount of external cash debt service payments (including interest on foreign
liabilities of the CBM).
15.
In case net international assistance or the contribution of the FNRH to the
budget falls short of the amounts projected in Table 1, the floor for NIR will be adjusted
downward and the ceiling on NDA will be adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the
difference between the actual levels and the projected levels. In the case of the NDA ceiling,
this amount will be converted into ouguiya at the program exchange rates. The cumulative

72
downward adjustments to NIR will be limited to $35 million. The cumulative upward
adjustments to NDA will be limited to the ouguiya equivalent of $35 million at program
exchange rates. In case the contribution of the FNRH to the budget exceeds the amounts
projected in Table 1, the floor for NIR will be adjusted upward and the ceiling on NDA will
be adjusted downward by an amount equivalent to the difference between the actual levels
and the projected levels.
16.
The floor on the basic non-oil deficit will be adjusted upward—that is, the
maximum deficit will be increased for any higher than programmed disbursement of
budgetary grants.
III. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

IV. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS TABLE
20.
The Treasury will prepare a monthly budget execution report in the format of a
Central Government Operations Table (TOFE). In preparing this table, the following
definitions shall be used:


Grants are defined as a sum of foreign project grants (grants used in the execution of the
foreign-financed investment projects included in the central government and the EPA
parts of the consolidated investment budget and (parties BE et BA)); and foreign program
grants for budget support including the multilateral HIPC debt relief on the government
external debt budget and HIPC debt relief on the external debt of CBM and SNIM
(including the part of the AFD/BFD debt relief on Cologne terms).



Domestic bank financing of the government deficit is defined as a change in the net
credit to the government from the banking system, defined as claims on the government
minus deposits of the government with the banking system (including the HIPC account
but excluding the deposits of public establishments and other administrative units (EPA)
with the CBM).



Domestic nonbank financing of the government deficit is defined as a net change in
holdings of Treasury bills by nonbanks.



Domestic arrears are defined as a net change in the Treasury float and in the stock of
domestic claims (beyond a period of three months) on government acknowledged by the
Ministry of Finance (including but not limited to accumulated payment arrears to public

75
enterprises (utilities), international organizations, procurement contracts, and court

Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in the footnote above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. These two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

Safeguards Assessments

An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM) was completed
on April 30, 2010, highlighting that significant risks continued to exist. Since the completion
of the safeguards assessment, the General Council was restored, timely publication of the
audited financial statements resumed, and cash operations of the CBM foreign offices
ceased—all key safeguard priorities. Further action is needed on developing capacity in the
areas of financial reporting, information systems, and internal audit. To ensure the quality of
program monetary data, external audits are conducted every six months at the time of
program reviews. There are currently no plans to establish an audit committee or require the
General Council to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.
X.

AML/CFT

Mauritania recently changed its legal framework criminalizing money laundering and the
financing of terrorism with a view to enhance compliance with international standards. The
Financial Action Task Force for the MENA region (MENAFATF) has adopted Mauritania’s
5th follow-up report to the initial 2006 mutual evaluation report without expressing any
serious concern in April this year.
A financial intelligence unit (―Commission d’analyse des informations financières‖),
composed of experts from various ministries and the CBM, has been operational since 2006
and is responsible for analyzing suspicious transaction reports. To date, the unit has
processed 54 reports, of which two ultimately led to criminal convictions. The authorities are
currently receiving technical assistance from the World Bank.
8

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of
end-2004, which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is
financed by bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to
the member under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

5
XI.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Mauritanian currency is the ouguiya (UM), and its de facto exchange rate classification
is ―other managed arrangement‖ with no pre-announced path. The rationing of foreign
exchange introduced in late 2008 ended in mid-December 2009, thus allowing for greater
exchange rate flexibility and removing all restrictions on current account transactions. Fish
export receipts are subject to a repatriation requirement, under which the foreign exchangedenominated receipts have to be domiciled in an account at the CBM. Fish exporters remain
otherwise unrestricted in their use of the foreign exchange receipts. All foreign exchange
purchases and sales in excess of $100,000 by residents have to go through the foreign
exchange market organized by the CBM.
XII.

Last Article IV Consultation

Discussions for the 2009 Article IV consultation were held in Nouakchott during December
2-17, 2009. The Country Report No. 10/34 was considered by the Executive Board on March
15, 2010.
XIII. FSAP Participation, ROSCs and Offshore Financial Center (OFC) Assessments
A joint Fund/Bank FSSA, based on work undertaken during two visits to Mauritania in
February 2005 and February-March 2006 as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), was presented to the Executive Board in April 2006. As updated by subsequent
Article IV and review missions, its main findings are:


The financial sector, while not exhibiting any sign of distress, does not support
economic development and presents significant challenges.



Banks are vulnerable and inefficient; they primarily serve their affiliated economic
groups.



Nonbank financial intermediaries are underdeveloped; microfinance has increased,
requiring more intensive supervision.



Financial sector regulation and enforcement need to be improved, recent progress
notwithstanding.



The financial sector infrastructure—legal and judicial frameworks, accounting and
auditing practices, and the payment system—needs to be modernized.

Some recommendations have already been implemented, including: bringing domestic
financial sector regulation more in line with international standards and gradually increasing
competition in the banking sector by encouraging entry of reputable international banks.
The fiscal transparency module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) was based on two missions, conducted from May 14-24, 2002, and from

6
August 6-13, 2002, respectively. The final fiscal ROSC report is published on the IMF
website.

ANNEX III. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of May 31, 2012
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, balance of payments, external debt, and financial sector statistics. Since 2005, STA and
AFRITAC West have been assisting the authorities with macroeconomic statistics.
National accounts: Substantial work is still required to implement the statistical methodologies of the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA) and rebase constant price estimates to 1998. The National Statistical Office (ONS) has
finalized estimates for 1998–2001 and produced provisional estimates for 2002-06. The ONS has completed the 2009
estimates and is working on 2010-2011. AFRITAC West is providing technical assistance.
Price statistics: The current edition of the consumer price index (CPI), developed with the assistance of AFRISTAT,
has been published since May 2004. Geographical coverage of the CPI is limited to Nouakchott, the capital. The
authorities plan to overhaul the consumer basket that underlies the CPI this year.
Government finance statistics: The adoption of systematic compilation practices has improved data
comprehensiveness, but there is a need to operationalize a data validation process as a quality control measure. In
view of ongoing methodological improvements, the authorities should publish monthly statements of treasury
accounts. Substantial work is needed to move towards GFS2001.
Monetary statistics: CBM monetary statistics are broadly in line with the statistical methodologies of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual and data dissemination recommendations of the GDDS. The CBM developed and
implemented bridge tables from source data to the Standardized Report Form (SRFs) and since last year submits
SRF 1SR (central bank) and 2SR (other financial institutions) to STA on a preliminary basis. The quality of these
data needs to be further enhanced, and the scope of 2SR should be expanded to cover micro-finance institutions.
With the assistance of an external audit firm, the CBM is preparing its financial reporting system for IFRS
implementation in 2012, a key safeguards assessment recommendation. The CBM is committed to publish monetary
statistics on its official website in a timely manner.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are affected by significant shortcomings, as many components
are routinely based on estimates, and there are no systematic efforts to collect data on certain types of transfers,
foreign direct investment, or tourism receipts. In addition non mining exports, services and short-term capital flows
are not well measured. Similarly, under-reporting of external transactions by commercial banks is problematic. No
balance of payments statistics are reported to STA. An April 2011 STA TA mission provided recommendations,
which, if implemented by the authorities, would significantly address identified shortcomings.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). Metadata need to be updated.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Mauritania does not report government finance statistics to STA.
Monetary data using SRFs 1SR and 2SR are reported on a preliminary basis. The CBM also reports monetary data
based on its own template to the International Financial Statistics database.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association
Approved by Daniela Gressani and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and Marcelo Giugale (World Bank)
June 14, 2012
This updated joint IMF-World Bank low-income country (LIC) debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) continues to show a moderate risk of debt distress for Mauritania.9 Under the baseline
scenario, debt burden indicators do not exceed their policy-dependent indicative thresholds,
except for a minor and not protracted breach of the threshold for the present value (PV) of
the debt-to-GDP ratio. The public sector DSA suggests that Mauritania’s overall public
sector debt remains sustainable over the medium term. The country’s vulnerability to fiscal,
FDI, exchange rate, and growth shocks highlights the importance of continuing to build
fiscal and external buffers, follow a cautious borrowing strategy, and improve debt
management. Lack of agreement on debt relief from Kuwait would raise Mauritania’s
vulnerability to an external shock but would not affect the risk of debt distress, which would
remain moderate.
V. BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
43.
This report follows the DSA prepared in June 2011 for Mauritania’s Second
Review under the Extended Credit Facility.10 This analysis is consistent with the mediumterm macroeconomic framework presented in the 2012 Article IV Consultation and Fourth
Review under the ECF. Compared to the previous DSA, this analysis includes:


Better starting position. Historical averages for key macroeconomic variables

The external and the public sector debt sustainability analysis presented in this document is based on the Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC). Data up to 2011 underlying this analysis were
provided by donors and the authorities. From 2012 onwards, projections represent staffs and authorities’ views.
10

See staff report for the second review http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=25060.0

2
current DSA are slightly better thanks to the contribution of two recent exceptional
years (2010 and 2011) characterized by unprecedented high commodity prices, and
the authorities’ ability to build fiscal and external buffers, which was helped by high
dividends from the state-owned iron ore company. This has led to a modified pattern
for most debt ratios under both the baseline and alternative scenarios.


Updated debt stocks. The current DSA is based on stock as of end-2011 (Box 1),
while the previous one was based on the stock of debt as of end-2009. Amortization
and principal payments for 2012 onwards were also updated based on the most recent
data.

Box 1. Evolution of External Debt
As of end-2011, total external debt amounted to 90 percent of GDP.1 Gross public and
publicly-guaranteed (PPG) external debt was at about 76.8 percent of GDP, compared
with a projection of about 55 percent in the previous DSA, due to delays in resolving a
long-standing debt with Kuwait. To date, Mauritania has never accessed the international
bond market, and 85 percent of its total external debt is held externally by official
multilateral and bilateral lenders. The composition of debt has been relatively stable over
time and has shifted slightly toward more multilateral donors.

1/ This includes central government and state-owned enterprises debt (excluding the IMF SDR allocation and the public
iron ore company SNIM, which is treated as a private commercially-run company).



Revised macroframework (Box 2). The fiscal position will continue to strengthen as
fiscal consolidation efforts—anchored by a nonmineral fiscal balance—persist, and
public financial management and debt monitoring improve. The current account deficit
will worsen in the next two years due to large one-off operations but will stabilize at a

3
sustained level over the longer term thanks to the expanding capacity of the mining
sector.11 The overall growth rate for the period 2012–32 remains broadly unchanged
although the ongoing expansion of the mining sector and the country’s investments in the
energy sector are expected to boost growth.


Infrastructure projects. The previous DSA already incorporated the expansion of
Mauritania’s electricity generation and distribution system. The external borrowing for
the electricity project covers 2012–14 and is structured as one nonconcessional and one
concessional loan, each for $105 million.12 The DSA continues to incorporate
conservative assumptions regarding the growth dividend from the expansion of the
electrical network,13 and other projects to factor in potential risks associated with delays
in implementing those projects and other internal bottlenecks. Resort to concessional
borrowing from multilateral and bilateral donors will continue to guide the authorities’
debt strategy in the near term—with nonconcessional borrowing remaining the exception.
Over the longer run, new borrowing will gradually shift away from concessional
financing (Box 2), but the country’s debt will remain sustainable, thanks to improved
debt management and coherent macroeconomic policies. Private external debt will also
increase slightly in the medium term to finance the new airport (staff assumed an
additional $200 million in private-sector debt related to this project, of which 40 percent
is expected to come in 2012 and 60 percent in 2013) and the modernization of the iron
ore company.



Debt relief from Kuwait. The previous DSA scenario assumed that the debt owed to
Kuwait will be cancelled in 2011; however, discussions on this issue are still ongoing.
The current scenario assumes that full debt relief under HIPC terms will occur in 2012
(about $1 billion). To date, negotiations with Kuwait are at an advanced stage for the
portion owed to the central bank of Kuwait (about 17 percent of total). A number of
proposals have been made by the Mauritanian government, in line with the most recent
letter from the Paris Club, and discussions on various scenarios are still ongoing.
Treatment of the debt under the HIPC terms would represent the first best option, but
staff estimated the impact of various scenarios on debt sustainability (see paragraph 8).

11

Baseline macroframework factors in the positive impact of the ongoing large mining expansion capacity
projects (iron ore and gold), which would arrive at completion by 2015 and would boost the country’s
productive and export capacities. This would somewhat offset the impact of the declining commodity prices
projected in the medium term.
12

The program ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing was raised to allow for this strategic priority project. The
project was judged critical to increase electricity supply, was evaluated by a study of the Arab Development
Fund, and does not lead to a rise in the risk of debt distress.
13

The concessional loan has a 35 percent grant element, while the nonconcessional loan has a grant element of
18 percent. The loans are disbursed over the 2012–14 period.

4

Box 2. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth: Real GDP growth is projected to be sustained at 5.8 percent per year on average
over 2012–17, supported by a rebound in agriculture and strong activity in the mining sector. Significant
investment programs will boost production capacity of the national iron ore company, as well as private
copper and gold production. Upon completion of these projects, we expect growth to converge to about
4.4 percent per year by 2032 (slightly above the 4 percent historical average). Near-term risks include
volatility in commodity prices, a fall in external demand, and unfavorable climate conditions. On the
upside, accelerated structural reforms to improve the business environment and higher return on ongoing
investment could spur growth outside the traditional extractive industries sector.
Inflation: Prudent monetary and fiscal policies will lead to an inflation rate converging to about
5 percent in 2018 and thereafter.
Current account balance: After widening in 2012 amid falling metal export prices and increased
imports associated with the drought and the implementation of major mining and infrastructure projects,
the current account deficit is expected to narrow to around 4.7 percent of GDP in 2017. The longer-term
current account deficit follows the increase in mining companies’ export capacities and is broadly
consistent with estimates of the norm (a deficit of about 6 percent of GDP) for Mauritania’s current
account based on the methodology developed by the IMF's Consultative Group on Exchange Rates
(CGER).
Government balances: The framework assumes the following: (a) non-oil revenue remains stable at
about 27 percent of non-oil GDP throughout the period; and (b) grants are expected to stabilize at about
½ percent of GDP in the long run. The government’s non-oil balance including grants is projected to
improve gradually from a deficit of 5.4 percent to a surplus of 0.3 percent of non-oil GDP over the
2012–32 period. The projected primary balance improves from a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2012
to a surplus of about 0.1 percent of GDP in 2032.
External financing: The baseline scenario assumes that, with the exception of the nonconcessional loan
undertaken to finance the electricity generation plant ($105 million), Mauritania will borrow essentially
on concessional terms in the medium term. However, it is expected that new borrowing will gradually
shift away from concessional financing over the longer term. As a result, the average grant element on
new borrowing will decline to 10 percent by 2032.
Domestic debt, mainly treasury bills held by the banking sector and the national iron ore company,
stood at just under 6.7 percent of GDP at end- 2011 and is projected to decline in line with the
improvement in the fiscal position.
Real interest rates. The real interest rate on new short term domestic debt approaches 4 percent in
2017 and gradually declines thereafter.

based on three complementary methodologies. Two of the three approaches involve estimating an equilibrium
current account or ―norm‖.

VI. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
44.
The baseline scenario shows that most debt indicators remain well below their
policy-dependent thresholds, except for a short hiatus where the present value (PV) of
the debt-to-GDP ratio is breached. External debt is projected to decrease significantly over
the medium term from an estimated 91 percent of GDP in 2011 to about 67 percent in 2017,
assuming the Kuwait debt is cancelled and that borrowing diminishes in line with projected
improvements in the fiscal and external positions (DSA Table 1). The stock of total external
debt is projected to drop further in the longer term, reaching 26 percent of GDP in 2032.
Most of the external debt is public and publicly guaranteed debt. After an initial jump
reflecting new large investments, almost all debt burden indicators are declining, and remain
below their policy-dependent indicative thresholds throughout the period, except for a
marginal and non protracted breach of threshold for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio between
2012 and 2016 (Figure 1). Debt service ratios, which capture liquidity risks, remain below
their indicative thresholds.
45.
Risks to the external debt outlook are broadly balanced. On the upside, continued
fiscal discipline and stronger economic growth would further improve the external debt
profile. On the downside, negative trade shocks, recurrence of natural disasters, and loose
fiscal policy would push external debt higher than in Staff projections.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
46.
Mauritania’s external debt indicators remain sensitive to historical trends and
less favorable lending (Figure 1, Table 2). Under both scenarios, the PV of debt-to-GDP
rises initially 7 percentage points above the threshold, before declining steadily. On the other
hand, the PV of debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios remain below their thresholds
throughout the projection period. Moreover, using historical trends—which include two
droughts, high energy and food prices, political instability, and one global crisis—may not
accurately account for long-run debt dynamics.
47.
Bound tests highlight the country’s high vulnerability to non-debt-creating flows
and exchange rate shocks. Stress tests show that a one-standard deviation shock to nondebt-creating flows in 2013–14 represents the most extreme scenario where the NPV debt-toGDP indicator would rapidly breach the threshold, before declining rapidly to sustainable
levels. This contrasts with previous DSAs, which highlighted the dominance of export
shocks.14 Stress tests also show that a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to
14

This is explained by a much larger current account deficit in 2013–14 that is in part triggered by mining
expansion projects that are self-financed through FDI. Simulating a large contraction in FDI would significantly
impact debt, although this result should be nuanced as the scenario does not correct for the fact that those
mining-related imports would likely not occur in the absence of FDI.

6
the baseline increases the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio by 20 percent of GDP, thus causing a
breach in the policy-dependent threshold until 2021, before declining significantly.
Regarding other debt indicators (the PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-to-revenues
ratios), the bound tests do not indicate any threshold breach.
VII. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
48.
The public debt outlook mirrors that of external debt because of its
predominance. Public debt is projected to fall from 70 percent of GDP in 2012 to 54 percent
of GDP by 2017, and would remain on a declining path over the long term. This represents a
marked difference compared to the 2011 DSA update, in which the public sector debt was
projected to increase as the fiscal deficit rose. The revised projections therefore allow for an
even larger decrease in the public debt ratio after 2020, owing to a relatively stronger primary
fiscal balance and sustained economic growth. The PV of public debt is projected to decline
continuously to 18.3 percent of GDP in 2032, down from 54.7 percent of GDP in 2012.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
49.
Stress tests highlight some vulnerability to permanently lower growth, fiscal
slippages, and large exchange rate shocks. Under the permanently lower growth scenario,15
the PV of public debt would reach 44 percent of GDP in 2032, compared with a baseline
projection of 18 percent of GDP. The public debt path is also vulnerable to shocks to the
primary fiscal balance and exchange rate volatility, which suggests that fiscal consolidation,
prudent monetary policy, and appropriate exchange policy are essential for keeping debt
sustainable over the medium term. For example, if the primary deficit remains at about
1.4 percent of GDP (as in 2012), the PV of public-debt-to-GDP ratio would almost double to
36 percent of GDP by the end of the
70
PV of PPG External Debt-to-GDP Ratio
projection period. By 2032, the PV of
(Assuming no full debt relieft from Kuwait 1/)
60
debt-to-GDP ratio remains almost
50
unchanged under historical real GDP and
40
primary balance averages.

50.
The absence of debt relief from
Kuwait would not lead to a protracted

indicator. The current DSA assumes so

1/ (a) Cancellation of 84 percent of the arrears on interest and principal
($ 1 billion) and the rescheduling of the remaining amount over 23 years with
a grace period of 6 years and a 0.5% interest rate . (b) Repayment of
$ 1 billion over a period of 20 years without a grace period .

This scenario assumes that real GDP growth is at its baseline level minus one standard deviation.

7
debt relief provided by the Kuwaiti authorities to Mauritania in 2012 (about $1 billion, nearly
40 percent of Mauritania’s outstanding stock of external nominal debt in 2011). Staff’s
analysis shows that the PV of external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the policy-dependent
threshold briefly (within five or six years in the medium term before returning back under the
policy-dependent threshold) under various scenarios.16
VIII. CONCLUSION
51.
Staffs consider that Mauritania faces a moderate risk of debt distress.17 This
reflects the expectation that most thresholds for debt stocks and debt service would be
respected under the baseline and stress scenarios. The PV of debt-to-revenue and PV of debtto-exports ratios would remain well below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the
period, while the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio exhibits a temporary breach in the indicative
threshold until 2016.18 The authorities agreed with this assessment.
52.
Debt dynamics remain subject to risks. The country’s vulnerability to fiscal, FDI,
large exchange rate fluctuations, and growth shocks highlights the importance of continuing
to build fiscal and external buffers, follow a cautious borrowing strategy and a prudent
monetary policy, and improve debt management. On the upside, the ongoing large
investment projects, both inside and outside the mining sector, are expected to result in an
acceleration of growth, which has not been fully incorporated in the macroeconomic
framework.

16

Scenario 1: no HIPC but cancellation of 84 percent of the outstanding accumulated arrears on interest rate
payments and principal and the rescheduling of the remaining amount over 23 years with a grace period of
six years and a 0.5 percent interest rate; scenario 2: a repayment of the total amount of outstanding arrears
(of about $1 billion) over a period of 20 years.
17

According to the LIC DSA guidelines, the existence of arrears could suggest that a country is in debt distress,
unless there are other reasons than debt-service burden for not servicing its debt. Despite having substantial
arrears to external creditors, Mauritania is not assessed as being in debt distress because its arrears are related to
debts that were previously categorized as ―passive‖.
In the LIC DSA framework, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World
Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, and classified into three categories: strong,
medium, and poor. Mauritania ranks as a ―medium performer‖ according to that criterion as the updated average
CPIA rating for Mauritania over 2008–11 is 3.24 (against a threshold of 3.25). The country’s performance
rating will not change because the breach was only in effect for one year (2010) and 2011 CPIA numbers are
not available yet. Policy-dependent thresholds are set according to the country’s CPIA classification.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 16, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Mauritania
On July, 2, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mauritania.1
Background
Mauritania staged a solid recovery from the global crisis. The commodity price boom of
the last two years, combined with prudent policies, helped Mauritania restore
macroeconomic stability and build reserve and fiscal buffers. However, both poverty and
unemployment remain high, highlighting the need to make growth more inclusive
through greater employment creation and economic diversification.
The Mauritanian economy weathered well the Sahel drought and the economic
slowdown in Europe. Real GDP grew 4 percent in 2011, less than the 5.1 percent
recorded in the previous year but still one of the best performances in the sub-region.
Buoyant activity in construction and services helped compensate for the drought-related
downturn in agriculture and stalling mining production. Inflation was contained to
5.7 percent (y-o-y), reflecting low pass-through of international food and energy prices.
The positive terms of trade shock associated with the run-up in metals prices in the first
three quarters of 2011 narrowed the current account deficit to 7.4 percent of GDP and
boosted foreign exchange reserves to a recent high of $501.6 million at the end of 2011.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Prudent policies contributed to maintaining macro-stability despite high international fuel
and food prices. Fiscal consolidation continued for a third consecutive year, with higher
mining revenues and strong tax collection more than offsetting the cost of the
emergency program put in place in 2011 to alleviate the impact of higher food and
energy prices on the most vulnerable. Monetary policy remained accommodative,
although the excess liquidity in the banking system, associated with the unsterilized
accumulation of net foreign assets, has not translated into high private-sector credit
growth, which remained subdued at just over 10 percent (y-o-y). With a smaller fiscal
financing requirement, T-Bill yields fell to unprecedented low of just below 3 percent.
Growth will pick up this year amid a rebound in the agricultural sector and several largescale investment projects. The recovery in cereal production and major infrastructure
projects are projected to offset the expected decline in demand from Europe, lifting
growth above 5 percent. Inflation is estimated to remain well contained on the back of
declining energy and food prices and prudent monetary and exchange rate policies. The
external position is expected to significantly deteriorate in 2012 due to one-off effects
linked to the emergency drought-relief program, major energy investments, and the
construction of the new airport—before recovering in the medium term as new mineral
production comes on line and nonmetals commodity prices fall.
Going forward, maintaining macroeconomic stability in an economy highly vulnerable to
exogenous shocks is essential. To accommodate pressing social needs in the aftermath
of the drought, the fiscal stance will temporarily loosen, but return to the pre-drought
consolidation path as ill-targeted subsidies are phased-out while more effective social
safety nets are introduced. Mauritania’s narrow export base keeps its economy highly
exposed to falls in metals prices and shifts in global demand. Over the medium term,
Mauritania’s overarching objective is to diversify the economy away from commodity
exports to make growth more inclusive and reduce poverty.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong program performance,
noting that sound policies contributed to the accumulation of significant fiscal and
external buffers, which helped the economy withstand a severe drought, a slowdown in
external demand, and high international fuel and food prices. However, progress in
tackling unemployment and poverty has been limited, and the economy remains
vulnerable to external shocks due to its dependency on commodity exports.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability in
the short run. In this regard, they noted the intention to introduce a new short-term T-bill
maturity to absorb excess liquidity in the banking sector. They also agreed that the
modest loosening of the fiscal stance in 2012 to meet drought relief needs is
appropriate, but advocated a quick phase-out once the drought emergency lapses.

3
Directors praised the authorities’ determination to consolidate the fiscal position over the
medium term. In particular, they welcomed their intention to replace universal price
subsidies with well-targeted social safety nets. They agreed that fiscal policy should be
delinked from volatile commodity prices, notably through the creation of a well-managed
mining fund, and urged a continuation of efforts to improve non-mining tax collection and
seek new revenue from the natural resource sector while protecting Mauritania as a
destination for foreign investors. To safeguard debt sustainability, Directors stressed the
importance of avoiding non-concessional borrowing and new contingent liabilities, and
encouraged the authorities to reach agreement on debt relief with remaining creditors on
HIPC terms.
Directors noted that the banking system is relatively stable but emphasized that deeper
financial intermediation would increase the effectiveness of monetary policy and
promote more inclusive growth. In this context, Directors encouraged the strict
application of recently overhauled regulations on connected lending and concentration
risk. This, coupled with ongoing improvements in banking supervision, will help prevent
the build-up of financial stability risks.
Directors welcomed the implementation of the new investment code and the one-stop
shop as useful first steps toward improving the business climate. Structural reforms are
needed to diversify the economy away from commodity exports and foster more
inclusive growth, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like agriculture. They also urged
the authorities to tackle remaining governance problems, notably through the systematic
application of the procurement code.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under Mauritania’s Extended Credit
Facility Arrangement and Approves US$16.78 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the fourth
review of the economic performance of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania under the
program supported by a three-year Extended Credit Facility arrangement.
Completion of the review makes SDR 11.04 million (about US$16.78 million) available to
the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. This would bring total disbursements under the
arrangement to SDR 55.2 million (about US$83.89 million).
The Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement for Mauritania in March 2010 for
an amount equivalent to SDR 77.28 million (about 120 percent of the country’s quota in the
IMF, (see Press Release No. 10/89).
Executive Directors noted the progress made by the authorities on their reform objectives
under the ECF-supported program despite a severe drought and difficult economic
conditions.
In completing the review, the IMF’s board also approved the authorities’ request for waivers
of nonobservance and modification of performance criteria.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
―Mauritania’s performance under the ECF-supported program was strong in 2011. Sound
policies contributed to the accumulation of significant fiscal and external buffers, which
helped the economy withstand a severe drought, a slowdown in external demand, and high
international fuel and food prices. However, progress in tackling unemployment and poverty
has been limited, and the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks due to its
dependency on commodity exports.

2
―In the short run, Mauritania’s main challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability. In this
regard, the introduction of a new short-term T-bill maturity to absorb excess liquidity in the
banking sector will help guard against inflation. The modest loosening of the fiscal stance in
2012 to meet drought-relief needs is appropriate, although these additional expenditures
should be phased out once the drought is over to ensure fiscal sustainability.
―The authorities’ determination to consolidate the fiscal position over the medium term is
commendable. Replacing universal price subsidies with well-targeted social safety nets is a
key component of this strategy. To further reduce vulnerabilities, fiscal policy should be
delinked from volatile commodity prices, notably by creating a well-managed mining fund.
In addition, efforts aimed at improving non-mining tax collection and seeking new revenue
from the natural resource sector should be sustained, while protecting Mauritania as a
destination for foreign investors.
―Structural reforms to create employment, reduce poverty, and diversify the economy away
from commodity exports remain crucial. The implementation of the new investment code and
the one-stop shop are useful first steps toward improving the business climate. Remaining
governance problems should also be tackled, notably through the systematic application of
the new procurement code.‖

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Mauritania
July 2, 2012
I. Introduction
Mauritania was hit by a severe drought in 2011 that tipped a quarter of the total population
into food insecurity. As the authorities continue to alleviate the effects of the drought on the
poor and the vulnerable, they reiterate their commitment to the prudent policies and reforms
under the program, and thank staff for the candid discussions and helpful advice during the
recent mission in Nouakchott.
The implementation of the ECF-supported program continues to be satisfactory. All
quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2011 were met, including the target on
poverty-related expenditures, and the target on international reserves, both with a wide
margin. On the structural front, all but three of the eight structural benchmarks at endDecember 2011 were met (further progress was since achieved on the remaining three unmet
benchmarks). The criterion on non-concessional borrowing, for which my authorities request
a waiver, was missed by only three weeks.
In spite of the severity of the recent drought and the difficult international environment—
Europe being a key destination for Mauritania’s exports and an essential development
partner—, the authorities are determined to pursue their efforts to stabilize the economy and
improve the population’s living standards. However, as growth continues to be mostly driven
by extractive industries—which are not inclusive by nature—, further reducing poverty and
providing employment opportunities especially for the youth, remains a challenge. Continued
support from the international community to assist my authorities in their efforts to diversify
the economy, along with well-targeted social safety nets is therefore crucial.
II. Recent Economic Developments
Growth decelerated slightly in 2011 at 4 percent (compared to 5.1 percent in 2010) as the
consequences of the drought severely affected agricultural production. Real GDP growth is
however projected to reach 5.7 percent this year as agricultural production recovers thanks to
a favorable rainy season, and led also by the dynamism of the construction sector. On the
fiscal front, the overall deficit improved to 1.5 percent of non-oil GDP from 2 percent in
2010 driven by strong fiscal revenues from the booming mining sector. Inflation decelerated
to 5.7 percent from 6.3 percent as a result mainly of the slower pace of the increase in credit
to the private sector.
Relatively high international prices of the main commodities exported helped narrow the
current account deficit to 7.4 percent of GDP from 8.6 in 2010. The deficit will however
widen in 2012 driven by higher imports related to the emergency program and sizeable
infrastructure projects underway (a new power plant; a new international airport), and also
the projected decline in iron ore prices. Foreign exchange reserves increased substantially in

2
2011, nearly doubling to $501 million (compared to a year before), as the authorities
continue to strengthen buffers to shield the economy from potential shocks.
III. Policies Under the ECF
A. Fiscal Policy
Drought-related emergency spending and the need to increase fuel subsidies have put
pressure on this year’s budget. Thus, government expenditures rose by 1.1 percentage point
of non-oil GDP compared to 2010. My authorities are grateful to the donor community for
the sizeable pledges under the emergency program. However, given delays in disbursement
and also higher than initially anticipated costs and subsidies, spending in favor of the affected
poor was further revised upwards. On the revenue side, high international iron ore prices led
to record profits at the national mining company which translated into higher dividend
payouts to the government. Overall, fiscal revenues improved in 2011.
For 2012, the authorities remain firmly committed to their fiscal consolidation efforts, and
insist that the increase in the fiscal deficit projected for this year is temporary, mainly driven
by the need to address the effects of the drought. Efforts to rein in overall spending through
the stabilizing of the wage bill (civil service reform) or the introduction of new fuel price
formula to better align domestic fuel prices with international price and significantly reduce
subsidies remain high on my authorities’ agenda. In this regard, they would also like to stress
that the construction of the new international airport granted to a private consortium will
have no impact on the budget (except for minor expenditures) as it is paid for by a transfer of
land and no guarantee or tax incentives were given to the consortium by the government.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Liquidity continues to be abundant in the banking sector resulting from high exports receipts
from the mining sector (unsterilized) and also high fiscal revenues which have reduced the
government’s need to issue T-bills.
In their efforts to ensure price stability and anchor inflation expectations, the monetary
authorities target a moderate 13 percent growth of money supply this year. The central bank
will continue to closely monitor inflationary pressures and if necessary will tighten the
monetary policy stance through an increase of reserve requirements or T-bills emissions. In
this regard, and in accordance with the recommendations of Fund TA a new T-bill maturity
of one week will be introduced to sterilize excess liquidity (the cost will however be borne by
the Ministry of Finance).
On reforming the financial system, the authorities are addressing a number of weaknesses
identified by recent IMF and World Bank TA missions. In particular, the government will
seek to develop long-term savings by further loosening the regulation on interest rates on
savings accounts. Efforts are also underway to strengthen regulations and supervision of the

3
banking system through the introduction of a new capital adequacy framework consistent
with Basel II. The authorities are also making progress in the generalization of IFRS
accounting, and an audit firm is currently assisting commercial banks in their transition to
IFRS.
C. Poverty Reduction and Structural Reforms
Major steps have recently been taken to more effectively target social safety nets to the poor.
With the assistance of UNICEF, the authorities have designed a social protection strategy
aimed at better protecting the poor and vulnerable groups, and should be adopted by the
government by end-June 2012. Furthermore, a poverty survey of vulnerable groups in the
capital, Nouakchott, was recently completed with the help of the World Food Program. On
the basis of this survey, a cash transfer scheme for 10,000 poor households was launched,
and will be extended to the rest of the country as soon as the vulnerability survey for the
reminder of the country is completed (scheduled before the end of this year).
The government has also developed a new fuel price structure with the goal of phasing out
and eliminating poorly targeted fuel subsidies. In this regard, the full pass-through of
international prices is expected to take place at the end of the year, but in meantime will be
applied to all large consumers by July 2012.
IV. Conclusion
My Mauritanian authorities have continued to make satisfactory progress under the ECFsupported program, and the overall economic performance remains strong. In light of their
achievements, I would like to request the Board’s support for the favorable completion of the
fourth review.
