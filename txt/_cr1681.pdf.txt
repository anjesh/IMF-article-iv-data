IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Indonesia
On February 24, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Indonesia.
Over the past few years, the significant strengthening of the policy framework in Indonesia has
bolstered macroeconomic resilience. This was demonstrated by sound monetary management
and a prudent fiscal stance, underpinned by historic fuel subsidy reforms in 2015. These actions
reinforced macroeconomic stability and supported growth. In effect, Indonesia safely navigated a
difficult external environment in 2015, characterized by the fall of commodity prices, shifts in
global financial conditions, and slower growth of trading partners. Medium-term prospects are
favorable, supported by an inclusive growth-enhancing policy agenda that also places emphasis
on stability.
Overall, macroeconomic performance in 2015 has been positive. Economic growth is forecast to
see a moderate acceleration to around 5 percent in 2016; investment activity would lead the
recovery, in particular, public sector spending. However, weak commodity prices and slower
demand from trading partners present headwinds to growth. Inflation has fallen sharply at end2015, and is expected to remain within the inflation target band (3–5 percent) in 2016. The
external current account deficit narrowed significantly in 2015 to around 2 percent of GDP on
lower imports, and is projected to increase moderately in 2016 due to a pickup in domestic
demand. The fiscal deficit in 2015 widened but remained below the 3 percent of GDP statutory
limit for the general government.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, mainly from external factors including more
volatile global financial conditions, a deeper-than-expected slowdown in emerging market

trading partners, and further declines in commodity prices, requiring continued vigilance by
policymakers.
The authorities’ fiscal policy strategy aims to create fiscal space through improved revenue
mobilization and reform of general subsidies in order to increase spending on infrastructure and
targeted social programs. Early successes include the large reduction in fuel subsidies and the
expansion of conditional cash transfers and public investment. Nonetheless, important challenges
remain with revenue mobilization from the effects of lower commodity prices and a related
contraction of imports.
The relatively tight stance of monetary policy in 2015, combined with exchange rate and bond
yield flexibility, helped the economy adjust to external pressures, which have eased in
early 2016. The authorities appropriately allowed the exchange rate to reflect market forces, with
judicious foreign currency interventions to ensure the orderly functioning of markets. Allowing
government bond yields to be market determined has facilitated government financing despite
volatility in external financial conditions.
Looking ahead, the main policy challenge for Indonesia is to chart a course to higher, more
inclusive growth in the medium term, while navigating the more volatile global environment by
preserving macro-financial stability and further strengthening the external position.
Strengthening the fiscal framework through an enhanced revenue strategy would help, with
policy framed in a medium-term plan that provides guidance to government programs. Higher
public investment should be combined with sound public financial management, governance
reform of state-owned enterprises, and monitoring of potential fiscal risks. The gradual
unwinding of the tight monetary policy stance is appropriate as long as inflation remains
contained and financial markets continue to be calm. Expeditious approval of the draft Financial
System Safety Net law is a top priority to strengthen the institutional framework for financial
sector stability. The structural reform strategy is well-focused on improving competitiveness to
accelerate economic growth and diversify the economy. A series of policy packages issued since
August 2015 signal a renewed policy strategy to improve the business climate and reduce the
cost of doing business, thus catalyzing higher private investment and raising potential growth
prospects for Indonesia.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ sound macroeconomic management and
commitment to reform, which has allowed the Indonesian economy to weather the downturn in
commodity prices and the challenging external environment. While the outlook is positive,

downside risks remain, and Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to implement
prudent policies to safeguard resilience and to sustain structural reform efforts.
Directors considered the fiscal strategy to be appropriate. They welcomed the authorities’
commitment to adjust the 2016 budget in light of a lower revenue outlook, and looked forward to
continued adherence to the fiscal rule. Directors commended the decisive energy subsidy reforms
in 2015, including plans to better target electricity subsidies, and the use of the resulting fiscal
space to increase growth-critical social and capital spending. At the same time, the
underperformance of revenues has underscored the need to improve revenue mobilization by
enhancing tax policy and revenue administration, in the context of a medium-term fiscal
framework, to finance the large infrastructure needs and other priorities. Directors also stressed
the importance of sound public investment planning and management, and highlighted the role
that carefully designed PPPs could play in helping to address infrastructure needs.
Directors noted that the tight monetary policy in 2015 has helped to anchor inflation. While the
recent easing is appropriate, they agreed that it should be gradual and cautious to safeguard
financial stability, keep inflation within the target band, and support external adjustment.
Directors supported continued exchange rate flexibility and market-determined bond yields.
They welcomed efforts to deepen money markets to improve liquidity management, strengthen
monetary policy transmission, and help manage external financial volatility.
Directors took positive note that Indonesia’s financial system is sound, but called for close
monitoring of pockets of vulnerability. They called for expeditious enactment of the Financial
System Safety Net law to clarify the frameworks for emergency liquidity assistance and bank
resolution and align the mandates of financial sector agencies with the new structure. Directors
encouraged effective implementation of the framework for monitoring risks in the corporate
sector to address vulnerabilities stemming from foreign currency exposures and refinancing
risks.
Directors welcomed the new direction of structural reforms and investment liberalization and
called for continued efforts to bolster employment, diversify the economy, and raise growth
potential. They emphasized the need to press ahead with reforms to revamp the business climate,
streamline regulations, increase international trade and investment integration, deepen financial
markets, and improve labor market flexibility.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 8, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Since the taper tantrum episode in mid-2013, the Indonesian authorities have
taken significant steps to strengthen the policy framework, including through sound
monetary management and a prudent fiscal stance, underpinned by historic fuel subsidy
reforms in 2015. This has led to improved economic fundamentals. Nevertheless,
Indonesia, like many emerging market economies (EMs) is facing pressures from shifts in
the global economy due to slower growth and rebalancing in China, a severe down cycle
in commodity prices, and monetary policy normalization in the United States. While the
near-term outlook is positive, downside risks and vulnerabilities remain elevated.
Near-term outlook: Growth in 2016 is projected to increase moderately to 4.9 percent,
from an estimated 4.7 percent in 2015, supported by a pickup in capital spending and
conditioned on improved investment sentiment on positive reform momentum. Inflation
is projected to remain low, while the current account deficit is expected to increase
somewhat due to a recovery in domestic demand. Risks to the outlook remain high and
are tilted to the downside, mainly from global financial conditions, further decline in
commodity prices, and larger slowdown in trading partners, especially China. Slowerthan-expected progress on structural and fiscal reforms remains the key sources of
domestic risks.
Policy recommendations: There is broad consensus that policies should aim at
improving growth potential and making growth more inclusive, while also containing
short-term vulnerabilities. The current policy framework, which rests on exchange rate
flexibility and market-determined government bond yields, underpinned by sound
monetary management and prudent fiscal policy, remains Indonesia’s best buffer against
global volatility. Contingency planning and enhanced risk assessment of potential
vulnerabilities in the corporate and banking sectors remains important, as is expeditious
improvement of the authorities’ bank resolution and crisis management framework. A
medium term fiscal framework that targets a decisive increase in the tax ratio through
improved revenue mobilization will create fiscal space to address infrastructure gaps and
expand well-targeted social programs. Financial stability should be reinforced with the
expeditious passage of the financial system safety net bill (FSSN). Structural policies
aimed at improving competitiveness will remain critical to raising and sustaining growth,
increasing employment and improving general living standards.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Indonesia has weathered challenging economic conditions well. The economy has
navigated safely the commodity price shocks, tightening financial conditions, and repeated bouts of
turbulence in global financial markets, assisted by broadly appropriate macroeconomic policies.
Overall, economic fundamentals improved in 2015, even as the external environment became less
supportive and more uncertain. Growth has continued at a solid pace and remains among the
highest in EMs. Inflation has fallen to the lower end of the official target band. The current account
deficit has narrowed and investment flows remained mostly supportive. The government has
implemented a bold reform of energy subsidies, and made progress in boosting infrastructure
investment and starting to streamline the burden of regulations. These actions have helped to shore
up investor confidence. Indonesia has significant growth potential, with young demographics, rich
endowment in natural resources, low public debt, a large domestic market, and a participatory and
stable political system.
2.
The Indonesian economy, however, is still facing headwinds. Like many EMs, Indonesia is
facing pressures from ongoing shifts in the global economy related to lower growth and rebalancing
in China, a severe down-cycle in commodity prices, and monetary policy normalization in the United
States. These adverse developments have led to a slowdown in growth in recent years, tighter
financing conditions, and increased risks and vulnerabilities. The economy has been adversely
affected through commodity price, trade, and financial channels (Box 1). Government revenues, in
particular from oil, have dropped significantly. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows
have slowed down, as foreign investors’ appetite for EM assets in general has weakened. Following a
period of rapid increase in foreign currency leverage, albeit from low levels, corporate performance
has weakened and non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector are creeping up.
3.
Against this backdrop, the 2015 Article IV consultation focused on the need to manage
short-term vulnerabilities and to boost potential growth in the medium-term. The challenge is
to follow through on the reforms that the government has already launched and undertake further
macro-critical reforms to boost productivity and diversify growth, while maintaining macroeconomic
and financial stability. Policy priorities include: (i) enhancing revenue mobilization to create fiscal
space for growth-enhancing spending, (ii) maintaining flexible exchange rates and marketdetermined government bond yields, (iii) completing the legal framework to support financial
stability, and (iv) accelerating infrastructure development and structural reforms to unlock
Indonesia’s growth potential.
4.
Past Fund advice and the authorities’ policies have been broadly aligned, although
there has been some divergence. The authorities kept a relatively tight monetary stance in 2015,
made progress with strengthening financial supervision, and prepared legislation to improve the
financial stability framework. The authorities also pursued a flexible exchange rate policy, with some
FX intervention to prevent disorderly market conditions during episodes of external pressures. On
the fiscal front, actions were strong on subsidy reform, notably the landmark fuel pricing reform in
early 2015 that was followed by further actions on electricity reforms. Government bond yields

moved in line with market conditions. However, the fiscal deficit in 2015 is estimated to be higher
than recommended, in part reflecting weak revenue performance as no significant revenues
measures were taken, with the focus instead being placed on tax administration to raise compliance.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
5.
Macroeconomic performance. Despite the sharp fall in international oil prices, episodes of
capital outflows, and turbulent global financial markets, the Indonesian economy performed well
in 2015. Growth is estimated to have stabilized at 4.7 percent (y/y) (down from 5.1 percent in 2014).
Headline inflation fell to 3.4 percent at end-2015 on account of lower food and fuel prices, and
dissipating effect of the fuel price increases in late 2014. Inflation expectations appear to be well
anchored, with surveys indicating price expectations within the target band. The current account
deficit is estimated to have fallen to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2015, mainly due to a contraction of
imports. Substantially lower oil prices reduced oil imports by almost 2 percent of GDP from 2014
levels. Portfolio inflows remained supportive on balance, although equity outflows have continued in
line with developments in other EMs. Gross international reserves fell somewhat to US$105.9 billion
(or 7.4 months of imports of goods and services) at end-2015, but remained adequate at
119 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric. The rupiah depreciated by about 10 percent
relative to the U.S. dollar but remained broadly stable in nominal effective terms, while bond yields
rose by about 100 basis points—in both cases relatively modest compared with other EMs. The
government successfully placed international bonds amounting to US$3.5 billion in December 2015.
6.
The near-term outlook continues to be supported by domestic demand yet affected by the
severe commodity down-cycle and weak global growth, in particular in major trading partners.


Real GDP growth. In 2016, growth is projected to increase moderately to 4.9 percent. Domestic
demand would be the main driver of growth, while exports are expected to remain weak
reflecting low commodity prices. Growth will be led by capital spending of the government and
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the first half of the year, and by private investment later in the
year conditioned on positive reform momentum. Private consumption will increase somewhat
on account of lower fuel prices, but the recovery will be constrained by reduced commodity
income in rural areas and cuts in electricity subsidies.



Inflation is projected to remain within the BI’s target band in 2016, aided by anchored inflation
expectations and lower fuel prices, with core inflation remaining stable. However, moderate
upward pressures may arise from food price increase due to the El Niño phenomenon and
further cuts in electricity and LPG gas subsidies.



The current account deficit (CAD) is projected to increase to around 2½ percent of GDP
in 2016, on the back of a pickup in fixed investment and a further deterioration in commodity
export prices, while the balance of payments (BOP) is projected to return to a small surplus.

7.
Risks and contingencies. The economy faces a combination of risks tilted to the downside,
mainly from external factors (Appendix I). The main risk is more volatile global financial conditions,
with poor market liquidity possibly amplifying volatility in the event of capital outflows. A further
surge in the U.S. dollar could also add strains to corporate balance sheets arising from foreign
currency (FX) denominated debt. A deeper-than-expected slowdown in EM trading partners, notably
China, could further weaken external demand and commodity prices. On the domestic front, slow
progress in investment-enabling structural reforms and public investment projects and continued
declines in government revenue could negatively impact growth.
8.
Macro-financial linkages. A confluence of external and domestic factors could exacerbate
strains on banks and corporates. The main transmission channels would be from heightened risk
aversion leading to a sudden stop of capital flows and increased exposure of the banking sector to
the corporate sector (Boxes 2‒4). If a surge in investor risk aversion were to result in a sudden stop,
corporates would be forced to increase borrowing from domestic banks, leading to the migration of
risks across sectors (Box 4) and increased net exposure and vulnerability of the banking sector
(Box 2). Moreover, the corporate sector could become more exposed to higher refinancing and
default risk (Box 3). However, the economy is expected to be able to withstand an adverse BOP
shock, with a policy response consisting of tighter aggregate demand management, continued
exchange rate flexibility and market-determined government bond yields, combined with judicious
use of FX intervention to prevent disorderly market conditions. Contingency financing (amounting
to about US$77 billion) is in place, consisting of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization and
bilateral swap arrangements.
9.
Medium-term outlook. Growth is expected to reach 6 percent by 2020, factoring in strong
infrastructure investment and structural reforms that support productivity growth. The business
environment would improve with progress in addressing supply-side bottlenecks. Tax revenue-toGDP ratio would increase gradually and help create additional space for investment and other high
priority spending, but a significant spending gap would remain over the medium term. The CAD
would remain near 2½ percent of GDP on account of an increase in investment-related imports, as
well as expansion of domestic demand. FDI and portfolio inflows would remain supportive, with
international reserves expected to remain at around six months of imports.
10.
Authorities’ views. The authorities generally agreed with staff on macroeconomic
developments in 2015, but expected a stronger pickup in growth for 2016 contingent on an
improvement in global growth and on the back of positive support from the government’s reform
initiatives. Views were broadly aligned on the inflation forecast and the external outlook. The
authorities generally concurred on the assessment of major risks facing the economy. They noted
that the strengthening of the policy framework since mid-2013 has enhanced macroeconomic
stability and helped Indonesia weather several episodes of external turbulence relatively well. In
addition, the authorities strongly believe that the fiscal reforms that are commencing, including on
revenues, expenditures, and financing, will support the outlook for economic growth.

11.
External position and Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA). Indonesia’s external
position in 2015 is assessed to be broadly consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable
policies. Staff estimates the current account (CA) gap to be -0.7 percent to 1.3 percent of GDP,
consistent with the REER gap in the range of -6.5 percent to 3.5 percent (Box 5 and Appendix II).
Policy actions since mid-2013, including monetary policy tightening, fuel subsidy reform, and
greater exchange rate flexibility, have helped improve the external position. The main conclusions
from the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) are broadly unchanged from the last Article IV
(Appendix III). At 36½ percent of GDP (about half of which is public), external debt remains at a
moderate level, notwithstanding a rise in recent years. External financing appears sustainable, but
could be affected by domestic and external shocks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy and Reforms—Creating Fiscal Space for Priority Spending
12.
Fiscal Strategy. The government’s fiscal strategy is to create fiscal space via revenue
mobilization and energy subsidy reform to allow for higher investment in infrastructure and social
welfare programs. Some early successes were reached in 2015 although important challenges have
emerged that require early actions. The authorities introduced an ambitious energy subsidy reform
that eliminated subsidies on gasoline and rationalized those on diesel and electricity. These
measures, as well as low world oil prices, reduced energy subsidies by about 2 percentage points of
GDP in 2015. Social protection has improved somewhat in recent years, including with the launch of
universal health insurance.1 However, government revenues fell sharply mainly due to the impact of
lower oil prices, offsetting the gains from subsidy reforms. Absent decisive reform to strengthen the
revenue base, the underperformance of government revenues would pose a significant risk to the
authorities’ fiscal strategy.
13.
Developments in 2015. The central government deficit is estimated to have reached
2.8 percent of GDP, leaving the deficit of the general government (projected at the same level) close
to the statutory limit.2 About half of government bond issuance in 2015 is estimated to have been
financed by nonresident investors, who purchased both global and local currency bonds.
Government revenues decreased by 1.7 percentage points to 13 percent of GDP, mainly due to the
sharp fall in oil prices. The ratio of non-oil-and-gas tax revenues to GDP remained similar to the
level in 2014, despite one-off tax collections (such as prepayment of income and excise taxes)
1

The universal health insurance was launched in 2014. The main features of the reform are to consolidate multiple
schemes and to increase coverage to self-employed and the informal sector. The increase in coverage has not yet
taken place, as the authorities are evaluating its modality. So far, the fiscal impact of this reform has been small. For
more detail, see Indonesia—Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 15/175), “Managing Fiscal Risks in Indonesia.”

Indonesia’s fiscal rule limits the deficit of the general government to 3 percent of GDP and the public debt to
60 percent of GDP. While having some drawbacks, including the procyclicality of fiscal policy associated with
commodity cycles, this rule has provided an important policy anchor that, combined with rapid economic growth in
recent years, has contributed to the public debt falling from near 90 percent of GDP in 2000 to 27.5 percent in 2015.

recorded in December 2015. Capital spending (including local transfers for infrastructure) expanded
by 0.8 percentage points of GDP (to 2.5 percent of GDP), reflecting a concerted government effort
to improve project execution.
14.
Outlook. For 2016, under current policies, staff project central government revenue to
decline further, by almost one percentage point of GDP to 12.1 percent, mainly reflecting even lower
oil prices. To keep the deficit under the legal limit, spending would need to be curtailed even after
taking account of additional subsidy savings of 0.4 percent from better targeting of electricity
subsidies and lower oil prices. In the staff’s baseline scenario, some of the progress achieved in
expanding priority spending in 2015 will need to be rolled back this year. In addition, a more
uncertain external environment may make foreign investors less willing to invest in Indonesian
bonds. For the medium term, in the baseline scenario, the general government deficit is expected to
remain near the statutory limit, which would result in an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to about
30 percent of GDP by 2020, which is still relatively moderate. While the baseline envisages a modest
increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio and further progress in energy subsidy reform, on current policies,
capital spending at the general government would only reach 4 percent of GDP by 2020,
significantly below the authorities’ objectives and the regional average of 8 percent.

15.
Staff position. The authorities’ fiscal strategy is broadly appropriate. However, it needs to
be strengthened in light of recent developments; in particular, revenue mobilization needs to be
enhanced significantly in the context of a medium-term fiscal framework.


8

Medium-term fiscal framework. To boost confidence and provide guidance to government
plans, the authorities should consider developing a medium-term fiscal strategy that targets an
increase in the ratio of non-oil-and-gas tax-to-GDP by 2-3 percentage points over the medium
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

term, together with the policies to achieve this. This target seems reasonable given the low tax
ratio of Indonesia compared to EM peers. The pace of the increase in the tax ratio should take
into account the cyclical position of the economy.


2016 Budget. The authorities’ intention to adjust the approved 2016 budget early in the year
based on actual revenue of 2015 is well placed as the revenue and expenditure levels are
unrealistically high. The authorities should also consider taking early actions to increase
revenues in 2016, including through an increase in excises on fuel, tobacco, and vehicles. The
latter could raise an additional 0.6 percent of GDP of revenue. Combined with some savings
from rationalizing lower priority spending, these measures would allow for the reduction of the
general government deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP, rebuilding buffers against the deficit ceiling
and mitigating financing risks. At the same time, they would secure space to maintain priority
expenditures at a level similar to 2015.



Revenue mobilization. There is a clear need to implement a comprehensive strategy that
comprises both tax administration and tax reform actions.
o

Tax administration: ongoing
reforms should be adapted to
focus on risk, including targeting
high-potential segments of the
economy; ensuring tax
withholding obligations, in
particular for employers; and the
use of a few priority sources of
external information for tax
audit. The progress with VAT
e-invoicing is a positive
development which would pave
the way for risk-based audits. In
addition, risk-based compliance
strategies by tax type and by
taxpayer size would support
these efforts.

o

Tax policy: there is a need to
broaden the tax base by rationalizing exemptions, which could pave the way to raising VAT
rate over the medium term. Tax reform should also aim to rationalize income taxes,
including unifying various existing rates and rationalizing tax incentives, and strengthen
property taxes. Staff cautioned against basing the revenue mobilization plan in 2016 largely
on the tax amnesty bill being discussed in Parliament because of the significant uncertainty
surrounding its approval and impact on government revenues. The tax amnesty aims at the
repatriation of financial assets by levying a small tax rate on declared assets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Infrastructure investment. The authorities’ infrastructure plan could significantly improve
productivity and crowd-in private investment through public-private partnerships (PPP) and the
establishment of a coordinating body (Committee for Accelerated Infrastructure Delivery) to
focus on priority projects (Box 6).3 Progress has been made in project planning and selection.
However, the pace of implementation needs to be aligned with capacity constraints, including
those of local governments, and should carefully consider fiscal risks and macroeconomic
spillovers, including on interest rates and the current account. Moreover, the authorities should
minimize the granting of tax exemptions, which are likely to be less effective at raising potential
output than reform of the business environment. The increases in contingent liabilities for the
government and public debt will be affected by the uncertainty in international financing
conditions, which imply the need to manage this process prudently. Expanded infrastructure
spending should be complemented with improved financial management of public investment
and strengthening governance at state-owned enterprises and capacity at local governments.



16.
Subsidy reform. The fuel subsidy reform has been very successful and can serve as a model
for other countries. The authorities’ plan to continue with these reforms through improved targeting
of subsidized electricity rates in 2016 is commendable. The authorities should introduce a
transparent pricing formula that ensures timely adjustments of fuel prices to changes in
international oil prices and the exchange rate.
17.

Authorities’ views:



The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment on the need to revise the budget and further
improve the composition of public spending, although they differed on the actions needed to
mobilize revenue. The 2016 budget revision is planned earlier in the year, after reviewing tax
collections in 2015. The authorities agreed on the need to increase fiscal space for infrastructure
investment, which they view as a key driver of growth. Nevertheless, they also acknowledged
that there are some limitations in the level of financing available for execution of the
infrastructure plan. Therefore, implementation will be steady and gradual. The relevant public
agencies have already started the development of the legal framework to support infrastructure
development, including by issuing the implementing regulations of the land acquisition law to
facilitate public investment.



The authorities noted that the efforts to shift from general price-based subsidies to welltargeted subsidies will continue with the 2016 budget, focusing on enhancing targeted support
for farmers and fishermen, and conditional cash transfers. On revenue mobilization, the
authorities viewed that Indonesia’s low tax-to-GDP ratio stems mainly from problems in tax
administration and compliance, including arising from a complex VAT refund system and the
strict bank secrecy rule that prevents access to taxpayers’ financial data. In their view, staff’s
proposal to raise excise taxes would require a large increase, especially for selected excises, to

3

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

boost revenue in the short run. They also believe that Indonesia will need to enhance the menu
of tax incentives to promote FDI, in line with those offered by other ASEAN countries. These
reforms will also be supported by more sustainable financing policies. High reliance on market
financing is being reduced with alternative instruments that are being developed, including
financing from bilateral and multilaterals sources.

B. Monetary Policy and Foreign Exchange Management—Navigating a
Volatile Environment
18.

Developments in 2015. Financial volatility increased in the first nine months of 2015, in the
early months due to the slowdown of EMs growth and external uncertainty, and in AugustSeptember due to depreciation of the renminbi and turbulence in the Shanghai stock market. In
October, markets recovered strongly in line with the region, and have since been broadly stable.
In 2015, BI had kept the policy rate unchanged since February, with the policy rate being 175 basis
points higher at the year-end compared to mid-2013. Despite episodes of capital outflows, declines
in international reserves were moderate, especially compared to the taper tantrum episode. The
exchange rate and government bond yields
moved flexibly in line with market conditions
and orderly market conditions were
maintained. BI continued its efforts to
promote money market deepening,
supported by Fund technical assistance,
taking actions to reduce structural excess
liquidity in the banking system by
introducing new instruments for liquidity
management and reducing its presence in
the interbank FX swap market. The latter was
accompanied by more fluctuations in
interbank rates as banks’ adjusted to
tightening liquidity conditions.
19.
Monetary policy stance. Against the backdrop of lower inflation and with an estimated
negative output gap of about 0.4 percent of GDP, Bank Indonesia (BI) has started a process of
gradually unwinding its tightening cycle. Exchange rate pass-through has been limited thus far.
Effective in December, BI reduced the primary reserve requirement in rupiah by 50 basis points (bps)
to 7.5 percent. Moreover, in January, the policy rate was reduced by 25 bps to 7.25 percent,
following the broadly mild reaction of financial markets to the increase in the U.S federal funds rates
in December and higher financial volatility in China in January. BI’s deposit and lending rates were
similarly reduced. With the decline in inflation, real interest rates have turned positive in real terms.
20.
Staff position. With a more volatile and uncertain external environment, BI faces the
challenge of calibrating policies towards preserving stability, against the backdrop of weaker growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

INDONESIA



Monetary policy stance. The relatively tight monetary stance of 2015, which reflected the
authorities’ emphasis on stability, helped the economy to face external turbulence and bring
inflation back to within the target band. Against the background of much lower inflation, a small
negative output gap, and the apparent easing of external pressures, the gradual unwinding of
the tightening cycle is appropriate to support the economy, but should be implemented very
cautiously. In this context, the authorities should remain vigilant and stand ready to respond if
external pressures resume or inflationary pressures reemerge.



Managing external volatility. The authorities’ response to higher global financial market
volatility in 2015 was broadly appropriate, allowing for flexible exchange rates and marketdetermined government bond yields, together with modest use of international reserves to
ensure orderly market conditions. Maintaining such policy flexibility, combined with the
strengthening of financing contingencies, is critical.



Financial market deepening. The authorities’ recent actions to deepen the money markets
should continue, including by introducing reserve requirement averaging to reduce the need for
banks to hold high precautionary reserves. The launch by the financial services agency (OJK) in
January 2016 of the Global Master Repurchase Agreement aimed at developing the
collateralized interbank market is a positive development.

21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of recent
developments and the thrust of policy recommendations. BI noted that it had decided to maintain
its monetary policy stance in 2015, having weighed the impact of external developments, but
recently saw some scope to ease given moderating inflation and growth. Going forward, BI would
need to take into consideration a shift in the balance between stability and growth due to the rising
risk of adverse spillbacks from declining growth on financial stability. Thus, priority would continue
to be placed on stability, although with policy calibrated carefully to support economic growth. To
help manage external financial volatility, the authorities pointed out that further progress on
financial market deepening is a continued priority, while bilateral swap arrangements for contingent
financing have been expanded over the past few years.

C. Financial and Corporate Sector Issues—Sailing with Greater Vigilance
22.
Recent performance of the banking sector. The banking system appears to be broadly
sound but has pockets of rising vulnerability (Box 2). On average, the banking system is well
capitalized and profitable, with a capital adequacy ratio of near 19 percent and return on assets of
2.7 percent, well above major EMs. The high level of banks’ capital and profitability continues to help
weather a slower pace of economic growth and the impact of rupiah depreciation on corporates.
However, soundness varies across different types of banks. Some medium and smaller size banks are
vulnerable to a liquidity shock due to their higher reliance on short maturity deposits. In addition,
profitability has been showing signs of weakening and NPLs have started to creep up (to 2.6 percent

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

of total loans in September), while special mention loans4 jumped to 5.7 percent. Staff analysis
suggests that subdued economic growth and rupiah depreciation, if continued, would push NPLs
higher. Finally, the corporate sector is under growing pressure from a combination of sluggish
growth, low commodity prices, and tighter funding conditions, which could spillover to banks.
23.
Institutional developments. The financial sector supervisory and regulatory function in
Indonesia is in transition. Bank supervision and regulation were moved from BI to the new financial
supervisory agency (OJK) in 2014, while BI retained regulatory responsibilities for macroprudential
policies. There is a need to align the legislations pertaining to the financial sector agencies, including
their mandates, to the new institutional arrangement. In addition, there are gaps in the frameworks
for emergency liquidity assistance and bank resolution, including inadequate bank resolution tools
available to the deposit insurance agency and lack of legal protection for supervisors. There is also a
need to strengthen coordination and cooperation for crisis management. The authorities have
submitted to Parliament a draft bill (FSSN), which aims at clarifying these frameworks and mandates
and provides for more tools for the resolution of systemic banks.
24.
Supervision and regulation. OJK is developing a framework for consolidated supervision of
banks and non-banks and upgrading risk-based supervision, including for AML/CFT, supported by
Fund technical assistance. BI has made further progress in Basel III implementation. Liquidity
coverage ratio (LCR) requirements are being adopted to help banks manage liquidity risk and, most
recently, the counter-cyclical capital buffer has been introduced. Responding to the slowing
economy, in July 2015, OJK introduced policies to facilitate loan restructuring for banks with
relatively strong risk management capacity. In addition, BI has also unwound part of the tightening
of macro-prudential measures, undertaken in 2012‒13 to address systemic financial stability risks
from rapid credit growth.5
25.
Corporate sector. The corporate sector remains relatively strong compared to EM peers, but
risks are increasing, notably from a rapid rise in FX debt over the past years and weakening
performance (Box 3). Performance indicators suggest that the corporate sector as a whole appears
to be sound, as aggregate corporate leverage is still moderate and profitability remains the highest
among EM peers. Nonetheless, corporates have been impacted by commodity price falls and a weak
rupiah, exacerbated by increased FX debt. Corporate FX debt (including FX debt to domestic
banks) reached around 20 percent of GDP as of June 2015, double the level seen in 2010, and
concentrated in the commodity and a few non-tradable sectors. Against this backdrop, some
corporates, in particular those below investment grade, have been facing rising refinancing risk or
default risk: (i) while progress has been achieved with hedging of the FX debt, it is still incomplete,
making some corporates vulnerable to currency depreciation: (ii) rollover risk is likely to grow this
4

These are loans late up to 90 days, not classified as NPLs (August data).

5

In 2012‒13, loan-to-value (LTV) limits on residential mortgage lending and down payments on auto loans were
tightened, and additional reserve requirements were placed on banks having capital adequacy ratios below
14 percent and having loan-to-deposit ratios exceeding prescribed thresholds. In June 2015, both of these measures
were partly unwound for banks having NPL ratios below 5 percent, to avoid undue credit and liquidity tightening.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

year, as maturing FX debt securities are set to peak; or (iii) some corporates are facing higher default
risks, with an increasing number of corporates finding it difficult to meet interest expenses. While
disorderly defaults of large systemically connected corporates could create negative spillovers to the
banking system and damage confidence, the risk is small. The results of the empirical analysis
confirm these observations (Boxes 3 and 4).6
26.
Anti-money laundering/financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) issues. Indonesia was
removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) monitoring process in late 2015 in
recognition of the significant improvements in the AML/CFT regime. The country’s financial
intelligence unit (PPATK) is working on a national risk assessment.
27.
Staff position. To safeguard financial stability, the financial stability architecture needs to be
enhanced expeditiously, while the banking and corporate sectors need to be monitored.


Banking sector soundness. The financial sector appears broadly sound although this
assessment could be somewhat overstated by lagging indicators in an environment of slower
economic growth and rupiah depreciation. Moreover, there are pockets of vulnerabilities that
need to be monitored closely. Measures introduced in July to facilitate restructuring of NPLs
should be accompanied by stronger supervision to ensure adequate implementation (Box 2).7



Corporate sector soundness. The authorities are rightly monitoring the corporate sector closely
and both the BI and OJK have strengthened their surveillance framework. In addition, BI’s
innovative FX hedging regulations have helped corporates manage currency risks and contain
the rapid growth of external debt in the recent periods. These regulations require FX hedging by
corporates starting in 2015:Q4 of a gradually rising share of foreign liabilities falling due and
limiting external borrowing to investment grade firms. The corporate resolution framework
(including the bankruptcy regime) should be reviewed to ensure that it is capable of dealing
with large and systemically connected conglomerates. In the medium term, deeper financial
markets will help reduce the costs of hedging and facilitate development of the domestic
corporate bond market.



Supervision and regulation. Staff welcomes the further progress made in the implementation
of Basel III requirements. Staff considers the authorities’ decision to ease macroprudential
measures in 2015 as appropriate, intended to reduce systemic financial risks derived from a
tightening of credit conditions. Building on the progress in improving the AML/CFT regime, the
authorities are encouraged to further expand customer due diligence measures.



Financial stability architecture. An early approval of the FSSN bill is critical, which should be
followed by the simultaneous and closely-coordinated revisions of the laws of BI, the Deposit

Insurance Corporation (LPS), and OJK, to ensure the overall consistency of the legal framework
to the new institutional arrangements. These revisions should provide clarity on the mandates
and policy responsibilities of each institution. In this regard, it will be important to grant LPS
additional powers and instruments to resolve small banks.
28.
Authorities’ views. The authorities generally agreed with staff’s views and
recommendations. The banking sector is considered to be strong, and while banks’ asset quality has
worsened somewhat, it remains manageable. OJK is monitoring the process of NPL restructuring
closely to ensure financial stability. The authorities are placing a strong emphasis on strengthening
the financial stability architecture. On the corporate sector, the authorities have closely monitored
corporate debt, and expressed confidence that the risks could be managed. The authorities have
gathered useful information, partly through the FX hedging regulations, which would be improved
in the future.

D. Structural Reform Priorities—Diversifying Growth Engines
29.
Macro-critical issues. Over the decade prior to 2012, the commodity boom underpinned
benign macro-financial developments in Indonesia, including strong economic expansion and rapid
credit growth, assisted by a prudent macroeconomic policy mix. With the end of the commodity
super-cycle, the economy needs to find new drivers of growth, including in manufacturing,
agriculture, tourism, and other service industries. This will require critical structural reforms to
facilitate the diversification of the economy and to boost potential growth. These reforms need to
address a number of structural impediments, including a large infrastructure gap, complex and
burdensome regulations, protectionist tendencies, rigid labor markets and shallow financial markets.
The investment climate remains weak,8 complicated by the need for numerous permits from
different levels of governments,9 as well as restrictive FDI regulations, notably the negative
investment list (on foreign ownership and location or license restrictions).
30.
Recent reforms. The authorities have begun a series of reforms with a view of improving
the business climate and the efficiency of investment (Appendix IV). A series of policy packages
since August focused on a range of issues, including reducing the excessive burden of various layers
of regulations, facilitating trade, and taking initial steps to improve the functioning of the labor
markets. Moreover, the authorities issued the implementing regulations for the new land acquisition
legislation to address issues that had historically hampered investment, including in public
infrastructure. Energy subsidy reforms were combined with institutional changes to facilitate private
participation in the various stages of energy provision. The authorities have indicated that they
intend to review the opportunities available for foreign investment in Indonesia (the so-called

negative investment list) and consider participation in regional trading arrangement, including the
Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).
31.

Staff position:



Investment climate. The policy packages are an auspicious start of a process to improve the
business climate. These actions, and their implementation, should be followed by additional
measures to reduce the burden of excessive regulation. Bold actions on supply-side reforms and
trade liberalization will help increase investment and attract FDI inflows.



Labor market and human capital. Introducing flexibility to rigid labor practices can promote
employment and attract new sources of investment (e.g., easing complex restrictions on wage
setting as well as hiring and layoff procedures).10 Reducing skill gaps and strengthening human
capital (e.g., vocational training and stronger links with firms) will help Indonesia benefit from
positive demographic trends and foster inclusive growth.



Financial deepening. The financial markets and institutions have ample scope for development
in order to channel savings to needed investment and to increase the stability in the financial
system. Concerted efforts should be made to deepen capital markets, including corporate bond
markets, to strengthen long-term institutional investors and to develop a range of funding
instruments and investment options, while keeping the financial sector open to foreign
participation.

32.

Authorities’ views:



The authorities expressed a strong commitment to continuing structural reforms to establish
new drivers of growth and encourage investment. They indicated that these reforms were
prepared comprehensively to cover both fiscal issues (revenue, spending, and financing) and
actions to enhance productivity and competitiveness. Diversifying the economy to move away
from the longstanding reliance on natural resources is also part of the reform agenda. To this
effect, long-term policies are being developed, while, at the same time, actions are being
implemented to help the economy navigate the current global setting.



The authorities noted that they have closely followed up on the announced reform measures
and that most of the targeted regulations have been streamlined, although they recognize that
it may take time for the impact to fully materialize. Efforts will continue to enhance the
investment environment and streamline regulations, particularly at the local government level.
The authorities have also expressed their intention to open new sectors of the economy to FDI
and review Indonesia’s participation in regional trading arrangements, including the Trans Pacific
Partnership (TPP).

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Despite a weaker external environment in 2015, macroeconomic performance in
Indonesia has been satisfactory, underpinned by sound macroeconomic management. While
the weaker external environment contributed to lower growth and tighter and more volatile financial
conditions, economic growth remained among the highest in EMs, inflation fell sharply to within the
official target band and has remained well anchored, and the current account deficit narrowed.
Building on Indonesia’s strengths coming from its young demographics, low public debt, large
domestic markets, natural resource endowment, and participatory and stable political system,
economic fundamentals continued to improve.
34.
While the near-term outlook remains positive, the economy faces elevated risks that
are tilted to the downside. In 2016, economic growth is expected to recover moderately, inflation
to remain low, and the current account deficit to remain manageable. However, the economy faces a
combination of risks tilted to the downside, heightened mainly from adverse external developments.
Reliance on external financing makes Indonesia susceptible to funding reversals. Other external risks
include further fall in commodity prices, tighter global financial conditions, and a larger decline in
trading partners’ growth, notably in China. On the domestic front, delays in structural reforms and in
infrastructure spending could dampen growth. A confluence of external and domestic factors could
exacerbate strains on corporates and banks.
35.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy is appropriate, but important challenges emerged
in 2015. The actions to create fiscal space through revenue mobilization and reform of subsidies in
order to expand infrastructure investment and well-targeted social welfare spending achieved some
significant successes, including a historic subsidy reform and the expansion of priority spending.
However, government revenues underperformed significantly due mainly to the fiscal impact of
lower commodity prices, offsetting much of the gains from subsidy reform. Against this backdrop
the authorities reduced the level of spending to comply with the deficit ceiling of the fiscal rule.
36.
The authorities should consider adopting a medium-term fiscal framework with key
objectives and actions to achieve them. The authorities’ intention to adjust the revenue and
expenditure levels of the 2016 budget to be more consistent with 2015 actual outturns is
appropriate. Given Indonesia’s low tax ratio and the authorities’ ambitious development goals, there
is space to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 2‒3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term, in
order to allow for priority spending, while rebuilding fiscal buffers. Increasing the tax burden should
be gradual and take into account the cyclical position of the economy.
37.
There is an immediate need to reinvigorate policies to mobilize government revenues,
with actions framed in a medium-term plan. In the short-run, excises on selected products should
be increased, including tobacco, fuel, and cars. Over the medium-term, tax reform should aim at
broadening the tax base and increasing the VAT rate, while tax administration should adopt a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

INDONESIA

risk-based approach. Collections from a planned tax amnesty are very uncertain and, should they
underperform, the authorities may be forced to reverse some of the gains achieved in 2015 in
increasing public investment.
38.
The unwinding of the monetary policy tightening cycle should be gradual and
cautious. While the tight monetary policy bias in 2015 has helped to anchor inflation and support
the external position, the recent decline in inflation and the emergence of a small negative output
gap provide support for BI’s recent decisions to ease monetary policy and reduce reserve
requirements. Moreover, financial market indicators were relatively stable since October 2015—
including after the increase in the U.S. Federal Funds rate and higher financial volatility in China.
Further actions, however, should be carefully considered and paced, and take into account
inflationary and external developments
39.
Maintaining flexible exchange rates and market-determined government bond yields
is critical to help the Indonesian economy navigate through volatile external financial
conditions. The authorities have appropriately allowed the exchange rate to reflect market forces
with judicious foreign currency interventions to ensure the orderly functioning of markets. Allowing
government bond yields to be market determined has ensured financing of the budget deficit even
during turbulent financial conditions.
40.
While manageable, rising corporate sector vulnerabilities need to be monitored closely
and contingency plans considered. Lower corporate performance comes after a period of rapid
increase in foreign currency leverage, although from low levels. So far, the corporate sector has
adjusted well to the sharp fall in commodity prices, depreciation of the rupiah, and lower growth.
Profitability remains high relative to EM peers, but some corporates are under higher stress. The
authorities have taken action to promote hedging of foreign currency risk and are monitoring the
situation closely.
41.
Overall, the banking sector appears sound, although there are pockets of
vulnerabilities. Financial soundness indicators, including capital and profitability, remain relatively
strong. However, profitability has started to weaken and small banks face higher liquidity risks. While
the banking sector is expected to be able to weather slower economic growth, the authorities
should remain vigilant on possible spillovers from adverse external developments and corporate
strains on banks.
42.
Completing the authorities’ plans to strengthen the financial stability architecture
remains a top priority. In particular, the early approval of the FSSN bill will address some of the
critical gaps in bank resolution and enhance financial stability. Subsequently, aligning the
legislations of the various financial agencies to the new institutional framework should be done in a
coordinated fashion.

Finding new drivers of growth and diversifying away from commodities require better

Box 1. Indonesia: Macroeconomic Impact of Commodity Price Decline
After rising by 40 percent over a decade, the prices of Indonesia’s key traded commodities have dropped sharply
since 2011. Notwithstanding declining production and export values in recent years, the share of commodities sector
in Indonesia remains significant at just under 10 percent of GDP, and major commodities still comprise about half of
all merchandise exports.
Transmission channels. The global commodity price decline affects Indonesia—a small, open, net exporter of nonoil commodities—primarily through the income and investment channels.

 The price decline causes exporters’ revenues and profits to fall at existing production levels. Lower income in turn
dampens domestic demand and imports. The government budget constraint becomes tighter (on top of the direct
hit to oil and gas revenue through profit-sharing arrangements between the government and contractors),
undercutting ability to finance existing spending. Reduced corporate net worth increases the premium paid to
obtain financing, lowering credit demand and capital inflows.

 In addition, the price decline, increasingly viewed as permanent, weakens private incentives to invest in the
commodity sector and supporting industries such as construction, transportation, and logistics, with knock-on
effects to the rest of the economy, lowering incomes further.

 The two channels are mutually reinforcing. Over time, capital accumulation steadily slows, and pressure for labor
reallocation from the commodities and supporting sectors into other tradables is expected to increase.
1

Macroeconomic impacts. Estimates from cross-country regressions reveal that the decline in Indonesia’s
commodity terms of trade over the past three years (around 8 percent) may have led to about one percentage point
2
reduction in GDP growth. The average decline in fixed investment growth is about double that of consumption. A
separate estimate shows that the current account
balance has improved by around ½ percent of GDP
during 2014‒15, owing to import contraction. The fiscal
impact of lower oil prices was negative in 2015, as the
decline in oil and gas revenues (1.8 percentage points of
GDP) was not fully offset by lower spending for LPG and
electricity subsidies (0.5 percentage point of GDP).
Looking ahead, a further decrease in oil and gas prices
by 10 percent would raise the fiscal deficit by just under
0.1 percentage point of GDP in 2016.
On the supply side, the capital stock is estimated to have
declined by a cumulative 0.7 percentage point over the
past three years as a result of the terms of trade shock.
Impacts on labor supply and TFP are relatively muted
(and statistically insignificant), suggesting that potential output could be affected mainly via lower capital
accumulation.

Box 2. Indonesia: Banking System Soundness 1/
The banking system is well capitalized and profitable but asset quality and liquidity conditions need to be
monitored closely. Using end-2014 data for a wider cross-country comparison, the regulatory capital ratio of
18.7 percent and return on assets (ROA) of 2.7 percent were substantially above those of major emerging market
economies. However, profitability has started to moderate more recently. Moreover, the NPL ratio of 2.1 percent
and liquid assets relative to short-term liabilities of 33 percent were closer to the weaker end of the banking
sectors compared, creating pockets of vulnerabilities particularly with some small and medium sized banks. These
banks have relatively low capital and high NPL ratios partly as profitability tends to be low due to their high
funding costs. Another source of vulnerability is potential migration of special mention loans, which surged from
4.2 percent in end-2014 to 5.7 percent in August 2015, to NPLs especially if economic growth remains subdued.
Small and medium sized banks are also exposed to greater liquidity risk given their greater reliance on shortermaturity deposits.
Soundness varies across different type of banks. Asset quality is lower for regional development banks, with
their NPLs about twice those of other types of banks. Risks from asset quality for some private commercial banks
are mitigated by their higher capital ratios. State-owned banks are very profitable, with their ROA notably above
the industry average. Funding risk could become an issue for foreign/joint-venture banks as their Loan-to-Deposit
(LTD) ratios are significantly above the industry average and these banks rely more on wholesale funding
compared to their peers.
The banking system appears to be able to withstand relatively large shocks to NPLs at the aggregate level
but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Staff analysis suggests that NPLs in Indonesia are driven mainly by GDP
growth and the rupiah’s performance, which imply that the banking system could be vulnerable to further growth
slowdown and currency depreciation. For instance, in a simulation, if real GDP growth moderated from 4.7 percent
in t = –1 to 2 percent in t = 0, 1, 2, 3 and rupiah depreciation accelerated from 7.4 percent in t = –1 to 15 percent
in t = 0, 1, 2, 3 a stylized bank’s NPL ratio would rise by 1½ percentage points at the end of the simulation period.
2
Their strong capital buffers and profitability provide an important source of resilience for Indonesian banks.
However, pockets of vulnerabilities remain with smaller banks with relatively high NPLs. Looking ahead, the impact
of a measure introduced in July 2015 to facilitate NPL restructuring needs to be monitored closely.
Similarly, the aggregate banking sector appears to be in a strong position to withstand liquidity shocks,
but with pockets of vulnerabilities. Systemic liquidity risk appears limited as retail deposits represent a large
share of overall short-term liabilities (except for some small banks). Based on end-December 2014 data and
assumptions similar to those made in the last Staff Report (additional assumptions made on asset availability,
haircut, and encumbrance), the total liquidity gap of banks facing liquidity shortages was estimated at
Rp 14 trillion (0.34 percent of total funding), comparable to the result reported in the last Staff Report. Yet a
handful of foreign-owned/joint venture banks and small and medium sized banks are faced with a relatively small
amount of liquid assets and are vulnerable to larger than assumed shocks.

Box 3. Indonesia: Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities 1/
Indonesia’s corporate sector remains relatively strong compared to EM peers. Corporate leverage is low—the overall corporate debt
relative to GDP remains small at around 32 percent (compared with around 70 percent on average for peers) and the liability-to-asset
ratio is less than 50 percent as of June 2015, slightly lower than peers. Profitability remains relatively high, despite having weakened
recently with return on assets (ROA) falling from 19 percent in mid-2012 to is around 13½ percent as of September 2015.
Nonetheless, foreign currency-denominated (FX) debt of corporates has risen rapidly over the past few years. FX debt of
corporates (including FX debt to domestic banks) amounted to around US$ 160 billion or 20 percent of GDP as of June 2015, doubling
from 2010, mainly because of easy external borrowing conditions especially during the commodity booms. Moreover, shallow domestic
financial markets have led corporates to tap offshore debt markets. FX debt issuance has been concentrated in the commodity
(i.e., mining) and some non-tradable sectors (i.e., telecommunications, utilities). The major instruments have been debt securities,
particularly syndicated loans.
Some corporates, particularly those below investment grade, are exposed to growing risks, under pressure from a combination of
sluggish growth, rupiah depreciation, and rollover risk. Disorderly default of large systemically connected corporates may damage
confidence and create negative spillovers to the banking system. Close monitoring of the corporate sector, therefore, is essential,
particularly in regards to maturing debt securities and linkages to mid-sized banks. Risks to monitor include:



FX exposure. A portion of the FX debt remains unhedged, making them vulnerable to rupiah depreciation. BI’s FX hedging
regulations have generally helped corporates reduce currency risk. Although a portion of corporates were not completely hedged as
of mid-2015, the extent of hedging will likely improve with administrative measures in place starting from 2015:Q4. However, some
corporates appear to be only partially hedged—some hedging instruments have ceilings to reduce hedging costs.



Refinancing risk. Rollover risk is likely to grow in 2016 due to a rising level of maturing debt, weak investor appetite for EM assets,
and a weak rupiah. Notably, maturing FX debt securities (i.e., syndicated loans or bonds) are likely to peak this year, concentrated in
March. Still, a large proportion of short-term maturing debt comes from offshore affiliate corporates, which will help mitigate the
rollover risk.



Default risk. Groups of corporates are running into a heightened default risk. Corporates in the resource sector are under most
pressure, with the interest coverage ratio below 1.5 for a third of the sector, followed by those in the telecommunication industry.

To encourage corporates with external debt to enhance risk management, BI introduced a set of prudential measures in October 2014.1/
Moreover, staff analysis suggests that corporates may have become more susceptible to adverse shocks. After a period of subdued
economic activity and exchange rate depreciation, corporate balance sheet conditions are expected to provide smaller buffers against
negative macroeconomic shocks going forward. Indeed, simulation results suggest that corporates may have become more vulnerable to
adverse shocks compared to after the “taper tantrum.” The projected median default probabilities under the baseline scenario rise to
somewhat above those during the taper tantrum in 2013 despite projected macro fundamentals being broadly comparable to those
in 2013.
Under staff’s adverse scenario, corporate distress could reach high levels. The median default probability would rise to some 1/2 of
the maximum registered during the Lehman crisis. This reflects the assumptions of a sharp GDP growth slowdown and deterioration in
other macro variables. The 95th percentile estimate, with remote chance of occurrence, is very close to the maximum during the global
financial crisis. Moreover, inward spillovers of a negative external shock could be large in an environment of elevated uncertainty and
financial market volatility. Under such circumstances, a low-probability, high-impact outcome could become a real threat.

Box 4. Indonesia: Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) of the Economy1,2
The BSA matrix presents a snapshot of outstanding gross and net balance sheet positions (stocks) of different
sectors in the Indonesian economy, and can be used to study balance sheet exposures and vulnerabilities in
individual sectors, as well as cross-sectoral linkages. The BSA for Indonesia is based on outstanding amounts
(stocks) and uses the following statistics as source data: monetary and financial statistics (MFS) using standardized report
forms (SRFs) (covering the financial sector), international investment position (IIP) (covering the external sector), and
(3) government finance statistics (GFS) (covering the government sector). In addition, the from-whom-to-whom information
in the datasets is used to populate the matrix for nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) and the nonfinancial sectors
(households—HHs and nonfinancial corporations—NFCs).
Reflecting the openness of its economy, overall external funding in Indonesia accounts for the largest share of total
inter-sectoral net credit. This share is stable at about 33 percent of total allocated liabilities in the 2014 BSA,
corresponding to about 60 percent of GDP.
BSA analysis suggests two key vulnerabilities for Indonesia: NFCs and banks. Among Indonesia’s resident sectors, NFCs
rely heavily on funding from abroad (net external funding is close to 60 percent of GDP). Therefore, they are exposed to
foreign currency risk, as well as to funding risk. In turn, the banks in Indonesia are mostly exposed to NFCs. This large
exposure may be a source of vulnerability should the NFC balance sheet be adversely affected by the aforementioned
shocks. For instance, a shock to the balance sheet of NFCs may significantly increase the level of nonperforming loans
(NPLs).
Figure below compares the network map representation of the Indonesian BSA as of end-2007 and end-2014. It
shows gross inter-sectoral exposures and contains several dimensions. Arrows represent the flow of funds from creditor to
debtor, and their thickness indicates the size of the link relative to total allocated assets. Nodes size represents the size of
the net imbalance between funds borrowed and lent within a sector and nodes color represents whether a sector is a net
debtor (red) or creditor (green).

The main findings of the intertemporal comparison are: (i) net creditors in 2007 remained net creditors in 2014; (ii) gross
exposures (thickness of the arrows) and net exposures (size of the nodes) have overall become larger in the period; and
(iii) the largest exposure for both periods concerns the NFC sector borrowing from the ROW.

Box 5. Indonesia: External Stability Assessment1
Overall assessment. Indonesia’s external position in 2015 is assessed to be broadly consistent with mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policies. While much of the recent external rebalancing have been driven by
commodity price-led import compression, policy actions since mid-2013, including monetary policy tightening,
fuel subsidy reform, and exchange rate flexibility have helped improved the external position. Easing trade and
investment restrictions, deepening financial markets, and improving labor markets would help strengthen
overall competitiveness over the medium term. External financing appears sustainable, but susceptible to risks
(see below).
Foreign asset and liability position and trajectory. As of June 2015, the net international investment position
(NIIP) position stood at -48 percent of GDP, compared to -47 percent of GDP at end 2014. Strong net portfolio
inflows offset other net outflows in 2015:H1, resulting in a stable overall NIIP. At end-2015, gross external debt
is moderate at 36½ percent of GDP, with about 5 percent of GDP denominated in rupiah. The level and
composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable, but
nonresident holdings of rupiah debt could be affected by global volatility. With the exception of SOEs
borrowing, private external debt growth is expected to slow as global financial conditions tighten.
Current account. Drawing on various approaches including the IMF’s model-based External Balance
Assessment (EBA) regression exercise (after adjusting the results to account for Indonesia-specific factors), staff
assesses the cyclically-adjusted current account balance to be -0.7 percent to 1.3 percent of GDP away from the
level consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policies for 2015. Much of this gap
could be accounted for by low public social
spending in Indonesia and fiscal policy gaps in
other countries.
Real exchange rate. Despite an NEER
depreciation of around 2 percent compared to
the 2014 average, the REER has appreciated by
3 percent in 2015, a result of a temporary increase
in inflation related to the reduction in domestic
fuel price subsidies. EBA level and index REER
results suggest the REER gap to be about
-6 percent, in line with staff’s REER gap assessment
in the range of -6.5 percent to 3.5 percent in 2015,
consistent with the CA gap a and standard
elasticities.
Capital and financial accounts. Indonesia’s gross
external financing requirement is expected to be
about 9 percent of GDP in 2015, with amortization at about 7 percent of GDP. Net FDI and new borrowing are
projected at 1.4 percent and 7.8 percent of GDP, respectively. Net and gross financial inflows appear
sustainable, but could become weaker or reverse in the event of large domestic or external shocks. Continued
strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in check, and easing supply
bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term.
FX intervention and reserves level. Indonesia’s floating regime has had better facilitated adjustments in
exchange rates to market conditions since 2013. Reserves are assessed to be adequate as assessed against the
IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric, sufficient to absorb most shocks, with predetermined drains also
manageable. Intervention should aim primarily at smoothing volatility, while allowing the exchange rate to
adjust to external shocks.

Box 6. Indonesia: Infrastructure Reforms 1/
Indonesia’s infrastructure gap remains wide compared to its peers, particularly in transport and power.
Infrastructure investment has been subdued over the last decade at around 3–4 percent of GDP per year, very
low compared to major Asian EMs (e.g., 10 percent and 7.5 percent of GDP by China and India, respectively).2/
As a result, Indonesia scores lower than its peers on survey-based measures of infrastructure quality. Its
infrastructure gap is manifested in high logistics costs, estimated at around 24 percent of GDP (20 percent in
Thailand, 18 percent in China, and 13 percent in Malaysia). Also, electricity production per capita is
only 20‒60 percent of its peers, implying significant constraints on power generation. 3/
To close the infrastructure gap, the government has formulated ambitious plans for infrastructure
development. The government has set a target of around US$480 billion (about 50 percent of GDP) of
infrastructure investment during 2015–19.4/ The plans center on the transport and energy sectors, with the
largest category of projects comprising expansion of power generation capacity by 35GW, which would cost
9 percent of GDP. On funding sources, the public sector is expected to finance two-thirds of the total
investment (around 30 percent from the central government, 11 percent from local governments,
and 22 percent from SOEs). The rest is to be financed by the private sector, mainly through public-private
partnerships (PPPs).
The government has made a strong push to develop infrastructure since 2015. The government has taken
a series of measures, including accelerating budget execution, ramping up fiscal transfers to local
governments, injecting equity to SOEs, and upgrading the institutional and regulatory framework.



Central and local government. Capital spending by the central government increased to 1.9 percent of
GDP in 2015 (from 1.4 percent in 2014), reflecting efforts to accelerate the budget execution in the second
half of the year. The government has strengthened the budget monitoring system, such as creation of a
dedicated team for budget realization evaluation and monitoring (chaired by the Ministry of Finance and
reporting to the President every two weeks). Local governments are also set to play a greater role, aided
by a boost in fiscal transfers earmarked for investment (by ½ percent of GDP over 2014–16).



SOEs. To strengthen investment capacity and provide confidence, the government has undertaken the SOE
equity injection program, focused on electricity, construction, transportation SOEs, with 0.6 percent of GDP
executed in 2015 and 0.3 percent of GDP planned in 2016. The government has also limited the dividend
payments from SOEs as long as the retained earnings are channeled into infrastructure investment, while
allowing asset revaluation. On the back of the strengthened balance sheets, SOEs are set to step up
infrastructure investment. Capital expenditure of SOEs is projected to rise to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015
and 3.1 percent of GDP in 2016, compared to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2014.5/



Institutional and regulatory framework. The institutional and regulatory framework improved,
particularly in regard to prioritizing and monitoring infrastructure projects. KPPIP (The Committee for
Accelerated Infrastructure Delivery) was established as a coordinating body to focus on the delivery of
priority projects. KPPIP has identified 22 priority projects so far, with the amount totaling 8 percent of GDP.
A PPP Unit was also set up in 2014 in the Ministry of Finance, and acts as one-stop-shop for PPP
coordination and facilitation. Currently, eight PPP projects are in the pipeline, totaling around 2 percent of
GDP. The review process to assess PPP-related contingent liabilities has been strengthened. The
government has also revamped the regulatory framework, notably streamlining the investment licensing
process and encouraging foreign participation in PPPs (see Appendix IV structural reforms).

Recommended Policy Responses
Maintain exchange rate and marketdetermined bond yields. Further boost
investor confidence by preserving a sound
fiscal position, while allowing automatic
stabilizers to work in case of an extreme
economic slowdown and using contingent
financing if market access is restricted.
Monetary policy tightening would need to
be combined with targeted measures to
alleviate funding pressures faced by some
segments of the banking system and
preserve financial stability to avoid
reinforcing financial stresses brought on
by market volatility and capital outflows.
Similar policy response as above,
combined with heightened monitoring of
corporate sector vulnerabilities and firm
implementation of measures to encourage
hedging of corporate external debt.
Maintain vigilance on exchange rate passthrough to inflation.

High
Lower export volume and prices (particularly those
of commodities) could widen the current account
deficit, putting FX reserves and the exchange rate
under pressure. The fiscal balance would
deteriorate on weaker resource revenues and
knock-on effects to domestic demand, with the
financial sector exposed to losses from loans to
the commodity sector and a broader economic
slowdown. Corporate profits would decline from
weak commodity related activities. Corporate
balance sheets suffer from incomplete hedging of
external borrowing.

Maintain exchange rate flexibility to help
reduce the current account deficit and
limit FX reserve losses. More stringent
fiscal measures to contain the budget
deficit might be necessary if the slowdown
in EMs were accompanied by protracted
financial market volatility that restricts
funding. Accelerate infrastructure
spending and structural reforms to boost
productivity, employment in non-resource
sectors and export diversification.

Medium
Fiscal position would weaken further on lower oil
related revenues, with adverse spillovers to
growth if space for public investment is curbed.

Implement upfront revenue reforms to
raise non-oil revenues, and accelerate
structural reforms to boost private
investment and productivity.

Medium
The growth slowdown would further deter
investment, curb capital inflows, raise bank NPLs,
increase the country risk premium, and raise costs
for corporate external borrowing. The consequent
layoffs could further weaken domestic demand.

Assuming inflation is well anchored, ease
monetary policy. Accelerate infrastructure
spending and structural reforms to the
trade and investment regime to boost
productivity, employment in non-resource
sectors, and export diversification. Timely
and well-coordinated supervisory actions
to preserve banking system soundness
and close monitoring of at-risk corporate
borrowers.

Medium
Business and investor confidence could be
destabilized, with the failure raising NPLs,
increasing the country risk premium, and creating
knock-on effects in the banking system. A secondround impact could come through subsequent
layoffs and weaker domestic demand.

Monitor closely corporate borrowers with
high leverage and large FX exposures.
Undertake expeditious corporate debt
restructuring, with timely and wellcoordinated supervisory actions to
preserve banking system soundness.
Ensure the crisis management measures
are fully implemented and enforced, with
clear lines of communications among
regulators and with market.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects
staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly.

Technical
Background
Notes

Background. At end June 2015, Indonesia’s net international investment position (NIIP) position stood at -48 percent of GDP,
compared to -47 percent of GDP at end 2014. The components as a percent of GDP were reserves (+12), net FDI (-27), net equities and
portfolio debt (-22), and other investment (-11). Strong net portfolio inflows (mainly government debt) offset other net outflows in the
first half of 2015, resulting in a stable overall NIIP. At end June 2015, gross external liabilities stood at -74 percent of GDP (up from
72 percent of GDP at end 2013). Indonesia’s gross external debt is moderate at 36½ percent of GDP, with about 5 percent of GDP
denominated in rupiah as of June 2015.
Assessment. The level and composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable,
but non-resident holdings of rupiah debt could be affected by global volatility. Public external debt may increase above the current
baseline if the government increases reliance on external financing (including multilateral loans) to help fund infrastructure projects.
With the exception of borrowing by SOEs, which may also be used for infrastructure development, the growth in private external debt
is expected to slow owing mainly to a tightening in global financial conditions.
Background. Despite a decline in commodity exports, Indonesia’s CA deficit is estimated to improve to about 2 percent of GDP
in 2015 from 3.1 percent in 2014 mainly from import compression due to cyclical weakness in the domestic economy and sharply lower
oil prices. In the near term, lower commodity prices and weak trading partner demand for commodity exports are expected to offset
the benefits of lower oil prices and exchange rate depreciation. Over the medium term, a moderate increase in the CA deficit is
expected from lower energy and mining exports, as well as a rise in capital goods and raw material imports tied to infrastructure
investment and a pickup in domestic demand. Relatively low projected world oil prices should also help limit overall import increases.
Adjustment would be supported over time by continued exchange rate flexibility and a prudent monetary and fiscal stance, in keeping
with a moderate increase in domestic saving. In 2015, the oil and gas trade balance is expected to be about -1 percent of GDP and the
non-oil and gas trade balance is expected to be about 2.5 percent of GDP.
Assessment. The EBA CA results suggest a gap of 0.3 percent of GDP for 2015 (based on an estimated cyclically-adjusted CA balance
of -1.2 percent of GDP and a norm of -1.5 percent of GDP), smaller than -1.9 percent for 2014. Since much of the recent improvement
in the current account was cyclical (particularly from substantially lower oil prices which reduced oil imports by almost 2 percent of
GDP), staff believes the underlying cyclically-adjusted current account balance is around -1.5 percent of GDP for 2015.1/ In the same
vein, the EBA cyclically-adjusted CA norm estimate may not capture the effect of declines in commodity prices fully, and staff adjusted
the mid-point of the norm to -1.8 percent. Taking uncertainties and Indonesia’s investment needs into account, staff believes a norm of
-0.8 to -2.8 percent of GDP is appropriate. 2/ This suggests that the CA gap range of about -0.7 to 1.3 percent of GDP for 2015, which
reflects the domestic policy gaps including in social spending and external policy gaps (particularly fiscal deficits) in partner countries.
Background. Compared to the 2014 average, the REER has appreciated by 3 percent in 2015, a result of a temporary increase in
inflation related to the reduction in domestic fuel price subsidies.
Assessment. EBA level and index REER results suggest the REER gap to be about -6 percent, in line with the REER gap assessed by staff
in the range of -6.5 percent to 3.5 percent in 2015, the latter being consistent with the CA gap and standard elasticities.
Background. Indonesia’s gross external financing requirement is expected to be about 9 percent of GDP in 2015, with amortization at
about 7 percent of GDP. Net FDI and new borrowing are projected at 1.4 percent and 7.8 percent of GDP, respectively.
Assessment. Net and gross financial flows appear sustainable, but could dissipate or reverse in the event of large domestic or external
shocks. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in check, and easing supply
bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term.
Background. Since mid-2013, Indonesia has had a more flexible exchange rate policy framework. Its floating regime has better
facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions. As of end-2015, reserves were US$105.9 billion (equal to 119 percent of
IMF’s reserve adequacy metric—assuming a floating exchange rate—and about 7¼ months of prospective imports of goods and
services). In addition, the authorities have in place contingencies and swap lines amounting to about US$70 billion.
Assessment. Volatile capital flows could cause reserves to decline significantly. While the composite metric may not adequately
account for commodity price volatility, the current level of reserves should be sufficient to absorb most shocks, with predetermined
drains also manageable. Intervention should aim primarily at smoothing volatility, while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to
external shocks.
1/ The commodity shares used by the EBA in commodity terms of trade gap estimate for Indonesia has not fully reflected the rising
share of oil in commodity imports. Therefore, a recent sharp oil price decline means the commodity terms of trade may be less than
the EBA implies due to positive changes to the oil terms of trade, indicating a slightly larger improvement (about 0.3 percent of GDP) in
the current account than warranted from a cyclical perspective in 2015.
2/ Making the same commodity terms of trade adjustment of 0.3 percent of GDP, staff estimates the cyclically adjusted CA norm at
-1.8 percent of GDP, to which a range of +/- 1 percent is added to reflect uncertainty.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
In 2015, Indonesia’s external position
in 2015 was assessed to be broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policies. Policy actions since
mid 2013 (monetary policy tightening, fuel
subsidy reform, exchange rate and bond
yield flexibility) have helped improve the
external position. External financing appears
sustainable, but could be affected by
domestic or external shocks.



Potential Policy Responses:
Monetary policy should continue to focus
on containing inflation within Bank
Indonesia’s target band. Fiscal policy can
help support external adjustment and
contain vulnerability to funding pressures
by aiming for a small primary deficit over
the medium term, led by reforms aimed at
increasing the tax take, while providing
space for health spending and increased
infrastructure spending to help ease supply
bottlenecks. Continued flexibility of the
exchange rate and use of marketdetermined interest rates would also help
facilitate adjustment and absorb shocks.
Easing trade and investment restrictions,
deepening financial markets, and improving
labor markets would also help promote
growth and strengthen competitiveness
over the medium term.

Appendix III. Indonesia—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Indonesia’s external debt remains at a moderate level and is projected to be sustainable over the
medium-term. Growth in private external debt is expected to slow as global financial conditions
tighten and borrowing costs rise. Public debt remains low, but contingent liabilities arising from
borrowing by state corporations pose some fiscal risk.
External Debt Sustainability
1.
Indonesia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has steadily increased in recent years, but total
external debt remains at a moderate level. The main reasons for the increase have been a rise in
general government borrowing, through internationally issued bonds and holdings of nonresidents
of domestic bonds, and private external borrowing, mainly through loans and debt securities,
including by state-owned enterprises. As a share of GDP, external debt was 33 at end-2014, up from
a low of around 25 percent at end 2011, and is estimated to have reached 36½ percent at end-2015
(Figure 1 and Table 1).
2.
Looking ahead, external debt is projected to stabilize in the medium term. Under the
baseline, debt would stabilize at 36½ percent of GDP at end-2016 before declining to 33¾ percent
by end-2020 in line with favorable real GDP growth and slower nonbank private sector debt buildup
due to less favorable global financial conditions. Public external debt may increase above the current
baseline if the government increases reliance on external financing (including multilateral loans) to
help fund infrastructure projects. With the exception of borrowing by SOEs, which may also be used
for infrastructure development, the growth in private external debt is expected to slow owing mainly
to an expected tightening in global financial conditions. Real growth is projected to average about
5½ percent over the medium term and 6 percent in the longer run.
3.
As in the last Article IV, external sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP
shocks, but is more sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A further
deterioration in the current account balance from the current level would cause the external debt
ratio to rise moderately (a one standard deviation shock would raise the external debt to GDP ratio
to 39 percent by 2020). Exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact—a 30 percent
depreciation would raise the external debt to GDP ratio to about 51½ percent in 2016 followed by a
small decline to 48 percent of GDP by 2020.
Public Debt Sustainability
4.
Public sector debt remains low in Indonesia. General government debt as a percent of
GDP declined steadily from 87 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2014, owing to a prudent fiscal
stance, which has been anchored by the fiscal rule since in 2003 that caps the general government
deficit at 3 percent of GDP a year. The debt dynamics have been also favorable, with strong GDP
growth and moderate real interest rates. In 2015, the debt to GDP ratio is estimated to increase to
27.5 percent of GDP (from 24.7 percent of GDP in 2014), reflecting larger primary deficit than in the
past, SOE recapitalization (around 0.6 percent of GDP), and exchange rate depreciation. At the same

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

INDONESIA

time, foreign currency denominated debt has fallen to less than half of total public sector debt, as
issuance in the domestic rupiah bond market has grown rapidly and attracted strong foreign
interests. Notwithstanding, dependence on foreign investors remains sizable, with nonresidents
holding about 60 percent of general government debt. Moreover, the share of foreign ownership of
rupiah-denominated government bonds rose from about 20 percent in 2009 to 38.2 percent as of
end 2015.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt is expected to increase gradually over
the medium term (Figure 3). The baseline envisages general government deficit to remain constant
at 2.8 percent of GDP over the medium term, resulting in primary deficit of around 1 percent of GDP
through 2020. Favorable debt dynamics, with a negative interest rate-growth differential (at about
4 percent), would limit the increase in the debt to GDP ratio, which is expected to reach 31 percent
by 2020. Gross financing needs are also expected to remain at 5 percent of GDP over the medium
term.
6.
Public debt dynamics are robust to macroeconomic shocks (Figure 4). Standard stress
tests suggest that the debt ratio would remain at a low level over the medium term (higher than the
baseline by only about 1 percentage point of GDP in 2020) under shocks from lower revenues, sharp
exchange rate movements, lower economic growth, and higher interest rates. Nevertheless, fiscal
risks, in particular those arising from expanding balance sheets of key state corporations, will need
to be managed carefully. Pertamina and PLN—the two largest SOEs in Indonesia—already had
combined total liabilities equivalent to 9.4 percent of GDP at end-2013. Also, lower world oil prices
will affect Pertamina’s revenue from upstream activities.

Appendix IV. Indonesia—Structural Reforms1
The government implemented a set of reforms in 2015 to address supply-side bottlenecks
and revamp the investment environment. A number of regulations have been eased and clarified,
including those in regard to PPPs and land procurement. The main reform measures include:
Land Acquisition Procedures


A revised land acquisition law came into effect in 2015. Mandatory time limits (i.e., a
maximum of two years) were placed on the acquisition of land for public projects. The law
clarified, inter alia, that ongoing projects would be subject to this new law,2 which can force
relevant parties to sell their property for public infrastructure projects with fair compensation.



Other deregulation includes: (i) the private sector is also allowed to procure land for PPP
projects on behalf of the government3; (ii) if a SOE becomes a government-contracted agency,
funding for land procurement can be sourced from the SOE’s budget or a relevant cooperating
developer; (iii) the document requirements for permit have been simplified; and (iv) processing
time for permit issuance has been reduced.

Public-Private Partnership (PPP)


Institutional framework and role of SOEs strengthened. (i) A PPP unit (Directorate of
Government Support and Infrastructure Financing Management) was created in 2014 at the
Ministry of Finance, in charge of feasibility studies and transaction of PPP projects; (ii) equity
injection was made to selected major infrastructure SOEs and PT SMI (state-owned infrastructure
financing facility) amounting to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015. PT SMI is envisaged to become an
infrastructure bank; (iii) incentives were also provided to the SOEs to revalue their assets to
current market prices; and (iv) a direct lending scheme of international financial institutions
(IFIs) is allowed, under a sovereign guarantee.



Types of PPPs expanded: (i) in addition to economic infrastructure, a PPP modality can now be
used for social infrastructure projects, including facilities for education, sports, art, tourism, and
health, public housing, as well as for commercial facilities; and (ii) in addition to user-pay PPPs,

Electricity Grid Strengthening—Sumatra Program, 2015).
2

Previously, infrastructure projects that had acquired three-quarters of the required land were subject to the old
1960 law, and those whose land-acquisition process was less than 75 percent complete had to start again if entities
want to acquire land under the new law.
3

Direct land procurement by a private entity has been allowed: (i) a private entity can obtain an authority/proxy in
3
land procurement from a relevant government institution or SOE and act as a proxy; and (ii) with the authority/proxy
mandate, a private entity can carry out compensation payment as well as all the preceding stages (i.e., preparation,
consultations, valuation, and negotiation).

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

availability-based PPPs (i.e., when the source of payment is the government) and hybrid PPPs (a
mix of the user-pay and availability-based PPPs) are allowed.


Other deregulation: (i) in addition to a tender mechanism, a direct appointment of
concessionaire is allowed under certain conditions;4 and (ii) bundling of projects is allowed to
accommodate projects that extend beyond the boundary of one agency or local government;
and (iii) in addition to acting as a concessionaire, a SOE can act as a government contracted
agency; and (vi) private sector and IFIs are allowed to support the preparation of PPP projects.

Budget execution and support strengthened. (i) advance procurement for new projects was
initiated, so that projects planned for the 2016 budget year could already be put out for bid
for 2015; (ii) a Budget Realization Evaluation and Monitoring Committee was set up to identify and
take action to remove bottlenecks facing priority infrastructure projects; and (iii) viability gap
funding (VGF) has been budgeted to ensure commercial viability of projects that are important but
are not commercially viable.
Restrictions on foreign ownership were eased. Restrictions on foreign ownership were eased in
some of the transport and energy sectors. In the transport sector, the foreign ownership limit for a
seaport facility increased to 50 percent from 49 percent. The 100 percent of foreign ownership for a
power plan (greater than 10 MWV) has been allowed, compared with previous 95 percent.
Investment procedures and permitting time were curtailed. (i) the investment process has been
streamlined through a one-stop service at the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM);
(ii) construction permit regulations have been streamlined; (iii) processing time of investment
permits has been cut (i.e., the mining and geothermal sectors, and mineral and coal mining license
extension); (iv) obtaining land certificate has been made easier through deregulating notary’s
profession; and (v) regulations on SMEs’ business activities on unused land were clarified.
Trade facilitation. (i) import procedures have been reduced for selected products (including sugar,
rice for industry, horticulture products, textile products, steel, etc.) as well as raw materials for
medical products; (ii) trade requirements have been eased with regard to the registered importer
(IT), the national standard verification certificate for imported products (SPB-SNI), the labeling of
Bahasa Indonesia language, and identification numbers for an importer; (iii) export license
requirements have been eased for timber, rice, nonpharmaceutical precursors, palm oil, and
minerals; and (iv) administrative procedures have been eased for Special Economic Zone (SEZ),
through reducing the processing period for investment permits from 8 days to 3 hours5, as well as
4

A direct appointment of concessionaire is allowed, if (i) the project is an infrastructure development project which
was developed or operated by the same developer; (ii) the project utilizes a new technology and only one developer
can provide that technology; (iii) the developer has acquired all or a majority part of the land required for the project,
and (vi) if only one investor is eligible after the pre-qualification process.

tax incentives (e.g., exemption from VAT on immediate goods; and postponement of import duty
payments).
Labor market. To increase predictability, a minimum wage formula for provinces was established,
and some of rigid labor market regulations have been removed, including the need to hire ten local
employees for every foreign employee; need to obtain work permit for non-resident commissioners
or directors and for foreign workers attending meetings or provide training. Nonetheless, the
sectoral minimum wage setting is allowed.6
Minimum Wage t+1 = Minimum Waget × (1+National Inflation Ratet + National GDP Growth
Ratet)
Energy Sector


Sector governance improved. The government has reduced the fiscal burden of energy
subsidies by eliminating electricity subsidies for all but the poorest categories of consumers. The
measures include: (i) the subsidy was phased out for industrial, business and large residential
consumers; (ii) automatic indexation of tariff was adopted to ensure a full cost recovery for
industrial/business and large residential consumers; and (iii) reforms were initiated to improve
the performance of SOEs in the energy sector.7



Markets for private participation enabled: (i) licensing for 10 electricity projects was
delegated to BKPM; (ii) the licensing steps and time were reduced for setting up independent
power producer (IPP) projects; (iii) greater private participation was enabled in the electricity
sector by permitting electricity wheeling and power trade activities; and (iv) the government
signaled its intent to enhance the domestic supply of gas by creating a market place.8



Regulatory environment was improved to increase access to clean energy and energy
efficiency: (i) key constraints were addressed that persist in the geothermal sector;9 (ii) tariff
incentives were provided to develop new forms of renewable energy;10 and (iii) a market for key
energy efficiency services was established.

6

The government can allow a minimum wage setting outside the formula for certain sectors.

7

PLN is required to improve metrics relating to its electricity distribution performance; and regularly report
performance on these standards.
8

A systemic and time-bound process was stipulated for managing expiring production sharing contracts (PSCs); and
market rules were established for utilization of compressed natural gas (CNG) for land transport.
9

New Geothermal Law was issued, which streamlines licensing and tendering of geothermal projects; and a new
geothermal pricing regime was established using bidding under a regional ceiling price, by which PLN shall purchase
the power from those plants and build the transmission required for geothermal power plants
10

A feed-in tariff for biomass and biogas projects ≦10 MW and requires PLN to purchase this power; and a feed-in
tariff for hydro projects ≦10 MW and requires PLN to purchase this power.

target band by end 2015 and provided a bulwark against external
pressures on the rupiah. With economic growth slowing in 2015,
accompanied by a narrowing of the current account deficit, BI reduced
the primary reserve requirement in rupiah by 50 bps effective in
December 2015 to ease liquidity conditions. Policy communications have

Fiscal Policy

 Keep the overall deficit around 2 percent of GDP

The fiscal deficit in 2015 was 2.8 percent of GDP, higher than the revised
budget target (1.9 percent of GDP) and that recommended by staff. This
was mainly attributable to underperformance relative to budget of nonoil and gas tax revenues, driven by lower commodity prices and import
related taxes. Funding remained manageable through frontloading of
bond issuances and greater use of multilateral loans.

 Anchor credibility of the revised budget by upfront

No significant new revenue measures were introduced in 2015, with the
focus instead on tax administration to raise compliance, increase
registered taxpayers and improve IT systems. Capital budget absorption
improved strongly in H2:2015 after transitional delays related to the new
administration.

 Continue phasing out energy subsidies to raise

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
The working relationship between the IMF and the World Bank in Indonesia is very strong, with joint
working programs in a number of areas and close coordination through frequent meetings between
resident offices and with headquarters missions, including the Article IV consultation.
Key Areas with Joint Programs
Budget Reforms


The reform agenda for budget and treasury remains a high priority for both institutions.
Currently, the World Bank’s support is being provided through the Government Financial
Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) program, trust funds, and
development policy loans (DPLs), with elements in support of (a) efficient treasury operations,
including accounting reforms, improved in˗year budget disbursement, and regulatory reform;
(b) improved linkages between planning and budget preparation through the implementation of
a medium-term expenditure framework, performance budgeting, and the enhancement of
budget flexibility at the service delivery level; and (c) improved capacity for budget oversight
through systems and organizational reform. Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance launched SPAN in
April 2015. SPAN, a financial management information system supported by GFMRAP, is
designed to improve transparency, efficiency, and accountability of the government’s financial
transactions. An ongoing Development Policy Loan (DPL) on fiscal reforms also support reforms
to enhance the allocative efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. The IMF has
complemented this work through recent technical assistance (TA) on subsidy reform and social
safety nets aimed at ensuring longer-run fiscal sustainability.

Taxation Issues


Revenue (tax and nontax revenue) issues are a priority for the IMF and the World Bank, with
broadening the revenue base and increasing revenues an important issue for both macro-fiscal
stability and the investment climate. The Fund conducted a mission on tax policy and
administration in September 2014 to identify key reform options in each of these areas. The
Bank provides support through TA to DG Tax through a multi-donor trust fund and preparation
of an ongoing development policy loan (DPL) on fiscal reforms in support of tax policy and
administration reforms. The Bank has also been providing analytical support on nontax revenue
administration.

Asset-Liability Management


The World Bank and IMF have been leading an effort to improve asset-liability management,
including at the Treasury and Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance and at Bank
Indonesia, with continued collaboration envisaged, as needed.

Crisis Preparedness


4

In recent years, the World Bank has focused on supporting the authorities in Indonesia to create
a robust crisis prevention and management framework. Most recently, this support has included
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

analysis of the financial sector stability framework through the 2010 FSAP and a series of crisis
simulation exercises. Between 2012 and 2015, the Bank’s Program for Economic Resilience,
Investment and Social Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI) DPL has also supported the authorities
in this area. The IMF has supported work in this area through past TA on reviewing the legal
framework underpinning Indonesia’s financial stability architecture and in its current surveillance
dialogue with the authorities and exchange of views with the Bank.
Financial Sector


The World Bank has focused on broad monitoring of the financial sector. Most recently, through
its Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization DPL, the Bank is
supporting the implementation of reforms aimed at maintaining stability, increasing
diversification, and enhancing financial sector inclusion in Indonesia. The IMF has concentrated
on the banking system, with emphasis on regulation and supervision, with a resident advisor
placed at the Financial Services Agency (OJK) in January 2015. It has also embarked on TA in
financial deepening, focused initially on money and foreign exchange market development and
more recently on monetary operations and the transmission mechanism. In addition, the Fund
has provided recent TA on the macro prudential policy framework and bank stress testing. A
joint World Bank-IMF FSAP was completed in 2010 and some recommendations have been
followed through by the authorities. The Bank is to provide TA to implement select FSAP
recommendations concerning the nonbank financial sector.

Statistics


The World Bank has a major program of capacity building with the statistics agency that was
launched in 2011. The Statistical Capacity Building-Change and Reform for the Development of
Statistics (STATCAP-CERDAS) program is designed to focus on improvements in key statistical
series that should improve the ability to understand the Indonesian economy, executed through
an institution-wide approach, which includes significant business, IT and HR/organizational
reforms. The IMF has focused recent training and TA on government finance statistics, monetary
and financial statistics, and sectoral balance sheets.

Macroeconomics


The IMF continues to take the lead in macroeconomic areas, with the Article IV mission and staff
visits, focusing on fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies; macrofinancial linkages, financial
sector reforms, and crisis management, as well as the external position and spillover effects. The
Fund also updates the Debt Sustainability Analysis at the time of the Article IV consultation, with
inputs from the World Bank and other development partners. The Bank has also taken on a
larger role, including on macroeconomic monitoring, public policy dialogue, and capacity
building, with ongoing coordination with the Fund. The Bank team continues to assist the
Ministry of Finance‘s Fiscal Policy Office to improve capacity for macroeconomic monitoring,
forecasting, and evidence-based macroeconomic and fiscal policy analysis.

These threads of work are expected to be continued by both institutions, with periodic meetings
aimed at keeping each other informed about ongoing work and joint areas of interest. Issues being
addressed by the IMF include domestic and external vulnerabilities, exchange rate management,

medium-term external and fiscal sustainability, and macro/financial linkages and financial stability
risks; and by the Bank the link between macro/fiscal policy and real economic outcomes, including
growth and poverty, resource-sector fiscal revenues, and longstanding problems in the
implementation and effectiveness of government spending.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 2015)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans to Indonesia have totaled US$31.5 billion since 1969.1 The
ADB approved a total of US$1.4 billion in loans to Indonesia in 2015. The sectors with the largest
shares in cumulative lending are public sector management (18.9 percent), energy (14.4 percent),
agriculture and natural resources (14.1 percent), and finance (13.4 percent).2
Between 1969 and 2015, the ADB provided Technical Assistance (TA) grants to Indonesia amounting
to US$437 million. The TA grants were financed from the ADB’s TA Special Fund, the Japan Special
Fund and other sources.
The ADB is preparing a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2016−2019, aligned with the
government’s medium-term development plan for 2015−2019. The CPS will be closely attuned to
the needs of Indonesia as a large middle-income country and guided by the government’s
commitment on development. The CPS will also maintain consistency with the priorities set out in
ADB’s Mid-Term Review of Strategy 2020.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance.
National accounts: Statistics Indonesia (BPS) disseminates annual and quarterly GDP (QGDP) by economic activity and expenditure
components at current prices and in volume terms at 2010 prices regularly. In general, GDP estimates are based on the latest
international methodologies following the System of National Accounts 2008. The QGDP estimates are based on a limited set of
indirect indicators. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, with seasonally adjusted data prepared but not published.
BPS has been leading the work on developing sectoral accounts and balance sheets jointly with Bank Indonesia (BI) with technical
assistance (TA) from STA. BPS and BI expect to finalize the annual nonfinancial accounts, financial flows, and stocks for the
year 2010 during 2016, and quarterly financial flows and stocks starting from Q1:2015 in 2017.

Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. In October 2013, BPS released the new Producer Price Index
(PPI) covering agriculture, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing with 2010 as the base period, and has published the PPI index
quarterly. BPS has also expanded the mining sample to include oil and natural gas extraction, coal, and gold, and starting or
completing work to further expand PPI coverage to include 15 service industries. Bank Indonesia has begun work to expand
coverage of the residential property price index to include resales (the current RPPI includes only the sales of newly constructed
units). It is planned that the new index will be released later in 2016.
Government finance statistics: Available government finance data for surveillance suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms
of classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month lag, but
subnational (provincial and local) government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of these data varies
widely. Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by recent decentralization initiatives, which have
shifted substantial resources to the subnational governments. Significant efforts are being made to overcome these problems,
ranging from the planned adoption of advanced accounting and statistical standards to the introduction of best-practice budget
management processes and the development of computerized financial management information systems.
Against this background, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront
of ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The coverage and timeliness of
public debt statistics is generally adequate.
The authorities are continuing their efforts to adopt the GFSM 2001 standards, with assistance from STA as part of a regional GFS
project. Recently, progress significant has been made in these areas and, in 2014, Indonesia reported for the first time to STA
general government data covering the period 2008 onwards. These data also include balance sheet data. In late 2015, with the
assistance of STA TA, the authorities have started to compile quarterly general government data based on estimates of local
government data (a practice that is followed in all countries with large numbers of local governments). However, these data are yet
to be published on the MOF’s website.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics are
compiled by BI on a timely basis. BI compiles and reports monetary data using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from
which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the
IMF. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification. With the
support of an STA mission in October 2014, BI expanded the coverage of the OFCs survey, which since January 2015 includes
finance companies, insurance companies, pension funds, the state owned pawn shop (PT Pegadaian), and the Indonesian export
financing institution (Eximbank); achieving almost full coverage of the subsector. OFC data are reported on a monthly basis. The
mission also assisted BI in advancing the production of flow-based monetary statistics and quarterly financial accounts. BI
compiles and reports to STA 11 core and 12 encouraged financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers, two
encouraged FSIs for OFCs, and three encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector, which are published on the Fund’s FSI website.
Starting with Q4:2011 data, BI began reporting these FSIs on a quarterly basis. STA recommended that BI coordinate with other
relevant institutions to explore the possibility of compiling FSIs for nonfinancial corporations and households.
Balance of payments (BOP): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Import and export transactions of free trade
zones and bonded warehouses are captured in goods data of BOP statistics.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial improvement.
Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to
estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have improved the coverage of the directory of enterprises
in recent years. Other areas that need improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio
investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item in the BOP has been large at
times and appears to be related to the under coverage of assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are
reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP), except data on direct investment.
Annual and quarterly IIP data are compiled and published, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI.
External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002
and the recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI,
the IIP and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of
private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the
accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by the
private sector from external creditors.

Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the
SDDS requirements. Indonesia uses the SDDS flexibility
options for the timeliness of the labor market categories
(employment, unemployment, and wages/earnings) and
general government operations. It is also availing itself of
flexibility options for the periodicity of labor market
categories (employment and unemployment).

Statement by IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
February 24, 2016
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.

Recent Developments



Real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 expanded by 5.0 percent (y/y), led by
domestic demand, with higher public-sector investment and public consumption, while
private consumption continued its steady growth. For 2015 as a whole, real GDP growth
is estimated at 4.8 percent (4.7 percent in the staff report).



Headline inflation rose to 4.1 percent (y/y) in January 2016 on higher food prices, while
core inflation continued to slow to 3.6 percent (y/y).



Based on latest preliminary data, the central government deficit in 2015 was about
2½ percent of GDP as revenues were somewhat higher and expenditures somewhat
lower than the estimates in the staff report (2.8 percent).



The current account deficit for 2015 is estimated at 2.1 percent of GDP (2.0 percent in
the staff report). In January 2016, a small trade surplus was recorded, mainly driven by
lower oil and gas imports, while reserves fell to US$102.1 billion due to government
external debt repayments.

2.
The government has taken actions to liberalize the foreign direct investment (FDI)
regime. The changes introduced on February 11 to the negative investment list of FDI include:
caps on foreign ownership on 35 industries were removed (e.g., toll roads, tourism-related
services, e-commerce, etc); majority foreign ownership for selected sectors are now allowed
(e.g., warehousing, telecommunication networks and services, healthcare facilities, etc); and
20 sectors that were closed were partially opened (e.g., land transport, etc). On the other hand,
the authorities restricted FDI in 19 sectors to protect small- and medium sized enterprises
(e.g., small value construction, coral reef harvesting, plantations up to 25 hectares, etc). Overall,
this constitutes further progress in the authorities’ reform agenda.
3.
On February 18, Bank Indonesia reduced the policy interest rate by 25 basis points
(bps), to 7 percent, and reduced reserve requirement by 100 bps, to 6.5 percent. Inflation
remains within the target band (3‒5 percent) and financial markets continue to be calm. Since
end-2015 (as of February 18), the rupiah has appreciated by 2.1 percent with respect to the
U.S. dollar, equity prices have risen by 4 percent, and the yield on 10-year government bonds has
fallen by 69 bps.

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for Indonesia
and Diah Handayani, Advisor to Executive Director
February 24, 2016
On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we would like to express our appreciation to the IMF
mission team for the constructive policy dialogue and candid discussions during the 2015
Article IV consultation. The discussions focused on policies to boost potential growth in the
medium-term, fiscal strategies to achieve reform objectives and other policy measures to
navigate the economy in a volatile environment. The Indonesian authorities broadly agree with
the general thrust of the staff’s assessment of Indonesia’s macroeconomic performance in 2015.
They however expect a stronger pickup in growth in 2016. We are encouraged by staff’s
recognition that the authorities’ continued fiscal prudence, sound monetary management,
and bold subsidy reforms have contributed to maintaining macroeconomic and financial
system stability and sustaining growth.
The Indonesian economy and financial system have weathered the difficult external
environment in 2015 remarkably well. The authorities’ strategy has properly placed a greater
importance on stability over growth as a response, in particular, to the taper tantrum episode. The
resilience of the economy owed much to the strengthened policy framework which the
authorities have called “Bauran Kebijakan” or the “policy mix strategy”.
The policy mix strategy continues to be instrumental in promoting macroeconomic
stability. Bank Indonesia uses the policy rate to achieve the inflation target, maintain the
exchange rate in line with economic fundamentals, and calibrates macro prudential policy to
foster macroeconomic development. On top of that, the Government and Bank Indonesia
intensified coordination to ensure that structural reforms are in place. The Government focuses
on fiscal reforms to increase the quality of spending and ensures sufficient stimulus while
adhering to fiscal prudence. Bank Indonesia ensures the continuance of financial deepening in
order to strengthen the resilience of the financial markets. Last but not the least, the Government
and Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen communication to ensure that all policies
mutually reinforce each other to yield macroeconomic stability.
Moving forward, the authorities will focus on nurturing stronger and sustainable growth
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. In this regard, the authorities are committed to
further structural reform agenda to enhance productivity and potential output. A series of policy
packages have been launched to improve the business climate, reduce the cost of doing business
and maintain purchasing power. Prudent macroeconomic policy will continue to be implemented
by improving fiscal space and carefully calibrating monetary policy to ensure macroeconomic
stability. In addition, significant progress on financial sector safety net regulation is expected to
better equip the country to manage volatility.

2
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Indonesia’s macroeconomic performance in 2015 has been satisfactory despite weak global
demand. The 2015 fourth quarter GDP growth of 5.04 percent (yoy) reflect the continued
recovery momentum that has built up since the third quarter of 2015. The recovery is mostly
driven by the pick-up in investment, in line with the ongoing implementation of infrastructure
projects. Private consumption remains strong with domestic demand compensating for the
slowdown in the external sector. Inflation is well contained at 3.35 percent (yoy), which is within
the government’s inflation target of 4±1 percent for the year. Well-managed inflation
expectations, lower exchange rate pass-through and a small negative output gap, have all
contributed to lowering core inflation. The government budget deficit in 2015 was 2.53 percent
of GDP. Meanwhile, public debt remains low and manageable at 27 percent of GDP by end2015. The balance of payments position improved significantly with the current account deficit
falling to 2.04 percent of GDP from 3.10 percent of GDP in 2014. Furthermore, international
reserves continued to be sufficient at US$105.9 billion as of end- 2015, which is equivalent to
7.45 months of imports and official debt repayments.
Going forward, Indonesia’s economic outlook remains solid. The authorities are confident
that growth will pick up to the 5.2-5.6 percent range in 2016, supported by strong consumption
and investment, better business climate as well as realization of government infrastructure
projects. The 2016 fiscal deficit is expected to be well below the statutory ceiling of 3 percent of
GDP as stipulated in the budget law. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s balance of payments is expected to
remain strong with a larger overall surplus. The current account deficit will be slightly wider
than 2015 due to increased economic activity, but remains at a sustainable level. Inflation
in 2016 is expected to stay within the 4±1 percent target, aided by anchored inflation
expectations and lower fuel prices.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
The well-directed fiscal strategy centers on creating fiscal space in a prudent manner. The
Government has embarked on a medium-term fiscal framework that consists of short term and
long-term strategies. The short term strategy is designed to help Indonesia safely navigate the
economy amid global uncertainties. This would be undertaken by providing fiscal stimulus in
order to maintain people’s purchasing power and improve the business climate. The long-term
strategy aims to create sustainable and equitable economic growth through budget reform, in the
areas of revenue, spending and financing. Further, the fiscal deficit will also be maintained
within the statutory limit of 3 percent of GDP.
On the expenditure side, staff acknowledges that the authorities’ have implemented bold
reforms to rationalize and substantially reduce energy subsidies to cut spending. Further
reforms to shift from general price-based subsidies to well-targeted subsidies are expected to
continue in the 2016 budget. The targeted subsidy is expected to focus on enhancing support for
farmers and fisher folk, as well as conditional cash transfers for the poor. This would, therefore,

3
promote inclusive growth. In addition, authorities will utilize the fiscal space to allow for larger
capital spending in economic and social infrastructure. The government has also initiated 22
priority infrastructure projects, mostly in the power and transportation sectors, as well as projects
in education and healthcare. Furthermore, the authorities also underscored the importance of
fiscal stimulus to stimulate demand and boost economic growth. Recognizing that late fiscal
absorption in 2015 had affected growth, the government issued the global bond with front loaded
strategy to accelerate capital expenditure in 2016. Progress has been made as some of the
projects have already been auctioned in the first two months of 2016.
On revenue mobilization, the authorities agree with staff’s view that revenue mobilization
remains a critical factor in opening up fiscal space. Indeed, with falling commodity prices
resulting in lower oil and gas revenues, the authorities see the need to reduce the reliance on
natural resource revenue and shift the burden to tax or non-oil revenue. The authorities believe
that the main challenge of this strategy relates to problems in tax administration and compliance,
arising from a complex VAT refund system and strict bank secrecy rule that prevents access to
taxpayers’ financial data. To this effect, the authorities are focusing on improving tax
administration by improving compliance, simplifying tax and integrating tax facilities. In
addition, the authorities would also aim to broaden the tax base while also implementing
reinventing policies such as tax amnesty. The authorities have opted to place an emphasis on
these measures as the staff proposal to raise excise taxes would require a large increase of excise
in the short run. Nevertheless, the authorities remain open to potential alternative measures to
enhance revenues and will continue to review policy alternatives. Further, the government plans
to submit a 2016 budget revision.
The fiscal reforms on expenditure and revenue mentioned above will also be supported by
more sustainable financing policies. High reliance on market financing will be reduced and
converted to alternative financing from more concessional bilateral and multilateral sources.
Monetary Policy and Foreign Exchange Management
Monetary policy has played a key role in ensuring the inflation is within BI’s target range.
Bank Indonesia has kept the interest rate at 7.50 percent for the most part of 2015, resulting in
headline inflation well within the 4±1 percent inflation target. Core inflation at 3.95 percent
(yoy) is the lowest rate in the last 10 years. Furthermore, solid coordination between Government
and Bank Indonesia played a significant role in achieving the inflation target.
The monetary policy stance also helped Indonesia adjust successfully to external pressure.
The authorities continue to allow the exchange rate to move flexibly as a shock absorber. This
has succeeded in reducing the current account deficit to a more sustainable level and maintaining
reserves at a comfortable level. Looking ahead, the authorities will remain vigilant to global
developments and changes in international commodity prices, while keeping the Rupiah
exchange rate in line with economic fundamentals. To this effect, the authorities also welcome

4
the results of the EBA assessment affirming Indonesia’s external position and exchange
rate to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and sound macroeconomic
policies.
The authorities foresaw that there exists room for monetary policy easing on the back of
solid macroeconomic stability and taking into account the reduced global uncertainty
post-FFR hike. Consequently, Bank Indonesia lowered the BI rate by 25bps each in both
January and February 2016. Further, the rupiah denominated primary reserve requirement was
also cut by 50bps and 100bps in January and February respectively. The BI rate and primary
reserve requirement cut are expected to strengthen efforts to boost the ongoing economic growth
and mitigate adverse spillback from declining growth to financial stability.
Financial and Corporate Sector Issues
The Indonesian financial sector continues to be resilient and well placed to weather the
current global conditions. The banking system is well-capitalized and profitable. The capital
adequacy ratio reached 21.2 percent (December 2015), which is well above the national
requirement and international standards. This has helped the banking sector withstand the growth
slowdown in 2015. Non-performing loans remain at a low level of 2.5 percent, albeit slightly
higher than the previous year. Credit growth accelerated from 9.8 percent (yoy) in the previous
month to 10.45 percent (yoy). The impact on the financial system of recent bouts of exchange
rate depreciation has been limited.
The authorities continuously strengthen measures to mitigate pockets of vulnerability in
the financial and corporate sectors. In the banking sector, international standards such as Basel
III have been implemented to ensure that banks are well capitalized to withstand turbulence. The
authorities have also implemented a stress test on the corporate sector whilst also mapping out
corporate to better understand their interconnectedness. The authorities remain committed to
continue to closely monitor any vulnerability as well as to upgrade the framework and
coordination on corporate vulnerabilities surveillance. Stronger monitoring is performed using
more forward-looking data, with support from IMF’s TAs. Further, the authorities have stepped
up its efforts in promoting prudent external debt management by introducing regulation to
mitigate currency risk, liquidity risk and overleverage risk. Measures implemented consist of
hedging and liquidity requirements to ensure strong payment capacity. This regulation will be
fully implemented in 2016.
Macro-prudential policy is calibrated by linking it to the dynamics of macroeconomic
development. To maintain the momentum of economic growth, the authorities have loosened
macro-prudential policy. The adjustments constitute of recent revisions of the Loan to Deposit
Ratio Reserve Requirement (LDR-RR) and Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for mortgage loans as
well as revision of down payment regulation for automotive loans.

5
Stronger cooperation and coordination are in place to secure solid crisis management
protocols. As noted by staff, the finalization of the Financial Sector Safety Net (FSSN) bill has
achieved significant progress. A consensus was reached among relevant agencies to identify the
list of systemic institution ex-ante and update the list periodically. The FSSN law is expected to
incorporate a modern safety net, establish clarity of rule and policy responsibility of each
institution. This bill remains the authorities’ top priority and they are hopeful that it can be
completed this year. The authorities have planned reviews of laws on Bank Indonesia (BI),
Depository Insurance Corporation (LPS) and Financial Service Authority (OJK), with a view to
further harmonize these laws. Currently, there exists a crisis management protocol as a forum to
assess financial stability, conducted by Bank Indonesia, Financial Services Authority (OJK),
Minister of Finance, and Indonesia Deposit Insurance (LPS).
Structural Reforms
Reforms to improve competitiveness and enhance investment remain the authorities’ top
priorities and are well laid out in the national medium-term plan. The authorities have
implemented significant reforms to improve the business climate and competitiveness to sustain
and accelerate economic growth. In January 2015, the authorities launched a One Stop Service
(PTSP) program to streamline the application for investment permits for all sectors. This reform
enabled the permit issuance process to be placed under one roof allowing faster approval
process.1 The authorities have also proceeded with the implementation of the Land Acquisition
Law which stipulates the maximum number of days for land acquisition. This procedure has
been successfully applied in several infrastructure projects such as the Trans Sumatra Toll Road
and the Palembang−Indralaya Road projects and would certainly facilitate other infrastructure
activities.
The series of policy packages unveiled by the authorities since August 2015 have also
improved competitiveness and the investment climate by –among others– streamlining
complex regulations, improving logistics to accelerate the flow of goods and services, and
reducing the cost of doing business by cutting red tape and eliminating some VAT for the
transport industry. Business licensing has been streamlined with the establishment of one stop
service and significant reduction of license processing time. The 10th policy package includes
updated negative list which opens up new sectors to FDI. On further measures to improve
competitiveness, the authorities noted staff suggestion to minimize the granting of tax
exemptions. However, the review will take into account the investment promotion regime in
neighboring countries.

With the implementation of the PTSP program, the processing time for the issuance of a full business permit was
shortened from an average of 260 days to 90 days.

6
Recognizing the significant infrastructure requirements, the Indonesian authorities are
committed to accelerate infrastructure development. The authorities have unveiled plans for a
medium-term investment program amounting to US$480 billion during the 2015−2019 period.
The infrastructure projects would focus on the transportation sector and energy sectors which is
essential to boost potential output. The public sector is expected to finance two-thirds of the total
investment (around 30 percent from the central government, 11 percent from local governments,
and 22 percent from state-owned enterprises). The rest is to be financed by the private sector,
mainly through public-private partnerships (PPPs).
The general strategy of the structural reform is to address structural bottlenecks, diversify
growth engines and ultimately raise potential growth. The authorities recognize that the full
impact of reforms will take some time to materialize. However, we are heartened by positive
indication from recent leading indicators as well as trends in investment which have started to
pick up in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Conclusion
The Indonesian authorities reiterate its unwavering commitment to further broad-based
structural reform while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The authorities resolve to
secure an accelerated and sustainable growth path over the medium-term. Our endeavor is
complemented with endowment in natural resources, young demographics, low public debt, a
large domestic market, and a participatory and stable political system. With all those factors, the
authorities believe that Indonesia can weather the unfavorable global environment and will
contribute positively to global economic recovery.
