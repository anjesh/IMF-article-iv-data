Republic of Fiji: Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation1
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the Republic of Fiji
Approved by Ray Brooks and James Roaf
January 19, 2011
Key Issues and Recommendations
Context: Fiji’s economy contracted during 2007–09 amid the global financial crisis and a weak
domestic investment climate, which has resulted from delayed reforms, political developments,
administrative restrictions, and mismanagement in the sugar industry. The 2011 budget faces
potential pressure from costs associated with the government takeover of the Fiji Sugar Corporation
(FSC) and external payments. Public debt is high and rising.
Growth prospects: Real GDP growth is expected to have improved to 0–1 percent in 2010 and 2011
on the back of recovering tourism, exports, and investment driven by resource extraction (water and
mining). The weak investment climate clouds medium-term growth prospects.
Focus: Identifying measures to support fiscal and external sustainability, to increase Fiji’s resilience
to shocks, and to lay the foundation for stronger growth.
Fiscal strategy: Fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt to below 50 percent of GDP; credible
restructuring of FSC and the sugar industry; improved debt management. Limit contingent liabilities
through full cost recovery for public enterprises. Mitigate the social impact of adjustment through
well-targeted social safety nets.
External sustainability: Adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime and ensure that monetary and
fiscal policies help protect reserves.
Supporting growth: Implement broad-based structural reforms to stimulate investment, including
by phasing out exchange and price controls and pursuing land lease reform to help diversify the
sources of growth.
The de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg (see Informational Annex).

I. INTRODUCTION
Economic growth in Fiji has been
negative or low for four years. This compares
unfavorably with other island economies in
the region (Figure 1). Fiji’s weak growth
performance is in part due to the weak
domestic investment climate that results from
delays in structural reforms, an increase in
administrative controls, the decline of the
sugar industry, and political uncertainty. The
global crisis and heavy rains and cyclones in
2009 and 2010 sapped further strength from
the economy. This period has also been
characterized by sharp swings in Fiji’s terms of
trade and foreign reserves, and an increase in
public debt from 50 to 56 percent of GDP, due
in part to government financing losses of the
failed Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC).
1.

It is now time to secure and
supplement recent reform efforts and
pursue strong fiscal consolidation to bolster
Fiji’s long-term growth prospects and ensure
external and fiscal sustainability. In the
absence of ambitious reforms, growth is
expected to be weak and public debt and
contingent liabilities will remain high. The
global crisis, commodity-price volatility and
recent natural disasters have highlighted Fiji’s
vulnerability to shocks. This suggests that the
macroeconomic policy framework and key
institutions should be strengthened to
improve Fiji’s capacity and flexibility to absorb
shocks.

II. BACKGROUND
A.

Macroeconomic Developments

3.
Fiji’s economy contracted by
3 percent in 2009 and marginal growth is
estimated for 2010 (Text Figure). The 2010
improvement is based on tourism rebounding
on the strength of regional economies and
the ongoing competitive gain secured through
the April 2009 devaluation (Figure 3). Exports
and investment driven by resource extraction
are showing positive signs, though growth in
these areas is from a small base.

Inflation has fallen sharply. After
rising to over 10 percent y/y in the 12-months
following the devaluation, inflation—inclusive
of two electricity tariff increases—moderated
to 4.0 percent y/y by late 2010 on sluggish
demand and steady international commodity
prices. Price controls imposed on many food
products since 2009 have likely contributed to
low inflation.
5.
Foreign exchange reserves have
improved steadily following the April 2009
devaluation and stood at over 4 months of
imports ($710 million) at end 2010. Reserves
have, however, been artificially supported by
exchange restrictions (Box 2). Nonetheless,
the reserve level increased during 2010 even
after adjusting for un-repatriated dividends.

Box 1. Fiji: Identifying Sources of Economic Growth
Fiji’s economic growth was low in the past
few years and the structure of the economy
remained broadly unchanged. The public
sector, finance, and tourism-related sectors
such as retail and hotels continue to be the
largest parts of the economy. In addition, the
share of agriculture in GDP has declined
recently mainly due to natural disasters and
the deterioration of the sugar sector.
Nonetheless, more than half of the
population is still involved in agriculture,
reflecting lack of employment opportunities
in other areas and low productivity growth in
this sector.
The weak business climate results in sluggish
private investment and is the major
impediment to economic growth in Fiji.
Structural issues related to land leases and
uncertainty about regulations are among
main factors affecting the business climate.
The economy was hit hard by the global crisis
and contracted by 3 percent in 2009, with
most sectors suffering across the board. The
contribution to growth from the public sector
is significant but volatile.
Fiji’s economy––especially tourism and
finance––is linked closely to its regional
neighbors. These links also increase Fiji’s
exposure to external shocks. In the near term,
growth will be supported by tourism, which is
benefitting from quick recovery in Australia
and New Zealand and the effect of the 2009
devaluation. The mining sector also shows
promise.

Box 2. Fiji: Exchange Restrictions
Fiji maintains a number of exchange restrictions and controls for companies and individuals. The
main restrictions and controls are:


Exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. (i) Repatriation by foreign
banks of their audited profits is limited to a certain amount each year based on negotiation
with the RBF; (ii) Tax certification requirement before foreign companies can remit profits;
and (iii) Direct limits on large payments for imports (e.g., oil).



Activities not delegated to commercial banks and requiring RBF permission.1 (i) Profit
remittances and the withdrawal of investments by companies must generally be staggered
over several months based on agreement with the RBF; (ii) Emigration allowance (up to
$200,000 per annum); (iii) Offset of foreign exchange earnings against foreign currency
payables other than payment of imports already landed in Fiji; (iv) Foreign currency
accounts––for local individuals and locally registered business entities ; (v) Offshore
insurance payments; (vi) Mortgage of Fiji registered assets to secure transactions held
outside Fiji; (vii) Local borrowing by nonresident individuals and nonresident-controlled
companies.



Activities delegated to commercial banks (up to certain limits).1 Payments including court
order, education and medical expenses, advance import payments, and other current
account transactions, etc.



Activities not allowed by the RBF.1 Offshore investments by nonbank financial institutions,
companies, and individuals. Suspension applies to both new applications and existing
approvals not yet utilized.

These restrictions limit income outflows in the balance of payments and thus artificially support
Fiji’s international reserves. However, staff analysis suggests that, even without these restrictions,
reserves would have been on an upward path, reflecting the strengthening of Fiji’s external position
after the devaluation.

Interest rate controls were relaxed.
To allow banks to better price risk, the
Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) in January 2010
removed ceilings on bank lending rates,
though banks must justify deposit-lending
rate spreads greater than 4 percent. In
response, average deposit and lending rates
rose marginally. Banks report limited lending
opportunities due to the weak investment
climate, and credit growth has been modest
(Figure 7). The government re-established
variable rate auctions for government
securities in May 2010. Government
borrowing costs have risen as banks and the
Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) can now
better price risk.

The current account deficit is
expected to have narrowed from 8 percent

Contingent fiscal liabilities are estimated at
17.6 percent of GDP at end 2010 and fully
reflect newly identified guarantees on bonds
issued by Fiji Development Bank (FDB). Loans
for infrastructure of about $185 million have
recently been negotiated with China
Development and Malaysia EXIM banks and
these loans are incorporated in the baseline
macroeconomic projections.

The fiscal deficit is estimated to have
fallen to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2010 from
3.9 percent of GDP in 2009. This reduction
resulted from a public hiring freeze (other
than for key IT, HR, and financial control
positions), lower-than-budgeted capital
spending, and stronger-than-projected VAT
receipts (in part reflecting the need to clear
fewer VAT refund arrears in 2010 after a
major refund effort in 2009). Preliminary data
indicate that the FNPF financed most of the
deficit as banks remain near their sovereign
limits.

The government is in the process of
taking over FSC. Mismanagement has
resulted in the company’s inability to service
its government-guaranteed debts amounting
to 3 percent of GDP (Box 3). The government
is developing a sugar industry reform plan
and intends to restructure FSC and the sugar
industry over the coming three years.

7

Box 3: Fiji: Fiji’s Sugar Industry
Fiji’s sugar industry was founded in the mid-1800s and beginning in 1879 labor was brought from
India to grow cane. The vast majority of cane farmers today are still of Indian descent. At
independence in 1970, sugar accounted for 70 percent of export earnings. Fiji’s sugar mills were
privately owned until 1973, at which time the government brought all four mills under the newly
formed Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), a majority state-owned company.
30

The sugar industry remains important for the
economy. It is estimated that 200,000
people—over 20 percent of the population—
depend on the industry for their livelihoods
(growers, transporters, millers, and associated
service providers). However, the share of sugar
in total export earnings and in GDP has
declined significantly since 1990.

The quantity and quality of sugar cane grown
have fallen since the 1990s due to shorterterm lease renewals that discourage
investment, aging farmers, and emigration
due to political uncertainty. The efficiency of
cane crushing has also deteriorated sharply in
recent years despite a mill upgrade program
undertaken by FSC during 2006–2010 at a cost
of $45 million (1.5 percent of GDP). Reduced
cane quality and poor mill efficiency are
reflected in the rising total cane to total sugar
ratio (TCTS).

FSC has been operating at a loss for the past
four years, in large part due to the mismanagement of the mill upgrade program that has left FSC
unable to crush the minimum quantity of cane for the company to be profitable. During this period
the government has provided guarantees on borrowing by FSC to cover both the mill upgrade cost
and the company’s operating losses. Total guaranteed debt of FSC stood at $92 million (3 percent of
GDP) at end 2010.

8
B.

Outlook and Risks

Growth is likely to be around
1 percent in 2011. This modest rebound will
be driven by recovery in agriculture following
drought in 2010 and continued improvement
in tourism. FDI weakened during 2009-10 and
investment-goods imports and lending for
investment have been, and are anticipated to
remain, weak (Table 4). Growth is projected
at 1 to 2 percent over the medium term in
light of the weak investment climate, which is
persisting due to structural rigidities,
exchange restrictions and price controls, and
political uncertainty.
11.



Excess liquidity in the banking system
could feed into inflation pressure
once recovery leads to more rapid
credit growth. This could also put
pressure on reserves through an
increase in the current account deficit
arising from higher imports. Shortterm pressure would be even greater
if exchange restrictions were relaxed
and current income outflows were to
increase;



If Fiji experiences difficulties in rolling
over its $150 million international
bond in 2011 the government could
face higher financing costs, have to
identify significant spending cuts,
and/or obtain central bank financing
and use reserves to pay the bond off.
This risk is judged as small at present
due to substantial liquidity in Asia and
the authorities’ selection of an
international bank to lead the bond
issue but the ongoing turmoil in
sovereign bond markets has the
potential to complicate Fiji’s bond
refinancing.

Inflation is projected to fall to
3 percent over the medium term. Banks’
excess liquidity has increased to 12 percent of
deposits in recent months. Much of this is
attributable to the lack of lending and
investment opportunities for banks and
exchange restrictions preventing or delaying
outflows. Excess liquidity is now only slightly
lower than one year ago despite efforts by
the RBF to mop up liquidity in 2010 through
changes in the required reserve ratio and
monetary operations. Liquidity is expected to
build further in the coming months due to
continued strong export receipts.
12.

Authorities’ Views
13.
Fiji faces multiple potential risks to
macroeconomic and external stability.



Investment and growth are likely to
remain weak without strong
structural reforms and the removal of
exchange and price controls;



Without fiscal consolidation and stronger
growth public debt will remain high and
Fiji will not create the fiscal space it ought
to have to respond to shocks;

The authorities agree on the growth
outlook and inflation prospects for 2011.
They acknowledge the need for structural
reforms to lay the foundation for stronger
growth but differ with staff on the
importance of exchange restrictions and price
controls as disincentives to investment. They
believe that Fiji will be able to roll over its
$150 million bond in the first half of 2011
though perhaps at a slightly higher interest
rate than originally envisaged.
14.

9
III. SUPPORTING GROWTH AND MAINTAINING FISCAL AND EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY
Fiji’s near term challenge is to restore growth while ensuring fiscal and external stability. Success will
rest on rapid implementation of structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, and strengthening the
macroeconomic policy framework and the independence of the central bank. Specific structural
measures include removing price and exchange controls, civil service reform, restructuring and
reforming public enterprises and the pension fund, and implementing land reform. Without reforms,
Fiji risks continued low growth, greater vulnerability from the concentration of economic activity in
tourism and reduced fiscal space to deal with shocks.

A.

Monetary and Financial Policies

Staff supported the RBF’s
introduction of a new monetary policy
framework in May 2010 and the
announcement of a 3 percent policy rate,
given low inflation, steady reserves and
weak activity. The new framework allows the
RBF to manage liquidity through the sale and
purchase of RBF bills and is an important
move toward a more active and marketoriented monetary policy arrangement. Staff
acknowledged that managing liquidity and
targeting the policy rate has proved
challenging in an environment of persistent
excess liquidity and limited lending
opportunities. The RBF’s two increases in the
statutory reserve deposit ratio in mid-2010
were appropriate and helped remove some of
the potential risk associated with high
liquidity. In the current environment of weak
growth, zero core inflation and no wage
pressure, the recent further reduction by 50
basis points of the key policy rate keeps policy
neutral.
15.

The removal of ceilings on bank
lending rates and the re-introduction of
variable rate auctions for government
securities are welcome. Looking forward,
staff urges the RBF to allow deposit and
lending rates to respond to the demand for
and supply of funds and thereby support
16.

credit demand from all borrowers, including
small and medium enterprises.
17.
Staff cautioned the authorities to
stand ready to tighten monetary policy
gradually if projected inflation moves above
3 percent, or if liquidity increases and credit
growth becomes too strong. Given rising
energy prices and the uncertain inflation
outlook, any further reduction in the key
policy rate should be avoided at this time.

Removing restrictions on profit and
dividend repatriation by foreign banks and
companies would reduce excess liquidity
while improving confidence, the appetite for
borrowing, and growth prospects. About half
of excess liquidity arises from these
restrictions. Staff urged the authorities to
relax these exchange restrictions quickly and
to remove them by the end of 2011.
18.

The RBF has improved supervision
and supervision policy for both banks and
insurance companies. Progress has been
made in a number of areas, including on 2006
FSAP recommendations (Appendix III).
Commercial banks appear well capitalized and
liquid (Table 6), albeit in part due to the lack
of investment opportunities. Going forward,
staff suggests that stress tests should be
conducted and reviewed with banks at least
semi-annually. Vacant bank examiner
19.

10
positions should be filled as soon as possible
to ensure effective, timely supervision. The
RBF should leverage data on credit analysis
available from large banks and enhance riskbased analysis and supervision of banks and
FNPF.
The government should be cautious
about extending further guarantees to FDB.
FDB’s nonperforming-asset ratio rose to
28 percent at end 2009. The government
guarantees about 20 percent of FDB’s loan
portfolio and all bonds issued by FDB to fund
its lending operations. Government
guarantees to FDB stand at 5.3 percent of
GDP.
20.

21.
The government adopted in April
2010 its reform plan to put FNPF on a sound
financial and actuarial footing. This is a
welcome development since FNPF is a
monopoly pension fund and has assets
equivalent to 62 percent of GDP. FNPF
lending to quasi-government entities
increased only marginally (F$12 million) in the
year to June 2010. However, staff was
concerned about FNPF’s plans to invest
further in real estate developments that have
already created financial difficulties for the
fund. Key steps taken or anticipated under
the FNPF reform plan are covered in Appendix
III and full implementation of these measures
in 2011 will help ensure fiscal sustainability.
22.
The first-time safeguards
assessment of RBF has now been completed,
which found key safeguards elements in
place. The RBF publishes annual financial
statements, albeit with some delay, that are
both prepared and audited in accordance

with internationally recognized standards.
The assessment confirmed, however, that the
level of autonomy of the RBF is very low, with
the legislation supporting a wide scope of
political interference. Proposed amendments
would address some but not all of these
weaknesses; alternative measures were
recommended by the staff for others. The
assessment also made recommendations to
establish an inter-departmental working
group to develop procedures for compilation
of monetary program data, and adopt an
action plan for establishing RBF capacity to
prepare IFRS financial statements. The
authorities are already working towards
implementing the recommendations.
Authorities’ Views
The authorities believe the current
stance of monetary policy is appropriate
given weak growth and low inflation. They
suggested the policy rate could be lowered
further to support fiscal objectives,
notwithstanding the high level of excess
liquidity. They indicated that interest rate
flexibility will be maintained to ensure the
effectiveness of monetary policy and allow
banks and other financial institutions to
properly price risk. The RBF noted it will take
steps to improve the quality and timeliness of
bank supervision. The authorities are
cognizant of high contingent fiscal liabilities
but feel that FDB plays a key role in lending to
agriculture and that further government
support to the bank is necessary, while
keeping FDB under close supervision by the
RBF. The authorities intend to complete
reforms of FNPF during 2011 and will consider
allowing FNPF to invest more offshore.
23.

B.
Staff projects a 2011 deficit of
3.7 percent of GDP (Table 3), based on the
authorities’ budget (which shows a deficit of
3.5 percent of GDP on a different statistical
treatment of some items). Staff
recommended a 2011 deficit of 3 percent of
GDP to start the fiscal consolidation necessary
to reduce Fiji’s public debt to less than 50
percent of GDP over the medium term. Staff
supports the increase of the VAT rate from
12.5 percent to 15 percent and policy changes
to increase the yield of excise taxes. All of the
increased revenue in 2011 will therefore be
used to finance FSC restructuring costs and
higher capital and non-wage recurrent
spending, in part to increase social protection
programs. These measures are estimated to
yield increased revenue of 2.3 percent of
GDP. The government’s intention to continue
to limit hiring and the growth in the wage bill
will also help restrain expenditure growth in
2011. These measures are, however, more
than offset by ambitious capital spending
plans and higher nonwage current spending.
24.

25.
On the financing side, the discussions
focused on options to roll over the global
bond and ensure domestic financing
requirements are feasible. The authorities
are working with an international bank to roll
over the global bond in the first half of 2011.
Staff considers such an approach reasonable
but commented there is some risk that the
cost to roll over the bond could increase,
especially for a full rollover in the current
global environment.

Staff noted strict adherence to debt
management procedures would help avoid a
rapid, excessive build-up of public debt. Staff
urged the authorities to ensure that new loan
discussions are coordinated across
26.

Fiscal Policy
government agencies and that new borrowing
is consistent with debt sustainability and
takes into account currency risk.
Staff welcomes the inclusion of
1.7 percent of GDP in 2011 budget
expenditure to begin restructuring FSC. It is,
however, critical that government develops a
well-designed reform plan for FSC so that
allocated funds are used for successful
restructuring of the company, which is a
necessary step in the overall strategy to
reform the sugar sector. Staff urged the
authorities to consider divestment of FSC as
an option when withdrawing budget support
in the future.
27.

The current stance of fiscal policy
will not create the fiscal space Fiji needs to
be able to react to shocks in the future. With
existing policies, public debt will rise by
0.7 percent of GDP by 2015 and contingent
liabilities will remain high. This falls well short
of the government’s own stated goal of
reducing public debt to 45 percent of GDP in
the medium term. Under a somewhat more
ambitious reform program based on civil
service rationalization, land reform, and the
elimination of exchange restrictions and price
controls, the combination of a lower wage bill
and higher growth would reduce public debt
to below 50 percent of GDP by 2016 and help
contain contingent liabilities (text table).
28.

29.
Staff reiterated its advice to
introduce a simplified investment allowance
scheme. It commended the authorities for
initial steps to restrict any new tax holidays.
At the same time, staff expressed concern
that some of the measures introduced in the
2011 budget—such as water resource tax
rates differentiated by scale of production

12
and sharp increases in import duties on some
items—could distort economic incentives and
might erode business confidence if they are
perceived to be arbitrary and create
uncertainty.
Authorities’ Views
The government is mindful of the
level of public debt but views a continued
expansionary fiscal stance, supported by an
accommodative monetary policy, as the best
policy mix to support medium-term
investment and growth. The authorities
30.

agree on the need to simplify investment
incentives and plan steps to achieve this in
the medium term. As noted earlier, they do
not foresee any difficulties in rolling over the
global bond but acknowledge some risk that
the interest rate could be higher than
assumed in the budget. They agreed that debt
management procedures should be
strengthened and will take measures to
ensure better coordination of future
borrowing.

External Balance and Vulnerabilities

31.
The baseline external current
account deficit is projected to be 7–8 percent
of GDP over the medium term. This
represents a substantial improvement
compared to projections at the time of the
2009 Article IV Consultation. This reflects

stronger non-sugar exports, tourism receipts
and remittances; subdued import demand
due to weak growth; and lower-than-earlier
projected outflows of dividends and profits,
consistent with current government policy.
The overall balance of payments is now

13
projected to be fully financed going forward—
assuming reserve coverage of around 4
months of imports—due to these
developments and assuming rollover of the
global bond.
32.
External vulnerabilities arise from
the narrow export base and volatile
commodity prices, and risks highlighted
above, namely natural disasters, exchange
restrictions that are limiting outflows, and
potential difficulties in rolling over the global
bond in 2011. All of these factors argue for
reserves closer to 5 months of import cover,
following from tighter fiscal policy and an
improved investment climate.



Foreign exchange earnings depend
heavily on tourism, sugar exports, and
remittances. While remittances have
been strong, the increased reliance
on tourism—which has been
volatile—and the uncertain outlook
for sugar create risks.



Food, oil and other commodity prices
have started to increase. Fiji is import
dependent for these items and
further price increases could put
pressure on reserves.

D.

Authorities’ Views
The authorities agreed on the
improved outlook for the current account
while acknowledging that this is driven in
part by weaker growth prospects and
exchange restrictions. They noted that they
intend to review and relax exchange controls
in 2011 if reserves continue to build. They are
mindful of the vulnerabilities arising from
Fiji’s position as a small open economy and
would like to target reserves sufficient to
cover 4 to 5 months of imports. They are
confident that Fiji will be able to obtain the
external financing it needs in 2011 at
reasonable cost.
34.

Exchange Rate Policy

The 20 percent devaluation of April
2009 improved competitiveness. The REER
has not changed significantly in the past
12 months and Fiji has locked in a sizeable
competitive gain from the devaluation. The
exchange rate assessment is complicated by
weaknesses in data but all three CGER
approaches show that the exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 4).
Direct indicators such as growing reserves and
modest real wage growth support this
35.

Debt sustainability analysis shows a
number of vulnerabilities. Shocks to the
outlook could push central government debt
to 61 percent of GDP by 2015 (Appendix IV).
Fiji has low external debt—currently
17 percent of GDP—but a combination of
shocks to GDP growth, interest rates and the
current account could raise external debt to
23 percent of GDP.
33.

conclusion. For the special case of sugar,
export earnings and profitability have
declined due to the reduction in the EU
support price and developments in the
domestic industry—such as mismanagement
of FSC, the breakdown in the sugar transport
system, and the abandonment of sugar
farms—that have reduced production
capacity.

14
Staff encourages the authorities to
adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Fiji’s exchange rate peg to a basket has served
as a nominal anchor, but has led to periodic
overvaluation and repeated sharp
devaluation due to inconsistent fiscal and
monetary policies and adverse terms-of-trade
shocks. A more flexible regime—based
initially on an exchange rate band of ±2–
3 percent around the current parity—would
help Fiji absorb external shocks and protect
its reserve position. A new regime would,
however, need to be supported with prudent
fiscal and monetary policies. It would also
require the RBF to be given full autonomy in
36.

managing monetary policy and the exchange
rate regime.
Authorities’ Views
The authorities agree that the
devaluation continues to pay dividends and
agree with the exchange rate assessment.
They are reconsidering their earlier decision
to adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime
and may retain the basket peg as their
nominal anchor because—in their view—such
a move could be premature given
uncertainties about the macroeconomic
environment and the current policy mix.
37.

15

Box 4. Fiji: Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates show the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Staff’s calculation of
the underlying current account to GDP ratio incorporates estimated outflows that would occur in
the absence of the restriction on dividend repatriation. The Macro Balance (MB) approach shows
that the currency is close to its estimated equilibrium level. Both the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
(ERER) approach and the External Stability (ES) approach suggest there is no evidence of substantial
misalignment. With the MB approach, the decomposition of the fitted values into time-varying
contributions implies demographic factors and relative income growth are the main factors in
determination of the equilibrium current account balance. With the projected low growth and
improved fiscal position, the current account balance tends to stabilize around its current level over
the medium term. In the ERER approach movements in terms of trade are the key driving forces for
the equilibrium exchange rate, while the ES approach indicates that rising foreign debt and low
economic growth are potential risks to external stability. Each approach is subject to uncertainty
because of the size of potential dividend outflows and/or model limitations.
Rising foreign reserves and low real wage growth also imply no overvaluation for the real
exchange rate at present. Since the 20 percent devaluation in April 2009 foreign reserves have
increased substantially. Staff calculations suggest that reserves would have increased even in the
absence of restrictions on dividend repatriation due to rebounds in tourism and workers’
remittances. In addition, falling inflation and lower real wage growth compared to major trading
partners suggest that the currency is not under high pressure for depreciation.

Structural Reforms

Structural reforms would spur
growth and help protect macroeconomic
stability. Priorities identified by the
government include public enterprise, civil
service, and land reform. The removal of
widespread price controls would help
improve economic efficiency and build
investor confidence.
38.

39.
Public enterprise reform will support
private-sector led growth and help contain
fiscal risks. Staff supports the government’s
decision to take over the FSC and restructure
the company. Finalizing quickly a credible
sugar industry reform plan will reduce
uncertainty for potential investors and help
ensure that the fiscal costs of FSC and sugar
industry reform are minimized. Raising utility
tariffs for services provided by public
enterprises to full cost recovery would
eliminate losses and encourage private
investment. Staff welcomes the government’s
approval of higher electricity tariffs in 2010 as
this should allow the Fiji Electricity Authority
(FEA) to proceed with much-needed
investment and attract more independent
power producers to Fiji. Tariff adjustments
tied to public enterprises should be
accompanied by well-targeted subsidies—or
other mechanisms such as the existing lifeline
electricity tariff—to protect the poor.
Improved oversight of public enterprises and
moving regulatory functions to an
independent entity would help improve
governance.

A well-designed and comprehensive
civil service reform will create space for
public investment in priority areas and
contribute to fiscal sustainability. Staff
supports the functional review of public
40.

service positions being undertaken by the
government. This should allow for a
comprehensive analysis of government
functions and wage and salary expenditures,
including of the police and military. The
adoption of performance-based
remuneration would be important for a
sustainable reform and more attractive
redundancy packages would assist in rightsizing government. The successful creation of
the Water Authority of Fiji in 2010 is
encouraging and staff welcomes
government’s efforts to identify other noncore services that can be outsourced.
Land tenure reform would encourage
private sector investment and job creation.
The government’s decision to create a land
bank to facilitate long-term leases should help
support greater utilization of land and
development and diversification of
agriculture. The recent announcement of a
major investment in bauxite mining on land
obtained through the land bank is a good
example of the growth dividends that are
flowing from the government’s structural
reforms.
41.

Staff urges the government to
eliminate price controls. These controls
distort market signals and discourage
investment, including in small-scale
agriculture. It would be preferable to use
targeted transfers to mitigate the impact of
price rises on vulnerable groups.
42.

Authorities’ views
43.
The authorities agree that public
enterprise reforms must proceed soon to
improve efficiency and help contain fiscal

17
risks. They intend to adopt a comprehensive
reform plan for the FSC in 2011 and are
preparing for the partial divestment of the
FEA. They noted that the ongoing functional
review of the civil service will guide future
reform efforts, though a comprehensive civil
service reform is several years away. The
authorities are hopeful that the land bank will
attract substantial voluntary traditional land

deposits that can then be sub-leased to
investors. The authorities commented that
they understand the costs associated with
price controls but stated that this is their
preferred way to deliver assistance to the
poor and noted their concern that certain
retailers are making excessive profits.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
Fiji faces difficult challenges to break
away from its low growth of the past
decade. There are encouraging signs of
recovery, but stronger, sustained growth
would require a more favorable investment
climate that can materialize only through
continued structural reforms and the removal
of administrative controls. There are a
number of downside risks to the growth
outlook. Public debt and contingent liabilities
are equivalent to 74 percent of GDP and limit
the fiscal space Fiji should reserve to respond
to frequent shocks. Volatile commodity
prices, increasing reliance on tourism, risk of
natural disasters and some uncertainty about
external financing represent significant
vulnerabilities. Investor interest is likely to
remain subdued in the presence of exchange
and price controls and continued political
uncertainty.
44.

The current monetary policy stance
is appropriate. High excess liquidity in the
banking system reflects the weak economic
environment and exchange restrictions.
Monetary policy should be gradually
tightened if core inflation rises or a return of
confidence leads to strong credit growth.
Restrictions on the repatriation of profits and
dividends should be relaxed to build investor
confidence.
45.

The 2011 budget deficit of
3.7 percent of GDP falls short of the effort
needed to bring public debt below
50 percent of GDP in the medium term. The
authorities are to be commended for the bold
revenue measures in the 2011 budget. If
these are complemented by ambitious civil
service and public enterprise reform Fiji will
move towards fiscal sustainability.
46.

Public enterprise and FNPF reform
will bolster fiscal sustainability. The fiscal risk
of supporting public enterprises has been
made clear by FSC. The government should
move quickly to finalize the FSC restructuring
plan and the company should be divested
within the next three years. FNPF reforms
detailed in Appendix III should be completed
in 2011.
47.

48.
Fiji should adopt a more flexible
exchange rate regime to help absorb shocks
and protect reserves. An appropriate first
step would be to move to an exchange rate
band of ±2–3 percent around the current
rate. This should be supported by strong fiscal
adjustment, prudent monetary policy, and
continued interest rate flexibility. The
independence of the RBF should be
strengthened and changes to the RBF Act
recommended in the recent safeguards
assessment should be implemented.

18
Recent RBF action to strengthen
bank supervision is welcome but further
steps toward risk-based supervision are
needed. Stress tests should be conducted and
reviewed with banks more frequently and the
RBF should make greater use of creditanalysis data available from large banks.
49.

Structural reforms are necessary to
spur growth and would help protect
macroeconomic stability. Well-designed land
reform and the removal of price controls
should support investment and the
diversification of economic activity. Civil
service reform and adjusting tariffs for public
services will help contain contingent liabilities
and should increase efficiency. The social
50.

impact of redundancies and higher tariffs can
be addressed through retraining programs
and additional targeted social assistance.
A number of exchange restrictions
are subject to Fund approval under Article
VIII (Box 2). Restrictions arise from tax
certification requirements before foreign
companies can remit profits and direct limits
on large payments (dividend payments and oil
payments). Staff does not recommend IMF
Executive Board approval of these restrictions
and advises that they be removed.
51.

It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Status of Key 2004 Fiscal ROSC Recommendations
2004 ROSC

Status

MOF Comments

Clarify the status of
the suspended 1999
Public Finance
Management Law.

The 1999 law was replaced by the new
2004 Financial Management Act (the
2004 FMA) and other instructions,
providing a legislative framework to
support financial management reform,
which envisages performance
budgeting, moving to actual
accounting over the medium term, and
introducing a new financial
management information system
(IFMIS).

The PFMA was repealed and
replaced with the FAM 2004. From
the FMA, the Finance Instructions,
and Finance Manual were
developed. A new Financial
Management Information System
was implemented in 48 out of
52 departments. The 4 outside
FMIS include Ministry of Health
(MOH), Department of National
Roads (DNR), Water Supplies
Department and Government
Supplies Department. The Water
Department is now the Fiji Water
Authority and has its own
information system. The
Government Supplies Department
has been closed and replaced with
the Fiji Procurement Office, which
from next year will be an Activity
under Program 1 of Head 4.
Implementation of the FMIS is
currently being undertaken with
MOH and necessary paperwork is
also currently being done to
implement FMIS in DNR.

Address weaknesses
in compliance of legal
and regulatory
requirements on
budget
implementation.

Compliance remains weak. A draft on
accounting protocols has been
prepared.

Compliance is no doubt weak. The
State Services Decree of 2009
allows all Permanent Secretaries to
control the recruitment and
termination of personnel under
their control, as well as initiating
disciplining them. To address the
noncompliance issue, the Ministry
of Finance implemented the
following measures:

Write monthly to all
Permanent Secretaries whose
financial returns are not up to
date and copied to Permanent
Secretary of the Public Service
Commission.

35

Appendix I. Status of Key 2004 Fiscal ROSC Recommendations
2004 ROSC

Status

MOF Comments


Simplify tax statutes,
in particular, the
Income Tax Act,
narrowing the room
for administrative
discretion.

Strengthen the policy
framework for
publicly controlled
financial institutions,
such as FNPF, Fiji
Development Bank
(FDB), and the
Housing Authority.
Monitor the
soundness of their
financial positions.

The new Tax Administrative Decree
(effective January 1, 2010) harmonizes
and simplifies administrative provisions
in Income Tax Act, VAT Decree, Hotel
Turnover Tax, Gambling Turnover Tax,
and Land Sales Act. However, there is
still room for discretional
administrative decisions.
Financial reports are prepared
quarterly by the Ministry of Public
Enterprises and annual audited
financial reports are submitted to the
Cabinet. However, oversight is not
harmonized, with the Ministry of
Public Enterprises overseeing some
public enterprises, while the Ministry
of Finance oversees the Fiji
Development Bank.

Ministry of Finance to request
Permanent Secretary of the
Public Service Commission to
initiate disciplinary actions, if
noncompliance continues.
The Fiji Islands and Revenue
Customs Authority is currently
working with a PFTAC consultant on
the rewrite of the tax legislation.

Under the Public Enterprises Act
1996, the Ministry of Public
Enterprises is responsible for
overseeing and implementing
Government public enterprise
reform program with the intention
of increasing the efficiency and
effectiveness of the public
enterprise sector. Under the Act,
the Ministry will continue to
monitor the performance of public
enterprises declared as
Government Commercial
Companies [GCCs]. The Ministry
also implements and monitors the
restructuring or re-organization of
identified government entities.
From a national fiscal viewpoint,
the Ministry of Finance is
responsible for overseeing; (a)
GCCs; (c) Commercial Statutory
Authorities (CSAs) that includes
FDB; and (d) grant recipient
statutory entities (SAs). The
comment is noted and a
harmonized effort to closely
monitor entities which are both
looked after by the two ministries
are being undertaken, which
include quarterly meeting updates

36

Appendix I. Status of Key 2004 Fiscal ROSC Recommendations
2004 ROSC
Establish sound
internal controls
within ministries,
departments, and Fiji
Islands Revenue and
Customs Authority
(FIRCA), by: (i)
upgrading the
capability of the
current accounting
system, (ii) conducting
basic reconciliation
processes, (iii) taking
effective and timely
disciplinary action for
contravention.

Status
Not yet fully enforced.
(i) An Integrated Financial
Management Information System has
been partly implemented (four
ministries, including the Ministry of
Health, are yet to adopt it). (ii) The
reconciliation process is neither
effective nor timely. (iii) Disciplinary
action is not taken in most cases.
Instructions are being reviewed to
introduce disciplinary measures for
noncompliance.

Introduce an internal
audit unit and
strengthen FIRCA’s
Internal Audit
Committee.

Internal audit was introduced in 2008.

Strengthen audit
capacity.

External audit has been strengthened
in the last few years.

MOF Comments
It is important to note that the
Ministry of Finance only collates
financial information that is posted
by individual agencies to produce
financial reports for Whole of
Government. The carrying out of
reconciliation is the onus of the
Accounting Heads of the various
agencies and the Permanent
Secretary (PS) as he/she is the Chief
Accounting Officer of the agency.
Furthermore, both the Accounting
Head and the PS have a reporting
requirement stipulated in the
Finance Instructions which requires
them to ensure the monthly
submission or tabling of financial
returns to relevant authorities.
On disciplinary actions, please refer
to comments on item 2 above.
After introduction in 2008, Internal
Audit has carried out and continues
to carry out strengthening and
reviewing of FIRCA’s internal
business processes for both
Customs and Taxation. They have
moved toward improving and
eliminating risks with regards to
revenue leakages and collections.
There has been a significant shift in
the selection of cases to be audited.
At the moment we are delving on
technical issues with large and
small and medium taxpayers since
they contribute the highest amount
of taxes to the government.

37

Appendix I. Status of Key 2004 Fiscal ROSC Recommendations
2004 ROSC

Status

MOF Comments

Improve the quality
and expand the scope
of the information
provided in the annual
budget documents, in
accordance with the
GFS.

Public agencies and expenditures that
are outside the budget should be
included, for example FIRCA, the
Housing Authority, and some large
infrastructure projects. In addition,
some expenditure items are
misclassified, e.g., some capital
transfers should be reclassified as
current transfers.

Beginning in the 2010 Revised
Budget, projects financed through
direct payments are reported as
part of total expenditure. FIRCA
grant is recorded as one-line items
in the budget, depending on the
purpose of the grant, i.e., operating
or capital nature. Housing Authority
does not receive any government
support through the budget. The
misclassifications will be addressed
in the annual budget process;
where the purpose of the spending
will be reviewed and classified
accordingly.

Introduce quarterly
reporting by MOF on
the fiscal outturn and
present a mid-year
report on budget
implementation to
parliament, including
revised spending and
revenue forecasts.

Quarterly information on revenue is
published, but no quarterly
information on expenditure is
available. Internal monthly revenue
and expenditure reports are available
for some areas. The quality of
reporting needs to be improved.

Quarterly expenditure information
form part of the Fiscal Outturn
Report that is tabled to Cabinet at
the end of every quarter. Following
Cabinet’s endorsement, quarterly
expenditure information can be
accessed on RBF’s quarterly
publications. Some of the
improvements now implemented
include: reporting on the
outstanding commitments; tracking
of the amount of unpresented
checks; matching the financing
sources (below the line), and the
overall balance (above the line) is
also being introduced in the second
half of 2010.

38

Appendix II. Status of Key FAD Recommendations on Tax Policy and Administration
2009 TA on Tax Incentives
Reduce the corporate tax rate to
25 percent in 2012.

Eliminate the provision of tax holidays
as of December 31, 2011.
Restructure investment allowances by
replacing by, say, a 20 percent
investment allowance and providing a
higher, say, a 30 percent allowance for
key priority areas in 2012.

Eliminate most sector-specific and
employment-related incentives.

Review of the Sixth Schedule
Tax deduction of 150 percent to be
available for marketing costs of goods
and services in the South Pacific
islands.

Status
The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 31 percent in
2008 to 28 percent in 2010 and 20 percent for companies listed
on the South Pacific Stock Exchange with more than 40 percent
local equity shareholding. The corporate tax remains at
28 percent in 2011.
Tax holidays have not been eliminated. However, no new tax
holidays were introduced in the 2010 Budget.
Not restructured as per IMF recommendation.
In the 2011 Budget there were some extensions to some of the
incentive allowances, deductions, and exemptions but the rate
remains the same. The extension were for the following:
1. Export Income Deduction Incentive is extended to 2015.
2. Employment taxation Scheme is extended to 2012.
3. Accelerated Depreciation available to buildings is extended to
2012. The incentive is also available to new plants and

2008 TA on Tax Administration

Status

Reorganize core tax and customs
functions of the Fiji Islands Revenue
and Customs Authority (FIRCA).
For domestic tax administration
reform, review all tax procedures,
especially the burdensome assessment
regime, and develop effective business
processes.
For customs, develop a comprehensive
reform plan and review business
processes under the new
organizational proposals.
Increase and unify the VAT threshold
and strengthen audits, given concerns
about fraudulent VAT refunds.

Early in 2009, FIRCA formed the Reform Steering Committee on
taxation and customs to study and implement recommendations.
Regarding tax procedures, the new Tax Administration Decree
(effective January 2010) harmonizes and simplifies
administration.

A reforms team has been set up in FIRCA to ensure proper
reforms are carried out for business processes for Customs and
Taxation Division. The team was set up in 2009 and is progressing
well on reforms activities for FIRCA.
The authorities increased the VAT threshold in the 2010 Budget
(from F$30,000 to F$50,000 for goods and from F$15,000 to
F$50,000 for services).

Appendix III. Fiji: Status of Key 2006 FSAP Recommendations
FSAP Recommendations
Enhance supervision while
economizing on RBF’s
resources. Make greater use
of external and financial
institution internal auditors.

Status/Progress
2009
The RBF has made substantial progress in dealing with their staffing problems and
has filled most examiner and analyst positions. A challenge remains, however, with
high staff turnover. The RBF has made extensive use of external auditors.
2010
Staff turnover has significantly reduced over 2009/2010. Vacancies existed within
the Financial Institutions Group (FIG) after the establishment of the Financial
System Development & Compliance Group in April 2009 during which policy
analysts within FIG were viewed as the best people to initiate financial system
development work in the newly established group. FIG is in the process of filling
the two remaining examiner vacancies.
The RBF continues to be pro-active in its effort to enhance the effectiveness of its
supervisory role, given its current resources and challenges. There are plans to
establish a separate Statistical Unit in 2011, and job rotation to strengthen the
policy and research function.
The RBF continues to engage the external auditors of licensed financial institutions
in its supervision work and continues to review the internal auditors’ reports
during onsite examinations. The RBF requested some special audits in 2010. The
RBF will continue to improve this process in 2011. Improvements are to be made
on timeliness of meetings/submission of management letters, and more robust
formal analysis and integration of off-site and on-site supervisory work.

Introduce risk-based
supervision to ensure that
supervision is focused on the
areas and institutions of
greatest concern, including
matters other than credit
risk.

2009
The RBF has made good progress in implementing risk-based supervision. The cycle
of onsite examinations has been done on a risk-based basis with pre-exam
information collected based on internal discussions of significant risk areas, and
integrated with offsite information. In-house stress testing is currently carried out
on an ad-hoc basis, but the RBF is working toward regular stress testing with the
help of Fund technical assistance provided in March 2009.
Market risks policies have yet to be developed but supervision units have started
examining these areas. In September, a draft Banking Supervisory Policy on
Minimum Requirements for Management and Operational Risk was circulated to
the industry for comments and will be finalized by year end. Supervisory actions
have been stepped up for the FNPF with recent onsite recommendations focusing
on strengthening corporate governance and risk management.
2010
Risk-based supervision is now the approach taken in all on-site examinations and

40
FSAP Recommendations

Status/Progress
off-site monitoring. Though the documentation of the approach is still to be
completed, risk-based modules introduced by APRA in its training for Pacific
Supervisors have been used as a guide. Stress testing is continuing and there are
plans to increase the regularity of conducting these in 2011.

Sign MOUs with all relevant
foreign and domestic
supervisors.

The Banking Supervisory Policy on Minimum Requirements for Management and
Operational Risk was finalized and approved by the Board and implemented in the
first half of 2010. The Insurance Supervision Policy Statement on Minimum
Guidelines for Risk Management Frameworks on Licensed Insurers was
implemented in June 2010.
2009
A draft MOU with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has not
been finalized. The RBF is discussing a draft MOU with the Bank of Papua New
Guinea. The Capital Markets Development Authority, an agency responsible for
regulating and supervising capital markets, has recently been brought under the
RBF.
2010
No further work has been done on the formalization of the MOUs. This is due to an
agreement with the AFSPC that Pacific supervisors are able to maintain APRA
contacts that they can use in case they need information on branches/subsidiaries
of Australian financial institutions they supervise. The same AFSPC network is used
for sharing of information amongst Pacific supervisors.

Clarify the powers and
responsibilities of the RBF
and the MOF.

2009
A new RBF Act has been drafted bringing it into line with international standards.
The draft Act has been reviewed by the Fund.
2010
The Amendments to the RBF Act have been finalized by the RBF and sent to the
Solicitor General's office for consideration. The RBF has had several discussions to
clarify various provisions relating to r intentions and objectives. The Amendments
will now require the approval of the Attorney General and then Cabinet’s final
approval.

Strengthen liquidity
forecasting capacity to
improve forecasting of
foreign reserves and the net
position of the government,
and improve the RBF’s ability
to undertake a systematic
analysis of the forecasting
errors.

2009
The RBF has discussed with MOF ways to improve cash flow forecasts. The RBF
monitors and analyzes daily forecast errors, and produces monthly forecasts to
year-end. However, the use of direct control instruments and the suspension of
open market operations since June 2007 made the liquidity forecasting exercise
practically irrelevant and thus halted its improvement.
2010
The RBF continues to fine tune its methodologies for forecasting foreign reserves,
an important determinant of bank liquidity. Strengthening the accuracy and
reliability of Overseas Exchange Transactions data from the banks and foreign

41
FSAP Recommendations

Status/Progress
exchange dealers, is critical. In addition, improving liaison with major industries is
needed for the accurate capturing of inflows and outflows of foreign reserves.
Strengthening information sharing between the RBF and the MoF to more
accurately forecast government’s net financial position, is vital.

Improve government
securities primary issuance
techniques (auction
frequency, advanced
calendar, benchmark issues,
consolidation).

2009
No progress has been made on this front. The government still relies heavily on the
FNPF to finance its deficits and sees no immediate need to implement this
recommendation. The Reserve Bank’s Capital Markets Unit intends to incorporate
these recommendations into its master plan for capital market development.
2010
The government has removed the fixed coupon on its bonds and setting of interest
rates on treasury bills. Since May 2010 interest rates on all government securities
are market determined.
The market is informed of all upcoming government issues. In addition, the timing
of some of these government issues are discussed with institutional investors and
where appropriate the issues are aligned with investor preference.

Fiji National Provident Fund
strengthening and reform.

2009
The FNPF Board is considering the recommendations of an actuarial report
conducted by Mercer consultants. In addition, a paper has been drafted for
possible demonopolization of compulsory retirement savings. Plans are also in
place for a comprehensive review of the operations of the FNPF including an
overhaul of governance structure to ensure FNPF autonomy and long-term
sustainability. An expert on the Singapore’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) will assist
the authorities in coming months. A proposed action plan should be finalized by
the first quarter of 2010.
2010
A major reform program of the FNPF is currently underway. The Reform Program
was developed after a staff visit to the Singapore CPF by the FNPF and the RBF in
February 2010, and taking into account the recommendations of the FSAP 2006
mission, the 2008 World Bank Actuarial Advisory Report, the Singapore
Cooperation Enterprise (SCE) Consultancy Reports of 2009 and 2010, and Mercer
Actuarial Reports of the FNPF from 2008. The Reform Program was approved by
the Prime Minister in April 2010 and has a time line for completion by December
2011. Major areas of reform are the Review of the FNPF Act, the Pension Review,
the Investment Rehabilitation Program, and the IT Strategic Review and Reform.
The FNPF makes a quarterly update to the Prime Minister on the progress of the
reform actions, and meets monthly with the Reserve Bank as part of the prudential
consultation process, where the reform and other issues of concern are discussed,
and updates provided by the Fund.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Fiji’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg.
Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of
Fiji’s five major trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound sterling
(replaced by the Euro at the beginning of 1999); and the Japanese yen. The weights used in the
basket, based mainly on the value of trade and tourist transactions are reviewed annually. The
exchange rate of the Fiji dollar against U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined daily
by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) in relation to the currency basket. The RBF’s buying and selling
rates for transactions in U.S. dollars are communicated to commercial banks. On April 15, 2009,
the Fiji dollar was devalued by 20 percent against the basket. The exchange rate was F$1.8195 per
U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2010.
Exchange and capital controls were tightened significantly in early 2009 following the devaluation
of the currency. Some of the exchange restrictions have been eliminated and amended since then.
Remaining restrictions subject to Article VIII arise from the Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs
Authority tax certification requirements before foreign companies can remit profits abroad and
from limits on large payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends repatriation of foreign banks).

3

Approval of most current payments was delegated to commercial banks and foreign exchange
dealers in the late 1990s. However, the extent of delegation was tightened during periods of stress
on foreign exchange reserves, most recently in April 2009. In December 2009, the RBF announced
an increase in the delegated ceilings for commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers for most
current payments, effective January 1, 2010. There are also restrictions in Fiji dollars on offshore
portfolio and direct investments by the Fiji National Provident Fund and other nonbank financial
institutions, companies, and individuals.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Suva during Nov 10–24, 2009. The
consultation (Country Report No. 10/136) was completed by the Executive Board on
January 11, 2010. Fiji is on a 12-month cycle with the concurrence of the authorities.

Safeguards Assessment: The first-time safeguards assessment of the Reserve Bank of
Fiji (RBF) was finalized in January 2011 and found key safeguards elements in place. The RBF
publishes annual financial statements, albeit with some delay, that are both prepared and audited
in accordance with internationally recognized standards. The assessment confirmed, however,
that the level of autonomy of the RBF is very low with the legislation supporting a wide scope of
political interference. Proposed amendments would address some but not all of these
weaknesses; alternative measures were recommended by the staff for others. Other priority
recommendations include: (i) establishing an inter-departmental working group to develop
procedures for compilation of monetary program data, and (ii) adopting an action plan for
establishing RBF capacity to prepare IFRS financial statements.
XI.
Resident Representative: The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific
Islands based in Suva, Fiji was opened on September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji,
Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr. Yongzheng Yang is the resident representative.

5
ANNEX II. FIJI: WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of December 31, 2010)
The Bank and Fund country teams led by Ms. Rosa Alonso I Terme (World Bank Task Team
Leader, Public Service Reform), Mr. Vivek Suri (World Bank Lead Economist, East Asia and
the Pacific) and Mr. Jonathan Dunn (IMF Mission Chief for Fiji) maintain a close working
relationship and have an ongoing dialog on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
Cooperation over the past year has included World Bank participation in the 2009 Article IV and
April 2010 SBA negotiation missions and overlap (separate Bank missions on public service
reform) with the April 2010 SBA negotiation mission and September 2010 IMF staff visit to Fiji.
The Bank’s participation facilitated discussions with the authorities in the areas of public service,
public financial management, and land reforms.
The Bank and Fund teams agree that Fiji's main macroeconomic challenges are to put
government finances on a sustainable path to reduce Fiji’s public debt-to-GDP ratio and help
safeguard external stability, and to address structural obstacles that are impeding growth. The
Bank and Fund share the view that the following structural reforms are important to achieve the
above objectives and are therefore deemed macro-critical:


Civil service reform. A well-designed civil service reform would identify non-core
service areas that could be privatized or outsourced to help rationalize public sector
employment. Initial steps would include freezing wages and limiting hiring to key
positions such as IT and HR pending an audit of civil service positions to identify overall
government employment needs. Other key steps include establishing control over civil
service payroll and hiring procedures and, if needed, designing adequate redundancy
packages to facilitate the right-sizing of government.



Public enterprise reform. The Fiji Sugar Corporation needs to be restructured and
returned to profitability, and wide ranging sugar sector reforms need to be implemented
to make the sugar industry viable. Tariffs for electricity and other goods and services
provided by public enterprises should be raised to full cost recovery levels. FNPF should
be made actuarially sound, including through reducing the conversion rates of benefits to
annuities, limiting non-pension withdrawals and increasing the independence of FNPF’s
management. These reforms will help reduce the government’s direct and contingent
liabilities and help ensure fiscal sustainability and promote growth. Poor performance on
the part of FSC has already created a large burden on the budget and significantly
reduced Fiji’s growth, highlighting the need for urgent and credible reforms in the sugar
sector.



Review of the social safety net. Fiji’s social safety net needs to be reviewed to reduce
inefficiencies and enhance protection of the most vulnerable segments of the population.
A stronger safety net will help to ensure the success of Fiji’s reform agenda.

6


Tax policy and administration reform. VAT and income tax legislation should be
strengthened and simplified to increase efficiency and broaden the tax base. This should
include eliminating tax holidays, removing most tax exemptions, and introducing a
simplified investment allowance scheme. Tax administration reforms will improve
compliance and taxpayer services. These reforms should increase revenue and reduce
discretion, thereby helping to achieve fiscal consolidation and to improve the business
climate and prospects for growth. Fiji continues to benefit greatly from TA in this area
provided by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) located in Suva.



Debt management. Debt management procedures should be followed strictly and Fiji
should develop a debt-management strategy to prevent a rapid build-up of public debt.



Land reform. Land leases should be redesigned and procedures for the use of land as
collateral need to be streamlined. Land reform is critical for Fiji’s growth prospects and
economic diversification.



Strengthening statistical capacity and statistics. Fiji should ensure that it continues to
develop personnel with the capacity to produce accurate and timely economic statistics.
Good statistics are important both for macro policy formulation and good public financial
management (e.g. establishment payroll and wage bill control). Fiji continues to benefit
from a broad range of statistical advice from PFTAC.

The Bank and Fund teams agreed to continue close collaboration going forward. Appendix I
details those activities that the Bank and Fund will work on over the coming year. The teams
agreed, in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), that the AsDB will lead on
public enterprise reform and analysis of the social safety net in connection with the possible
reform of the sugar industry.

ANNEX III: FIJI—RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
CENTRE1
(As of December 31, 2010)
Public Financial Management
PFM TA to Fiji has mainly focused on accounting and control based, in part on a 2006 PFTAC
review of Treasury operations that provided advice on the appropriate structure, functions and
accounting procedures, as well as interim measures for strengthening internal controls. This has
been supplement by a scoping study on Accrual Accounting in September 2009, following which
a consultant worked, in November 2009, on the next steps to improve IPSAS based cash
accounting, before moving toward accrual accounting. The consultant further worked on this
issue in September 2010 as a result of which, for the first time, Fiji’s IPSAS based cash accounts
shall be submitted to the Auditor General by mid-December 2010. Fiji also requested a review of
their IFMIs system and this is being undertaken in December 2010.
In addition, a peripatetic consultant assisted the government in 2006 to set up a system of
Performance Budgeting, and this work was continued in 2007 and 2008 by the PFTAC PFM
Advisor. A short-term mission to develop staff capacity in Debt Strategy and Sustainability
Analysis was undertaken in July–August 2007. In addition, the PFTAC Advisor conducts regular
monthly training courses in PFM for the staff of the Budget Division. Permanent Secretary
Finance also participated in the PFTAC organized study visit to the US Treasury, in August 2008.
A Fiji participant attended the two-week PFM program in September 2009, organized by PFTAC
in India.
Tax Administration and Policy
In March 2008, FAD recommended changes to FIRCAs (Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs
Authority) operations, i.e., reorganize core tax and customs functions; review all tax procedures,
especially the burdensome assessment regime; develop effective business processes; customs to
develop a comprehensive reform plan and review business processes under the new
organizational proposals; increase and unify the VAT threshold; and strengthen audits.
FIRCA have adopted all but a few of the recommendations. Terms of reference for the
implementation have been finalized and steering committee and project teams formed. PFTAC has
provided assistance to review the business processes and identify process enhancements. PFTAC
has also assisted with development of a new corporate plan incorporating implementation of the new
business processes and modernization of the income tax legislation. The rewritten income tax

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The
Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu.

8
legislation, drafted with PFTAC assistance, and will include self-assessment principles and make
PAYE a final tax. The IMF Legal has provided assistance to review and modernize the VAT
legislation.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In 2008, TA in respect of supervision of the national provident fund was provided by MCM. In
September 2009, RBF hosted a regional training seminar by STA on Financial Soundness
Indicators and reporting requirements under the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
In March 2009, RBF and PFTAC hosted a regional training seminar by MCM on Stress Testing
and in October 2010 participated in a regional training seminar organized by the Advisor on
Liquidity Risk in Banking Operations.
Recently, assistance to the RBF has been provided through its participation in AFSPC activities,
for which the Advisor serves as Secretariat. As a result of the RBF’s participation in the June
2010 meeting of the AFSPC working group to standardize prudential returns, the Advisor
provided recommendations to the RBF for strengthening prudential bank reporting requirements.
Additionally, the RBF was an active participant in the October 2010 annual meeting of the
AFSPC, which included training presentations on Basel III and the possible implications for the
Pacific, and supervisory cost recovery schemes being used by PIC supervisory authorities.
Macroeconomic Frameworks
In December 2009, PFTAC provided assistance to the RBF on reform of monetary policy
operations and the exchange rate arrangement. PFTAC’s new macroeconomic advisor is following
up with assistance in building forecasting and financial programming techniques in RBF.
Economic and Financial Statistics
GDDS metadata for Fiji, prepared with assistance from PFTAC, are posted on the IMF website. A
multi-year action plan developed in 2002 was reviewed and updated in early 2008, to strengthen
both the organization and content of statistics. In response to subsequent requests by the
authorities, assistance has been, and will continue to be, provided to assist the transition of balance
of payments (BOP), government finance, monetary and national accounts statistics to the latest
international standards, and to improve the quality of these statistics. During 2007 and early 2008 a
series of STA expert missions focused on strengthening monetary and financial statistics.
The PFTAC Advisor and experts have undertaken 11 missions since 2008 to assist in improving
balance of payments, national accounts, and prices statistics. As a result, the Fiji Islands Bureau
of Statistics has recently released quarterly BOP estimates up to September 2009 and annual
international investment position statistics. The coverage and quality of national accounts
estimates have been significantly improved and constant price estimates have been rebased to
2005 prices. Work has also begun on developing quarterly GDP estimates and an expenditure
measure of GDP. The CPI has been rebased to 2005, an imports’ prices survey has been
implemented to begin compiling import price indexes and development of producer price
indexes is underway.

9
ANNEX IV: FIJI—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2010)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved 18 loans totaling $303.6 million. The
AsDB has approved 80 TA projects, totaling $27.0 million since 1970. AsDB opened a Pacific
sub-regional office in Suva in June 2004, servicing Fiji Islands and five other Pacific nations.
Following the military coup of December 2006, AsDB’s disbursements and TA operations
were suspended. In April 2007, AsDB adopted an Approach to Reengagement for Fiji Islands
which allows for the completion of activities ongoing at the time of the December 2006 coup,
but not approval of a new country partnership strategy or new operations until Management
judges that five criteria have been met. While three criteria have clearly been met, the stance of
some AsDB member countries towards the government and Fiji Islands’ suspension from the
Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth remain problematic. Periodic reports, to update
AsDB’s Board on the evolving situation in the country, are prepared in line with the Approach
to Reengagement.
ADB has three ongoing loan projects—two that were ongoing at the time of the 2006 coup and
one, Emergency Flood Recovery Project for $17.5 million, was approved in 2009 as an
exception to the Approach to Reengagement. Supplementary financing for the Third Fiji Road
Upgrading Project ($26.8 million) and the Suva-Nausori Water Supply and Sanitation Project
($23.0 million) was approved in 2009. The implementation of all three projects is proceeding
satisfactorily with the road and water/sanitation projects expected to be substantially complete
by end 2012. The flood recovery loan is also expected to be completed by 2012. Opportunities
for private sector operations continue to be considered. Fiji Islands has continued to benefit
from a limited amount of regional technical assistance (TA) on a case-by-case basis, but there
are no ongoing country program TAs.
AsDB undertook a review of country portfolio performance in 2010. While AsDB-financed
projects have not experienced significant counterpart resource constraints to date, the
sustainability of the absorptive capacity of various government agencies particularly as a result
of the migration of skilled staff to implement programs is a long-term concern.
When the conditions for reengagement are in place, a Country Partnership Strategy will be
prepared with Government. Future operations would likely include areas where there is a clear
poverty alleviation focus, both within AsDB’s traditional sectors of assistance in Fiji Islands
and also in relevant areas prioritized under AsDB’s Strategy 2020. Grant co-financing and
capacity building technical assistance are also likely to play important roles in any future
strategy.

ANNEX V: FIJI—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 31, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, especially GDP and balance of
payments data, core economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate
for surveillance. Macroeconomic data are slowly improving, owing in part to the
considerable technical assistance provided by the Fund and PFTAC in recent years.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the
Monthly Economic Review. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (BoS) publishes a quarterly Current
Economic Statistics and a monthly Statistical News. The Ministry of Finance and National
Planning (MoF) issues the Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address on an
annual basis. All of these publications are received by APD on a regular basis.
Formal participation in the GDDS commenced on May 9, 2000, marked by the posting of the
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata were last
updated in November 2002. The country has maintained its commitment to use the GDDS as
a framework for statistical development.
National Accounts: Production-side estimates of GDP at current and constant prices are
available up to 2009. Revised data were published in September 2010 using the 2002
Household Income and Expenditure Survey, a new business census, and estimates of the
informal sector. Expenditure-side GDP data in constant prices are not available and
expenditure-side GDP data in current prices are only available through 2005. In addition,
GDP broken down by income is only available through 2005.
Price statistics: The BoS is updating the CPI weights from the current 1993 base using
results of the 2002 Household Expenditure and Income survey. There have been persistent
difficulties in compiling export and import unit value indexes, mainly due to lack of
continuity that resulted from a switch to ASYCUDA for customs processing late in 1999.
The BoS plans to re-introduce trade price indexes with a starting period of 2002 (to coincide
with the new benchmark year for national accounts).
Government finance statistics: Public debt data remain weak. Following a PFTAC
supervised project, reporting of data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
(GFS) Yearbook has resumed. Data include a statement of sources and uses of cash for
budgetary central government, subdivisions of receipts and payments by economic category
and outlays by function. Data for 2006 in the format of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 are available. Some inconsistencies remain between the GFS data and fiscal
data provided to APD, especially in the areas of nontax revenue, wages and salaries, other

11
purchases of goods and services, and subsidies and transfers. Other problem areas include a
lack of transparency in budget reporting, with some agencies outside the budget, including
the Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority; and an absence of published updates on the
budget outcome and financing sources.
Monetary statistics: Data on the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks are
comprehensive and provided to APD and STA on a regular and timely basis. Data on
nonbank financial institutions, including the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), are less
regular, timely, and reliable. With FNPF representing a large part of the financial sector, the
unavailability of a consolidated financial survey hampers economic and financial analysis.
The RBF is in the process of broadening its monetary survey into a depository corporations
survey and compiling a financial survey that covers nonbank financial institutions. A
November 2005 expert mission, during a PFTAC monetary statistics workshop, reviewed the
compilation procedures and provided training and a work plan for the RBF to comply with
the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and to report using the
standardized report forms (SRFs). A follow-up February 2008 mission provided advice on
introducing the SRFs and developing an integrated monetary database that will meet the data
needs of the RBF, APD, and STA.
Balance of payments: The BoS is nearing the end of a major PFTAC assisted project to
compile new balance of payments data and revise historical data back to 2000 consistent with
the IMF Balance of Payments Manual (fifth edition). Revised annual balance of payments
data were published in June 2010 that significantly reduced errors and omissions in 2008
from over 10 percent of GDP to about 6 percent of GDP. Initial estimates of quarterly
balance of payments data and the annual investment position were also published in June
2010. A separate project to publish data on international trade in services is also nearing
completion, while technical assistance to address problems in the capital and financial
accounts will start shortly. Balance of payments data for the period up to end-2006 were
reported to the Statistics Department for publication in the 2007 Balance of Payments
Yearbook. Problems remain in the measurement of external debt, due to the absence of a
consistent framework and insufficient coordination between the RBF, the BoS, and the MoF.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Fiji
On February 2, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Fiji on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Background
Economic growth in Fiji has been negative or low for four years. This is in part due to the weak
domestic investment climate that results from delays in structural reforms, an increase in
exchange restrictions and price controls, the decline of the sugar industry, and political
uncertainty. Fiji’s economy contracted by 3 percent in 2009 and marginal growth is estimated for
2010. The 2010 improvement is based on tourism rebounding on the strength of regional
economies and the ongoing competitive gain secured through the April 2009 devaluation.
Exports and investment driven by resource extraction are showing positive signs, though growth
in these areas is from a small base. Growth is projected at 1 to 2 percent over the medium term
in the absence of structural reforms and other measures to improve the investment climate.
Inflation is projected to fall to 3 percent over the medium term in the weak growth environment.
Without fiscal consolidation and stronger growth public debt will remain high and Fiji will not
have the fiscal space it needs to respond to shocks.
Foreign exchange reserves have improved steadily following the April 2009 devaluation and
stood at just over 4 months of imports at end 2010. Reserves have, however, been supported
by exchange restrictions. The real effective exchange rate has remained stable. After rising
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees
that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
through mid-2010, inflation—inclusive of two electricity tariff increases—moderated to
4.0 percent (year on year) by late 2010 due to sluggish demand and steady international
commodity prices. Price controls imposed on many food products since 2009 have likely
contributed to low inflation.
The fiscal deficit is estimated to have fallen to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2010 from 3.9 percent of
GDP in 2009. This reduction resulted from a public hiring freeze (other than for some key areas),
lower-than-budgeted capital spending, and stronger-than-projected VAT receipts. The losses and
mismanagement of the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) have led to pressures on the budget. The
deficit was financed mostly by the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) as commercial banks
remained near their sovereign lending limits. Central government debt at end-2010 is estimated
at close to 56 percent of GDP. Contingent fiscal liabilities are estimated at 17.6 percent of GDP
at end 2010 and include guarantees on bonds issued by Fiji Development Bank. On November
26, 2010, the authorities announced a 2011 budget with a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP.3
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) relaxed interest controls in the beginning of 2010 by removing
ceilings on bank lending rates (though banks still must justify deposit-lending rate spreads
greater than 4 percent). In response, average deposit and lending rates rose marginally. The
government re-established variable rate auctions for government securities in May 2010.
Government borrowing costs have risen as banks and the FNPF can now better price risk.
Banks report limited lending opportunities due to the weak investment climate, and credit growth
has been modest. Banks’ excess liquidity has increased to 12 percent of deposits in recent
months, much of it attributable to the lack of lending and investment opportunities for banks and
exchange restrictions preventing or delaying outflows.
On the structural front, the government is drawing up a detailed plan to revive the FSC and the
sugar industry. A land bank has been established to increase security of land leases as part of
an overall effort to encourage investment and job creation. Significant progress has been made
in SOE reforms, including adjustments to electricity tariffs to increase cost recovery and the
establishment of a water authority. A functional review of public service positions is under way,
as is the adoption of a performance-based remuneration system. However, wide-spread price
controls have continued and, in some cases, they have intensified in recent months.
Executive Board Assessment
On February 2, 2011, the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with
Fiji and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.
Fiji faces difficult challenges to break away from its low growth of the past decade. There are
encouraging signs of recovery, but stronger, sustained growth would require a more favorable
investment climate that can materialize only through continued structural reforms and the
removal of administrative controls. There are a number of downside risks to the growth outlook.
3

This corresponds to the staff’s projected 2011 budget deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP, which excludes
privatization receipts from revenue and makes adjustments in customs revenue estimates.

3
Public debt and contingent liabilities are equivalent to 74 percent of GDP and limit the fiscal
space Fiji should reserve to respond to frequent shocks. Volatile commodity prices, increasing
reliance on tourism, risk of natural disasters and some uncertainty about external financing
represent significant vulnerabilities. Investor interest is likely to remain subdued in the presence
of exchange and price controls and continued political uncertainty.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate. High excess liquidity in the banking system
reflects the weak economic environment and exchange restrictions. Monetary policy should be
gradually tightened if core inflation rises or a return of confidence leads to strong credit growth.
Restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends should be relaxed to build investor
confidence.
The 2011 budget deficit falls short of the effort needed to bring public debt below 50 percent of
GDP in the medium term. The authorities are to be commended for the bold revenue measures
in the 2011 budget. If these are complemented by ambitious civil service and public enterprise
reform Fiji will move towards fiscal sustainability.
Public enterprise and FNPF reform will bolster fiscal sustainability. The fiscal risk of supporting
public enterprises has been made clear by FSC. The government should move quickly to
finalize the FSC restructuring plan and the company should be divested within the next three
years. FNPF reforms should be completed in 2011.
Fiji should adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime to help absorb shocks and protect
reserves. An appropriate first step would be to move to an exchange rate band of ±2–3 percent
around the current rate. This should be supported by strong fiscal adjustment, prudent monetary
policy, and continued interest rate flexibility. The independence of the RBF should be
strengthened and changes to the RBF Act recommended in the recent safeguards assessment
should be implemented.
Recent RBF action to strengthen bank supervision is welcome but further steps toward riskbased supervision are needed. Stress tests should be conducted and reviewed with banks more
frequently and the RBF should make greater use of credit-analysis data available from large
banks.
Structural reforms are necessary to spur growth and would help protect macroeconomic
stability. Well-designed land reform and the removal of price controls should support investment
and the diversification of economic activity. Civil service reform and adjusting tariffs for public
services will help contain contingent liabilities and should increase efficiency. The social impact
of redundancies and higher tariffs can be addressed through retraining programs and additional
targeted social assistance. Fiji should seek support from development partners, including
technical and expert advice, to help design and implement these important structural reforms,
which are critical to improving the overall business environment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued
after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case.
