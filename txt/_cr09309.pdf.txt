Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with the Solomon Islands
Approved by Subir Lall and Dominique Desruelle
September 21, 2009


Consultation: The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with the Solomon
Islands were held in Honiara July 20–29, 2009. The staff team comprised David
Cowen (Head), Kiichi Tokuoka, Li Zeng (all APD), and Milo Lucich (Asian
Development Bank). Raynold Moveni (Advisor, OED) also attended the meetings.
The team met with Central Bank of Solomon Islands Governor Denton Rarawa,
Minister of Finance and Treasury Snyder Rini, Minister of Development Planning
and Aid Coordination Steve Abana, other senior officials, and donor and private
sector representatives. Staff worked with the World Bank on a debt sustainability
analysis, with the Asian Development Bank also collaborating.



Past surveillance and advice: In recent consultations, the IMF and authorities
have agreed on the broad priority and direction of policies. Since the 2008 Article
IV consultation, monetary policy has been conducted in line with staff
recommendations, but budget execution and cash management remain concerns.
On the exchange rate, only modestly greater flexibility has been allowed. However,
in the area of financial sector oversight, timely improvements have been made.



Exchange rate system: The Solomon Islands accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 in 1979 and maintains an exchange system that
is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The exchange rate arrangement is currently classified as an other
managed arrangement.



Economic statistics: Progress is being made in upgrading the statistical
framework, but further improvements are necessary to ensure effective surveillance
(Annex V). Monetary and balance of payments statistics are being standardized.
However, fiscal data still lack coverage of provincial governments. Further work is
needed in producing reliable national income accounts, following a major revision,
and a monthly nationwide consumer price index should be compiled.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Economic performance has weakened in 2009, given the global recession and the logging sector’s
decline, which have weighed heavily on exports and growth. Real GDP growth is projected at 0.4 percent
in 2009, compared to 6.9 percent in 2008. With lower fuel and food prices and tightening liquidity
conditions, inflation pressures have eased considerably. The lower cost of commodity imports is also
expected to lead to a reduction in the external current account deficit in 2009, more than offsetting projected
declines in export volume and prices—notably timber and copra. However, with net external inflows
slowing, reserves are projected to decline modestly.
Growth hinges on maintaining macroeconomic stability, developing basic infrastructure, and
undertaking structural reforms, including on land issues. Over the next few years, given a likely further
drop in logging output, the recovery in exports and growth is expected to be slow and also depends on the
start of new mining activity. Increasing the Solomon Islands’ competitiveness and diversifying the
production base are also essential to reducing fiscal and external vulnerabilities.
Key policy issues and recommendations
Discussions focused on the policy framework needed to strengthen the fiscal and external positions, ensure
financial sector soundness, and restore supportive growth conditions. Staff and the authorities broadly
agreed on the near to medium-term outlook, but views differed on the pace and scope of fiscal and exchange
rate adjustment.
Fiscal policy: In view of the government’s weak cash position and existing borrowing constraints, a
combination of discretionary revenue and spending measures and structural fiscal reforms is needed to
bolster tax collections, slow recurrent expenditure growth, and adequately fund development outlays.
However, the authorities saw resources as adequate for implementing the 2009 budget and necessitating only
modest fiscal tightening next year, despite cash pressures. Given near - to medium-term prospects, staff
viewed new external assistance in the form of budget support as providing a cushion for undertaking more
lasting fiscal adjustment and improving budget execution.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: With inflation falling and liquidity tightening, a more accommodative
monetary stance is appropriate. Further development of the central bank’s liquidity management operations
as currently envisaged is necessary to contain liquidity risks, foster interbank activity, and ultimately improve
monetary controls. Given signs of overvaluation and expected reserve losses, staff urged pursuit of a more
flexible exchange rate policy. However, the authorities did not see exchange rate movements as immediately
easing external pressures, viewing the current managed arrangement as an effective nominal anchor.
Financial sector and other reforms: Timely efforts aimed at fortifying the bank supervisory framework
and enhancing monitoring and oversight should help strengthen controls and manage risks, as necessary, to
deal effectively with the fallout of the growth slowdown. Accelerating improvements in the operational and
financial performance of state enterprises will also assist in reducing fiscal risks. Further trade, investment,
and land reforms should be aimed at attracting new foreign investment and promoting conditions for
broader-based and sustained growth.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
The focus of the 2009 Article IV consultation was on the challenging period that lies ahead for
the Solomon Islands’ economy. Economic developments are being driven by weak external conditions,
declining timber production, and an uncertain policy environment, which threaten to undermine recent
stability gains and increase external vulnerability. To the country’s credit, resiliency has been a hallmark of
the Solomon Islands in response to previous setbacks, as evidenced by recent robust growth following unrest
earlier in the decade. However, in the face of current adversity, further resolve will be needed to restore
favorable growth conditions and maintain a stable macroeconomic environment.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The effects of the ongoing global recession and depleted forestry reserves are weighing heavily
on export earnings and growth prospects. Following a record harvest in 2008, logging (60 percent of
exports) now appears to be entering a period of irreversible decline due to overexploitation, with lower timber
exports and taxable prices also leading to fiscal revenue losses.1 Lower commodity prices have also dragged
down rural incomes. Fisheries production is expected to remain flat, owing to weaker external demand and
still modest sector investment (Box 1).
Box 1. Solomon Islands—Recent Changes to the National Accounts
Since the 2008 Article IV consultation, the authorities have adopted significant revisions to
the national accounts data dating back to 2003. The National Statistics Office (NSO), with
assistance from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC), has produced new
constant and current price estimates of GDP by economic classification and expenditure share.
These estimates, published by the NSO as a new series for 2003–06, have led to an increase in
nominal GDP by 30–40 percent compared to the old series. National accounts data used in this
report are based on the published series and growth estimates produced by the Central Bank of
Solomon Islands for 2007 and 2008.
Changes in the compilation of national accounts have focused on several key activities not
fully captured in previous estimates. The revisions come from two main sources. First, efforts
have been made to more precisely capture household and informal activities, in particular those in
the agricultural sector. These changes are now reflected in the published series. Second, recent
PFTAC assistance has focused on producing more accurate estimates for public administration and
defense, using data from the government’s development budget, although series including this set
of changes have not yet been published.

1

The current outlook, in line with that of the authorities, is for logging output to decline from 1.5 million cubic meters
in 2008 to 1.1 million cubic meters in 2009, and by another 20 percent a year in 2010 and 2011, with an even more
rapid pace of decline thereafter.

On the positive side, inflation
pressures have eased considerably
with lower food and fuel prices.
Headline inflation was 5½ percent
(y/y) in June, down from a peak of
25 percent in mid-2008, and is
expected to be at about the same level
at end-2009.

However, in 2009, growth is projected
to be only 0.4 percent, or around
3¾ percent excluding logging—about
half the rate of the previous year. Aside
from problems in the timber sector and
the fall in commodity prices, major
floods in early 2009 have adversely
affected agricultural output, with
El Niño conditions also possibly
constraining sector growth this year
and next. Combined with tighter credit
conditions, domestic demand is
expected to be less supportive in 2009.

Boosted by timber exports, real
GDP growth was an estimated
6.9 percent in 2008 (Table 1),
driven also by strong demand and
record prices for palm oil and
copra and a healthy rise in tourism
and trading activity. Compared to
other countries in the region and
relative to earlier years, signs of
strain began to emerge in the
Solomon Islands in
2008 (Figure 1), as evidenced by
relatively high inflation, a weak
external current account, and
falling reserve cover.

currencies in the basket peg,
the real effective exchange
rate has appreciated by about
20 percent (between April
2008 and May 2009), raising
competitiveness concerns
and possibly putting pressure
on the balance of payments.

In light of the slowdown,
the fiscal position will likely
weaken in 2009, with possible
financing constraints, following
comparatively strong
performance in 2008. The overall
fiscal balance is expected to slip
into a deficit (including grants) of
around 0.4 percent of GDP in
2009, against an estimated surplus
of 1.5 percent of GDP last year
(Table 3).

A more supportive fiscal stance
was targeted in 2009 with the

declining tax revenues and weak
spending controls have led to
periodic cash shortages,
hampering effective fiscal
operations. In response, the
government took measures in
April to conserve cash, led by a
10 percent cut in nonessential
recurrent outlays and freeze on
civil service hires. 3 Select import
duties and excises also were
increased and tax and customs
exemptions were tightened.
Subsequently, cuts were made in

response to looser conditions prevailing

7.5 percent last November. To help better
manage liquidity conditions, the CBSI
also introduced a Secured Advance
Facility (SAF) in late 2008—timely given

Included were increases in rural livelihood constituency grants for members of parliament to spend in their home

Under the HCA, the Solomon Islands was provided debt rescheduling and relief by a group of major creditors
(Australia, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and International Fund for Agriculture
Development) in 2007. In exchange, the government is expected to refrain from new external borrowing and pursue
grant financing and ODA only until it achieves “green light status” under IDA’s debt distress ratings system. Following
the 2004 domestic debt restructuring and a settling of expenditure arrears, new domestic borrowing has been limited by
ongoing efforts by the central government to strengthen debt management.

10
support in the banking system. 6 A new liquidity forecasting framework was also introduced at the
CBSI in mid-2009, with IMF technical assistance.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Under the current baseline, growth is expected to remain below recent trend over the
next few years. For 2010, real GDP is projected to expand by around 2½ percent (Table 5),
supported by moderately improving conditions in China, Korea, and other major East Asian
trading partners; increased palm oil and rebounding copra production; and new foreign direct
investment (FDI) in mining and telecommunications. 7 Greater air carrier competition between the
Solomon Islands and Australia has lowered ticket costs significantly, which should give tourism a
boost along with further investment in this sector. However, declining logging and ancillary
activity—in 2010 and beyond—would continue acting as a drag on income and employment,
fiscal revenues, and export receipts. Starting in 2012, large-scale gold production is expected to
boost growth significantly. 8
6.
In view of these conditions, the fiscal position and external current account could
come under more strain over the next several years, putting pressure on foreign reserves.
Under this baseline, the current account deficit would widen starting in 2010, given further
expected declines in timber exports and a projected rise in the oil import bill. New capital imports
associated with mining, telecommunications, and potentially large-scale agricultural and fisheries
projects would also widen the deficit, although these would be financed largely by FDI and/or
official inflows. Still, without additional external financing, reserves are projected to fall to the
equivalent of 1.2 months of the following year’s imports by end-2011. Even with gold exports
from 2012, the external current account deficit will likely remain at an elevated level given the
large import requirement of new nickel mining operations, now expected to commence by middecade. Risks would remain to the downside, namely stemming from a possible prolonged global
downturn, delays in mining production, and further policy slippages. Complicating planned
investment projects could be continued uncertainty about land tenure and access, commodity price
volatility, and financing availability. On the upside, government capacity building, improved
basic infrastructure, and streamlined investment regulations could be offsetting factors.

6

The SAF provides eligible banks a seven-day advance (with possible rollover), against which banks must pledge
restructured government bonds as collateral. In addition to this new standing credit facility, the CBSI still maintains the
Bokolo deposit facility for 1–2 year deposits.

7

A Telecommunications Bill was approved in August 2009, which opens mobile services to competition in 2010 and
internet services in 2011.

8

Australian Solomons Gold Limited is undertaking a US$134 million rehabilitation of the GoldRidge mine, with
co-financing from the European Investment Bank and International Finance Corporation. Based on current plans, staff
expect the mine to produce an average of 120,000 troy ounces of gold a year during 2012 to 2018.

11
7.
Based on this outlook, large and potentially destabilizing macroeconomic imbalances
could emerge, necessitating sizable policy adjustment, as well as new exceptional financing.
Specifically, they are:


A budget financing gap equivalent to 4 percent of GDP a year (around US$25 million in
2009), based on the fiscal policy response needed to build up minimal government cash
reserves to two months of recurrent and domestically financed development spending and
avoid potentially debilitating spending cuts, backed by additional budget support.



An external financing gap averaging around US$25 million a year, arising from the
adjustment and financing needed to maintain gross reserves to the equivalent of three
months of prospective nonmining-related imports—a modest level in view of the Solomon
Islands’ vulnerability to shocks and current risk factors.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Policy discussions focused on actions needed to ensure fiscal sustainability, contain
external vulnerability, and generate sustained high growth. There was broad agreement on the
near to medium-term outlook, but views differed on the pace and scope of actions needed to
strengthen the fiscal position and on the role of the exchange rate in facilitating adjustment.
A. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
9.
The authorities recognized the worsening fiscal situation, with staff urging a cohesive
strategy for easing the cash constraint, including pursuit of possible new budget support. In
the authorities’ view, measures already in place were seen as providing adequate resources for
executing the 2009 budget, as amended. Staff supported cuts in recurrent spending given its
unchecked growth in recent budgets, but noted a rollback in development outlays could be
destabilizing. In addition, the authorities were urged to raise the taxable price of logs, 9 scale back
new parliamentary entitlements, and further reduce nonessential recurrent spending, including on
government travel. Carryover restraints were also recommended in 2010, in addition to pursuing
further budget support—all essential to building up minimal cash reserves, regularizing budgetary
operations, and providing breathing space to implement ongoing structural fiscal reforms.
10.
On the 2010 budget, staff noted a tighter fiscal stance would be necessary to solidify
the cash position, avoid spending arrears, and restore budget credibility. To this end, the
authorities were urged to target an overall surplus of at least 1½–2 percent of GDP in next year’s
budget. However, under current policies and based on existing donor commitments, staff
projected the overall surplus would likely reach only around 0.8 percent of GDP in 2010. In the

9

As in recent consultations, the authorities expressed reluctance to raise the determined price of logs for taxation
purposes using an automatic mechanism. By staff estimates, an increase in the determined price of logs by an average of
US$25 per cubic meter could raise revenue by 1 percent of GDP a year.

12
event, staff noted the government would face a high risks of cash shortages in the upcoming fiscal
year, necessitating an even tighter hold on nonessential recurrent spending to avoid crowding out
government-funded development spending and further placing an economic recovery at risk. Under this
and even more optimistic scenarios (e.g., logging revenue remains constant as a share of GDP), further
external assistance would likely be necessary. In response, the authorities saw improved tax and customs
administration as providing a substantial revenue boost in 2010, with further buoyancy coming from an
anticipated recovery. At the same time, they acknowledged spending pressures were already emerging
associated with the 2010 elections. In view of recent high inflation, civil service wages hikes could add
further pressure.
11.
There was general agreement that medium-term fiscal sustainability requires steady
progress on reforms to strengthen the revenue base and improve budget execution. Staff urged these
efforts be underpinned by a medium-term budget framework, which would need to target expenditure
smoothing during the transition period from logging to mining revenues (Box 2). This framework would
be anchored by targeting a low to moderate overall surplus (including grants), given limited domestic
financing options and foreign financing constraints. To this end, the authorities noted work under way to
improve medium-term revenue forecasting.
12.
With respect to increasing fiscal revenue, efforts focus on broadening the tax base, curtailing
the use of exemptions, and improving tax and customs administration. Priorities on inland revenue
include expanding taxpayer registration and further reducing tax arrears, but the authorities acknowledged
more resources were needed for auditing and record keeping to improve compliance. Over time, they
noted a value-added tax would be considered, as part of efforts to expand the revenue base and ease the
burden imposed by the existing GST on final producers. On customs administration, in addition to further
reductions in discretionary exemptions, projects are underway aimed at strengthening inspection
procedures, implementing WTO valuations, and introducing post-clearance audits. A Customs Valuation
Bill approved in August 2009 is expected to support these efforts, in part by increasing penalties for
evasion of duties. Staff also urged the authorities to ensure that an internationally accepted tax regime was
in place for the emerging mining sector, given the need to develop new sources of fiscal revenue and at the
same time ensure sound resource management, with possible IMF technical assistance in this area.
13.
To strengthen expenditure control, public financial management reforms aim to improve
cash management, budget integration, and accounting and audit functions. Plans are underway to
formulate a cash flow forecasting model, fully implement new payroll and accounting systems, and
integrate cash and debt management. Ongoing government audits of line ministries’ accounts will be used
to help strengthen accounting and internal control functions. A debt management strategy, centralized
recording system, and proper accounting for treasury bills could facilitate future government borrowing, as
conditions allow.
14.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that the Solomon Islands would continue
to face moderate risk of debt distress. Under the framework of the HCA, public debt has declined
significantly in recent years, equivalent to 32 percent of GDP at end-2008. In the baseline, all debt

Box 2. Solomon Islands—Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook and Policy Credibility
The Solomon Islands’ fiscal performance has been relatively strong in recent years, supported by both robust
economic growth and improved revenue administration. Since 2008, however, fiscal pressures have emerged. As a
result, the government faces a severe cash constraint, reinforced by its pledge under the Honiara Club Agreement to
restrict official borrowing in exchange for significant debt relief.
Under the current baseline, potentially large budgetary financing gaps could emerge the next several years,
even assuming modest resumption of external

As an alternative, the adjustment scenario
would be underpinned by a more robust
policy framework, targeting more ambitious
tax measures and public financial
management reforms than currently
envisaged. This framework would be expected to
draw in additional donor assistance, including
new budget support, and eventually enable the
government to borrow abroad more aggressively
for development expenditure. Policy adjustment
would also give rise to a faster accumulation of
cash reserves.



Current rules restricting external and domestic borrowing have been effective in lowering debt service payments.
However, they may act to excessively constrain fiscal policy by counteracting automatic stabilizers. Moreover,
when revenue shortfalls are substantial, these rules could press the government to reduce its own outlays in
essential areas such as health and education and for development spending.



As fiscal and debt management strengthens, the government may wish to consider adopting more
flexible rules and anchor them with a medium-term budget framework. Experience elsewhere suggests
that credible fiscal rules can alleviate potential debt bias and time inconsistency problems.
Theoretically, a sophisticated target, such as a fiscal deficit as a share of GDP that varies in line with
the output gap, can help enforce fiscal discipline, while avoiding procyclicality often caused by a
simple rule (e.g., a fixed cap on the debt as a share of GDP, allowing the deficit to reach near the
ceiling in an economic boom).



A first step might be to design a simple target limiting the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) or to set caps
on major spending categories, given the source of past slippages and need for budget credibility. A
target on the fiscal balance excluding natural resource revenues, as recently adopted by Papua New
Guinea, may also be an option, given expected volatile timber-related and rising mining-related tax
receipts over the medium term.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
15.
With inflation pressures subsiding, the authorities agreed scope remained for
monetary easing. The CBSI already shifted to this bias earlier in 2009, as evidenced by modest
open market purchases from banks and some exchange rate depreciation. However, given few
monetary instruments, banks’ limited (i.e., government) debt holdings, and an already moderate
LAR, staff noted additional easing might come through foreign exchange operations. Staff
indicated that such operations would likely necessitate greater day-to-day movement in the
official exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, in part through a widening the daily trading band.
This could help shore up reserves and address a sizable overvaluation of the Solomon Islands
dollar (Box 3). The authorities noted banks were already required to sell foreign exchange to the CBSI
under current net open limits. 10 However, they were reluctant to make more fundamental moves given
concerns about the shallowness of the foreign exchange market and a view even a large change in the
exchange rate might not immediately ease balance of payments pressures, seeing the current managed
arrangement as an effective nominal anchor, notwithstanding recent high inflation.
16.
To improve monetary controls, the authorities were urged to develop new instruments and
strengthen the operational framework. In particular, with the standing (Bokolo) deposit facility offering
low yields and new government debt issuance constrained, banks appear in need of short-term obligations
to help manage liquidity. To this end, staff urged the issuance of short-term (e.g., 28-day) CBSI bills. Such
an instrument would give the CBSI a more effective tool for managing liquidity and help promote greater
interbank activity. Staff and the authorities agreed that the newly introduced SAF was an important tool for
providing temporary liquidity support, which along with better designed deposit facilities, could help guide

A limit on a bank’s overnight position of SI$5 million is currently imposed. Banks must either reduce the position in
the foreign exchange market or sell excess holdings to the CBSI.

Given recent large external imbalances and the
near-to-medium-term outlook, some further
depreciation of the SI$ vis-à-vis the US$ is justifiable.
Using the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (ERER)
approach, the assessment results suggest that the REER of
the Solomon Islands is currently overvalued by about
26 percent. The same holds using a modified
macroeconomic balance approach, where the impact of
REER on foreign reserves is gauged with a VAR model.
Here, the results imply that the SI$ is overvalued by
around 20 percent, that is, the adjustment needed in order
to maintain official foreign reserves at three month’s
coverage of prospective nonmining-related imports.

(2002 = 100)

Monthly percentage change

The recent REER appreciation can be decomposed
into (i) the SI$’s real appreciation vis-à-vis the US$
and (ii) the US$’s real appreciation relative to other
currencies in the basket peg arrangement. The first
component, largely driven by the Solomon Islands’ high
inflation relative to the United States, was a major factor
until mid-2008, when inflation pressures began to ease
with falling commodity prices. Since then, large swings in
US$ exchange rates vis-à-vis other currencies in the basket
have become the main reason behind the REER
appreciation. Since April 2008 the SI$ has appreciated by
5, 10, and 20 percent against the euro, Australian dollar,
and New Zealand dollar, respectively.

Solomon Islands: Nominal and Effective Exchange Rates, 2003–09

Jan-03

The exchange rate assessment points to a substantial
overvaluation of the Solomon Islands dollar (SI$).
These findings differ since the last assessment at the time
of the 2008 Article IV consultation, when the exchange
rate was found to be broadly in line with fundamentals.1
Following a period of relatively little change, the Solomon
Islands dollar depreciated by about 5 percent vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar (US$) in nominal terms between April
2008 and May 2009, but has since been mostly stable.
From the start of the same period through March 2009,
however, the real effective exchange rate (REER)
appreciated by about 25 percent.

Historical experience shows that the exchange rate can be used as an effective adjustment tool for the Solomon
Islands. While the authorities indicated concerns about the low elasticity of import demand, the results of this analysis suggest
that exchange rate adjustment tends to have a larger impact on exports than on imports, and thus could lead to improvements
in the country’s external balance. However, recognizing that in a small open economy the exchange rate cannot carry the full
burden of adjustment, progress in other areas is needed to strengthen competitiveness, such as improving transportation
infrastructure, lowering operating and borrowing costs, and implementing new streamlined business regulations.

market interest rates. Along with the new liquidity monitoring framework, more effective use of these
instruments in injecting and withdrawing liquidity could also help facilitate a move toward adopting
quantitative targets.
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the newly allocated SDRs by the IMF should be used to
boost foreign reserves, in view of mounting external pressures. However, given the near to
medium-term outlook and risks, these additional resources should be viewed as complementary to
necessary fiscal and external adjustment.
C. Financial Sector and Structural Issues
18.
The authorities have taken timely steps to strengthen the banking supervision framework,
but agreed risks lie ahead that bear close watch. They noted new prudential guidelines had been issued
addressing capital adequacy, asset classification and provisioning, and large credit exposure, which staff
welcomed. Stipulations in the new Secured Transaction Act also broaden the base of eligible collateral.
While the banking sector has been very profitable in recent years, staff cautioned that the recent uptick in
nonperforming loans (NPLs) and funding constraints suggest credit and liquidity risks are rising.11 The
government’s weak cash position may also be affecting borrowers’ ability to stay current with loans, which
staff urged be monitored closely. Going forward, with banks’ funding costs rising and limited fee-based
income, profits could come under pressure. If so, staff noted this could possibly limit banks’ ability to
provision for loan losses.
19.
In view of global financial conditions and the economic slowdown, the authorities agreed the
National Provident Fund (NPF) should continue to be monitored closely. In particular, staff urged the
NPF proceed cautiously with diversifying its balance sheet—both onshore and offshore—especially in
view of operating losses incurred recently, namely on overseas investment. In addition, members’ use of
own contributions as pledged collateral against real property would need to be watched closely by the NPF
to ensure this practice was limited to creditworthy borrowers.
Given the longstanding financial difficulties of state-owned enterprise (SOEs) and associated fiscal
risks, staff urged swift action to commercialize their operations. In preparation for this, external audits
of the large SOEs’ financial accounts have been completed through 2007. As audits of the 2008 and 2009
accounts become available and in view of the need to avoid cross-arrears with government, staff urged
SOEs proceed quickly into the strengthening phase of their reform program, which aims to improve record
keeping, accounting and control standards, and corporate governance. The authorities indicated that the
Ministry of Finance and Treasury’s new SOE monitoring unit would play a key role in assessing progress
in achieving these objectives, with a view to also guiding privatization decisions over the medium
term.
20.
The authorities noted progress made in other areas aimed at improving the
investment climate, but a number of challenges remain, especially on land issues. To help
11

17
streamline business formation and regulation, a new Companies Act and Companies (Insolvency
and Receivership) Act were approved in 2009. A legal framework to help guide investment in
transportation infrastructure was also established earlier this year with passage of the National
Transport Fund Act, which enables donors to set up funds for road and maritime projects. The
Solomon Islands completed its second World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Policy Review in
June 2009, highlighting progress made in reducing the level and dispersion of most favored nation
(MFN) applied tariffs, but also pointing to the need to comply fully with WTO binding
commitments and address the discriminatory application of certain internal taxes. On the other
hand, land reforms continue to proceed slowly. A Land Reform Unit (LRU), formed in 2007 to
guide government land policy, has yet to become fully operational. The Tribal Land Bill, which
aims to expedite resolution of land ownership to ease access for commercial purposes, has also
stalled following legal review, awaiting redrafting by the LRU.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Macroeconomic outlook: The effects of the global recession and depleted forestry
reserves are weighing heavily on export earnings and growth prospects. With little growth
expected in 2009 and only modest recovery the next few years, the overall fiscal position and
external current account could come under more strain, putting pressure on foreign reserves. Over
the medium term, with new mining operations expected to come on stream by 2012, the outlook
improves, but still with uncertainty given previous production delays. More than this, improving
conditions for sustained high growth requires maintenance of macroeconomic stability and pursuit
of structural, trade, and legal reforms aimed at ensuring better service delivery, reducing costs,
and resolving land disputes. All of this should be done with a view to raising competitiveness and
possibly attracting new FDI in labor-intensive and export-rich activities, notably agriculture,
fisheries, and tourism.
22.
Near-term risks: Risks are expected to remain to the downside over the foreseeable
future, with the main factors being a prolonged global recession, delayed mining production, and
further policy slippages. Related to this, the failure to undertake necessary adjustment to
adequately address fiscal and external imbalances could act to undermine macroeconomic
stability and already-strained investor confidence. These factors could undercut growth prospects,
limit employment opportunities, and invite social unrest—possibly reversing some of the
noteworthy security gains made in recent years. On the upside, government capacity building,
improved infrastructure, and streamlined investment regulations could provide an added lift.
23.
Fiscal policy: Given prevailing conditions, sizable fiscal slippages are likely in 2009, with
the risks of carryover into 2010 absent decisive measures. While some deterioration might be
expected as automatic stabilizers kick in, the lack of cash is constraining effective fiscal
operations. Some immediate relief could be found in increasing the taxable price of logs, scaling
back new parliamentary entitlements, and further restraining nonessential recurrent spending,
including in the 2010 budget. However, more lasting efforts are needed to deal effectively with
the permanent loss in logging revenues and persistent weaknesses in cash and spending controls,
as the current fiscal path is neither sustainable nor desirable, with existing limits on new

18
borrowing expected to stay in place for some time. More fiscal space also needs to be created for
well-targeted, export-related, and employment-intensive development spending.
24.
Medium-term fiscal prospects: Ensuring a sustainable fiscal stance and effective budget
operations hinges on further broadening the revenue base, strengthening tax and customs
administration, and reducing tax exemptions, as well as rolling back nonessential recurrent
spending, managing closely civil service wage and employment growth, and improving cash
management, accounting, and audit functions. However, these efforts may take some time. In the
interim, more external assistance in the form of budget support may be essential to building a cash
cushion, regularizing budgetary operations, and providing impetus for lasting structural fiscal
reforms and adjustment.
25.
Monetary policy: With liquidity conditions tightening and inflation pressures subsiding,
the move towards a more accommodative monetary stance appears appropriate. Given an already
moderate LAR and limits on open market operations, further policy loosening could come
principally through foreign exchange operations. In view of current limitations, the CBSI should
take further steps to improve monetary policy effectiveness. Foremost, the new liquidity
monitoring framework could be used as a basis for developing a more flexible set of instruments
and informing an appropriate choice of monetary targets. Complementing these efforts, a further
refinement of standing facilities and issuance of short-term CBSI bills would help to deepen
interbank activity and improve banks’ own liquidity management.
26.
Exchange rate policy and competitiveness: Taking account of recent and prospective
external imbalances, greater exchange rate flexibility could help facilitate necessary adjustment to
stem reserve losses. Based on an updated assessment, the exchange rate appears to be substantially
overvalued. Under the current managed arrangement, more flexibility is needed vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar. Recognizing in a small open economy the exchange rate cannot carry the full burden of
adjustment, a more stable fiscal stance and stronger reform efforts are also necessary to strengthen
external competitiveness and improve growth opportunities.
27.
Financial sector: The banking system appears well positioned to handle the slowdown in
growth and associated rise in NPLs, given its recent strong performance and efforts by the CBSI
to strengthen oversight. However, signs of increasing liquidity and credit risks facing banks need
to be monitored closely. Complementing this effort should be tight enforcement by the CBSI of
new prudential guidelines on capital adequacy, loan loss recognition, and large credit exposure to
help safeguard the banking system during the current slowdown. Risk management controls
should also be in line with parent bank operations. In light of recent global financial turmoil, NPF
operating losses should continue to be monitored closely.
28.
External assistance: Given the near- to medium-term outlook, development partners
appear willing to provide new budget support, but recognize that in the current environment this
will entail considerable risks, especially going into an election year. The DSA still points to a
moderate risk of debt distress, with positive debt dynamics dependent on growth-inducing
adjustment, new mining and export opportunities, and renewed access to concessional borrowing.

19
29.
Fund engagement: Given potentially large financing gaps and the uncertain external
environment, staff is prepared to further discuss with the authorities possible modalities of
support, including access to Fund financial resources. In technical areas, the Solomon Islands
should continue to avail itself of PFTAC support to further strengthen macroeconomic
management, statistical policy, and financial sector oversight.
30.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
SOLOMON ISLANDS
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2009 1
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Subir Lall and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Carlos Alberto Primo Braga (IDA)
September 21, 2009
Based on the joint IMF-World Bank low-income country DSA (LIC DSA), the Solomon Islands
remains classified as being at medium risk of debt distress. 2 Under the baseline, all debt
indicators are below their policy-dependent indicative thresholds and are expected to remain
so over the medium and long term. However, several stress tests result in a substantial
increase in the debt burden and cause some indicators to rise significantly above their
thresholds. Given past debt problems and uncertain growth prospects, the government of the
Solomon Islands will need to proceed cautiously with new borrowing over the medium to long
term. In particular, the potential dependence on mining as a main driver of growth highlights
the need to improve the investment climate and business environment to raise productivity in
other sectors and broaden the production base.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
At end-2008, total public debt was US$200 million (including arrears and public credit
guarantees), or equivalent to 32 percent of GDP. 3 This level of debt encompasses the central
government only, with debt data unavailable for state enterprises and provincial
governments. Around two-thirds of total public debt is external debt. The vast majority of
1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank, in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB). The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Solomon Islands authorities.

2

See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04)
and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework,
Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0629,
9/10/04) and “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt Relief,”
(www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110606.pdf and IDA/SecM2006-0564, 8/11/06).
3

Compared to the previous DSA, the debt-to-GDP ratios have fallen substantially as a result of changes in the
methodology for compiling national accounts data. This has resulted in a large upward revision of the official
series for nominal GDP.

2
domestic public debt is owed to the banking sector (including the Central Bank of Solomon
Islands), with the National Provident Fund also holding government bonds amounting to
about one fifth of the total domestic public debt. 4 The overall level of public debt has
declined significantly in recent years (Table 1a and 2a). After a period of distress, the debt
situation improved substantially in 2007 following a rescheduling agreement reached with
major creditors under the Honiara Club Agreement (HCA). 5 As a result, total public debt (as
a share of GDP) declined from 57 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2007. Arrears to external
creditors were settled and all external debt obligations are now being serviced regularly.
2.
As of end-2008, total external debt amounted to US$160 million, or 25 percent of
GDP. Public external debt accounted for over 85 percent of total external debt, mainly
stemming from multilateral agencies. Key creditors are the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) and the World Bank Group’s IDA, with their shares of the total public external debt
around 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively, at end-2008. Other external creditors include
the European Commission, European Investment Bank, International Fund for Agriculture
Development, and Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

The shares of the central bank and the private banking sector of the total debt are about 30 percent and
50 percent, respectively.

5

The Honiara Club is a multilateral forum convened by the government of the Solomon Islands in October
2005 to seek debt relief from a group of major official creditors (Australia, the European Commission, the
European Investment Bank, and International Fund for Agriculture Development). The final agreement resulted
in a moratorium on principal repayments and forgiveness of interest payments during the moratorium period. It
also led to debt forgiveness from external creditors (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP).

3
II. MAIN ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The baseline scenario encompasses current policies. The government is assumed to
make moderate policy adjustments on both the macroeconomic and structural fronts (Box
1). 6 However, the fiscal stance would continue to be constrained by a slow growth recovery,
weak cash position, and limited borrowing capacity, necessitating a sizable compression in
government spending over the next few years. Even with envisaged large expenditure cuts
(as a share of GDP), the government’s cash position would still remain extremely tight,
requiring strict fiscal discipline and treasury management to ensure proper budget execution
and avoid spending arrears. A key assumption is that gold and nickel mining exports will
start in 2012 and 2015, respectively, boosting medium-term growth prospects and buttressing
official foreign reserves.
III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability
Baseline
4.
Under the baseline, all external debt indicators remain below the indicative
policy-dependent debt burden thresholds. Despite modest new external borrowing
assumed to start in 2011, all of the indicators would decline moderately over the medium
term (Table 1a), led by steady repayment of existing debt. Over the long term, they would
stabilize at about half of the current levels.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
5.
Several thresholds are breached under the historical scenario and a few stress
tests.


The present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio, debt-to-exports ratio, and debt-torevenue ratio: Under the historical scenario, the PVs of debt-to-GDP ratio and debtto-exports ratio exceed the thresholds. Among the bound tests, two result in
significant increases in debt burden indicators —the shock to net nondebt creating
flows and the combined shock to growth, exports, deflators, and these flows,
surpassing the policy-dependent thresholds over the near to medium term (Table 1b). 7



Debt service-to-exports ratio and debt service-to-revenue ratio: Under all scenarios
and stress tests, these indicators would stay below the policy-dependent thresholds,
supported by the relatively high concessionality of public external borrowing.

6

The Solomon Islands is currently classified as a weak performer with regard to its policies and institutions, as
measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index.

7

These results are highly sensitive to expected large FDI inflows in 2010 and 2011 associated with new mining
and telecommunications operations.

4

Box 1. Main Assumptions in the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to average around 5 percent during 2010 to 2014—higher than the
historical average, which reflects negative growth experienced during the period of social and
political unrest in the early 2000s. Notwithstanding expected low growth in 2009, recent growth
projections through 2008 have been in line with outturns. Consistent with the official outlook,
logging activity is projected to decline sharply over the medium term due to depleted timber
reserves. Activities in other sectors will pick up, mostly in mining and agriculture. New, large gold
and nickel mining operations are assumed to commence production in 2012 and 2015, respectively,
in line with recent developments.1 Inflation is expected to average 6½ percent a year during 2010 to
2014, declining to about 5 percent in the longer term as international commodity prices stabilize.
The overall fiscal position is projected to run a small deficit, on average, during 2010 to 2014.
However, rather than reflecting major policy adjustment, this situation is due largely to a
combination of falling revenue (as a share of GDP), a weak cash position, and limited capacity to
borrow. Reflecting existing donor commitments, inclusive of some scaling back over time of
assistance provided under the umbrella of the Regional Assistance Mission in Solomon Islands,
external grants are expected to fall in real terms. As a result, recurrent spending will likely be
compressed significantly from current levels in order to maintain a positive cash balance and avoid
expenditure arrears. The direct impact of new mining-related revenues is assumed to be relatively
low (below 1 percent of GDP), given no firm agreement on the tax regime in this area.
The current account deficit is expected to widen sharply over the medium term, due both to the
rapid decline in logging exports and large projected mining-related imports, principally supported
by foreign direct investment (FDI) in this sector. Before peaking at about 25 percent of GDP in
2016, the deficit would be expected to narrow temporarily in 2012 and 2013, when gold export
receipts start to materialize. In the long run, with nickel mining providing a major boost to export
earnings, the deficit would gradually fall and then stabilize at about 5 percent to GDP.
New borrowing and aid flows: Under the baseline scenario, the government is assumed to
maintain its policy of no new borrowing for recurrent expenditure. However, starting in 2011 it is
assumed to restart modest external borrowing for development expenditure, responding to needs to
improve basic infrastructure and given the expected fall-off in external grants. Nonetheless, the
authorities are expected to pursue a high grant element in their new external borrowing in keeping
with the spirit of the Honiara Club Agreement (HCA). Under the HCA, the government is expected
to refrain from new external borrowing and pursue grant financing and ODA until it achieves
“green light status” under IDA’s debt distress ratings system. Aid inflows would still decline
moderately over the medium term, while FDI from the mining sector (gold and nickel) expected to
increase significantly. The reserve cover would fall over the near to medium term to the equivalent
1.2 months of prospective imports coverage in 2011. It would then reverse, but fall below the threemonth threshold for most of the projection period again by 2028.

__________________
1/ Gold: Australian Solomons Gold Limited is leading a consortium (including the European Investment Bank and
World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation) in investing around US$150 million to restart operations
of the Gold Ridge mine. Currently, the mine has proven reserves of around 800,000 troy ounces of gold, and is
assumed here to operate during 2012 to 2018. Nickel: The Sumitomo Metal Mining Company is expected to invest
around US$2 billion in a large nickel mining operation. The mine is assumed here to produce from 2015 onwards,
with annual production reaching around 30,000 tons (55 percent purity).

5
6.
Two country specific scenarios are also examined, based on different assumptions
from the baseline. They demonstrate the potential volatility of the Solomon Islands’ external
position and benefits that could accrue from pursuing a moderate path of adjustment over the
near to medium term.


Higher-case scenario (Table 3a): Under this scenario, the fiscal stance is underpinned
by a more robust policy framework. Revenue growth would be higher than under the
baseline. Expenditure levels (as a share of GDP) would also exceed those in the
baseline, in part aided by additional donor budget support, which would backstop
further reforms. The more stable fiscal position would allow the government to build
cash reserves. Growth prospects would be expected to improve, in part due to higher
development spending. Over time, this would be expected to facilitate greater
external borrowing by both the government and the private sector. Based on these
assumptions, external debt (total and public) would be expected rise above that in the
baseline, mainly given the government’s greater capacity to borrow.



Lower-case scenario (Table 4a): The main assumptions under this scenario are that
the start of new large gold mining production is delayed by two years to 2014 and that
large nickel mining operations, expected to start in 2015, do not materialize, in part
due to volatile commodity prices, land tenure issues, and financing constraints.
Compared to the baseline scenario, lower GDP growth, smaller export earnings, and
larger fiscal deficits that would be expected to arise in this case would not necessarily
lead to larger external debt. This is because government’s capacity to borrow abroad
would be constrained by its weaker underlying fiscal position, necessitating greater
recourse to domestic borrowing—potentially squeezing out the private sector and
further dampening growth prospects. The reserve cover would rise initially with gold
exports, but fall subsequently following the end of production. Assuming moderate
nonmining export growth, it would only be at around 1.5 months of import coverage
by 2029—well below the levels envisaged in the baseline and higher-case scenarios.
B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability

Baseline
7.
Total public debt is expected to decline steadily over the medium and long term.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to halve to 16 percent of GDP in 2014 from 32 percent of
GDP in 2008. However, some debt indicators would remain relatively high. In particular, the
PV of public sector debt to revenue (excluding grants) would stay above 40 percent through
2014.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
8.
Debt dynamics are subject to substantial risks. The results of the alternative
scenarios and stress tests indicate that lower GDP growth would significantly inflate debt

6
indicators, such as the PVs of debt-to-GDP ratio and debt-to-revenue ratio, particularly in the
longer term (Table 2b). The first bound test (a temporary but significant decline in GDP
growth) corresponds to the most extreme shock, owing to the combined effects over time of
relatively low expected growth in 2010 and 2011 and very large standard deviations in
historical growth averages. This finding again points to the sensitivity of this DSA to growth
conditions.
9.
Public debt dynamics differ under the additional alternative scenarios. Despite
higher external public borrowing for development expenditure, public debt is lower under the
higher case scenario (Table 3b) than in the baseline scenario. This is due to a smaller need
for domestic financing under the former, as a result of stronger fiscal balances. On the other
hand, the lower-case scenario (Table 4b) points to a substantially higher public debt burden
due to both larger fiscal deficits and lower nominal GDP over the medium and long term.
IV. CONCLUSION
10.
The Solomon Islands face a moderate risk of debt distress. Under the baseline, no
thresholds are breached. However, several thresholds are breached under several stress tests,
indicating the vulnerability of the baseline to shocks, in particular to net nondebt creating
flows and the combined shock for the external DSA and to a temporary growth shock for the
public sector DSA. The balance of risks is to the downside. Weak government finances
already point to the need for further fiscal adjustment and exceptional financing. In addition,
delays in developing the mining sector could intensify dependence on traditional sectors,
reduce the level of potential growth and pace of poverty reduction, and ultimately jeopardize
fiscal and external sustainability.
11.
Considering past debt problems and uncertain growth prospects, the
government of the Solomon Islands will need proceed cautiously with new borrowing
over the medium to long term, concentrating on productive development outlays—notably
growth-enhancing infrastructure. In the meantime, given current vulnerabilities and the
near to medium-term outlook, policies will need to be put in place to strengthen underlying
fiscal and external positions, supported by additional external assistance.

Sources: Solomon Islands authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes both public and private sector external gross debt. The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. Residuals are large in the latter half of the projection period, as reserves fluctuate mainly due to
the large and volatile FDI from the nickel mining company.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are derived over the past 10 years.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ In 2008, refers to disbursements from previous loans.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. The DSA exercise was conducted
jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ See Table 3a for details.
4/ See Table 4a for details.
5/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
6/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
7/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
8/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external gross debt. The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. Residuals are large in the latter half of the projection period, as reserves fluctuate mainly due to
the large and volatile FDI from the nickel mining company.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are derived over the past 10 years.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ In 2008, refers to disbursements from previous loans.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Includes both public and private sector external gross debt. The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. Residuals are large in the latter half of the projection period, as reserves fluctuate mainly due to
the large and volatile FDI from the nickel mining company.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are derived over the past 10 years.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ In 2008, refers to disbursements from previous loans.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

ANNEX II: SOLOMON ISLANDS—SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTER 1
Over the past few years, support for the Solomon Islands from the Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) has focused on the following areas:
Tax policy and administration: A PFTAC mission in December 2006 and follow-up
visit in May 2007 assisted the authorities in the preparation of a project plan for
implementing business revenue reform. A joint FAD-PFTAC regional mission took
place in February–March 2008 and recommended strategies for addressing future revenue
needs, with a follow-up visit in May 2008. However, the government’s revenue policy
remains to be finalized.
Bank supervision and examination: A PFTAC mission in October 2008 reviewed the
implementation of Basel I by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) and the adequacy
of regulatory reporting requirements for banking institutions. A follow-up mission in
February 2009 completed the review and revised the reporting requirements. During these
visits, PFTAC Advisor also provided assistance and training to the CBSI supervision staff in
the proper use of regulatory enforcement actions and conduct of an on-site examination of
the National Provident Fund. Additional visits are planned to assist the CBSI in
strengthening its off-site monitoring and analysis of banking institutions through the
introduction of formalized output analysis reports to be generated by the new regulatory
reporting forms. PFTAC also will provide support for an IT expert in August 2009 to assess
the CBSI’s computer needs and reconfigure the current FRE\D database used by the
Supervision Department to accommodate the new regulatory reporting requirements and
forms.
Statistical issues: A monetary and financial statistics (MFS) mission visited in
July 2007 to assist the CBSI in moving towards the MFS Manual 2000 reporting
standards. During a two-year period ending February 2009, a PFTAC statistics advisor and
short-term experts undertook eight visits to the Solomon Island to assist the authorities
strengthening compilation of balance of payments statistics, developing import prices
statistics, and improving the quality and timeliness of national accounts statistics. Constant
price GDP estimates have been rebased to 2004 prices. A follow-up mission on national
accounts statistics is planned for February 2010.

ANNEX III: SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of August 2009)

The Solomon Islands has been a member of the World Bank since the country’s
independence in 1978, receiving 11 IDA operations to date totaling US$63.4 million in
education and health, roads and rural development, and energy, as well as a structural
adjustment credit. Following the repayment of all outstanding arrears in 2003, the Solomon
Islands emerged from nonaccrual status, and country relations were normalized. The
Solomon Islands qualifies for grant funding under the IDA Debt Sustainability Framework
and is eligible for an IDA15 allocation of US$9.8 million.
The World Bank Group’s (WBG) assistance is motivated by the need for re-engagement in a
low capacity, post-conflict country, while recognizing the abundance of donor funds. Bank
activities in the Solomon Islands are currently addressed under the Regional Engagement
Framework FY06–FY09 for Pacific Islands. However, the World Bank and International
Finance Corporation (IFC) are now preparing a joint stand-alone Interim Strategy Note
addressing the period FY10–12. The opening of a WBG country office in 2008, together with
the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), reflects increased institutional and regional
commitment to small and fragile states.
The Bank’s current activities in the Solomon Islands are concentrated in the following areas:
Energy: The Bank has two projects under implementation in the energy sector. The first is
the Sustainable Energy Project comprising an IDA14 grant of US$4.0 million, which aims to
support reform of the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority by enhancing its operational
efficiency, system reliability and financial performance and by strengthening its financial and
operational management through a commercialization program, with a view to reducing
power losses and increasing the reliability of generation and distribution systems. The Tina
River Hydropower project, currently under preparation, is expected to reduce the country’s
high level of dependence on imported diesel, while providing a more reliable and sustainable
power supply. The Bank’s contribution will take the form of a partial risk guarantee, based
on US$4 million in IDA resources. The regional Sustainable Energy Finance Project
provides US$0.5 million in loan guarantees for the purchase of household sustainable energy
systems—a scheme implemented by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands.
Telecommunications: The Bank is providing technical assistance (TA) to the government to
examine ways to improve the competitiveness of the sector, in order to reduce
telecommunication costs and improve service quality and coverage, in particular outside
Honiara. Supported by a proposed US$3.8 million IDA operation, this work will (i) assist
government in managing the transition from a monopoly to competition; (ii) establish a
regulator with the appropriate legal, regulatory, and technical expertise; and (iii) assist in

6
implementing a sustainable, self-financing connectivity program for rural and remote areas.
Board consideration is anticipated for end 2009.
Rural development: The Bank launched the Rural Development Program (RDP) in
February 2008, focusing initially on four provinces. The program is expected to expand to
include the remaining provinces in 2010. Implemented by the Ministry of Development
Planning and Aid Coordination, the RDP aims to raise the living standards of rural
households by (i) providing local services and basic infrastructure through community
grants; (ii) increasing the capacity of Ministry of Agriculture and Livelihoods to provide
agriculture extension services; and (iii) supporting rural business development. Approved in
September 2007, total project financing is approximately US$21.8 million including an IDA
grant (US$3.2 million), EC grant (US$10.1 million), and AusAID grant (US$ 6.6 million).
Health: A Health Sector Support Technical Assistance Program was approved in March
2008 with an IDA grant of US$1.2 million, complementing the larger AusAID Health Sector
Support Program SWAp with TA for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services in
(i) public expenditure management and medium-term planning at the provincial level;
(ii) sector performance monitoring; and, (iii) training and capacity building. Following initial
implementation delays, project activities are expected to start in October 2009.
Economic analysis: In 2008, the government requested World Bank and IFC support to
identify sources of revenue to replace the anticipated decline in logging, which in 2008,
accounted for 16 percent of GDP, 60 percent of exports, and 18 percent of government
revenue. This initiative aims to encourage policy changes and actions by government,
donors, and the private sector to increase economic growth based on realistic assessments of
the medium-term fiscal outlook and growth prospects across key sectors of the economy.
The work has three streams: (i) Near and Medium-Term Growth Prospects to 2013;
(ii) Long-Term Growth Prospects, 2013 and Beyond; (iii) case studies of customary land
tenure carried out by the Bank’s Justice for the Poor program. The first stream has been
completed, with preliminary findings presented in March 2009; the second stream will be
finalized in the latter half of 2009.
In addition, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) has asked the World Bank to assist
in undertaking a Public Expenditure Review (PER). The move to a PER reflects the desire of
the ministry to improve public financial management (PFM), and as such forms an important
component of Government’s response to the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) conducted in late 2008. The PER will be critical to overall
improvements in PFM, maximizing the development impacts of the government’s limited
resources, as well as rationalizing financial flows and spending at the provincial level.
Rapid Employment Program (REP): The REP will be a labor-based public-works program
to create employment in Honiara and peri-urban settlements. It will provide an alternative

7
source of income to those most vulnerable to the effects of the global financial crisis and
contractions in government spending, with the overarching objective of helping to reduce
risks of social instability. The REP aims to (i) address unemployment, underemployment,
and poverty; (ii) augment basic life skills and household incomes, particularly for the
working poor; and (iii) increase economic productivity through investing in the maintenance
of infrastructure assets.
Regulatory Simplification and Investment Policy and Promotion Project (RSIPP):
Undertaken by the IFC’s Investment Climate Advisory Services, the RSIPP fosters
public-private dialogue to bring about simplifications in business processes and
improvements in investment climate. Components include streamlining business startup and
licensing, reducing the time and cost of contract enforcement, improving investment
promotion, and speeding up and making more affordable land transfers. A gender component
seeks to assess and reduce gender-based barriers to private sector participation. In the area of
business licensing, the IFC is coordinating closely with the AsDB.
IFC Investments: IFC is considering substantial loan and equity positions in a mining
enterprise (Gold Ridge mine), which is expected to resume production soon. The project has
two main components: (i) the rehabilitation of the processing plant and equipment by an
engineering contractor, and (ii) the redevelopment of the mine and associated costs of
infrastructure. IFC is also actively pursuing potential investments in sustainable agriculture
and fisheries.

ANNEX IV: SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 2009)
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973, the Solomon Islands has
received 16 loans amounting to US$79.3 million, 9 grants amounting to US$53.6 million and
61 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to US$18.3 million. The Solomon Islands is
eligible for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants available to countries that are very poor,
heavily indebted, or in a post-conflict situation. The AsDB approved ADF grants of
US$5.0 million and US$14.0 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The 2007–08 ADF
allocations for the Solomon Islands succeeded in catalyzing substantial grant cofinancing
from the governments of Australia and New Zealand, the European Commission, and the
Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).
The AsDB’s country assistance strategy seeks to reduce poverty by promoting equitable
private-sector-led economic growth through improved transportation infrastructure and
services and a stronger business-enabling environment. 1 An Interim Country Partnership
Strategy (2009–11) is being prepared for approval in September 2009. Capacity development
and the promotion of good governance are guiding priorities. In light of the global economic
turbulences, the AsDB is adjusting its operations to support the government in terms of
mitigating the impacts, currently through analytical support and adjustments in the design
and delivery of investment projects to increase local content. AsDB assistance is currently
provided entirely on a grant basis and, in line with government policy, no new lending to the
country will be provided until public finances stabilize.
In transport infrastructure, the AsDB supports the institutional strengthening of the Ministry
of Infrastructure Development. Investment projects, all grant funded, include an Emergency
Assistance Project in response to the 2007 earthquake and consequent tsunami that is
rebuilding damaged roads, bridges, wharves, and water supplies; the Solomon Islands Road
Improvement Project to rehabilitate roads and bridges; the Domestic Maritime Support
Sector Project for the establishment of a franchise shipping scheme for services to remote
locations and the construction of selected wharves. A transport sector development project is
being prepared for approval in 2010.
AsDB operations in private sector development focus on business law reform, public
enterprise reform, and access to finance. Specific interventions include the modernization of
the company registry; establishment of a secured transactions registry; and selected
state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, privatization, and public–private partnership support.

ANNEX V. SOLOMON ISLANDS––STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of September 1, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Recent technical assistance (TA) from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Center has led to improvements in constant and current price GDP estimates. Revised estimates have
been produced for 2005 to 2007, but await final analysis before being published. Currently, GDP
estimates produced by the National Statistical Office differ from those used by the Central Bank of
Solomon Islands (CBSI). No official expenditure-based GDP estimates are published. A census survey,
which will be a basis of future GDP estimates, is scheduled to be completed later this year. While
limited data on employment can be obtained from the National Provident Fund, wage data are not
compiled. In light of the inadequacy of labor statistics, the authorities plan to conduct a Labor Force
Survey in 2011.

Price statistics: A monthly consumer price index (CPI) is produced with a short lag (about a month),
but covers only the capital Honiara. The weights of this index were revised in 2007, based on the
results of the 2005–06 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The authorities plan to compile a
nationwide CPI, and have already compiled a list of goods to be contained in the basket. However, the
timing of actual compilation is unclear due to lack of funds. TA has been provided on the development
of an import price index but, due to resource constraints, there has been little progress in
implementation.
Government finance statistics: Currently, annual fiscal data are prepared for the central government,
but they do not cover provincial governments. Tentative monthly revenue and expenditure data are
available, but they are generally not consistent with annual statistics. The authorities started collecting
disbursement information on donors’ grants in 2006. The quality of public debt data has been improved
recently through better coordination between the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and the CBSI. To
expand coverage of general government activity, major state-owned enterprises’ financial accounts
have recently been produced for the first time up to 2007, with accounts for 2008 expected to be
available by late 2009.
Monetary and financial statistics: The CBSI publishes monthly monetary and financial statistics
(MFS) in summary form and provides more detailed data in its quarterly and annual reports. An
integrated monetary database is operational as a result of TA from the IMF’s Statistics Department, and
MFS are reported to the Fund using the standardized report forms (SRFs). A follow-up mission is
scheduled for January 2010 to derive the SRFs for the other depository corporations and other financial
corporations based on a soon-to-be introduced call report form to collect balance-sheet data from
reporting corporations.
External Sector Statistics: The CBSI has been compiling quarterly balance of payment statistics
(BPS) using its own survey since 2006. Compared to the previous method, which was based on foreign
exchange transactions reported through the banking system, the newly compiled BPS has improved
both coverage and data accuracy. However, these quarterly data have not yet been reported to the
IMF's Statistics Department, and only annual BOP data are currently available in the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook up to 2006.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Solomon Islands does not participate in the

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Solomon Islands
October 16, 2009

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the circulation
of the staff report. The information does not change the thrust of the staff report.
2.
Headline CPI was 3 percent year/year (y/y) in July, benefiting from the lagged effect of
declining commodity prices.
3.
Exports performed in line with staff expectations through August (imports have not been
officially reported). Export receipts from logging activity increased slightly in July and August, but
falling production during these months suggests export levels will likely decline going forward. Fish
and palm oil exports dropped more than anticipated, while copra and cocoa exports performed as
expected.
4.
The Solomon Islands dollar has begun depreciating in real effective terms, mainly due to a
weaker U.S. dollar vis-à-vis trading partners’ currencies. Nonetheless, owing to an earlier
strengthening, the real effective exchange rate still appreciated by around 10 percent (y/y) through July
2009.
5.
Gross foreign reserves were around US$125 million at end-September. In addition to the
Fund’s SDR allocation, the rise also reflects foreign exchange sold to the Central Bank of Solomon
Islands resulting from the sale offshore of a large loan by a major commercial bank to comply with
liquidity requirements. Staff now expect reserves at end‒2009 could be moderately higher than
originally projected, but with the same declining trend still expected over the medium term.
6.
On the fiscal front, the government continues to face a tight cash situation. While overall
revenue performance (through August) is slightly below expectations, expenditure pressures appear to
have eased modestly. As a result, net claims on government by the banking system rose by SI$ 33
million in July and August as expected, mainly on account of a drawdown in deposits.
7.
Broad money growth is in line with the staff’s outlook for 2009. However, despite a further
easing of liquidity conditions, credit growth declined to 2.4 percent (y/y) in August, reflecting the
general slowdown in economic activity.

Statement by Hi-Su Lee, Executive Director for Solomon Islands
and Raynold Moveni, Advisor to the Executive Director
October 16, 2009
INTRODUCTION
Our Solomon Islands authorities would like to express their sincere gratitude to staff for the useful
discussions during their recent visit to Honiara. They value the discussions with staff on issues
ranging from strategies to minimizing the effects of the global shocks on Solomon Islands’
economy to reforms needed to placing Solomon Islands on a sustainable footing going forward.
The authorities also express their sincere gratitude to development partners, the Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC), the World Bank, and the Fund, for advice and assistance
received over the years.
Solomon Islands is an import-dependent nation comprising of eight provinces scattering over a vast
ocean. Strong growth performance in recent years was a result of stable policy implementation and
return in confidence. However, the slowing of demand for external products, remittances and
investment flows, has hit the economy and fiscal position. The authorities have tighten monetary
conditions and taken a number of measures in the face of a deteriorating fiscal position. Further
support of the donor community is needed to help preserve the social safety net in the face of these
shocks.
The authorities wish to continue to strengthen the engagement with the Fund in the face of shortterm challenges, and value the continued technical assistance to strengthen policy frameworks.
Strengthened monitoring and the maintenance of a strong dialogue with donor parties on the
macroeconomic framework would help the authorities address the immediate challenges. To this
end, they welcome the recent assurances from the Fund regarding its willingness to remain
engaged in a dialogue with donors and assist the authorities over the next 12 months.
ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
The Solomon Islands’ economy grew by 6.9 percent in 2008. The main drivers are the agriculture and
forestry sectors, with each sector contributing 17 percent and 16 percent to Solomon Islands GDP,
respectively. For 2009, the authorities project a growth of 1.1 percent, somewhat higher than the
staff’s estimate of 0.4 percent. The difference lies in the assumptions used. The authorities and the
staff both share the view that a slowdown in logging and ancillary activities will act as drag on
growth. Nonetheless, the authorities consider that an uptick in agriculture, tourism, and FDI-financed
construction activities will lift growth in 2009 and 2010.
After reaching a peak of 23.5 percent in September 2008, the headline inflation decelerated to 3
percent year-on-year in July 2009. Lower inflation reflects the easing of international food and fuel
prices and the central bank’s tight monetary policy stance. External reserves have strengthened in
recent months, increasing from less than 3 months worth of imports to 4.8 months worth of import
cover in September. The improvement reflects donor inflows, a recovery in log exports, and the
recent SDR allocation.

2
POLICY ISSUES


Fiscal Policy

Fiscal performance was broadly on track in the first half of 2008, revenue collections exceeded
targets and expenditure growth slowed as intended. However, with the onset of the global economic
crisis, confidence has all but evaporated. Revenues have fallen sharply, and recurrent spending has
been higher than budgeted. The effect of the pass-through of the international food and fuel price
shocks was immediate. The costs of utilities (due to the increase in energy costs) and of providing
and sustaining government services shot up significantly. The authorities considered the environment
after the shocks hit to be abnormal and responded to the situation by increasing budget allocations to
utilities and provincial government grants. Without such allocations, government services would have
been disrupted and potentially destabilizing. They consider their decision to provide higher budget
allocations to be appropriate at the time and viewed the increased cost of providing and sustaining
government services − owing to the increase in inflation − to be the main driver of the recurrent
spending overrun in 2008 and in the first half of 2009. Meanwhile, the authorities passed a
supplementary budget of around SI$70 million to offset the effect of inflation on the costs of
providing government services, address the needs of those hit by a tsunami last year, and advance
structural reform in the telecommunications sector.
The authorities agree that fiscal pressures have emerged and that there is a need to create fiscal space
to sustain fiscal operations and over time make a greater contribution to development spending.
Mindful of the emerging pressures, the authorities took a series of measures to stabilize the fiscal
situation. These include spending re-prioritization, freezing of public service hiring, and imposition
of a 25 percent reservation on recurrent “other charges” or on non-payroll charges excluding pensions
and gratuities, and debt servicing. In addition to these measures, the authorities also: (i) placed a cap
on discretionary revenue exemptions at 50 percent; (ii) increased excise on beer and tobacco; (iii)
broadened excise on spirits to include wine, spirits and premix; (iv) increased duty on motor vehicles;
(v) increased vehicle licensing fees; and (vi) directed all government ministries to collect all
outstanding dues to the government. Meanwhile, the authorities note staff’s advice of scaling back
non-essential recurrent spending and parliamentary entitlements. On the latter, the authorities have
sought a judicial review of the appropriateness of increasing the parliamentary entitlements.
The authorities note staff’s recommendation to raise “the taxable price of logs” and to increase the
determined price of logs by “an average of US$25 per cubic meter” to lift revenue “by 1 percent of
GDP a year.” The authorities understand the rationale behind this recommendation. However,
experience with implementing similar policies in the past produced unwanted outcomes. Logging
companies have colluded to protect their interests in the past by cutting back production, laying off
workers, and holding back exports, resulting in huge revenue and foreign exchange losses. A similar
reaction at this point of economic weakness and low foreign exchange reserves could prove to be
counter-productive. Meanwhile, the authorities are encouraging investors to move to downstream
processing and Kolombaraga Forest Products Limited has become a sustainable forestry role model.

3
Staff has singled out the impact of minimum wage increases as one of the factors responsible for
driving recurrent costs up. The first review of the legal minimum wage rate for 12 years was
completed in 2007 and came into force on May 1, 2008. However, the impact on government
finances is minimal because the wage rate of the majority of civil servants is already higher than the
revised minimum wage rate. The cost of living adjustments award and the hiring of labor to fill up
unfunded positions – based on public service establishments rather than on budget allocations – are
the two main factors contributing to the increase in public service remuneration.
The authorities welcome the staff’s recommendation to adopt an internationally-accepted tax regime
for the emerging mining project. They agree that designing a good tax regime will be important to
ensuring sound resource management but will lack the necessary resources and expertise in this
area. As such, Solomon Islands would welcome Fund assistance in this area.
The authorities agree with the staff on the need to expedite fiscal structural reforms to enhance
medium-term fiscal sustainability. Under quite difficult circumstances, the authorities are aiming
to record a surplus budget in 2010. In line with this, they are committed to strengthening further
the revenue and expenditure measures that they have already put in place. They are also committed
to implementing further measures to enhance stability over the medium term, where appropriate.
The road ahead will be difficult and, in that context, the authorities agree with staff that external
budget support is critical to preserving the social safety net.


Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate

The authorities welcome the discussion on scope for monetary easing and note the staff
recommendation for a more accommodative monetary stance. The authorities agree that inflation
pressures have eased but caution that a careful assessment of the impact of the global shocks on the
domestic economy is required before changes to the current monetary policy stance can be
considered. Solomon Islands does not produce a national CPI with monetary policy decisions largely
being based on price information in Honiara. So the actual inflation rate for the country as a whole
could still be higher than the one quoted in the report.
The authorities are aware of the need to enhance the monetary policy operational framework. In this
regard, they are considering measures to improve the efficiency of the indirect policy instruments for
liquidity management purposes and look forward to working closely with the Fund in this area.
There is broad agreement between the staff and the authorities on the need for greater exchange rate
flexibility as the basis for providing an effective anchor and that, because the exchange rate alone
cannot bear the full brunt of the adjustment, this will require addressing structural bottlenecks to
improve the economy’s competitiveness over the medium term. Notwithstanding, the authorities are
not entirely comfortable with the staff’s advice to widen the daily trading band as the basis to shore
up reserves and address the external imbalances. The authorities’ past experience, however, has
been that this does little to address the imbalances and simply results in additional profits to
commercial banks. Against this background, and considering the desire to prevent further
inflationary pressures, the authorities will continue to maintain its current exchange rate policy of

4
pegging the value of the Solomon Islands dollar to a trade-weighted basket of currencies with the
US dollar being the intervention currency.


Financial Sector

The domestic banking system has been largely unaffected by the global financial crisis and is wellpositioned to deal with the slowdown in domestic activity. The banks are profitable and continue to
meet prudential requirements for capital adequacy, asset quality, and liquidity during the year. As
staff mention, credit growth has slowed in 2008 owing to the general slowdown in economic
activities, lack of viable investment proposals, and tight lending standards. In addition to the slowing
credit growth, asset quality has also deteriorated − albeit moderately. Non-performing loans increased
from 2.7 percent of total loans and advances at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 to 4.2 percent of
total loans and advances at the end of the second quarter of 2009 − while liquidity conditions have
tightened.
In response to tightening liquidity condition, the CBSI provided a short-term standing facility that
commercial banks can access. The commercial banks also raised deposit rates. Two out of the three
commercial banks that operate in Solomon Islands are branches of well-established Australian banks.
They are subject to strict banking standards from their parent banks. Viewed from this angle, the
authorities are confident that, despite some evidence of emerging pressures, the domestic banks will
continue to comply with the prudential requirements this year and the next.
Moving forward, the authorities wish to assure Directors that they are committed to maintaining a
stable financial system. The recent upgrading of the prudential standards, along with the
strengthening of the regulation and supervisory framework, are a testament to that commitment.


Structural policies

The authorities have made significant progress in some areas of structural policy, in particular, they
have streamlined business formation and regulations, established regular audits of SOE accounts, and
reformed telecommunications and transport sectors to allow new entrants. These actions have begun
to show results. Following the government’s decision to open up the telecommunications sector, a
service provider has expressed its interest to enter the market in the second quarter of 2010.
However, the authorities agree that further structural reforms will be needed to lift Solomon
Islands’ medium- to long-term growth prospects. In this regard, they are committed to working
closely with their main donors to implement their medium-term development strategy. In particular,
the authorities are aware that management of public enterprises, in general, needs to be improved,
given the drain on budget resources.
Finally, in relation to land reform, the authorities are aware of the need to move forward. The
authorities have acknowledged the concerns of the business community, in particular, on difficulties
to securing land titles for investment. However, the authorities recognize that sustainable land reform
needs to take place with broad public ownership. In the Solomon Islands, this requires significant
time and effort, given the complex land ownership structure and the resistance to land sales.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/126
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 4, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Solomon Islands
On October 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands. 1
Background
Economic conditions in the Solomon Islands have weakened in 2009, given the effects
of the global recession and a logging sector decline. Real GDP growth is projected at
0.4 percent this year, compared to 6.9 percent in 2008. On the positive side, inflation
pressures have eased substantially, mainly owing to lower fuel and food prices. An
expected drop in timber exports has been more than offset by the lower cost of
commodity imports, leading to a projected narrowing in the external current account
deficit to 11 percent of GDP in 2009, from around 19 percent in 2008.
In light of the slowdown, the fiscal position will likely weaken in 2009, with possible
financing constraints. The overall fiscal balance is expected to slip into a deficit of
around 0.4 percent of GDP this year, as compared to a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP in
the previous year. Affecting this are lower timber-related tax receipts and weak spending
controls, despite measures taken by the government to conserve cash. As a result, its
cash position is expected to remain under strain in 2009 and possibly the next few
years, absent further fiscal adjustment and new external assistance.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
At the same time, liquidity conditions have tightened, with external inflows and deposit
growth slowing significantly. Private sector credit is projected to rise by only 6 percent
this year, compared to 26½ percent in 2008. The exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
has been allowed to weaken modestly since mid-2008, but in real effective terms it has
increased substantially, possibly adding to external pressures.
In the near to medium term, growth is expected to remain below the levels observed in
recent years. Although recovery of the global economy and new foreign direct
investment, especially in mining and telecommunication sectors, could provide a lift to
the economy in 2010, declining logging and ancillary activity will likely act as a drag to
income and employment, fiscal revenue, and export receipts over the medium term. In
the event, both the fiscal position and current account could come under more strain,
with the possibility of large and unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances.
In order to place the economy on a more stable path and lay down the conditions for
higher sustained growth, policy measures should be adopted to strengthen the fiscal
position, reduce external vulnerabilities, and improve the overall investment climate. On
the fiscal front, more efforts are needed to broaden the revenue base and contain
recurrent spending, especially in view of the current cash and borrowing constraints,
which may persist for some time. In this light, the 2010 budget should be geared toward
a modest surplus.
Regarding monetary policy, the current accommodative stance appears appropriate.
However, greater exchange rate flexibility may be needed, in view of tight liquidity
conditions and to protect foreign reserves. Over the longer term, additional monetary
control will need to come through development of new policy instruments and a
strengthening of the liquidity management framework.
The banking system appears well positioned against the current slowdown, but given
rapid credit expansion in earlier years and signs of rising liquidity and credit risks, tight
enforcement by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands of new prudential rules will be
important to ensuring sound financial performance and proper risk management control
by banks.
Creating conditions for higher growth in nonlogging sectors is essential to improving the
fiscal and external position, providing new employment opportunities, and reducing
vulnerability to shocks. In addition to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment,
further structural reforms aimed at lowering operating costs and ensuring better access
to land are also needed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Solomon Islands faces a more challenging
environment than in the recent past. The impact of the global recession and lower
logging output could dampen short-term growth prospects, undermine the fiscal position,
and increase external vulnerability given projected reserve losses. Against this
background, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to gear macroeconomic
policies toward maintaining stability, while pressing ahead with essential structural
reforms aimed at strengthening public administration, improving the business climate,

3
and diversifying the production base.
Directors advised the authorities to address the increasingly unsustainable fiscal
situation, given possible permanent losses in logging-related revenues, relatively large
expenditure outlays, and government financing constraints. They highlighted the need to
tighten fiscal policy to conserve cash and avoid external pressures in the near-term
through greater spending discipline, especially in nonessential recurrent areas and the
government wage bill, which could also avoid squeezing out domestically financed
development spending. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to adopt an
internationally accepted tax regime for the emerging mining sector, with the help of Fund
technical assistance.
Directors agreed that medium-term fiscal sustainability hinges on steady implementation
of structural fiscal reforms aimed at strengthening revenue administration and reducing
tax and customs exemptions, as well as improving cash management, budget
integration, and accounting and auditing functions. They underlined the importance of
additional external budget support to safeguard essential social spending and help
secure more lasting fiscal adjustment. In view of the continued moderate risk of debt
distress, Directors commended the efforts to implement a sound debt management
strategy.
Directors noted that the current accommodative monetary stance is broadly appropriate,
given the moderation of inflation. They encouraged the authorities to improve the
liquidity management framework to strengthen the central bank’s effectiveness,
including through the development of short-term debt instruments and new standing
facilities, which would also help to promote interbank activity. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to use the recent SDR allocation to boost reserves, given external
pressures.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate appears to be
substantially overvalued, which could undermine medium-term external sustainability. In
this context, Directors generally considered that greater exchange rate flexibility could
help improve overall competitiveness and facilitate external adjustment, while noting that
this should be accompanied by efforts to improve transportation infrastructure, reduce
operating and borrowing costs, and streamline business regulations.
Directors welcomed the timely steps taken to strengthen banking supervision, while
highlighting that credit and liquidity risks necessitate close monitoring. They encouraged
banks to bring risk management controls in line with parent bank operations. Closer
monitoring of the National Provident Fund would also be useful, given the recent impact
of adverse global conditions on operating income.
