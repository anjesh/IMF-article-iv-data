STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: Growth remains relatively high, but various factors, including the
unsettled global outlook and slow government decision-making, have weighed on
investment. Inflation has moderated, leading the RBI to pause monetary tightening, but
remains elevated. The slow pace of fiscal consolidation has added to demand pressures.
Growth is projected at 7 percent for 2011/12 and 2012/13, while risks – from slow reform
efforts, high and volatile inflation, and the global situation – remain on the downside.
Short-Term Demand Management Policies: Base effects have brought inflation down in
recent months, but pressures including from high expectations, depreciation, and little excess
capacity suggest that rate cuts are premature. The 2011/12 budget target is likely to be
exceeded; returning to fiscal consolidation will require subsidy reform which the government
has long committed to, as well as tax reforms, which have been delayed.
Policies to Revive Investment and Inclusive Growth: Ensuring sustainable growth will
require reinvigorating the structural agenda, rather than relying on monetary and fiscal
stimulus. Measures to facilitate infrastructure investment, reform the financial sector and
labor markets, and address agricultural productivity and skills mismatches stand out. The
FSAP concluded that India’s financial system is broadly stable, but noted scope for some
further improvements in stability and developmental areas. Reconstituting fiscal space and
reorienting expenditure toward capital and social areas are vital to make growth more
inclusive, and also to reduce financial restrictions (which in turn would boost growth).
Spillovers from External Risks: While external risks are manageable in the baseline, a
protracted downturn in advanced economies could have a sizable impact on India’s growth.
Advanced economies’ bank deleveraging is underway, which so far has been offset by banks
from the region. But a sudden stop of capital inflows would complicate the financing of the
current account deficit. Also, India’s large corporations present an important potential
channel of contagion.

Ensuring a more stable macroeconomic environment would lay the groundwork for reducing poverty

and inequality. There is an extensive literature on how inflation can be particularly damaging to the poor, who are
unable to insure against changes in prices. Recent Fund research further divides inflation into food and nonfood
inflation, showing that higher nonfood inflation is generally associated with higher income inequality, while higher

But structural measures will be essential in the long run. The 12 Plan will present measures to improve

outcomes in health, education and agriculture, improve infrastructure to reduce regional disparities and facilitate
communication, and to improve governance to raise the quality of public services. Beyond this, reforming
expenditure to more accurately target subsidies to the poor and making progress on the financial inclusion agenda
proposed by the government and endorsed by the recent FSAP mission would also help make growth more inclusive.

BOX 2. CORPORATE INVESTMENT IN INDIA1
1.
While investment was the main driver
of growth before the global financial crisis, it
has been lackluster since then. Strong
corporate investment drove the overall increase
in investment, but it has slowed to 10 percent of
GDP from 14 percent before the crisis. More
recently, the quarterly growth of investment
(gross fixed capital formation) has fallen to about
-0.6 percent on average in the first three quarters
in 2011, compared to an average of nearly
3 percent between 2000 and 2007. High
frequency data suggest that this reflects weak
corporate investment.

Both macroeconomic and structural
factors are responsible for recent weak
corporate investment. The high and volatile
inflation rate and heightened global uncertainty
appear to have depressed corporate investment
since the global financial crisis. Monetary
tightening since early 2010 may have affected it
at the margin as well. However, since late 2010,
quarterly investment has fallen short of levels

corporate investment in India. The significance
of liquidity suggests that there remains room for

BOX 2. CORPORATE INVESTMENT IN INDIA (continued)
4.
India has substantial room for improving its business environment to boost corporate
profitability, which is a key determinant of corporate investment. According to the World Economic
Forum, India’s global competitiveness fell to 56th place in 2011 from 49th in 2009, reflecting weakening
institutions (e.g., transparency of government decision making) and the relatively slow pace of
infrastructure improvement. The World Bank has ranked India at 132nd out of 183 countries in the world
(up from 139th in 2010) in terms of ease of doing business. In this survey, India is ranked at 166th in
starting a business, 97th in registering property, and 182nd in enforcing contracts. These rankings indicate
that India could do more to enhance corporate sector profitability by reducing the costs of doing
business and improving institutions. In addition, according to the World Bank, there are large differences
in costs of doing business across Indian cities, meaning that many cities in India can learn from its bestperforming cities.

5.
Micro empirical analysis confirms that
lowering business costs could enhance
corporate profitability. Moreover, for exporters,
lowering costs to export appears to raises
profitability, indicating that cutting such costs by
improving infrastructure, especially transport,
would be beneficial. According to staff estimates,
reducing the average of each cost of doing
business to the lowest among Indian cities is
estimated to boost corporate investment by
3-13½ percent through raising profitability
(see table).

BOX 3. INDIA’S EXPORTS: THEIR EVOLUTION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS1
The composition of India’s exports is unique. The share of services exports, which has reached 35 percent, is
higher than in advanced countries, but the share of manufacturing exports in total goods exports is still low.
While services exports have a high technology content and high-value added, the goods and manufacturing
exports are still dominated by relatively low-tech and low-value added products, though there is a clear shift
away from traditional exports (e.g. textiles, gems, and leather products) towards medium- and high-tech
products (e.g. engineering goods). Based on an index of export sophistication developed by Anand et al.
(2012),2 Indian services exports are more sophisticated relative to its income level. However, India’s goods
export sophistication has remained below the average sophistication level of Asia, and it is lower than China’s
and Brazil’s.
The evolution of exports is expected to help India increase sophistication and diversification further
and should benefit India through reallocation of resources and catch up in productivity. The
sophistication and diversification of Indian exports have reached a threshold that will enable them to acquire
skills and assets needed to move closer to the production possibility frontier. Growth is likely to benefit from
knowledge spillovers. High exports sophistication, particularly of services, is likely to support growth.
Increasing the sophistication of manufacturing exports would result in higher productivity and reallocation
gains similar to those seen in the services sector. Going forward, India could benefit from realizing exports with
new regions: even though exports to emerging and developing economies have increased, the potential to
increase them further is substantial.
However, realizing these benefits will require trade reforms, investment in infrastructure, health and
education, and labor market reforms. The key trade reform areas are reducing trade restrictiveness and
improving trade facilitation and infrastructure. India’s weighted average tariff is high relative to other G20
economies. Also, India scores much below comparator Asian economies on the Overall Logistic Performance
Index. A substantial investment in infrastructure, health, and education (both basic and technical) will be
needed to sustain and increase sophistication. In addition, labor law reforms will be necessary to realize
efficiency and productivity gains in manufacturing.

BOX 5. THE OUTPUT-INFLATION TRADE-OFF IN INDIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR DISINFLATION1
1.
The detrimental effects of high inflation on growth are well documented in the literature.
For example, Khan and Senhadji (“Threshold Effects in the Relationship between Inflation and Growth,”
IMF Working Paper 00/110, 2000) indicate that high inflation hurts growth, and identify different inflation
levels for advanced (1-3 percent) and developing economies (7-11 percent) above which inflation begins
to hurt growth.
2.
Several papers have estimated that inflation beyond 5-6 percent is detrimental to growth
in India. Ahluwalia (“Prospects and Policy Challenges in the Twelfth Plan”, Economic and Political Weekly,
May 2011) notes that inflation above 6 percent is “regressive and also distortionary, damaging both
inclusion and growth”. Mohanty et al. (“Empirical Threshold in India: An Empirical Investigation”, RBI
Working Paper 18/2011, 2011) find evidence of an inflation threshold for India in the order of 5.5 percent.
Using quarterly data from 1996-2011, we also find evidence that puts the inflation threshold at 5-6
percent for India.
3.
Threshold analysis can also be used to shed light on the nature of the inflation-output
tradeoff at different levels of inflation. For this, we use a backward-looking Phillips curve (PC) model,
and apply quantile regression which allows the estimated slope parameter to differ depending on the
level of inflation. We also conduct standard OLS regressions to compare results. The estimated equation
is given by:
Q π
∑ β, π
ε
γ y
y
where γ is the slope of the PC and τ refers to the τ th quantile of the dependent variable (i.e., any
particular level of inflation for which γ is to be estimated). Other controls are included, such as real oil
prices.

4.
The estimated Phillips curves confirm that the tradeoff between inflation and output
differs at different levels of inflation. The standard OLS regression shows that a 1 percentage point
increase in the output gap leads to a 0.4 percentage
point increase in inflation. This implies large disinflation

the basis of different economic groups that

However, as the national CPI was introduced
only in 2011, the WPI remains the only
established national price index. In addition,
the higher weight of food in the CPI means its
basket is likely to be less responsive to
demand-management measures such as
monetary policy. Therefore, the RBI will

37.
The approval of long-delayed tax
reforms would have positive growth effects.
Both the GST and the new Direct Tax Code
(DTC) are still being negotiated. However, the
central government’s broadening of the base
of indirect taxation to approximate the
eventual GST base and the recent important
agreement on the services list for the GST
show that progress is being made. The FC
estimated that the GST would boost efficiency
by 1½ percent of GDP.
38.
Expenditure reforms, which the
government has repeatedly committed to,
are vital to ensure medium-term fiscal
consolidation. The government is aiming to
boost spending on public investment, health,
and food subsidies, while containing nonpriority expenditure. Subsidies have been an
important exception to an otherwise relatively
successful containment of non-priority
spending, while slowing growth and rising
expectations for social spending will make
maintaining budget discipline even more
difficult. Liberalization of fuel prices, especially
diesel, and rationalization of fertilizer and gas
subsidies will be crucial to bringing the deficit
down, though support for the most vulnerable
must be ensured. Institutional reforms such as
tighter escape clauses from the Fiscal
Responsibility Act and an independent review
mechanism for fiscal policy, as proposed by
the FC, would help implementation.
Recapitalization of public banks, which
constitute about ¾ of the overall system,
guarantees of public insurance policies, and

outlays (Box 6). Finally, the poor financial
position of several state electricity boards
should be resolved with tariff changes and
improvements in efficiency.
39.
Improving spending efficiency will
be particularly important. India’s Unique
Identification program (UID), already the
world’s largest biometric database, is expected
to cover one-third of the country’s population
– 400 million people – by end-2012. Pilot
projects using the UID to target social benefits
have begun and could represent an important
step in broadening the reach of government
programs at lower cost.
Authorities’ Views
40.
Fiscal consolidation is well underway
and medium-term targets will be met. The
debt-to-GDP ratio is in within easy reach of the
FC target of 68 percent of GDP by 2014-15.
The authorities note that the deficit
consolidation path is frontloaded, and that
there will be space in the remainder of the FC
period to reach the medium-term target of a
3 percent of GDP budget deficit for the central
government.
41.
The authorities note various
structural measures to improve the
implementation of fiscal policy. The 12th
Plan will make improvement of expenditure
efficiency a priority and the UID will pave the
way for direct cash transfers. Bringing down
fuel and fertilizer subsidies is important, but
will have to be done cautiously to minimize
dislocations

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BOX 6. ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FROM PPPS1
1.
India’s increasing use of PPPs for infrastructure creates new liabilities. Private finance for
infrastructure was US$51 billion in 2010/11, or around 2.8 percent of GDP, but the 12th Plan is expected
to call for it to rise to 5 percent of GDP. India’s PPP program, at US$129 billion already one of the world’s
largest, could thus grow rapidly. However, PPPs create contingent liabilities, such as annuities or
termination payments or the need to finish a desired program after an investor goes bankrupt.
2.
These risks should be presented transparently. Some countries, such as the United States,
require contingent liabilities such as public guarantees to be incorporated into the budget; the United
Kingdom also does this with PPPs. Chile annually presents all contingent public liabilities, including PPPs,
calculating both a maximum cost to the government if all guarantees are called (in 2010, around 4
percent of GDP) as well as a probability-based estimate of expected outflow (only around 1/10,000 of
GDP).

3.
Estimates for India’s PPP portfolio can also be produced, though data are sparse. We make
simplifying assumptions of project duration and the time remaining on each contract, and also assume
construction liabilities are capped at project cost, while operating income is related to construction cost
and prorated for contracts that can last up to 30 years. Assuming default probabilities approximately
comparable to S&P ratings of BB (for construction) and BBB- (for operation), we find relatively small
exposures. Maximum exposure drops drastically from a peak of around 0.3 percent of GDP as projects
currently under construction come online and reduce potential losses (Figure 1). As for the risk weighted
measure, with 95 percent probability losses remain under Rs 20 billion, or 0.02 percent of GDP. However,
different assumptions could produce different results. More accurate calculations, based on the deeper
database of information available to the authorities, would be worthwhile, especially as these programs
expand.

52.

Given decelerating but still high

inflation, keeping policy rates unchanged
until inflation is clearly on a downward
trend is warranted. Since most of the recent
decline in inflation is due to base effects,
cutting rates immediately would be premature.
Looking beyond March when base effects end,
the RBI should stand ready to raise rates if
sequential inflation rises again, while it could
afford to cut rates if the inflation momentum
clearly eases. Over the medium term, the RBI is
rightly aiming at lowering inflation further to
below 5 percent.

allowing the existing financial restrictions to be
removed gradually. Fiscal reforms are
preferable to demand stimulus for reviving
investment. In particular, reorienting
expenditure toward capital and social
spending as envisaged by the authorities is
welcome as it can boost investment and
promote inclusive growth. Decontrolling diesel
prices, rationalizing other fuel and fertilizer
subsidies, and moving toward direct cash
transfer under UID are essential to keep
deficits under control and free space for more
growth-enhancing spending. Approval of the
GST should also be a priority.
54.

The revival of growth should come

from structural reforms, rather than from
monetary and fiscal stimulus. Structural
impediments, some of which have intensified
in recent years, are important contributors to
India’s investment slowdown. Removing
obstacles to investment is crucial, especially in

facilitate land acquisition and mining would
promote infrastructure provision and ensure
that India’s high growth potential remains
intact. Financial reforms are needed to increase
corporate and household access to credit and
diversify funding sources. On the other hand,
given the large fiscal deficit and elevated
inflation, fiscal and monetary policy cannot be
relied upon to stimulate investment and
growth.
55.

A slowdown in global growth,

particularly if triggered by a sudden stop in
capital flows, would have a serious impact
on India. Investment is increasingly tied to
global cycles, corporates are relatively highly
leveraged, and the external position, while
quite manageable, is less favorable than
during 2008. The resulting growth downturn
could also lead to a substantial deterioration in
asset quality in the financial system.

Such reforms would also make

growth more inclusive. Addressing skill
mismatches, moving toward a more liberalized
labor market, and improving agricultural
productivity will support income growth and
formal job creation, especially for the less
privileged in society.

India’s trade would be affected by a

global crisis but the net impact is unlikely to
be large. India is less exposed to global supply
chain disruptions than many other Asian
economies. While a 1 percent decline in global
domestic demand (weighted by countries’ trade
with India) is associated with a 0.6 percent

would improve India’s current account deficit by
around 0.6 percent of GDP, while falling
investment would pull down imports of capital
goods, which account for about 60 percent of
imports.

through sentiment effects and through financial
channels such as corporate external borrowing
and equity markets. Around 11 percent of the
market capitalization, and a significantly larger

4 percent of GDP, and total holdings of debt
securities amount to 2.3 percent of GDP. Falling
global investor confidence could thus have a
serious impact on equity prices, the rupee, and
capital flows, complicating rollover of existing
debt or finance for new projects.

ANNEX II. INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD
BANK GROUP
In Bank FY2011 (July 1-June 30), IBRD/IDA
lending totaled US$3.47 billion. IFC committed
$754 million in FY2011. The World Bank Group’s
(WBG) Country Strategy (CAS) for India for 20092012 focuses on helping India to fast-track the
development of much-needed infrastructure and
to support the seven poorest states in achieving
higher standards of living for their people. The
strategy envisaged a total proposed International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
lending program of US$14.6 billion for the fouryear CAS period, of which approximately US$3
billion additional IBRD financing was in response
to the financial crisis. The International
Development Association (IDA) 15 allocation was
SDR 2.919 billion (US$ equivalent 4.79 billion).
Midway through CAS implementation the
projected IBRD lending was revised upward to
US$16 billion. India’s IDA 16 allocation is SDR
3,243.6 billion US$ equivalent 5.019 billion).
As a result of the financial crisis as well as
increased Government demand for the Bank
Group’s support, the pace of IBRD lending
accelerated in FY10-11, bringing India closer to
its Single Borrower Limit (SBL) of $17.5 billion
earlier than anticipated. To help maintain India’s
IBRD net exposure within the SBL and ensure
medium-term sustainability of the India program,
the Reserve Bank of India is discussing an
agreement with the IBRD and the Bank for
International Settlements on purchases of IBRD
Special Private Placement Bonds. The IBRD and
Government are working to increasing the
selectivity of new projects and scaling up efforts
to leverage private finance with IBRD
investments. India is IFC’s largest country
exposure. IFC is focusing on projects with
development impact and is managing its
exposure via mobilization and selectivity.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The overarching objective of the CAS is to scale
up the development impact of Bank Group
assistance to help India achieve: rapid, inclusive
growth; sustainable development; and improve
service delivery. It aims to do all this while
strengthening project implementation, improving
the effectiveness of public spending, and
achieving demonstrable results to scale up the
impact of World Bank assistance. The diversity of
India calls for a differentiated, tailored approach.
In India’s low-income states and lagging regions
in more advanced states, the focus is on
achieving the MDGs, relying primarily on IDA
resources and non-lending technical assistance
(TA). In more advanced states and at the central
level, the focus is on strengthening institutions so
that they can deal with emerging middle income
challenges, relying on IBRD lending and cuttingedge analytical work. In the context of WBG India
CAS, IFC’s three strategic pillars are inclusive
growth, climate change and regional and global
integration. IFC is prioritizing support for the
Low Income and North East States in order to
better promote inclusive growth.
The World Bank’s India Program is increasingly
focused on supporting large, transformative
development programs, with projects such as the
National Ganga River Basin, Pradhan Mantri
Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Second Rural
Roads, and National Rural Livelihoods, and
innovative operations such as the Karnataka
Watershed. The shift to a more substantial
engagement has raised the visibility and
influence of the Bank Group, while creating
opportunities for greater focus on public policy
and institutional reform.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

ANNEX I. INDIA: MEDIUM-TERM SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
Macroeconomic Assumptions. Growth is
forecast at 7 percent in 2012/13, and is
expected to revert only gradually to trend
growth of around 7½ - 8 percent in the
medium term. Inflation (WPI) is expected to be
around 7 percent in the year to March 2012,
but with little decline expected thereafter.
Fiscal Assumptions. The rapid consolidation
called for in early 2010 has proved challenging.
The 2011/12 general government deficit is
forecast at 8.1 percent of GDP. While state
budget deficits are largely contained, deficits
at the central level are likely to decline only
slowly.






Tax revenues remain well below historical
levels of GDP due to slowing corporate
revenues, cuts to fuel taxes, and a failure to
reverse the 2009 tax cuts taken to
stimulate the economy. Buoyancy has been
modest since the end of the global
financial crisis (GFC); combined with the
clouded outlook for tax reform,
consolidation based on revenue is
unlikely1.
Expenditure in three of the four areas
targeted by the government for
consolidation (interest, wages and
pensions), as well as military and Plan
expenditure, are expected to remain under
control and support consolidation.
The fourth area, subsidies, continues to
grow rapidly. Reforms to fertilizer pricing
have not brought down subsidy payments,
and diesel prices are now around one-third

The DTC and GST have both been delayed, but in any case
are likely to be revenue neutral in the near term.

percent below international prices as they
were raised only once in the first 11
months of 2011/12. Without significant
reform this will continue to weigh on the
budget.
A. Sensitivity Analysis
Debt Path under the baseline. The
primary deficit is expected to remain
around 3 percent over the medium term,
slightly below the debt-stabilizing level as
interest rates remain well below GDP
growth. The ratio of debt to GDP is thus
likely to decline steadily from 66¼ percent
at end-2011/12 to 61.4 percent in 2017/18.
Other Scenarios. With deficits close to the
debt-stabilizing level, a scenario of no
policy change produces constant
dynamics. Nominal GDP growth averaging
around 14 percent reduces the impact of
most shocks, so shocks to interest rates or
contingent liabilities would have only a
transient effect on debt dynamics, though
one with slower growth would produce a
slowly rising debt ratio.
Policy Risks. A return to fiscal
consolidation involving serious subsidy
reform would bring India closer to last
year’s analysis of a more rapid decline in
the debt ratio. On the other hand, a big
increase in spending in the buildup to the
12th Plan or a large stimulus to revive a
slowing economy could produce
significantly less favorable dynamics.

INDIA
2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on India
March 9, 2012
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
Economic and financial developments
1.
The latest national accounts data confirmed the broad based slowdown, but
there are signs of a modest rebound. GDP growth dropped to 6.1 percent y/y in 2011Q4
(6.8 percent in 2011 Q3), in line with staff projections. Investment remains sluggish with a
third consecutive decline in y/y terms. Private consumption was robust at 6.4 percent y/y.
From the supply side, the slowdown was mostly due to manufacturing (which grew by
0.8 percent y/y, versus 2.7 percent in the previous quarter), while services continued to
advance at a robust pace. In sequential terms, however, activity seems to have bottomed out.
After rebounding strongly since late 2011, the manufacturing and services PMIs stabilized in
February and remained well above the expansionary threshold.
2.
The trade deficit rose to $14.8 billion in January (compared with $10.3 billion in
the previous year), owing to the jump in imports. Import growth reached 20.3 percent y/y,
partly due to higher oil prices, while non-oil imports growth moderated to 17.6 percent.
Exports have also picked up steam, advancing by 10.1 percent y/y, following single digit
growth in late 2011.
3.
In line with staff projections, inflation pressures have continued to abate on base
effects. The new national CPI (which was introduced last year) recorded an inflation rate of
7.7 percent y/y, while consumer price inflation for industrial workers fell sharply to
5.3 percent y/y due to the retrenchment in food prices. In sequential terms, the CPI-IW
inflation momentum has also moderated.
4.
The rupee has appreciated and capital inflows have returned in recent weeks.
The rupee has appreciated by 8 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year, with the
NEER appreciating by about 5 percent. Portfolio equity inflows (mutual funds and ETFs)
have rebounded significantly since late January.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with India
On March 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2012 Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India’s growth remains one of the highest in the world, but a range of factors have weighed it
down. Following a rapid recovery after the global financial crisis, the economy has slowed more
than most other major emerging markets, as investment has been dampened by a confluence
of cyclical and global factors, as well as by concerns about structural impediments.
Consumption, particularly in rural areas, and exports, with increasing geographical destination
diversity and sophistication, have been the bright spots. At the same time, inflation is elevated,
and its recent moderation is primarily due to base effects. While monetary policy has been
tightened, the fiscal deficit remains high. The unsettled global outlook has added to policy
challenges. After the boom in capital inflows in 2010/11, rising global risk aversion has reduced
the flow of capital. The rupee depreciated the most among major Asian currencies in 2011,
partly due to India’s current account deficit. Concerns about global growth have harmed investor
sentiment and advanced economies’ bank deleveraging has raised the cost of external finance.
Growth is projected at about 7 percent for 2011/12 and 2012/13, with inflation forecast to remain
above the RBI’s comfort zone. Investment is anticipated to pick up modestly from the slump
recorded in late 2011, and consumption should remain robust, but exports are expected to cool.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Inflation is projected to fall in the near term, but to stay above the Reserve Bank of India’s
objective. The current account is projected at 2.8 percent of GDP.
Growth risks are to the downside. The main domestic risk is a further weakening of private
investment if government approvals do not accelerate, reform efforts are not reinvigorated, and
inflation remains high and volatile. At the same time, external risks continue to be elevated as
Euro area growth could underperform and bank deleveraging could intensify even in the
absence of a new full-fledged global financial crisis. Inflation risks remain, as momentum
indicators are mixed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that sound macroeconomic policies and fundamentals enabled India
to weather well the global economic crisis. Nevertheless, economic growth has slowed below
trend in the last year due to cyclical and structural factors, and while inflation has come down, it
is still high. Some Directors noted that it is difficult to attribute the current slowdown to structural
factors. Downside risks prevail in light of the uncertain global environment, supply constraints
and elevated funding costs. A major challenge will be to bring growth back to potential and
ensure its inclusiveness, while further lowering inflation. Directors underscored that this will
require a reinvigoration of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.
Directors encouraged continued vigilance against inflation. They agreed that policy rates should
be kept unchanged until inflation is clearly on a downward trend, given the uncertain outlook for
growth. They encouraged the Reserve Bank of India to stand ready to raise policy rates if
inflation starts to rise again, while it could consider cutting rates if the inflation momentum
clearly eases.
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation is crucial to crowd in private investment and lower
inflationary expectations. They supported the planned reorientation of expenditure toward
infrastructure and the social sectors, and highlighted the need to rationalize fuel and fertilizer
subsidies and improve public expenditure management. They encouraged tax reform,
especially the introduction of the goods and services tax.
Directors considered the flexible exchange rate regime to be an important buffer against
external shocks, and supported the policy of intervening in the foreign exchange market only to
contain volatility and to prevent disruptive movements. They welcomed the authorities’ moves
toward further trade and gradual capital account liberalization.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reform to raise public and private investment
and boost inclusive growth. While some progress has been made, many Directors were of the
view that a more determined effort to remove structural impediments is required in several
areas. On the other hand, some Directors felt that structural reforms were progressing at a
measured pace. Continuing to develop infrastructure, which in turn requires facilitating land
acquisition and mining, would ensure that India’s growth potential remains intact. Financial

3
sector development and reform are needed to improve access to credit and diversify funding
sources. Addressing skill mismatches, increasing labor market flexibility, and improving
agricultural productivity are crucial to support formal job creation and reduce poverty.
Directors welcomed the FSSA’s finding that India’s financial system is broadly stable, albeit with
room for improvement in the regulatory and supervisory framework, and encouraged
development of a prioritized action plan to implement key recommended reforms. They
welcomed measures to increase the quantity and quality of bank capital, strengthen
inter-regulatory cooperation, and clarify supervisory responsibilities. They encouraged close
monitoring of asset quality and provisioning; continued development of domestic bond markets;
a gradual reduction of credit concentration limits, with due regard to development needs for
financing, and a reduction in mandatory holdings of government securities by financial
institutions, while ensuring adequate liquidity buffers for financial stability.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Arvind Virmani, Executive Director for India
and Michael Patra, Senior Advisor
March 9, 2012
1.
We welcome staff’s candid assessment of recent macroeconomic and financial
developments in India and the evolving outlook, based as it has been on constructive and
open-minded engagement by our authorities during 2011 and early 2012. This year’s Article
IV consultation assumes added importance in view of the high uncertainty characterizing the
global environment, which is impacting India’s macroeconomic performance and prospects
on a persisting basis. This consultation is also noteworthy for it being co-terminus with the
Financial Sector Assessment Program. While there is broad consistency between staff’s
analysis and the assessment of our authorities in several aspects, there are also some areas of
divergence which we address in this statement.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
2.
It is heartening to note staff’s impatience with the under-actualization of India’s
growth potential - in ascribing the recent slowdown to ‘governance scandals’ and ‘civil
activism’, aspects in the life and ethos of every open, secular and pluralistic democracy the
world over, as currently being witnessed, but inevitably subservient to the rule of law, as
demonstrated in India. To draw casual connections between these events and the slowing of
the economy is speculative and runs the risk of missing more fundamental factors at work. It
is necessary to recognise that the slowdown is common to all major economies that
experienced a robust rebound from the crisis of 2008-09; however, a careful analysis of high
frequency data may indicate that the Indian economy has been undergoing a cyclical
moderation that set in during the second half of 2010-11 (April-March), again a phenomenon
recorded across the world. Lead indicators – capacity utilisation; new investment intentions;
sales growth; order books; business confidence – are all exhibiting cyclical effects.
3.
Additionally, two factors have accentuated the downturn. First, the worsening
external environment is strongly impacting demand – as staff has correctly noted, India’s
investment, which is the main driver of the current downturn, has become closely correlated
with the global cycle (page 23). In particular, corporate investment in manufacturing and
tradeables shows close co-movement with global demand. Our estimates show that a one
percentage point decline in global growth could result in 0.3 percentage points decline in the
growth of non-agricultural domestic demand. Furthermore, one percentage point decline in
India’s gross fixed capital formation could shave off about 0.2 percentage points from
potential output growth.
4.
Secondly, the anti-inflationary monetary policy stance has had a dampening effect on
investment demand as well as on interest-sensitive components of private consumption, as
was expected in view of the objective of lowering inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
has raised its policy rates on 13 occasions since March 2010 amounting to an increase of 350
basis points – the most aggressive central bank response to inflation in recent times. Inflation
has moderated significantly since January 2012.

2
5.
Lead indicators are now suggesting that the economy is reaching the bottom of the
cycle. In January 2012, purchasing managers indices for India reached their highest level
since April 2011, led by forward-looking indicators of output and new orders. The PMIs have
continued to remain in expansionary mode in February 2012, albeit with a slight moderation
in output growth. The February 2012 OECD composite leading indicator for India points to
an upward positive change in momentum. While private consumption has been resilient, a
durable easing trend in core inflation will boost consumer confidence significantly. Exports
have expanded by 26 percent in the financial year up to December 2011, outpaced by import
growth. As capital flows turned volatile, there was a drawdown of reserves to finance the
rising current account deficit. In retrospect, it was the arsenal of policy instruments available
and the measured approach to capital account management that restored stability and enabled
a modest real appreciation in the early months of 2012. Our authorities are fully cognisant
that a large and/or prolonged external shock could easily overwhelm these efforts and cloud
the outlook.
The Quality of Growth
6.
In evaluating the performance of the Indian economy and the road ahead, it is perhaps
useful to step back and take a longer-term perspective. Over the period 2007-12 (AprilMarch), average GDP growth of around 8.2 per cent, as against 7.8 percent in the preceding
five-year period, was achieved in a difficult international environment. This implies a 35 per
cent increase in per capita GDP during 2007-12. The progress towards inclusiveness is
difficult to assess, because inclusiveness is a multidimensional concept. Yet some progress
has been achieved. Illustratively, preliminary estimates suggest that poverty declined by
approximately one percentage point per annum during the five-year period 2004-05 to 200910, faster than before. India is well poised to meet the Millennium Development Goal target
of 50 per cent reduction of poverty between 1990 and 2015. The National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), with a people-centered, demand-driven architecture, has
directly led to the creation of 9.9 billion person-days of work since its inception in 2006-07.
In 2010-11 alone, the MGNREGA generated employment to the tune of 2.53 billion persondays. It has also successfully raised the bargaining power of agricultural labour resulting in
higher agricultural wages, reduction in distress migration and has also secured some
inclusivity in the growth process. The progress achieved so far may be modest relative to
aspirations, but an important consequence of the intensified focus on inclusion has been
heightened awareness and empowerment, greater desire to access information about rights
and entitlements, and eagerness to demand accountability from the public delivery systems.
Outlook
7.
Over the next five years (2012-17), our authorities are putting in place a growth
strategy that envisages a return to our estimate of potential output growth of 8.5 to 9 percent.
In this regard, we differ from staff’s estimates of potential growth which seem to vary
annually and are sensitive to choice of methodology, in contrast to our view that potential
growth is a medium- to longer-term concept that reflects underlying structural trends rather
than cyclical variations and year-to-year shifts and events. What shall be the drivers of this
return to trajectory? First, the high rates of investment and private sector savings constitute
strong macro-economic fundamentals supporting high growth. Secondly, with India’s young
population, the labour force is expected to increase by 32 per cent over the next 20 years and

3
add to the growth potential. Thirdly, the thrust on accelerating the pace of investment in the
physical infrastructure will be sustained. Since more than two-thirds of the investment in the
economy is by the private sector, public-private partnership-(PPP)-based efforts, already one
of the largest in the world, are expected to constitute 50 per cent of the estimated investment
in infrastructure of about 10.0 per cent of GDP by 2016-17, up from 30.0 per cent currently.
Measures are being taken to enhance private sector funding of infrastructure. The
establishment of infrastructure debt funds is a step in this direction. The creation of a vibrant
and liquid corporate bond market is being taken up on a priority basis. Fourthly, Indian
companies in many sectors have shown capacity for innovation, which needs to be nurtured
and strengthened through a greatly expanded programme of Research & Development
(R&D). Fifthly, constraints arising from the supply side, such as better availability of water,
power and land-based resources will be the focus of the growth strategy for the mediumterm.
Monetary Policy Issues
8.
An issue that has vexed our authorities is staff persisting in stating that “the RBI
could give more weight to the CPI in policy formulation over WPI” (paragraph 16)
repetitively in successive Article IV Consultation reports. As a comprehensive CPI did not
exist till January 2011 this appears disingenuous. CPIs continue to be dominated by food
items, and the efficacy of monetary policy to deal with food inflation is limited.
Accordingly, in the Indian context, the conduct and formulation of monetary policy cannot
be guided solely by CPI movements. The RBI therefore follows a multiple indicator
approach to the monitoring of inflation, closely monitoring and analyzing movements in the
three available sectional CPIs (CPI for industrial workers; CPI for agricultural labourers; CPI
for rural labourers). The RBI communicates its forecasts in terms of the WPI simply because
the CPIs relate to specific sections of the population whereas the WPI is a national-level
index (and the RBI is a national - not sectoral- or section-level- institution). This is not a
phenomenon peculiar to India. Illustratively, in the USA, inflation is measured by the CPI,
but the Federal Reserve prefers to communicate its view of inflation in terms of the personal
consumption expenditure deflator. This by no means implies that more weight or less weight
is given to one indicator over another in the analysis of inflation. Now that a new
comprehensive CPI has been developed, it is bound to play a greater role once it has an
established track record. Given the wide diversity of the Indian population and variations in
consumption baskets, it has been found necessary to compile CPIs for the rural and urban
population to measure inflation. The latter indices are being compiled since January 2011,
and so far only twelve observations are available. The fact that national-level CPIs are being
compiled is indicative of the intention of our authorities, but they would wait for enough
observations to be convinced that the new CPIs have stabilized, that they truly reflect
inflation conditions and that they are well understood by the public.
Fiscal Policy
9.
With tax revenues affected by the cyclical downturn in growth, and expenditures
overshooting mainly on account of the impact of the significantly higher than budgeted
global prices of crude and fertilizer, restraining the fiscal deficit in 2011-12 to the targeted
path of consolidation is proving to be a major challenge. The final outcome will be known on
March 16, 2012 when the Union Budget for 2012-13 will be presented to the Parliament.

4
Accordingly, it is premature to speculate on the actual outcome at this juncture (as in
paragraph 9 of the staff report). The trajectory of deficit adjustment continues to be
downward; in terms of averages for the years 2010-11 and 2011-12 rather than for each year
in isolation, fiscal consolidation remains on track. The public debt/GDP ratio at 67 percent at
the end of 2010-11, according to the September 2011 WEO, is already very close to the
target of 68 percent set for 2014-15.
Financial Sector Issues
10.
Our authorities welcome the comprehensive review of India’s financial sector and the
quality of regulation and supervision in India under the FSAP. They regard this engagement
as extensive and productive. Although there are some differences of views, they fully
recognize the importance of the FSAP in contributing to financial stability in India and
express strong support for the role FSAP plays in promoting the soundness of the global
financial system. India remains committed to phased adoption of international standards and
best practices calibrated to suit our local conditions to meet the developmental and inclusion
goals as well as to maintain stability in the financial system.
11.
We will restrict our comments to our key concerns relating to some of the findings/
recommendations in the FSSA. First, while the level of non-performing assets at 2.8 percent
of total assets in the banking system has shown a modest increase in 2011, it compares
favourably with asset impairment levels in both major advanced economies and peer
economies. Secondly, with regard to the issue of large exposure limits, this is driven by the
development needs of the country, especially in the context of the need to finance investment
in infrastructure. Tightening the concentration limits would severely constrain the availability
of bank finance, which is the major source of finance for this purpose. Thirdly, while the
FSAP report recognizes the benefit of the cash reserve ratio (CRR)/statutory liquidity ratio
(SLR) in providing liquidity to banks in crisis time, it neglects the financial stability
enhancing role played by them – the large pool of liquid assets comprising the highest quality
collateral which helped Indian banks to deal with the tightening of liquidity during the global
financial crisis of 2008-09, and which places them in an advantageous position with respect
to compliance with Basel III norms. Furthermore, staff’s argument that mandatory holdings
weaken monetary transmission is not clear as government market borrowings are at marketdetermined interest rates and monetary policy actions impact such yields. Moreover, banks
voluntarily hold higher than mandated levels of these securities. Fourthly, several steps have
been taken to improve oversight over interconnectedness and financial conglomerates
including (i) prudential limits on aggregate interbank liabilities; (ii) restricting
uncollateralised funding to banks and primary dealers with caps on both lending and
borrowing by these entities; (iii) restrictions on capital instruments of banks; (iv) restrictions
on banks’ exposure to non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), and tighter regulation of
NBFCs; and (v) intensive monitoring of financial conglomerates and common exposures in
sensitive sectors. Our authorities also fully recognize the importance of establishing
information sharing arrangements with other jurisdictions and are expanding appropriate
information sharing networks on a priority basis. There are substantial developments in the
areas of home-host relationships as well as engagement with supervisors in other
jurisdictions on an ongoing basis.

Conclusion
12.
The macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and resilient.
Over the past two years, the challenges of inflation and fiscal consolidation have necessitated
a focus on demand management. It is now time to address supply side issues. The
productivity and innovation enhancing elements in the New Manufacturing Policy and the
National Skill Development Mission, along with intensified efforts to bridge the gaps in
physical and social infrastructure, are intended to release the supply constraints and allow
India to renew its tryst with faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth, the theme of our
approach to the Twelfth Five Year Plan covering the period 2012-17.
