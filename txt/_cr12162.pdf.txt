STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 15, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. Poland’s economy performed well throughout the crisis, reflecting very strong
fundamentals and decisive counter-cyclical policies. After robust growth last year, the
economy is expected to slow in 2012 as heightened uncertainty and tighter credit conditions
weigh on private consumption and investment. Fiscal space to respond to new adverse
shocks is now more limited than in the past, suggesting that the policy mix would need to
rely more heavily on monetary policy.
Interconnectedness. Trade and financial linkages with Europe are significant, including
cross-border vertical integration of non-financial corporations and foreign ownership of the
banking system.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit is set to decline to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2012, from
5.1 percent of GDP in 2011. Over the medium term, additional measures of ¾-1 percent of
GDP will be needed to achieve the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective. In the event of
an adverse shock, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate.
Monetary policy. Policy interest rates should remain on hold on account of the slowing
economy and projected decline in inflation. If the economy were to slow significantly, and
the outlook for inflation were to weaken, policy rates should be cut given the ample scope to
do so. The NBP is prepared to provide liquidity support in both zloty and foreign currency, if
needed.
Financial sector policy. Recent supervisory measures are helping to further improve the
resilience of the banking system. Increased capital and liquidity buffers, as well as stricter
prudential standards, are helping to address risks associated with foreign-currency
denominated mortgages, but a more proactive approach to addressing non-performing
loans is desirable. Work to strengthen the supervisory framework, improve prospects for
long-term bank funding, establish a macro-prudential framework, and design a specific bank
resolution regime is underway.
Structural reforms. Continued reforms—notably on improving the functioning of the labor
market, easing administrative burdens, and advancing privatization—would boost potential
growth.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

CONTEXT
1.
Poland’s economy performed well throughout the crisis, reflecting very strong
fundamentals and decisive counter-cyclical policies. The floating exchange regime played a
stabilizing role, while broadly adequate international reserves and the precautionary FCL
arrangement boosted market confidence. The banking system remained largely shielded from
external turmoil despite substantial foreign ownership and a high share of foreign-currency
denominated mortgages. But, policy space to respond to new adverse shocks is now more limited
and there remain some vulnerabilities associated with large gross external financing needs and a
high share of mortgage portfolios denominated in foreign currency.
2.
The ruling coalition was reelected in late 2011. The center-right Civic Platform (PO) and
the agrarian Polish People’s Party (PSL) have a slim parliamentary majority and a fresh four-year
window to complete their policy and reform agenda.
3.
Trade and financial linkages with Europe are significant. Polish manufacturing firms are
highly integrated in the cross-border production chain of core euro area countries (notably
Germany), and bilateral trade with the euro area accounts for more than half of Poland’s total trade.
In part reflecting this integration, the non-financial corporate sector relies heavily on intracompany
lending, which covers about 54 percent of external funding needs. Around 60 percent of Poland’s
banking system is owned by European banks, but overall reliance on parent funding is moderate
(Box 1).

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Cross-Border Linkages of the Polish Banking System1
Poland’s banking system is highly interconnected with the European financial system.
Foreign-owned banks and branches—with parents mostly based in the euro area—account for
about two-thirds of the Polish banking system. BIS consolidated data shows that foreign banks’
claims on Poland amounted to 59 percent of GDP at the end of 2011, reflecting the openness of
Poland’s financial system.
The banking sector’s negative net foreign asset position largely reflects banks’ liabilities to
foreign financial institutions, over 90 percent of which is parent bank funding. Though,
traditionally, parent funding has proved stable and Poland requires parent banks to commit to
support their subsidiaries, deleveraging remains a risk. At the same time, the moderate overall loan
to deposit ratio of 113 percent and an average loan to deposit ratio of just under 100 percent for
banks with parents in European economies under stress help to mitigate this risk. About 80 percent
of parent funding to Polish subsidiaries is denominated in foreign currency, and is the main source
of funding for foreign currency credit to non-financial corporations and households, particularly
mortgages. As a result, banks with higher loan-to-deposit ratios have a larger share of foreign
currency loans in their loan portfolio.
Foreign financial institutions are also important counterparties in foreign currency derivative
transactions. Polish banks have large long foreign currency positions on their balance sheets—the
currency mismatch amounted to about 4¾ percent of GDP (and 5½ percent of banks’ balance
sheet) in Q1 2012. Most of this open position is closed by off-balance sheet foreign currency
hedging instruments, mainly FX swaps and, to a lesser extent, cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Foreign financial institutions are the main counterparties in these markets: transactions between
foreign and Polish banks account for about 90 percent of the total FX swap market turnover. Polish
banks are therefore vulnerable to a reversal of sentiment by the foreign banks, either through a
tightening of credit limits or an increase in prices.
These cross-border linkages make Poland vulnerable to potential spillovers from escalating
financial and sovereign stress in the euro area. Parent bank deleveraging or funding withdrawal
would worsen the Polish banking system’s liquidity situation, with potential adverse effects on credit
and growth (see Box 3). In addition, banks’ large foreign currency hedging needs—which tend to
increase when the zloty depreciates—could subject Polish banks to liquidity strains and rollover
problems during times of market stress.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Economic Expansion is Slowing
4.
Economic activity in 2011 was strong and well balanced, but has weakened recently
(Figure 1). Despite substantial fiscal consolidation, real GDP growth posted a solid 4¼ percent in
2011, helped by a rebound in investment and net exports (boosted by zloty depreciation towards the
end of the year), and steady private consumption growth. The expansion slowed modestly in the first
quarter of 2012. More recently, however, the economy has started to lose steam: the latest data
releases suggest that industrial production and retail sales are slowing more substantially.
5.
Labor market conditions have softened (Figure 2). After declining through most of the
year, the unemployment rate climbed to 9.7 percent toward the end of 2011—only about
1 percentage point lower than its crisis peak. While this partly reflected the increase in labor
participation, it was also due to weaker job creation as increased uncertainty about the economic
environment and the phase-out of government-funded active labor market programs led firms to
curtail new hiring. Wage growth was relatively muted and unit labor costs declined.
6.
Inflation declined recently, after peaking at 4.8 percent in November. Headline inflation
remained above the upper bound of the NBP’s inflation target in 2011, mostly driven by higher food
and energy prices, a VAT hike, robust domestic demand, and zloty depreciation (later in the year).
Since November, it has declined steadily, falling to 4 percent in April 2012. The decline reflects the
slowing economy, base effects of the VAT hike, and moderating food price increase. Core inflation
has also fallen amid modest wage pressures.
7.
The current account deficit narrowed, but its financing shifted to more volatile sources
(Figure 3). The current account deficit improved to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2011, somewhat better than
its average since Poland joined the European Union (EU). The weaker zloty in the second half of the
year—amid renewed global financial market turbulence—helped boost net exports, offsetting strong
imports in the first half (Figure 4). The current account was mostly financed by EU transfers and net
FDI inflows. However, the relative importance of portfolio inflows has increased, reflecting growing
foreign investment in the government bond market. Other investment flows, particularly to the
banks, were more volatile, as parent firms became more cautious about their liquidity positions in the
second half of the year. Net errors and omissions were -2.0 percent of GDP, near the EU average,
reflecting the improvements to the balance of payments compilation system completed last year.
Poland’s external position is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate
policies (Box 2).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 2. External Sector Assessment1
Consistent with the recommendation of the 2011 Triennial Surveillance Review, the assessment of
the external sector has been expanded.2 In addition to the real effective exchange rate (REER), the current
account, capital flows, international reserves, and the country’s international investment position are
assessed.
Poland’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate
policies, but with some potential vulnerabilities.



Model-based estimates support the result that the current account and the REER are broadly
consistent with fundamentals. Nonetheless, the new External Balances Assessment (EBA) approach
suggests that a narrowing of the current account of ½-1 percentage point of GDP would be warranted
over the medium term.3 This can be achieved by adhering to the planned fiscal consolidation path.
Both EBA and CGER analysis suggests that the REER is in line with fundamentals.4



Net IIP liabilities are large, but are mostly comprised of diversified FDI liabilities and intra-company
lending. In contrast to some other countries in
Central and Eastern Europe, FDI liabilities in Poland
Industry Composition of FDI Position, 2009

are more diversified and reached both tradable and



Despite factors that mitigate the potential risks
from a high net IIP liability position, rising foreign

foreign currency swaps) increase Poland’s
vulnerability to a reversal of investor appetite.

International reserves are broadly adequate, exceeding most indicators of reserve adequacy. They fall
within the recommended bounds of the IMF reserve adequacy metric,6 but remain short of 100 percent
of short-term debt at remaining maturities plus the current account deficit. The FCL arrangement with
the IMF also serves as a precautionary buffer against external shocks.

B. The Banking System Has Been Resilient
8.
The banking system has remained
profitable, well capitalized, and liquid
(Figure 5). Profitability increased by 37 percent
compared to the previous year, driven to a large
extent by strong net interest income and
declining provisioning. The average capital
adequacy ratio remained high at around
13 percent, with Tier 1 capital representing
90 percent of total capital. In the latest European
Banking Authority exercise, Poland’s largest
bank exceeded the capital adequacy target by
more than 2 percentage points. Liquidity
indictors remained generally robust. The loanto-deposit ratio edged up, in particular for some
institutions already exposed to funding risks,
and stood at 113 percent in aggregate.

Credit expanded at a healthy pace, but conditions are tightening. Overall bank lending
grew by 12¾ percent annually in the first quarter of 2012, led by strong corporate credit growth. But
lending standards are tightening, likely reflecting moderate deleveraging by parent institutions and
uncertainty about the economic outlook. Indeed, household credit growth is moderating amid
supply constraints and lower demand.

Further regulatory and supervisory actions were undertaken to contain risks associated
with foreign currency mortgages (Figure 6). Almost two-thirds of all mortgages are denominated
in foreign currency (mainly Swiss francs). To help address the flow of new foreign currency
mortgages, prudential rules were further tightened in 2011: debt service-to-income ratios were set at
42 percent and risk weights were increased to 100 percent (to be implemented by June 2012).
Nonetheless, one-quarter of all new mortgages issued in the first quarter of 2012 were denominated
in foreign currency. To address the outstanding stock of foreign-currency denominated mortgages,
the KNF requested that banks boost their capital and liquidity buffers.
11.
The evolution of asset quality,
however, has been weaker. The overall
non-performing loan (NPL) ratio leveled-off at
around 8.2 percent at the end of 2011, but
partly on the back of strong credit growth, as
absolute impairments grew in both the
corporate and household sectors. NPL ratios are
uneven across loan types, with high levels on
consumer credit, moderate but persistent levels
in the corporate portfolio, and relatively low—
but increasing—levels on mortgages. Banks
have started disposing some of their nonperforming consumer portfolios, but have taken
fewer measures to address corporate
nonperforming loans.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The economic expansion is expected to slow in 2012. Baseline GDP growth is projected to
moderate to 2½ percent, as heightened external uncertainty weighs on private investment, adding to
the effects of a reduction in EU-funded public investment. Household consumption is expected to
remain subdued on account of tight credit conditions (driven by general concerns about risks and
deleveraging by some parent banks), persistent unemployment, and slow wage growth. Lower
growth in trading partners is expected to reduce exports, although the contribution of net exports
would remain positive as softening domestic demand dampens imports. The pace of job creation is
likely to remain insufficient to significantly reduce unemployment in the near future. On current
policies, inflation should continue to decline toward the NBP’s target of 2½ percent on the back of
the slowing economy and moderate wage pressures.
13.
Over the medium term, the economy is expected to gradually gather steam. Growth is
expected to recover to 3 percent in 2013, rising to 3¾ percent by the end of the projection period,
led by domestic demand. Even under the baseline assumption of further gradual reductions in banks’

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

loan-to-deposit ratios and lower reliance on parent funding, deposit growth should be sufficient to
provide a basis for continued moderate credit expansion. Robust private investment and an eventual
rebound in private consumption are expected to offset declines in EU-funded public investment
(which is expected to fall from peak levels reached in 2011). Private investment is largely financed by
retained earnings, and thus a period of moderate credit availability should not undermine prospects.
The contribution from net exports will shift over time, and turn negative in the outer years.
14.
Risks to the outlook are on the downside, emanating mainly from external sources
(Appendix V). The near-term outlook remains characterized by heightened uncertainty about the
external environment. A deeper-than-expected recession or an intensification of the crisis in Europe
would give rise to adverse spillovers into Poland through several channels (Box 3):


Trade and FDI. Nearly 60 percent of Poland’s exports are to core euro area countries and
Poland is heavily integrated into the German manufacturing supply chain. The euro area also
accounted for over 75 percent of Poland’s foreign direct investment liabilities in 2010.



Confidence. A deterioration in confidence arising from an external shock would have an
adverse impact on domestic demand though lower private consumption and investment.



Banking system. About 60 percent of Poland’s banking system is owned by euro area banks,
exposing it to deleveraging by parent institutions. Although the banking system’s moderate
loan-to-deposit ratio helps mitigate this risk, there are wide differences among banks.



Investor appetite. Poland’s large share
of nonresident holdings of government
bonds, sizable gross external financing
needs (estimated at 30 percent of GDP
in 2012), and high external debt
(64.8 percent of GDP at end-2011)
increase its vulnerability to a reversal of
investor risk appetite. Significant prefunding of the government’s financing
needs and a large liquidity cushion help
mitigate these risks.

risks to bank and household balance sheets. Sharp zloty depreciation could erode asset
quality and give rise to liquidity strains for banks that rely on derivatives to hedge currency
mismatches in their balance sheets. These risks are mitigated, however, by the low level of
credit relative to the size of the economy: foreign currency mortgages amounted to
13 percent of GDP and 21 percent of household disposable income at end-2011.

Econometric analysis confirms that trade and financial channels play a key role in the transmission of
shocks from the euro area to Poland. Based on a VAR analysis, the cumulative response of Poland’s growth
to a euro area shock is estimated at 60 percent of the original shock on impact, declining to 30 percent after
two years. Financial conditions in the euro area explain a major part of the overall spillovers, especially during
the first two quarters immediately after shock. While the trade channel plays a limited role in the initial shock
transmission, its contribution increases over time.

A Global Projection Model with cross-country financial linkages is used to simulate a scenario of
intensified financial stress in the euro area. In particular, a 100 bps increase in the euro area’s external
finance premium, measured as the spread between the risk-free rate and the lending rate for firms and
households, leads to an increase in Poland’s premium of 25 bps roughly three quarters after shock. As a result
of higher financing costs and weaker foreign demand, Poland’s output gap widens by 0.2 percentage points
relative to baseline, with the accumulated output loss amounting to 1.5 percentage points over three years.
The downturn would be significantly more severe if monetary policy in Poland were constrained by the need
to support the exchange rate. A historical shock decomposition exercise shows that demand and financial
shocks from the euro area played a major role in driving Poland’s business cycle fluctuations, particularly in
the 2008–09 crisis.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the near-term outlook. The central
bank’s GDP growth projections for 2012–13 differ slightly from staff’s in terms of timing. While staff
projects a sharper slowdown in 2012 and a moderate recovery in 2013, the central bank expects
somewhat higher growth in 2012 and a deceleration in 2013. There are also some differences in the
path for public investment.
16.
The authorities also agreed that risks emanated mainly from external sources, and
emphasized that confidence effects stemming from uncertainty about the situation in the euro area
were a critical spillover channel. They also underscored the wide range of actions undertaken by the
KNF to reduce the flow of foreign-currency denominated mortgages.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
In the face of the difficult external environment, Poland’s near-term challenge is to
balance continued adjustment and support for the economy. This means further reducing the
fiscal deficit in line with current plans to ensure that public debt is put firmly on a downward path,
keeping policy interest rates on hold to cushion demand, and continuing to strengthen the resilience
of the financial system. If downside risks were to materialize, there is some space for counter-cyclical
fiscal policies, but it is narrower than in the past. The policy mix would therefore need to rely on
monetary policy as the first line of defense. Poland has generally been receptive to past Fund advice
(Box 4).
Box 4. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Past Fund advice has been well-received, with action taken in several important areas:

14



Fiscal policy: The authorities have embarked on an ambitious fiscal consolidation, in line with past
Fund advice. The authorities also plan to introduce a permanent fiscal rule to strengthen the fiscal
framework, anchoring it firmly at MTO.



Financial sector: The authorities took steps to strengthen the financial sector, including
supervisory measures to tighten standards on foreign currency lending to households. They share
the Fund’s views on the importance of developing the resolution and the macro-prudential
frameworks, with work in these areas pending.



Structural reforms: Fund advice focused on three main areas: increasing labor force participation,
reinvigorating privatization, and eliminating barriers to economic activity. The authorities took
actions on all fronts, including the recent initiative to increase and equalize of retirement age for
men and women. Despite unfavorable market conditions, privatization was accelerated, with
above 700 state companies privatized in 2008-2011. Reducing red-tape barriers has been a
priority, with two de-regulation laws, limiting documentation/licensing requirements approved in
2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
18.
Monetary policy responded to shifting inflation risks in 2011. The NBP raised the policy
rate by a cumulative 1 percentage point to 4½ percent in the first half of 2011 as inflation pressures
mounted. In the second half of the year, the tightening cycle was suspended on concerns about the
intensification of the crisis in Europe and potential spillovers to Poland. In response to zloty
depreciation in late 2011, the NBP carried out sporadic interventions in the foreign exchange market
to curb excessive volatility. Heightened uncertainty about external and domestic liquidity conditions
has led banks to increase liquidity holdings, affecting the functioning of the interbank market as
evidenced by an interbank interest rate (POLONIA) persistently below the policy interest rate (Box 5).
19.
Monetary policy should remain on hold. In May, the Monetary Policy Council (MPC)
increased policy interest rates by 25 bps, citing the need to respond to inflation that was persistently
above its 2½ percent target and forecasted to decline only slowly in the coming quarters, to preserve
credibility. Staff was of the view that, in light of the slowing economy, the projected decline in
inflation, and muted wage pressures, monetary tightening was not warranted. It also noted the
absence of second-round effects from the earlier increases in commodity prices (which contributed
⅔ of the increase in inflation), slowing credit growth, declining core inflation, and market
expectations that inflation will fall within the target band by 2013. In June, the MPC left rates
unchanged.
20.
The authorities’ decision to increase the level of international reserves will further
boost adequacy. Staff reiterated that, while international reserves have grown substantially and are
broadly adequate under most metrics, they failed to cover short-term debt on a remaining maturity
basis plus the current account deficit. In light of external risks and large gross external financing
needs, additional reserve accumulation would boost adequacy—despite the floating exchange rate
and the contingent balance of payments support provided by the FCL arrangement. Staff also
suggested that a clearly-specified strategy on the pace of reserve accumulation would improve
transparency.
21.
Monetary policy should be the first line of defense in the face of an adverse external
shock. In the face of a deeper downturn, the policy rate should be cut and the cushioning role of the
flexible exchange rate should be exploited to the maximum extent possible. However, given the
stock of foreign-currency denominated mortgages, careful attention would need to be paid to the
effects of zloty depreciation on bank liquidity, and bank and household balance sheets. In this
regard, the NBP’s readiness to provide liquidity both in zloty and foreign currency is welcome. At the
same time, staff recognized that, in the event of a severe shock, particularly if Poland faces capital
outflows, monetary policy options may be constrained by the need to avoid excessive zloty
depreciation.

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 5. What Drives the POLONIA Spread?1
The Polish central bank implements monetary policy by conducting open market operations to keep
the Polish Overnight Index Average (POLONIA) in close proximity to the policy rate. The ability to do so,
as an initial step in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, can transmit the monetary policy signal to
the cost of funding for banks and lending rates. The POLONIA movement has closely followed the tightening
and easing cycles of the monetary policies. However, since 2009, the POLONIA has often stayed below the
policy rate and has done so persistently.
Several potential candidates that could influence the spread between the POLONIA and the policy rate,
or the “POLONIA spread”, are explored. The interaction of liquidity supply and demand determines the
liquidity situation in the interbank market and hence the spread. This could be influenced by the NBP’s FX
purchases from the MOF, banks’ liquidity demand as reflected in their participation in NBP’s OMOs, and
frontloading of the fulfillment of the reserve requirement. The stress in euro area and domestic interbank
markets could also contribute to the movements of the spread. In addition, the NBP’s repo and fine-tuning
operations may affect the liquidity situation and influence the spread.

An empirical analysis confirms the persistently
negative POLONIA spread since 2009. This is related
to the existence of the structural liquidity in the
banking system—NBP’s FX purchases—and banks’
underbidding due to unwillingness to lock up liquidity
in the seven-day NBP bills. The frontloading of banks’
fulfillment of the reserve requirements also plays a
role, particularly during the last few days of the
maintenance period. In addition, external market
sentiment also has some influence on the spread.

Sources: NBP; Reuters; and IMF staff estimates.

NBP’s response to the fluid liquidity situation has
been effective. The repo operations initiated as a response to the financial crisis have played a positive role
in steering the POLONIA towards the policy rate. The liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operations seem to be
successful in reducing both the level and volatility of the POLONIA spread, particularly in the case of the
regular fine-tuning operations introduced recently. However, the persistently negative spread may have
weakened the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
It is challenging to keep the POLONIA in close proximity to the policy rate. It requires a stable external
environment that reduces banks’ incentive to hoard liquidity. In the short term, the NBP should be provided
with the necessary information to forecast liquidity. In this regard, it is important for the NBP to have
advanced information regarding MOF’s anticipated FX exchanges. In the medium to long term, enhancing the
activities of interbank market and developing long-term local currency funding could help banks to conduct
better asset and liability management, a conduit for the improvement of the monetary policy transmission
mechanism.

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities agreed that monetary policy should remain accommodative. Even with
the recent rate hike, they felt that monetary policy would still provide support to the economy. They
also agreed that there was scope to cut policy rates in the event of a deeper downturn and a weaker
outlook for inflation.

B. Entrenching Fiscal Consolidation
23.
The fiscal deficit was reduced significantly in 2011. With public debt close to an
important legal threshold, deficit reduction was essential.1 The fiscal deficit dropped from
7¾ percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.1 percent in 2011 on the back of buoyant tax collections, a
redirection of pension contributions from the second to the first pillar, and fiscal consolidation
measures. The latter included an increase in VAT rates, a freeze in PIT thresholds, and a temporary
expenditure rule that included a public wage freeze. Public debt (ESA95 basis) increased to about
56 percent of GDP (53.5 percent of GDP based on the national definition and below the preventive
constitutional threshold).

The Public Finance Act establishes two preventive debt thresholds that apply to the national definition of public debt (excluding
the debt of the National Road Fund that is included in the ESA95 definition). The first threshold, at 50 percent of GDP is mainly
indicative. The second threshold, at 55 percent of GDP, requires the implementation of fiscal measures to curb the increase in debt,
including a nominal wage freeze, increases in VAT rates, and a limit on pension indexation. The Constitution caps public debt at
60 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

25.
Reducing public debt is a key medium-term priority. A much lower public debt ratio
would rebuild buffers and give policymakers flexibility to respond to future shocks. In this regard, the
authorities’ medium-term objective (MTO) of a 1 percent of GDP structural fiscal deficit by 2015 is
appropriate. Based on current policies, staff estimates that additional measures of about ¾-1 percent
of GDP would be necessary to achieve the MTO. In this regard, staff noted the sizable cuts in public
investment in the authorities’ fiscal program and saw merit in a broad review of expenditures to
identify priorities and areas where low-priority spending can be reduced. This will help avoid
excessive cuts in public investment, which is crucial to meeting Poland’s still-significant infrastructure
needs. In addition, there is scope to simplify and eliminate inefficiencies in the tax system and to
reduce tax preferences.
26.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to introduce a permanent fiscal rule. The
authorities are considering an expenditure-based rule with a debt brake, which would limit increases
in public debt while still allowing for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Staff underscored the need for
appropriate flexibility in the rule, notably an escape clause, to ensure that the authorities have
sufficient flexibility to deal with severe shocks. The proposed rule would be anchored on the MTO,
which is sensible. Staff also welcomed the proposed fiscal rule for the local government, which would
limit their debt and deficits.
27.
The recent pension reform will contribute to Poland’s long-term fiscal sustainability. In
May, the parliament passed legislation that will gradually increase and equalize the retirement age to
67 for men and women (from 65 and 60, respectively). The increase will take place over 8 years for
men and 28 years for women. While the short-term fiscal impact of the reform will be minimal, the
long-term effect would be more substantial. Although Poland’s public pension system is already a
defined contribution scheme, the increase in the retirement age will support higher pensions in the
longer-term and reduce reliance on social benefits, which should help strengthen public finances.
Staff also welcomed the authorities’ initiatives to reform the special pension regimes and suggested
that these could be aligned with the main pension system over time.
28.
In the event of a significant deterioration of the external environment, there is scope
for some counter-cyclical fiscal response. This scope is more limited than in the past, given the
level of public debt and its closeness to the constitutional debt limit. Nonetheless, staff
recommended that automatic stabilizers be allowed to operate to support the economy and that a
credible medium-term strategy to reduce the deficit and debt over time be developed. Given the
authorities’ impressive track record of policy implementation, the latter should be straightforward.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment, but believed that the 2012
fiscal deficit and public debt ratio would be slightly lower than staff’s projection. On the
medium-term path, the authorities were of the view that the enacted measures, alongside lower
public investment, would be sufficient to achieve the MTO by 2015. They recognized the need to
protect public investment but viewed the rapid decline of public investment in their projections as
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

consistent with the drop off in EU structural funds after 2011. They noted that additional fiscal
measures could be considered, if needed, and reiterated their commitment to the fiscal
consolidation. The authorities also saw merit in conducting an expenditure review to identify priority
spending, but were less persuaded on the need for revenue measures. At the same time, they
underscored their efforts to improve the efficiency of the tax system. The authorities also emphasized
that adopting a permanent fiscal rule would further strengthen Poland’s finances in the longer term.

C. Safeguarding Financial Stability
30.
The banking system appears well prepared to withstand an adverse scenario. Stress
tests conducted by the NBP—which use a sufficiently severe set of macroeconomic assumptions—
indicate that overall the system can withstand adverse shocks. At the same time, banks financed
mainly by foreign funds or that hold large portfolios of foreign currency denominated loans would
be the most affected. Staff therefore supports the measures undertaken by KNF to strengthen the
banks’ capital and liquidity buffers which are necessary to cope with adverse market and
macroeconomic developments. The authorities’ work to develop a more comprehensive framework
for long-term bond issuance is an important step toward improving banks’ funding profiles in line
with regulatory requirements outlined in the Basel III framework.
31.
Recent supervisory measures to address the high level of foreign currency mortgages
are welcome. Increased capital and liquidity requirements have boosted buffers to deal with credit
and liquidity risks that could arise if the zloty depreciates. Staff urged the KNF to continue to
maintain close supervisory oversight of banks and implement targeted actions to contain FX lending
risks (i.e. restrictions of activities or, if needed, Pillar 2 measures). While these measures should lead
to a reduction in new foreign currency mortgages, staff suggested that a further tightening of
prudential regulations (i.e. imposing more conservative loan-to-value ceilings) should not be
excluded.
32.
Staff favored a more proactive approach to address the outstanding stock of
non-performing loans. While higher capital buffers and tighter lending standards provide
safeguards against risks to asset quality, a more proactive approach to address NPLs should be
explored, as this would help ensure that NPLs are addressed at an early stage and do not undermine
credit and growth prospects going forward. This could include increased voluntary out-of-court debt
restructuring by banks under strict prudential rules (i.e. conservative prudential treatment for loan
restructuring) and supervisory scrutiny (active onsite oversight with emphasis on loan classification
and provisioning).
33.
Recent and proposed improvements in Poland’s supervisory framework are welcome.
The KNF stepped up the intensity of its supervisory processes in line with the recommendations of
the 2011 Report on Observance of Standards and Codes, which is commendable. More frequent
onsite examinations, targeted and timely supervisory actions, and a close dialogue with home
supervisors are essential for monitoring and containing risks in the banking sector. Additional

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

supervisory resources may be needed to ensure that the KNF can effectively increase the scope and
intensity of supervision, including of the credit union sector (SKOK).
34.
A specific bank resolution regime would enable the authorities to resolve financial
institutions promptly and in an orderly manner. Work on such a framework, led by the Bank
Guarantee Fund (BFG) and with the engagement of the World Bank, should provide a diversified
toolkit and a clearly identified resolution authority, taking into consideration the Financial Stability
Board’s Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes and evolving European legislation. Conclusion
of this work and passage of relevant legislation are priorities.
35.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to establish a macro-prudential framework
under the aegis of a multi-agency Systemic Risk Board. In line with the recommendations of the
European Systemic Risk Board, the framework should aim to identify, monitor, and contain systemic
risks and to become fully operational by end-June 2013.2 Close cooperation among relevant
authorities is necessary in the process of developing the proposed legislative and operational
frameworks and IMF technical assistance was provided in this area.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities emphasized that they are implementing forward looking reforms to
further strengthen the financial sector. They noted that key initiatives, including developing an
effective resolution regime, a well articulated macro-prudential framework, and a deeper market for
long-term bond issuance, all aim at improving the resilience of the financial sector. The authorities
welcomed the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update scheduled for 2013 as an
opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions on financial sector issues, including in the areas of
supervisory framework, crisis management and resolution, and macro-prudential policies.

D. Deepening Structural Reforms and Euro Adoption
37.
Deepening structural reforms is crucial for long-term growth. The remaining structural
rigidities appear high, as suggested by the still low labor participation rates compared to the EU
average, or the low place in cross-country rankings of business climate. Despite continued
privatization efforts, the share of the public sector has stabilized around 20 percent of GDP in recent
years. Pushing forward structural reforms is vital to boost growth potential in the long-term.
38.
Further progress was made in eliminating structural bottlenecks over the past year. The
recently passed pension reform should improve labor participation. Measures to reduce

administrative burdens enacted last year broadened the use of electronic documents, simplified
one-stop-shop regulations, and replaced many documentation requirements with declarations.
Privatization was continued despite unfavorable market conditions: roughly 200 firms were sold in
2011, yielding receipts of around 1 percent of GDP.
39.

Possible reforms include:



Labor market: The labor market would benefit from better job-matching services, and the
pilot project to address regional disparities in employment conditions by targeting services
to local needs is welcome. Given high youth unemployment, efforts to reduce
skill-mismatches by better aligning the education system to job needs should continue.
Anti-crisis employment provisions, including flexible rules on short-term contracts, could be
made permanent.



Product markets: Given the large number of licensed professions, plans to ease access to
them are welcome. Streamlined rules for construction permits and land use would also
improve the business climate. Privatization should be continued, guided by the authorities’
goal to reduce the public sector’s role in the economy, and the government’s program covers
300 firms in 2012–13.

40.
Euro adoption remains an important long-term objective. The authorities continue to
make progress toward convergence, fulfilling the entry criteria, and preparing necessary changes to
the Constitution. No target date has been announced.
Authorities’ views
41.
The authorities expressed their strong commitment to continuing structural reforms.
They concurred with the staff on the importance of reforms for long-term growth. They pointed to
measures taken in the education system, including a greater focus on, and financial support for,
math and hard sciences. They also noted increased access to pre-school facilities, which should
improve the quality of education and facilitate women’s labor force participation. Reforms of the tax
and social security systems for farmers—to better align them with the main system—are being
considered.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Poland has performed even better than expected in the face of a challenging external
environment. This has reflected very strong fundamentals, robust domestic demand, and sound
macroeconomic management. Poland’s precautionary Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the IMF
has helped maintain confidence in the country’s policies. Fiscal space to respond to adverse shocks is
now more limited, and there remain some vulnerabilities.

43.
The economy is slowing and external risks are rising. Uncertainty, confidence effects,
lower external demand, and tighter lending conditions are weighing on growth. Risks are to the
downside, and emanate mainly from the possibility of an intensification of the euro zone crisis.
Poland’s high interconnectedness with Europe would give rise to adverse spillovers through trade,
FDI, and financial channels. Shifts in investor risk appetite could also have an impact, given Poland’s
large external financing needs. Recent actions by the authorities—including frontloaded public debt
issuance and supervisory actions to further strengthen banks’ buffers—help mitigate these risks.
44.
The fiscal adjustment has been impressive and should continue. After declining by nearly
3 percentage points of GDP in 2011, the deficit is expected to decline by a further 2 percentage
points of GDP—reaching 3.1 percent of GDP—in 2012. This should start to put public debt firmly on
a downward path. If the growth outlook were to deteriorate significantly, automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate to support the economy.
45.
Public debt should be further reduced over the medium term to rebuild fiscal buffers.
The authorities’ MTO of achieving a structural fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2015 is
appropriate and should allow for sustained reductions in public debt. Additional permanent fiscal
measures of about ¾-1 percent of GDP will be needed to achieve the MTO. Although some decline
in EU-funded public investment is appropriate given its very high current levels, excessive cuts
should be avoided given Poland’s still-significant infrastructure needs. The proposed permanent
fiscal rule, anchored on the MTO, should strengthen public finances while still providing flexibility to
deal with unexpected shocks. The recent pension reform will contribute to long-term fiscal
sustainability.
46.
Monetary policy should remain on hold. Given the economic slowdown, the projected
drop in inflation, and muted wage pressures, hikes in policy interest rates do not appear warranted. If
the economy were to slow significantly and the outlook for inflation to weaken, rates should be cut.
In the event of an external shock that gives rise to liquidity strains, the NBP should provide
emergency liquidity support in both zloty and foreign currency, as was the case during past episodes
of financial turbulence. International reserves have grown substantially in recent years, and the
decision to increase them will further boost adequacy.
47.
The banking system has continued to perform well, and recent supervisory measures
are helping to contain risks. The banking system has remained highly profitable, well capitalized,
and liquid. Nonetheless, mortgage portfolios denominated in foreign currency and non-performing
loans (NPLs) continue to pose risks. Higher capital and liquidity buffers are helping to mitigate these
risks, and the KNF’s regulatory tightening and increased supervisory oversight should lead to a
deceleration of new foreign currency mortgage lending. A more proactive approach to addressing
NPLs would further strengthen the resilience of the banking system.
48.
Recent and proposed improvements to the frameworks for financial sector supervision,
funding, resolution, and stability are commendable. More frequent on-site supervision, targeted
and timely supervisory action, and a close dialogue with home supervisors are essential to monitor
22

and contain risks in the banking sector. The work to develop more comprehensive framework for
long-term bond issuance will help improve bank funding profiles. A specific bank resolution regime
is needed to enable the authorities to resolve financial institutions promptly and in an orderly
manner and work in this area should be given high priority. The authorities’ intention to establish a
macro-prudential framework to identify, monitor, and contain systemic risks is welcome.
49.
Long-term economic prospects will depend crucially on structural reforms. Continued
reforms would further unleash growth potential, and are especially important given Poland’s adverse
demographic trends. Strengthening the functioning of the labor market, improving the business
climate, and advancing privatization plans are key areas of reform.
50.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation remain on a 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Corporate Bond Market Development
and Local Currency Funding
The Polish domestic corporate bond market is underdeveloped. The Polish corporate sector
relies mainly on bank loans for financing as only a few large companies are able to tap the corporate
bond market. The corporate bond market is eclipsed by the marketable treasury securities market in
both the size and liquidity. At end-2010, the outstanding amount of corporate bonds was about
2 percent of GDP—relatively low compared with other emerging economies—while the size of
marketable treasury securities reached 33 percent of GDP. Short-term corporate bonds accounted
for about 37 percent of the total stock of corporate bonds, which may indicate the limited availability
of long-term funding for the corporate sector. The main investors for long-term corporate bonds are
domestic banks and investment funds, with limited participation by pension funds.

Barriers to growth in the corporate bond market arise from both the supply and demand sides.
Raising funds by issuing bonds is too expensive for small and medium enterprises, while large
companies with foreign capital have alternative sources of financing, such as borrowing funds from
intra-company capital markets. As a result, only about 180 companies have long-term bonds
currently listed in the market. The majority of bonds and issuers have not been rated, leaving
investors to assess the risk. Furthermore, the low volume of issues and low liquidity in the secondary
market dampen the demand for corporate bonds. The dominance of OTC transactions hinders the
development of the secondary market, while the newly-introduced Catalyst still needs time to take
off.1

Polish financial institutions issue limited amounts of bonds domestically. The outstanding
amount of domestic financial bonds was about 2 percent of GDP—low compared with some
emerging economies. Given the structural liquidity surplus in the banking system, banks prefer to
earn interest margins from deposits and have little incentive to issue bonds. Long-term bank debt
securities were only 5.2bn zloty at end-2010, representing only 0.5 percent of banking sector
liabilities.

The mortgage bond market remains very small. In 2010, the outstanding amount was only
0.2 percent of GDP. This is insufficient to meet the needs of banks that wish to reduce reliance on
parent funding or foreign exchange derivatives to finance their foreign currency mortgage loan
portfolios (13 percent of GDP at end-2011). Notably, there are legal impediments to issuing

mortgage bonds2, for example, concerns for asset encumbrance issues. In addition, due to zloty
depreciation, according to the KNF, about one third of foreign currency mortgages had an LTV ratio
above 100 percent at 2011Q3, increasing the difficulty of issuing mortgage bonds.
Much needs to be done to further develop non-government bond markets and reduce the
banking sector’s maturity mismatch. From the supply side, the government’s commitment to
reducing the public debt ratio is welcome, as it will reduce competition with corporate bond
investors. Regulatory incentives, such as liquidity requirements aimed at narrowing maturity gaps
would encourage banks to gradually lengthen funding maturity. Recent steps to develop the
framework for long-term bond issuance are also helpful. From the demand side, pension funds, with
15 percent of GDP in assets under management, should be encouraged to play an important role in
providing steady demand for long-term zloty assets. Moving the trade of corporate and bank bonds
from the OTC to an exchange platform, such as the newly created Catalyst, and improving its
institutional support could enhance the transparency and efficiency of secondary market
transactions.

Appendix II. Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises
Privatization efforts have continued in recent years, despite deteriorating market sentiment.
These accelerated visibly after 2008 (left panel), with the strategy for 2008–11 envisaging ownership
changes in about 800 enterprises. The goal was almost met, with some 750 firms subject to
privatization in the last four years, of which 200 in 2011. Privatization receipts amounted to
PLN13.1 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) last year, somewhat below the budgeted PLN15 billion. The
receipts could have been higher, but deteriorating market sentiment prompted a delay in sale of a
minority stake in Polish largest bank (PKO BP).

1/ Public sector value added to GDP.

Most privatization receipts in 2011 reflected large transactions, but without a shift of control
to the private sector. Around 200 firms were covered by privatization in 2011, and more than
80 percent of receipts reflected six largest deals. However, the state retained control, as these firms
were deemed to be strategically important (Table 1). For some of them, notably those listed on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange, revisions to corporate statutes restricted the voting power of private
investors. This enables the government to maintain strategic control without having a majority stake
(Table 2).It also illustrates that even substantial receipts do not necessarily imply a growing role of
the private sector. Indeed, despite a visible pickup in receipts, share of the public sector in GDP has
remained stable in recent years (right panel).

For 2012, the full-year privatization goal looks achievable. Receipts are budgeted at
PLN10 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) in 2012, of which 30 percent was collected in the first four months.
Most of this reflected sale of a minority stake in Polish largest energy firm (PGE). Barring a major
deterioration in market sentiment, the full-year goal appears achievable. Receipts could be, for
example, generated by possible sale of shares in the largest insurer (PZU SA) and the largest bank
(PKO BP). Despite having only minority stakes, the government will maintain control in these
systemically important financial firms.

While continued privatization is envisaged in 2013, the receipts are set to decline. The recently
approved strategy for 2012–13 assumes that 300 firms will be covered privatization, in most cases
involving sale of majority stakes. If completed, this would leave the Ministry of Treasury as an owner
of about 100 firms. However, the overall public ownership will remain much broader, as it currently
covers above 2,500 companies, many of them owned by local authorities. The strategy assumes that
privatization receipts will be PLN5 billion (0.3 percent of projected GDP) in 2013, half of the amount
budgeted this year.
The authorities intend to improve corporate governance in public firms. The recently issued
code of good practices for strategic companies requires, inter alia, that the management selection
will be contracted to headhunting agencies. There is also a plan to enact a law on ownership
oversight, which would set common standards for all public companies.

Appendix III. Credit Growth and Non-Performing Loans—
Recent Developments and Outlook
Like many other countries, Poland experienced rapid expansion of bank credit in the years
leading to the global financial crisis. This trend was driven by common factors: relatively low
credit-to-GDP ratios and rising per capita incomes at the outset, ample liquidity in global capital
markets, and extensive foreign bank entry. In this setting, internationally active banks used their
group structures to exploit arbitrage opportunities, funding a rapid expansion of domestic retail
credit via cross-border intra-group funding supported by the issuance of wholesale liabilities abroad.
Credit growth declined in the aftermath of the crisis, following somewhat different trajectories
across segments. Credit market dynamics after the outbreak of the crisis reflected demand and
supply factors. On the demand side, the deceleration of economic activity caused a concomitant
reduction in the financing needs of households and enterprises. On the supply side, the deterioration
in borrower’s creditworthiness during the downturn, combined with a more challenging environment
for parent banks and the application of more conservative lending standards—also in response to
regulatory changes—caused a retrenchment in credit supply. The latter was more pronounced in
segments with a history of rapid credit growth, and toward borrowers deemed to be riskier.
The bulk of bank credit is toward domestic residents, but about two-thirds of the mortgage
portfolios are denominated in foreign currency. Loans to resident firms and households account
for virtually the entire the loan book. But, the mortgage portfolio is predominantly denominated in
foreign currency, reflecting bank lending practices in the run up to the crisis. At end-2011, about half
of the mortgage loans were denominated in Swiss francs, and an additional 10 percent in other
currencies, with zloty-denominated mortgages accounting for 37 percent.
Loan impairments increased sharply in recent years and, despite some improvement of late,
have remained at relatively high levels. After peaking to about 8¾ percent of gross loans in 2009,
non-performing loans (NPLs) declined to 8¼ percent in 2011, partly owing to the strengthening of
credit growth. Loan quality, however, was heterogeneous across categories. In the corporate book
portfolio, NPLs averaged about 11 percent in 2011. Impairment ratios were generally higher for loans
to SMEs, and for firms operating in some segments of construction and real estate, where NPL ratios
surpassed 20 percent in 2011. Concentration in corporate credit portfolios was also significant, as
large exposures (i.e., above half-million PLN) represented 6 times banks’ capital. Large exposures to
corporate firms in some sectors (particularly construction and real estate, retail trade, and food
processing), need to be closely monitored due to their size and high impairment ratios. Regarding
credit to households, the value of impaired loans increased throughout 2011, albeit at a slower pace
than credit expansion, resulting in a mild stabilization of NPL ratios. The latter have remained above
18 percent for consumer and credit card loans, albeit the size of these portfolios is not material from
the systemic perspective. On the other hand, credit quality in mortgage portfolios extended a mild
deterioration, with NPLs surpassing 2 percent in 2011.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Against this background, the two main sources of credit risk originate from mortgage
portfolios in foreign currency and loan concentration to real estate and other highly cyclical
sectors. System-wide, a source of credit risk stems from legacy mortgages in foreign currency, which
exposes unhedged borrowers to zloty depreciation—particularly vis-à-vis the Swiss franc. While the
prevalence of floating interest rates in these mortgages offers some relief (as lower interest rates
have helped keep debt servicing costs manageable), high loan-to-value ratios—in some cases above
100 percent—expose lenders and borrowers to risks of a further downward movement in housing
prices. The effects of zloty depreciation on loan quality may also be non-linear beyond specific
thresholds. Another important source of risk stems from concentration in some banks’ corporate
portfolios, particularly to real estate developers and building companies—where non-performing
loans have remained high—and to firms operating in highly cyclical sectors, such retail trade.
Given the slowing economy, loan quality may erode in the period ahead. Economic activity and
labor market dynamics, combined with exchange rate movements, are likely to be the key driving
factors of loan quality in the period ahead. The slowdown in economic activity is expected to have an
adverse impact on loan quality in the corporate loan portfolio. In turn, credit quality in the mortgage
book is likely to be affected by labor market conditions, which are expected to remain weak. In
addition, credit quality in the mortgage portfolio is likely to erode as recent vintages mature (i.e.,
about 45 percent of total mortgages were originated in 2007−08). While staff’s baseline forecast
does not envisage downward pressure on house prices, further declines cannot be ruled out,
particularly if economic growth were to slow by more than expected amid already high inventory
levels.1
In this context, supervisory actions to
strengthen bank lending practices
should be complemented with a more
proactive approach to existing NPLs.
The increased supervisory focus on bank
lending origination practices, particularly
in the area of FX-denominated mortgages,
is an important step in the right direction.
These efforts may need to be
complemented by a more proactive
approach to address the level of NPLs,
particularly in the corporate sector. This
could include voluntary out-of-court loan
restructuring, subject to strict prudential
supervision on loan classification practices
by banks.

Appendix IV. Poland’s Export Structure
This appendix highlights some key features of Poland’s export structure, complementing Box 4 on
financial and trade linkages. It also provides some observations about Poland’s role in the German
supply chain, reflecting recent IMF research on the changing pattern of global trade1.

providing components for goods whose final
destination within Europe is Germany. In contrast, exports to Latin America have not changed
significantly and those of other destinations have declined.
The structure of Poland’s exports may provide indirect access to Asia. While the EU remains
Poland’s main trading partner, a heavier reliance on Germany is viewed by many as a gateway to
non-European markets, particularly Asia. Exports to China, for example, make up 5 percent of
German exports, and these are concentrated in automobiles and related parts. While it is difficult to
measure, CEE inputs (including those of Poland) into German cars suggest indirect linkages to Asian
demand. This trade contributed to the relative outperformance of the German economy within the
Euro Area since 2009 and is therefore a contributor to the resilience of Polish economy.
Poland is vertically specialized in the German supply chain. T he foreign value added (FVA) in
Polish exports has increased dramatically since the mid-1990s2. The FVA accounts for about half of
the growth of Polish exports over this period, with the largest contributors being Germany and the
other EU countries. However, relative to some regional peers, foreign input has not played as much
of a role. A closer look at the sectoral distrbution of exports indicates that Poland provides both
intermediate goods (particulary auto components and assembly of washing machines and dryers) as
well as final goods such as food, wood, and furniture.

Integration into the supply chain supports an
increasing technological intensity of exports. The
technological intensity of exports has risen, as
integration into the supply chain has strengthened
through the years. The share of hi-tech and mediumhigh tech products in exports rose from about 40
percent in 2000 to 50 percent in 2010. These gains
also reflect an increasing technology intensity in
imports, more so than domestically produced and
developed componets.

Poland has an advantage in products where German demand is growing. Poland has a revealed
comparative advantage (RCA)3 in many of the products in which German imports have been growing
since Poland joined the EU. Looking at the top 20 product classes that Germany imports from
Poland, most have an RCA index above 1, indicating that Poland has an advantage. The highest
RCA’s are in furniture and wood produts and dried fish. For most of the products, the value of total
world imports to Germany are also growing, except in furniture and passenger cars. About half of the
products are also experiencing above average German import growth, especially in copper, washers
and dryers, and TV receivers.

(Scale—high, medium, or low)

Nature/ Source
of Main Threats

1. Strong
intensification of

crisis.

2. Protracted
slowdown in
economic activity
in Europe.

3. Excessive pace
of parent bank
deleveraging.

4. Substantial
and prolonged
increase in oil
prices.

5. Excessive
decline in public
investment.

Relative Likelihood of Threat
Medium
 Adverse feedback loops between
sovereigns and banks pose significant
risks to euro area economic activity
going forward.
 Episodes of strong market pressure on
euro zone economies are likely to
reverberate across financial markets
and asset classes including a significant
depreciation of the zloty.

High
 Fiscal consolidation in euro area
countries could have stronger-thanexpected adverse effects on growth.
 Prolonged uncertainty could have
dampening effects on growth.

Medium
 European banks are expected to
engage in substantial deleveraging in
the period ahead, including via balance
sheet contraction.
 Excessive or uncoordinated
deleveraging by these banks would
have adverse effects on credit supply
and economic activity.

Medium
 A protracted increase in oil prices could
result from global demand outpacing
supply.
 Geopolitical tensions involving major
oil exporters could cause periods of
sharp increases in oil prices.
Medium
 A substantial cut in EU-transfers would
affect the government’s capacity to
fund investment in public
infrastructure.
 Without additional fiscal consolidation
measures to reach the medium-term
fiscal objective (MTO), excessive cutbacks in public investment may
materialize.

Overall Level of Concern
Expected Impact if Threat is Realized
High
 Substantial trade and financial linkages with Europe
entail a direct channel of contagion. External distress can
affect Poland through its large gross external financing
needs, including the substantial share of foreign
investors in the government bond market.
 Significant zloty depreciation would lead to liquidity
strains and credit losses (including possibly higher NPLs)
in some banks with FX denominated mortgage
portfolios. But the stock of these mortgages is low
relative to the size of the economy (13 percent of GDP).
 Sound public debt management, significant prefinancing, and the government’s large liquidity cushion
help mitigate risks to government financing.
Medium
 Substantial trade linkages with Europe would weaken
growth in Poland through lower exports.
 Banks’ asset quality would deteriorate, with implications
for capital adequacy and credit supply.
 The space for counter-cyclical fiscal policy is narrower
than in the past.
 Poland’s economy is relatively closed (exports are
40 percent of GDP), so domestic demand could offset.
Medium
 Excessive deleveraging could result in a credit squeeze,
with adverse implications for growth in Poland.
 The modest size of domestic credit markets, moderate
loan-to-deposit ratio, and high capitalization, profitability
and liquidity of the banking system help to mitigate risks.
 Strong corporate balance sheets, the reliance of the
corporate sector on retained earnings to finance
investment, and the ability of domestic banks to extend
credit help to cushion the impact of a credit squeeze on
the economy.
Low
 An oil price shock would have adverse implications for
growth and inflation in Poland.
 Still high unemployment may dampen second-round
effects.
 Poland’s energy intensity declined rapidly in the past
decade, although it remains above the EU average.
Medium
 Near-term growth would be lower than under the
baseline.
 Potential growth would be adversely affected, given
Poland’s still significant infrastructure needs.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The zloty is freely floating.
Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. Poland
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed by Poland
solely for the preservation of national or international security as introduced by the European
Union within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The consolidated
list of such sanctions is available at: http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/consol-list_en.htm.

VIII.

Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 1, 2011. In concluding the consultation,
Directors welcomed the return of Poland’s economy to solid growth in 2010, supported by
timely and forceful countercyclical policy responses to the global crisis. Directors welcomed
the recent increases in the policy interest rate and noted that some further gradual hikes in
the policy rate are warranted to bring inflation back to target, while efforts should continue
to improve monetary policy communication. On fiscal policy, Directors welcomed the
substantial fiscal consolidation that is already under way. Directors supported the authorities’
plan to adopt an expenditure-based fiscal rule, complemented by efforts to strengthen
budgetary processes, tighten entitlement programs, and streamline the public
administration. Directors commended the Polish authorities for the steps already taken to
improve the effectiveness of financial sector surveillance policies. They encouraged further
efforts to strengthen the resilience to the financial sector. Directors underscored that a
further increase in labor participation and a reduction in product market rigidities are key to
boosting potential growth. Directors welcomed recent improvements to the balance of
payments compilation system, which have reduced errors and omission.

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles and disseminates
annual and quarterly GDP at current and constant prices following 1993 SNA and ESA
1995. Moreover, a full set of accounts, including financial accounts by institutional
sectors are compiled too. There are inconsistencies between annual and higher
frequency data reflecting differences in weights and in coverage. Electronic retrieval of
the data is challenging. The sub-annual data are collected on a cumulative rather than
on a discrete basis, and plans to introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed.
Seasonal adjustment on relatively short interval leads to frequent and large backward
revisions.
Price Statistics: The CPI does not cover the imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings.
The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural areas.
The PPI does not include any estimation for missing prices or quality and seasonal
adjustments.
Government Finance Statistics: General government data are released on a quarterly
basis, and compiled on the same basis as the annual general government data, i.e.
derived from detailed ESA accounts (ESA = European System of Accounts). Revenue and
expense are available according to the full economic classification and, in addition,
expense is also available according to COFOG (Classification of the Functions of
Government).
Further significant enhancements to government sources of data are necessary to
comply with the accrual basis of reporting, and to compile full information on financial
and nonfinancial asset stock data for general government.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT–INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (Cont’d)
Monetary Statistics: Beginning with data for January 2004, the NBP compiles monetary
accounts in accordance with the ECB’s framework for monetary statistics using the
national residency approach. An earlier ROSC mission recommended that the NBP, in
cooperation with the MoF, reconcile monetary and government finance statistics and
carry out a reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
Balance of Payments: Largely to improve data accuracy, the NBP reduced its reliance
on International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) data and increased its reliance on
survey-based source data, starting in the first quarter of 2010; however, the size of errors
and omissions remained unacceptably high. In 2009 and 2010, errors and omissions
were larger than the current account deficit. STA undertook an evaluation mission to
Poland in July 2009 (prior to the implementation of the new compilation system) to
examine possible causes of the large and growing net errors and omissions. Among
those potential sources were financial account transactions (by banks and nonbanks),
goods imports, and weaknesses in data capture through the ITRS.
During the 2011 IMF Spring Meetings, the NBP informed of data improvements work
that the NBP and GUS had undertaken, and revisions that it anticipated incorporating in
the external sector accounts at end-June 2011. A STA mission followed up on these
issues during June 6-10, 2011. The mission concluded that the intended revisions to the
Polish data are based on appropriate compilation techniques. The revisions would affect
the estimates from 2004 forward.
Poland has conducted much research into trade in used cars (imports of used cars from
Germany may have been missed); remittances (incoming private transfers may be
overstated and outgoing private transfers may be understated); repurchase agreements
(a limited amount of double counting of financial transactions in repos may have
occurred); and overseas assets of non-financial corporations (these may be misreported
or missed). Further, the NBP’s new survey-based compilation system has had an overall
positive impact on data quality.
The mission also advised that research may usefully be conducted into the valuation of
exports and imports of goods and the coverage of derivatives transactions.

POLAND: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Republic of Poland
July 2, 2012
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff Report was
circulated to the Executive Board on June 19, 2012. The information does not alter the thrust
of the staff appraisal.

1.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) and Swiss National Bank (SNB) signed a
Swiss franc/zloty swap agreement on June 25. Treated as a precautionary measure, the
swap agreement would allow the NBP to provide Swiss franc liquidity to banks in Poland in
the event of major Swiss franc funding pressures. In contrast to the Swiss franc/euro swap
agreement between the NBP and SNB in November 2008, this one allows the NBP to
directly swap zloty into Swiss francs. The term of the swap transactions is one week, and all
swap transactions require the SNB’s prior approval. The amount and detailed terms have not
been disclosed.
2.
With the latest eurobond issue, the Ministry of Finance has met its total foreign
currency debt redemption needs for this year. On June 11, a 10-year eurobond worth
EUR1.5 billion was issued. The bond has a fixed coupon of 3.75 percent (a spread of 247bps
over similar German Bunds at issuance). This issue, together with a few recent domestic
issues and a loan from the World Bank, has allowed the government to meet 80 percent of
total gross financing needs thus far, compared with the 70 percent achieved in mid-May.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Poland
On July 2, 2012 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background
The economy fared well throughout the crisis, and growth was robust and well-balanced
in 2011. Despite substantial fiscal consolidation and challenging external conditions, real
GDP expanded by a solid 4¼ percent, driven by a strong rebound of fixed investment—
mainly infrastructure spending—and net exports, which picked up toward the end of the
year. The current account deficit improved to 4.3 percent of GDP, and was largely
financed by capital transfers from the EU and net FDI inflows.
The fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting buoyant tax
collections and consolidation measures. The government’s financing needs were
comfortably met in financial markets (with successful international bond issuance and
increasing foreign holdings of domestic government securities) and also helped by
privatization receipts. Fiscal consolidation measures amounting to 1¼ percent of GDP
are being implemented in 2012. A narrowing of local government deficits and a
redirection of pension contributions from the second to the first pillar are expected to
generate an additional ¾ percent of GDP in general government deficit reduction.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Throughout 2011, headline inflation remained persistently above the National Bank of
Poland’s (NBP) target (2½ percent), driven by energy and commodity prices, increases
in administered prices and VAT rates, and robust economic activity. In response, the
NBP hiked the policy rate by a cumulative 100 basis points to 4½ percent in the first
half-of 2011, before pausing for nearly a year. A further rate hike to 4¾ percent took
place in May 2012. Meanwhile, wage pressures have remained subdued and there is no
compelling evidence of second round effects.
The banking sector remained profitable and well-capitalized. Declining provisioning
boosted profitability and the average capital adequacy ratio remained high at around
13 percent. The nonperforming loan ratio reached 8.2 percent at end-2011, helped by a
recovery in credit growth. In response to credit risk stemming from foreign currency
denominated mortgages, the authorities tightened the prudential framework and asked
banks with riskier profiles to retain profits. The latest stress tests by the NBP showed
that the majority of banks are resilient to adverse macro scenarios, with some
institutions exposed to liquidity risk stemming from the hedging of their foreign exchange
positions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for sound macroeconomic management,
which has underpinned the good performance of the Polish economy in a challenging
environment. Directors noted that Poland’s precautionary Flexible Credit Line
arrangement has contributed to maintaining confidence and the forward momentum of
the recovery. However, in light of continued regional turbulence and weakening growth
prospects, Directors encouraged the authorities to address remaining vulnerabilities.
Directors observed that Poland’s strong economic links to the rest of Europe and
large external financing needs could give rise to adverse spillovers. Directors noted,
however, that recent actions by the authorities, including frontloading public debt
issuance and further strengthening banks’ capital and liquidity buffers, should help
mitigate these risks.
Directors broadly supported the on-going fiscal adjustment, which is necessary to
rebuild fiscal buffers. Most Directors, however, considered that automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate if growth slows more than anticipated. Over the medium
term, additional permanent fiscal measures would be needed to achieve the authorities’
medium-term objective, but excessive cuts in public investment should be avoided.
Directors welcomed the proposed fiscal rule and the recent pension reform, which
should strengthen public finances and contribute to long-term fiscal and external
sustainability.

3

Directors agreed that, given the absence of inflationary pressures, monetary policy
should remain on hold. In case the inflation outlook worsens, the National Bank of
Poland (NBP) has room to respond while trying to avoid abrupt exchange rate
adjustments. Directors concurred that the NBP should stand ready to provide
emergency liquidity support if needed. They noted that the decision to increase
international reserves could further boost the adequacy of external buffers, although, in
the view of a few Directors, the costs of this strategy would need to be considered.
Directors noted the resilience of Poland’s banking system, but underscored that
vulnerabilities remain owing to households’ foreign currency exposure and nonperforming loans (NPLs). Directors welcomed recent supervisory measures to contain
foreign currency lending and encouraged a more proactive approach to addressing
NPLs. Directors commended the recent and proposed improvements to the oversight of
the financial sector, including plans to establish a macro-prudential framework, and
underscored the need to develop a bank resolution regime.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue with structural reforms in order to boost
the growth potential. In particular, they stressed the importance of strengthening the
labor market, improving the business climate, and advancing privatization plans.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, Alternate Executive Director for the
Republic of Poland and Beata Jajko, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 2, 2012
On behalf of the Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
consultations held in Warsaw and the comprehensive set of papers. Our authorities broadly
agree with the staff assessment and policy recommendations.
Economic Outlook
After robust economic growth in 2011, private consumption and investments are slowing.
Fiscal consolidation and shrinking availability of EU structural funds weigh adversely on
public demand. In addition, developments in Europe weaken external demand and add to
uncertainty. As a result, the Polish economy is expected to grow by 2.5 percent in 2012 as
opposed to 4.3 percent in 2011.
Over the medium term, the economic outlook should improve, driven by a rebound in
domestic demand. But given strong trade and financial linkages with the EU, risks are on the
downside. The unemployment rate will likely remain relatively high, at around 12.5 percent
on average, before the economy gains momentum and the expected benefits of labor market
reforms materialize.
Poland continues to benefit from the Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the Fund which
provides an additional reserve buffer and helps strengthen investor confidence.
Fiscal Policy
The Polish authorities are determined to further reduce the fiscal imbalance in order to ensure
long-term fiscal sustainability. The measures undertaken—both on the expenditure and
revenue sides—aim at bringing the general government deficit in line with the Excessive
Deficit Procedure (EDP) in 2012 and narrowing the structural deficit to meet the medium
term objective, i.e., 1 percent of GDP, by 2015. Mindful of fragile growth, the authorities
carefully design measures to reduce expenditure and boost expenditure effectiveness. They
also continue to improve the efficiency of the tax system. A detailed description of the fiscal
measures was presented by the authorities in the 2012 update of the Convergence
Programme. In addition, the 2013 budget assumptions approved by the Council of Ministers
in June 2012 are in line with the fiscal consolidation path.
The 2011–12 consolidation package has already resulted in a strong reduction of the
general government deficit—from 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.1 percent in 2011. The
share of general government expenditure in GDP (after excluding budget co-financing of
projects financed with the EU structural funds) has been put on a downward path, and in
2012 it is expected to reach its lowest level in the last two decades. Moreover, the austerity
effort is expected to reverse the growth of the general government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2012.
Simultaneously, the authorities continue to strengthen the fiscal framework and increase
fiscal discipline on all levels of the general government. A temporary expenditure rule on the
central level and deficit-reducing rules on the local level are already in place. In addition, the

2
authorities continue to work on the fiscal responsibility law and a permanent fiscal rule,
which are expected to be enacted in 2013. An expenditure review is also in the pipeline.
Monetary Policy
In 2011 despite tightened monetary conditions—a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate
in the first half of the year—CPI inflation exceeded the upper limit for deviations from the
2.5 percent target. Inflationary pressures mainly originated from factors beyond the control of
the monetary authorities. Since December 2011 inflation has been slowly put on a downward
path but small fluctuations have persisted. In May 2012 the headline CPI dropped to 3.6
percent, while core inflation reached 2.3 percent, i.e., the lowest level since April 2011.
Slowing economic growth and relatively high unemployment limit the risks of second-round
effects.
In May 2012, the Monetary Policy Council increased the policy rate by 0.25 percentage
points to anchor inflation expectations and to ensure positive real interest rates. While the
current level of interest rates appears to be adequate to maintain price stability in the medium
term, the Council remains vigilant to the developments in the economy and stands ready to
act accordingly.
The National Bank of Poland ensures that the level of official reserves is adequate. The
current account deficit narrowed and was mostly financed by EU funds and FDI inflows.
Despite last year’s volatility of the exchange rate, an outflow of short term capital was not
recorded.
Financial Sector
Despite a large presence of foreign investors, the Polish financial sector remains resilient to
the sovereign debt crisis. The banking sector is much less leveraged than EU and global
banks and remains liquid, well-capitalized and highly profitable. In 2011, net profit increased
by 37.5 percent, reaching a record high level for the Polish banking sector. The capital
adequacy ratio remains high (over 13.8 percent in the IQ2012), with Tier 1 capital
representing 90 percent of total capital.
There has been limited evidence of bank deleveraging so far. Credit growth rebounded
strongly in 2011, rising 11 percent y/y (after exchange rate adjustment), mainly due to strong
corporate sector demand. Total corporate lending rose by 19 percent y/y in 2011 with 60
percent of this increase generated by small and medium sized companies (SME). At the same
time, credit to households slowed significantly as a result of more restricted lending policies
caused by new legal regulations imposed by the Financial Supervisory Authority (KNF) in
2010 (Recommendation T) and 2011 (Recommendation S II).
The stock of FX mortgage loans remains elevated, but the share of FX loans in new mortgage
lending has been significantly reduced. Despite a steep depreciation of the zloty in the second
half of 2011, FX mortgage loans are still the best performing type of asset with a NPL ratio
at 1.7 percent in March 2012, versus 3.6 percent for zloty mortgage loans. The overall loan
performance (overall NPLs) has slightly improved during the course of 2011; however, the
picture is diverse across the different types of assets: with 10.9 percent in corporate lending

3
and 17.7 percent in consumer lending.
Structural Reforms
Mindful of the importance of structural reforms for long-term growth, the authorities
continue to implement labor and product market reforms. They also remain focused on
moving forward with privatization—when market condition allow—and on enhancing the
management of public assets.
In order to increase the labor force participation rate—which is still relatively low compared
to the EU average—the authorities are implementing pension system reforms. From 2013
onwards, the retirement age for men and women will be gradually raised to reach 67 for both
groups—by 2020 for men and by 2040 for women. The length of work required for pension
eligibility has also been extended for uniformed services which are regulated by a special
law.
Improving conditions for business activity and innovations remains one of the authorities’
priorities. The measures undertaken include streamlining the requirements for setting up new
businesses by a further reduction of administrative and disclosure requirements and
enhancing the effectiveness of legal court proceedings. In addition, the deregulation of the
380 licensed professions is in the pipeline. The process is expected to be implemented in
three stages with the first one aiming at improving access to 49 professions
