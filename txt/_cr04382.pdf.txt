Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Mark Plant (PDR)
November 30, 2004
A mission visited Kigali during July 5–19, 2004 to conduct discussions for the 2004
Article IV consultation.
The team comprised Messrs. Meyers (head), Bledowski, Christensen, and Hauner (EP)
(all AFR), Messrs. Dicks-Mireaux and Rother (EP) (both PDR), and Mr. Vacher
(MFD).
The mission met with the Minister of Finance, Central Bank Governor, Minister of
State for HIV/AIDS, bankers, representatives of the donor community, NGOs, and
various other government officials.
A three-year PRGF arrangement for SDR 4 million (5 percent of quota) was approved
on August 12, 2002. Three reviews have been completed. In concluding the second and
third reviews under the PRGF on June 9, 2004, Directors emphasized the importance of
adhering to the 2004 program, and urged the authorities to strictly limit new external
borrowing.
At the time of the 2002 Article IV consultation, which was completed on July 24,
2002, Directors emphasized the need for fiscal transparency and prudence, and urged
action to avoid a deterioration in debt sustainability indicators. Progress has been made
on fiscal transparency and revenue collection. Debt sustainability remains an issue.
Rwanda’s statistical base has significant limitations for surveillance purposes; STA and
AFRITAC East are providing assistance to strengthen national accounts and balance of
payments data. Rwanda formally subscribed to the GDDS on October 31, 2003.
Staff reports for the PRGF and subsequent reviews have been published; the authorities
have agreed to publication of this report.
Rwanda has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
x

Rwanda has made great strides in the period since 1994. Having established the key
elements of a market economy, and with significant progress in restoring
macroeconomic stability, there is now a window for improving economic productivity,
generating employment, and strengthening export performance. Failing this, Rwanda
risks moving to a slow and, possibly, unsustainable growth trajectory.

x

The implementation of Rwanda’s growth strategy has lagged and, in recent years, real
GDP growth performance has been erratic. GDP growth in 2004 may fall short of target,
due to a slowdown in construction and the effects of a drought-induced electricity
shortage.

x

While the monetary overhang that developed during 2003 was largely eliminated by
end-June 2004, concerns regarding monetary stability persist, following an unexplained
shift in the structure of base money, and compression in bank reserves.

x

Key risks over the medium term are that agricultural productivity gains will not be
realized; export growth will be slower than envisaged and/or that the external terms of
trade will deteriorate; and that the level of external grant assistance will not be adequate.

x

Discussions focused on key macroeconomic challenges: achieving high and sustained
GDP growth; assuring fiscal and external sustainability; and reducing poverty.

x

In fiscal policy, the outlook for expanding the domestic revenue base is uncertain. Given
this, the expansion of government programs in health, education, water and energy,
would widen the structural deficit over the medium-term. Absent a long-term increase in
external program grants, such deficits would not be sustainable.

x

In money and banking, the recent sale of government shares in two banks should help to
strengthen the commercial banking sector. Recent shift in the structure of the monetary
base could weaken the effectiveness of central bank policy instruments.

x

In the external sector, Rwanda’s export base remains highly concentrated and vulnerable
to climatic and international price shocks. Given this, maintaining a ceiling of
150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio over the medium- to long-term would
be prudent.

I. INTRODUCTION
Rwanda, landlocked, lacking significant natural resources, and supporting the
highest population density in Africa, faces the challenge of moving to high and
sustainable economic growth. The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions indicate that
timely policy updates, strengthened economic governance, and the continued support of the
international community will figure critically in the realization of this objective.
1.

Rwanda has made great strides in the period since 1994. The next stage, the
transition from recovery and reconstruction to sustained growth, will, however, present new
and substantial risks. The 2004 Article IV consultation focuses on the key macroeconomic
concerns for the period ahead: the outlook for improving economic productivity, and fiscal
and external sustainability. The discussion assesses the steps needed to address both
Rwanda’s extreme poverty and the economic progress that will contribute to regional
stability and welfare.

was reduced from about 50 percent in 1995 to
7 percent by 1998. Official reserves were reconstituted, rising from 1.3 months of import
cover at end-1994 to 6 months at end-1998. Real GDP is estimated to have recovered to the
1993 level by 1999. Similarly, progress on the structural agenda was impressive: the
exchange rate system was liberalized, with the export surrender requirement abolished in
1997; the central bank was rehabilitated, a new central bank law adopted, and indirect
monetary policy instruments were introduced; and the trade system was reformed, with the
number of tariff bands and maximum tariff rates drastically reduced. The trade restrictiveness
index fell from 8 in 1995–97 to 3 in 1998.

Some aspects of the macroeconomic recovery, however, proved more
challenging. While the recovery in primary activities (largely agriculture) was relatively
rapid, formal sector activity registered a mixed performance. While growth in most services
was strong, neither manufacturing nor commerce had regained their 1993 levels by end2003.1 The massive destruction of Rwanda’s human capital along with an initial phase of
domestic security threats, followed by regional conflict, clearly contributed to this
disappointing performance.
Box 1. Key Structural Advances
5.

The relatively slow rebound of the formal
sector limited the recovery in the tax base.
Government revenue, estimated at about 13 percent of
GDP in 1992, fell below 4 percent in 1994 and stood at
just 12.2 percent of GDP in 2002, even after an
increase in the VAT rate from 15 percent to 18 percent
and the substantial strengthening of revenue
administration (Box 1).
6.

With spending on economic recovery, fiscal
imbalances remained high. Current spending
averaged about 12 1/2 percent of GDP during 1995–
2000, before rising to 15 percent in 2002, as priority
and exceptional outlays increased. Capital outlays
remained substantial throughout the post-genocide
period and, as a result, significant fiscal deficits were
generated and financed by a combination of external
grants and loans.
7.

The recovery of Rwanda’s external sector
proved, similarly, challenging. After a strong
improvement in the world market prices for coffee
during 1995–96, the collapse of coffee
prices in 1997 was followed by substantial
export price declines, leading to a
42 percent (cumulative) deterioration in
Rwanda’s external terms-of-trade during
1995–2002 (Figure 1). With the passing of
a short-lived boom in coltan (2000–01),
and with the implementation of an export
promotion strategy for the coffee and tea
sectors delayed by management
limitations, exports dropped in 2002,

leaving Rwanda with one of the lowest merchandise export-to-GDP ratios in the world (4
percent in 2003).
With the import bill relatively steady (at about 25 percent of GDP) exports
earnings covered only a fraction of the import bill, leaving Rwanda critically dependent
on external assistance to finance its substantial balance of payments deficits. Although
Rwanda received US$1.3 billion in public current transfers during 1995–2002 (10 percent of
GDP on average), this fell short of requirements. Despite its post-conflict status and shaky
export performance, Rwanda increased its external indebtedness by US$273 million during
this period, giving rise to a continued deterioration in its external debt sustainability.2
9.

In the banking sector, given the disorder in the operation of commercial law and
the disruption consequent to the genocide, the quality of commercial bank assets was
poor.3 As lending by existing banks was encumbered, three new banks were established and
credit to the economy increased rapidly. However, the reconstruction and relief activities that
contributed to rapid economic recovery, at the end of the 1990s, led to a real estate boom. As
NGOs pulled out of Rwanda, the real estate market collapsed, and bank portfolios further
deteriorated. Restructuring plans and capital injections did not fully address weaknesses in
the banking system. By end-2003, while improved, nonperforming loans were still equivalent
to 17 percent of total assets (37 percent of gross loans), only half of which had been
provisioned.
10.

III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Political and Social Developments
Rwanda’s PRSP set out key medium-term objectives for economic growth and
poverty reduction, including the critical issues to be addressed in assuring the
prerequisite macroeconomic conditions. For the period 2003–04, the agenda was farreaching: a transition to a constitutional democracy and the associated establishment and
strengthening of government institutions, including at the local level; the completion of the
demobilization operations; the resolution of cases against the genocide-accused (GACACA);
major steps in the economic growth strategy, including the continued rebuilding of
Rwanda’s human resource capacity; the reduction of fiscal and external imbalances and
strengthening of economic and financial institutions; and, more broadly, a substantial
reduction in poverty.
11.

2

The NPV of external debt, before HIPC Initiative relief, rose from US$ 633 million percent in 1995 to
US$711 million (equivalent to 236 percent of exports) in 2001. Rwanda reached the decision point under the
HIPC Initiative in December 2000, upon which associated relief would bring the debt ratio for end-1999 to
150 percent. However, by end-2000, as a result of new external drawings, including from the Fund, during the
year, the debt ratio had risen to 174 percent.
3

Nonperforming assets were equivalent to 35 percent of gross lending, at end-1999.

-9-

A significant part of the political agenda was realized. In particular, a new
constitution was adopted by popular referendum in May 2003, followed by presidential and
legislative elections during August–October 2003. On the social agenda, the demobilization
process, which was initiated in 1998, had succeeded in reaching only 55 percent of its target
by end-2003, as the voluntary repatriation of ex-combatants did not materialize as planned.
The GACACA process was introduced on a trial basis during 2003, about 30,000 out of
110,000 detainees were released during January–February 2004, with the completion of
hearings planned for 2004í05. Assistance to widows and orphans of the 1994 genocide
continued at a modest level.4 As set out in the PRSP and PRSP Progress Report, significant
action has been taken under social initiatives.
12.

B. Macroeconomic and Financial Developments during 2003–04
As the implementation of Rwanda’s growth strategy lagged, reflecting
continuing human resource constraints, the vulnerability of the real economy to
exogenous shocks became evident during 2003-04 (Figure 2). Failed rains in 2003 led to a
decline in agricultural output, which accounts for 40 percent of value added, and limited
overall real GDP growth for the year to about 0.9 percent (Table 1).5 There is a risk that real
GDP growth may also fall short of target in 2004. While growth in agricultural output may
reach 6 percent, construction activity is slowing and, reflecting the impact of a droughtrelated electricity shortage, manufacturing activity is contracting (Figure 3).

The Fund to Assist Survivors of the Genocide (FARG) provides limited support to about 60 percent of
victims, including basic housing, secondary school fees, and vocational training.

This figure is 1.5 percentage points below the authorities’ initial estimate, reflecting the staff’s evaluation that
real growth in some agricultural components was well below the authorities’ estimate.

- 10 -

While some progress was made toward strengthening the government revenue
base during 2003-04, the structural fiscal imbalance remained large. The revenue-toGDP ratio rose to 13.5 in 2003 and is on-track to maintain that level in 2004, reflecting the

on purchases of goods and services.7 Data for the
first half of 2004 indicate that the spending under the 2004 budget, which restrains growth in
recurrent outlays while accommodating external grant-financed increases for social
initiatives, is on track.8 With financing for government operations largely covered by external
current and capital grants, external borrowing (equivalent to 4 percent of GDP in 2003) has
been held below the level projected in the HIPC decision point document. Domestic bank
financing was limited.

net credit growth slowed substantially as the
government amortized loans that it had guaranteed on the hotel project and, as a
consequence, broad money growth had been brought down to 10.4 percent by end-June
(Figure 4). Monetary expansion (and a fall in export revenue) contributed to a significant
depreciation of the Rwanda franc in 2003. Inflation peaked at 11.2 percent in February 2004,

The domestic revenue-to-monetized sector GDP ratio, which provided a clearer picture of tax efficiency, is
estimated to have increased from 21.2 percent in 2001 to 25.4 percent in 2003.

The government also issued loan guarantees in mid-2003 (with a value equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP) as
part of the financing package for a hotel project.

reflecting the impact of the decline in agricultural output on food prices and the pass-through
of the exchange rate depreciation, before moderating modestly during March–June 2004, as
the impact of these factors stabilized (Figure 4).9
As the poor health of several commercial banks limited the recourse to
increasing the reserve requirement, the central bank raised its discount window rates
by 150 basis points during May–August 2003 and augmented government securities sales,
which led to a significant increase in interest rates. This did not, however, adequately reduce
liquidity. With nearly a third of the deposit base denominated in foreign exchange, the
accelerating depreciation of the Rwanda franc gave rise to a revaluation of foreign exchange
deposits that added to growth in bank deposits. Toward end-2003, the central bank
significantly increased foreign exchange sales at auction, slowing the brisk depreciation of
the Rwanda franc. As a result of this and the delayed disbursement of external program
assistance, the import cover of official reserves fell from 6.3 months at end-2002 to 5.2
months at end-2003.10 In the first half of 2004, the Rwanda franc appreciated slightly against
the U.S. dollar, reflecting stronger earnings from coffee and tin exports (paragraph 18) and
slowing import demand for industrial inputs and consumer goods as money growth slowed.
International reserves rose to US$ 218.8 million (5.4 months of imports) at end-June 2004.
16.

The external current account widened during 2003, before narrowing modestly
during the first half of 2004. A moderate improvement in the external terms of trade during
2003, as market prices for coffee and tea rose, was more than offset by a drop in coltan and
coffee export volumes. In the same year, the continued significant depreciation in the real
effective exchange rate did little to slow import growth, given the substantial share of donor
financed government- and project-related imports in the import bill, and the external current
account deficit before grants increased by 3 percentage points of GDP to 19.2 percent of
GDP (Table 4). During the first part of 2004, however, coffee export volumes increased
substantially, as international market prices recovered from the previous year’s lows,
reflecting the poor harvest in Brazil. In addition, a jump in world market prices for tin led to
a significant increase in cassiterite exports. At the same time, consistent with the reported
weakness in formal sector activity, merchandise import data through May 2004 indicate that
imports were lower than had been projected.
17.

Rwanda’s external debt steadied in 2003, as new borrowing, excluding a new
government loan guarantee, was limited (Table 5). Nonetheless, according to preliminary
estimates based on a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) update, Rwanda’s net present value

Movements in world petroleum product prices are reflected in domestic retail prices with a 3-month moving
lag. As energy products account for only 12 percent of merchandise imports (25 percent of GDP), the
macroeconomic impact of oil price increases on the international market has been limited.
10

Delayed EU and World Bank disbursements were equivalent to one month of import cover.

(NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio rose to about 315 percent at end-2003, after enhanced HIPC
Initiative relief.11
Substantial progress was made in addressing governance issues in Rwanda
during 2003-04. During 2003, the office of the Auditor General (AG), which was further
strengthened, audited the 2002 accounts of most public entities, including the ministries of
Finance and Defense, and issued a report to parliament in March 2004. A new Auditor
General’s Act is being considered by a parliamentary commission. In addition, a new chart of
accounts was developed for government operations, an internal audit department was
established at the Ministry of Finance, and a strengthened computerized accounting system
(SIBET 2) is targeted for introduction by end-2004. In line with the agenda for strengthening
legislation governing economics and finance, parliament approved a new organic budget law
in August 2004. Substantial progress has been made in finalizing financial instructions
supporting the new budget law, and the cabinet review of the core instructions is targeted for
end-September 2004. A new tax law was drafted with assistance from Fund staff,
incorporating tax provisions that were previously under the authority of the investment
promotion agency. Similarly, new tax and customs legislation have been submitted, along
with a revised investment code, to parliament for consideration. During the first part of 2004,
tax administration was strengthened through the creation of a large taxpayers unit in the
RRA. Beyond this, the central bank issued public notices for the closure of government
dormant accounts, setting in motion a process that will continue through 2004.
19.

20.
Steps were also taken to strengthen governance in the financial sector. Beginning
in 2003, the NBR conducted on-site audits of three commercial banks, established a
microfinance sector supervision department, and hired additional supervisors. Bank
regulation and supervision were strengthened with a new set of regulations issued at end2003 including, in particular, an increase in the solvency ratio from 8 to 10 percent, and
clarifications on credit concentration and asset quality. With a recapitalization in 2003,
financed by the World Bank, Rwanda’s key microfinance institution (UBPR) doubled its
lending portfolio, mainly to borrowers in urban areas. At end-June 2004, the NBR reached
agreements with five commercial banks on action plans that would bring them into full
compliance with bank regulations by end-2004, and a provisional agreement with the sixth
bank was reached in August 2004. At end-July 2004, agreements were reached for the sale of
majority shares in the BCR and the BACAR to foreign investors.

IV. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Rwanda, under its long-term strategy exercise (Vision 2020), has set the
attainment of middle-income status by 2020 a key objective.12 In addition, programs and
21.

The deterioration in the NPV indicator, compared with the decision point projection (190 percent), reflects
the impact of the lower reference discount rate and the sharp decline in exports from a small base. A full DSA
based on loan-by-loan data will be completed ahead of Rwanda’s HIPC Initiative completion point
consideration.

12

This corresponds to a GDP target of US$900 per capita by 2020.

- 13 -

projects that would support the attainment of the millennium development goals (MDGs) are
being scaled up and/or developed with the assistance of the international community. On the
general policy level, medium-term objectives have been reflected in Rwanda’s PRSP.

yield a rising domestic revenue-to-GDP
ratio, while the domestic fiscal deficit would decline (from a targeted 8 percent in 2004 to
3 percent in 2007), as exceptional spending would tail off and growth in other spending
would increase more slowly than real GDP.14 External sector imbalances would narrow in
tandem with the merchandise deficit, as rapid export growth would follow the
implementation of Rwanda’s export promotion strategy (Table 1 and Text Table 2).15

22.

The introduction of new programs and policies that would be supported under a
World Bank poverty reduction strategy credit (PRSC) and related programs with the
African Development Bank (AfDB) could lead spending to increase from the baseline.
Based on preliminary discussions, it appears that government spending could increase by
2 percentage points of GDP (half of which would be capital), with higher social outlays on
health, education, and water. It seems likely that investment in these areas would have a
significant growth impact only over the longer term and domestic investment would only
marginally exceed that in the base scenario. Thus, targeted real GDP rates would not vary
substantially from the base scenario in the medium-term as a result of these new programs.
23.

13

Growth targets for the medium-term scenario are drawn from the PRSP. The agriculture strategy includes
land tenure reforms, the introduction of improved seeds, intensified fertilizer use, and increased access to rural
credit. The electricity shortage that dampened manufacturing sector activity during the first part of 2004 is
being addressed with World Bank assistance. With the introduction of land tenure reforms and a new fertilizer
program scheduled for 2005, the 6 percent medium-term growth track appears to be feasible.

14

Exceptional spending, beginning with the 1998 PRGF program, covered spending on assistance to victims of
the genocide, demobilization and reintegration of soldiers, civil service reform, educational assistance to
returning refugees, and the establishment of governance institutions.

15

Rwanda’s export promotion strategy, which focuses on the coffee, tea and tourism sectors, targets the
development of niche markets, including specialty coffees, packaged teas, and ecotourism.

17

Topping up to bring the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio to 150 percent at end-2003 would reduce the NPV ratio
from 363 percent to 224 percent at end-2006.

- 14 -

Although it is envisaged that additional external grants would finance part of the increased
deficit, firm commitments are limited. As a result, external borrowing could increase relative
to the base scenario.
Even under optimistic assumptions about export growth, staff project that the
external debt ratio would rise above the reference range over the next few years.17
Assuming a modest increase in the level of external grant financing, the NPV of debt-toexports ratio on a post-enhanced HIPC Initiative basis would rise to 363 percent in 2006
before topping up (Table 6). However, given the ten-year grace period on new external
borrowing, the debt-service ratio would not exceed 10 percent over the medium term.
24.

Preliminary staff analysis also indicates that Rwanda’s long-term objectives of
reaching middle income status can be achieved only with substantially increased grant
assistance from development partners, even with a workable strategy and the
achievement of the targeted productivity improvements. Alternative scenarios illustrate
that NPV of debt-to-export ratios would rise to unsustainably high levels if investment
(public and private) needed to achieve per capita income levels of US$630 to US$900 by
2020 were financed by external borrowing (Appendix IV). Indeed, external grant financing
would need to increase substantially over an extended period in order to finance t investment.
25.

Over the medium-term, the three major risks faced by Rwanda are that (i) gains
in agricultural productivity will be more modest than envisaged; (ii) export growth will
be slower than targeted, and/or that the external terms of trade will deteriorate; and
(iii) the level of external grant assistance will not increase substantially. Given Rwanda’s
high population density, setbacks in the agricultural growth strategy would have a direct and
significant impact on poverty and could be destabilizing. Poor agricultural performance
would be likely to generate pressure to expand the labor-intensive rural works program,
which, in the absence of a comprehensive framework, might be little more than an income
transfer program. Weak export performance, as a result of further delays in implementation
of the export promotion program and/or faltering coffee prices, could undermine external
debt sustainability. At the same time, shortfalls in external grants would need to be
compensated by spending reductions or additional borrowing.
26.

V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The 2004 Article IV discussions focused on the key challenges facing Rwanda:
realizing the productivity improvements that will drive high and sustained GDP
growth; assuring external and fiscal sustainability; and reducing poverty. Actions
supporting these objectives, addressed during the discussions, included the introduction of
strengthened economic legislation; civil service and land tenure reforms; strengthening
financial intermediation and banking sector soundness; and the continued privatization of
commercial public enterprises.
27.

- 15 -

A. Economic Growth
In noting that real GDP growth slowed in 2003 and that there is a risk that the
2004 growth rate could fall short of the targeted 6 percent, the authorities
acknowledged their concerns regarding lower-than-envisaged agricultural output, the
current electricity shortage, and the continuing weak position of Rwanda’s
manufacturing sector. They also pointed to continuing vulnerabilities, including variations
in weather. In this regard, they viewed that key constraints to growth were structural and
would need to be addressed over the medium- to long-term.
28.

Discussions of the long run growth prospects indicated that, while a general
orientation had been identified, little or no action has been taken to make the growth
strategy operational. The authorities and staff agreed that while medium-term growth
targets were ambitious, they would be achievable with a sound policy strategy and sustained
implementation. The authorities explained that the long-term strategy has three key foci: (i)
the institutional environment; (ii) basic infrastructure; and (iii) social investment.
Institutional development would target the extension of financial intermediation and the full
implementation of land reforms. In responding to staff concerns regarding the prospects for
private investment and employment generation, the outlook was less clear. The authorities
viewed information and communications technology (ITC), and tourism to be areas of
comparative advantage, and indicated that there was considerable potential for the
development of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, in ITC, while a
work is in progress to connect Rwanda to an intercontinental fiber optic network, an analysis
of its implications for business development is missing and, so far, activity in the sector has
largely targeted services to NGOs and official representations. A similar situation was
reported for tourism and, while UNIDO was said to have prepared a report on SME
development, neither the scale nor the timeframe had been projected.
29.

In response, staff noted two critical concerns: (i) that, given continuing human
resource constraints, delays in moving from strategy to implementation could be
expected to continue; and (ii) that, while a number of supporting studies had been
conducted, significant uncertainties remain regarding the productivity improvements
that can be realized and their timing. In particular, staff pointed out that, in addition to a
stable macroeconomic environment, the planning and management capacity for setting out
detailed policies and associated time-bound action plans, and for their implementation would
need to be set in place. Given the delays that had been already experienced in this regard,
work with supporting partners to promptly address this concern was seen as critical. In
discussing the analysis underpinning the growth strategy, which is now under review, staff
stressed that there is a risk that productivity growth could be weaker than envisaged.
30.

B. External Viability
The Rwandan authorities recognized that the sustainability of their growth
strategy would, even in the best of circumstances, hinge critically on reducing external
imbalances over the medium term. They also recognized that raising export growth was
key to reducing these imbalances. Reflecting this, they stated that cabinet had approved a
31.

- 16 -

revised export promotion strategy in August 2004, that an action plan for the strategy is being
finalized, and that an inter-ministerial group is coordinating its implementation and
monitoring.18 Additional steps that were seen as supporting improved export performance
include the establishment of an EPZ, and entry into the East African Community (EAC) and
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).19 Supporting these steps, the
authorities noted that discussions to establish a direct railway link to Rwanda were under
way, and that a project to use methane gas trapped under Lake Kivu for electricity generation
would help to limit the growth of energy imports in the period ahead. Beyond this, a
diagnostic trade integration study for Rwanda, under the umbrella of the World Bank’s
Integrated Framework is scheduled to be initiated during the fourth quarter of 2004.
While acknowledging the logic of selectively addressing constraints in the coffee,
tea and tourism sectors and expanding regional market, staff stressed that, unless policy
implementation in the export sector was strengthened substantially, Rwanda’s external
imbalances could become unsustainable. As Rwanda’s export base is small in relation to
its GDP, staff noted that export growth would need to be both rapid and sustained to bring
the NPV of external debt down to a prudent level. In these circumstances, Rwanda’s history

and on strengthening export performance more broadly. Furthermore, staff noted that, given
the proximity and resource base of the eastern DRC, the expansion of commerce that would
accompany peace in the Great Lakes region would form a critical element in the success of
Rwanda’s external strategy.
32.

18

Rwanda’s trade regime is relatively open with a score of four on the trade restrictiveness index. Rwanda has
made some progress in reducing the level and dispersion of tariff rates and there are currently no explicit
nontariff barriers.

19

It is envisaged that the EPZ would be used as a staging area for regional wholesaling activities. In addition,
the authorities noted that a decision was pending on their application for membership in the EAC.

20

Coltan exports, which peaked at US$41 million in 2001, are projected at about US$5 million in 2004.

- 17 -

In reviewing external debt sustainability, the authorities recognized that slowerthan-envisaged export growth and discount rate changes had led to a deterioration in
Rwanda’s net present value of debt-to-exports ratio which, according to a preliminary
estimate under the HIPC methodology, rose to 315 percent at end-2003 (Figure 6).
Nonetheless, they were confident that export growth would improve and argued that under
realistic borrowing projections the debt-service ratio would not exceed 10 percent during the
next decade. In response, staff noted that even if the ten-year grace period on new external
borrowing provided a period in which growth in debt-service payments would be limited,
sustained borrowing above US$100 million per year over the medium-term would entail
substantial long-term risks given Rwanda’s limited export diversification and continued
vulnerability to exogenous shocks.21

limiting the NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio to 150 percent over the medium to long term and to persuade external partners to
provide additional grants to substantially finance the planned expansion in government
programs.22
33.

C. Public Finances
In reviewing the fiscal outlook, authorities recognized that, following the
implementation of key tax reforms during 2002–03, the revenue-to-GDP ratio appears
to have reached a plateau at about 13.5 percent. In view of this and as no new tax
measures are currently under consideration, staff underscored the importance of improving
34.

21

A debt sustainability update based on the standard debt sustainability template for low-income countries
(Appendix VI) shows that, in a baseline scenario, Rwanda's external debt ratios would be elevated and remain a
source of vulnerability: without additional topping up at the HIPC Initiative's completion point, the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio would only slowly decline to 229 percent by 2024, while the debt service-to-exports ratio
would climb above 10 percent after 2020. In addition, several stress tests indicate that adverse shocks to the
macroeconomy (growth and export performance, in particular) would lead to a significant deterioration in
external debt sustainability.
22

The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio provides an accurate measure of the Rwanda’s external debt burden, given
the low interest rates and long grace periods which characterize its borrowing.

- 18 -

tax efficiency through the reform of tax, customs, and investment code legislation, and
policies that support the relative shift in economic activity from the informal to the formal
economy. As this would depend on the fair and predictable application of the law, the
authorities were urged to maintain their commitment to avoiding any new tax exemptions
and to continue with strengthening the revenue authority. The authorities noted their
agreement with this assessment.
In discussing government spending, the authorities noted that substantial
spending increases over the medium term, including for health, education, energy,
water, roads, transfers to local government and, possibly, for the development of the
EPZ were under consideration. Taking this into account, and reflecting further delays in
the demobilization activities to 2005 and beyond, staff noted that the government’s domestic
fiscal deficit, which rose steadily from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2002 to a targeted 7.8 percent
in 2004, could remain at an elevated level for an extended period. Given the need to assure
adequate credit to the economy and avoid inflationary financing, staff observed that such a
decision would mark a policy shift from the progressive reduction in fiscal imbalances
targeted under the PRGF to a continuing reliance on external grant and loan resources to
finance a major share of its budget. The authorities, while recognizing the importance of
moving toward fiscal balance, were convinced that the benefit that would be derived from
scaled up operations would substantially exceed the cost.
35.

In these circumstances, the authorities, noting the limited prospects for
additional external grant commitments, viewed an increase in external indebtedness,
with such borrowing rising from US$92 million in 2004 to US$107 million in 2005, as a
viable option. Staff advised that this level of borrowing substantially exceeds that envisaged
in the decision point document for the HIPC Initiative and, given current uncertainties about
growth and external viability, would not be prudent. Given this, staff urged the authorities to
work with the international community to identify additional grant resources and to limit new
external public borrowing, until the potential for export and productivity growth is
established.
36.

Regarding the 2005 budget, while basic elements had not been fixed at the time
of the mission, the authorities recognized the appropriateness of the indicative fiscal
balance targeted under the PRGF. Discussions indicated, however, that the revenue
outlook is not encouraging. The impact of the electricity crisis on corporate profits and a
softening of banking sector profitability, in part associated with the stabilization of the
Rwanda franc exchange rate, are expected to have a deleterious impact on direct tax
collections in 2005. Beyond this, while the fiscal impact of the anticipated entry into the East
African Community and, possibly, SADC has not yet been estimated, there is a chance that
they could reduce tax revenue modestly.
37.

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
In discussing monetary developments, the authorities stated that the monetary
overhang that had developed during 2003 had been largely eliminated by endJune 2004. They pointed to the limited extension of net credit to government from the
38.

- 19 -

banking system, as non-demobilization program grants exceeded projections, and increased
central bank foreign exchange sales and money market interventions to achieve the reserve
money target as explanatory factors. The authorities noted their concern, however, about
changes in the structure of monetary aggregates—the share of currency in M2 has risen by
3 percentage points, to 23 percent, over the past year, while the share of foreign currency
denominated deposits has increased by 3½ percentage points, to 28 percent, over that same
period. The increased importance of currency was seen as a possible indication that the
banking system’s role in financial intermediation was diminishing, while the relative increase
in foreign currency deposits, despite the recent appreciation of the Rwanda franc, may
weaken the central bank's ability to control monetary aggregates.
Staff noted that bank reserves, which at end-June 2004 did not meet statutory
requirement and had fallen to a very low level (Figure 7), reflected weakness in the
enforcement of prudential regulations that, unless corrected, could complicate the conduct of
monetary policy. While the monetary base

staff pointed out that bringing banks into compliance with prudential regulations, which is
key for assuring banking soundness, would be critical to enhancing the effectiveness of NBR
policy actions. In this regard, the authorities were urged to promptly reach agreement with all
commercial banks on action plans that would ensure this objective.23

In discussing inflation, which since the final quarter of 2002 remained above the
targeted range, the authorities pointed to the impact of food price increases, which were
linked to poor weather and viewed as outside of their control. They pointed to a
moderation in food prices in recent months and reaffirmed their commitment to the prompt
reduction of inflation. Staff noted that, while non-food price increases appear to have
moderated in recent months, the delayed feed-through of depreciation of the Rwanda franc in
2003 and lagged adjustments in utility tariffs and energy price increases could be expected to
put upward pressure on inflation in the period ahead. Staff stressed, therefore, that projected
40.

23

The central bank had reached agreements with five out of six commercial banks on action plans that would
bring them into full compliance with bank regulations by end-2004. Reserves, however, fell substantially short
of the 8 percent of the deposit base for three banks.

- 20 -

substantial fiscal spending increases in the period ahead will need to be effectively sterilized,
if inflation objectives are to be achieved.
In discussing exchange rate developments, staff noted its concern that
unnecessarily tight restrictions set on the bidding process for central bank foreign
exchange auctions could limit the speed of exchange rate adjustment to changing
market fundamentals. In response, the national authorities indicated that they had modified
the out-of-market limits on auction bids, as a step toward increasing exchange rate
flexibility.24
41.

E. Commercial Banking
In the commercial banking sector, the authorities noted that with the sale of the
BCR and the BACAR to foreign investors, the health and competitiveness of Rwanda’s
banking sector were set to improve significantly. They added that the planned
recapitalization of the Rwanda Development Bank (BRD) could further strengthen options
for financial intermediation. While acknowledging these advances, staff indicated that the
situation of the banking sector remains fragile, with the share of nonperforming loans in
gross lending (35.6 percent at end-March 2004) still higher than the level at end-2002. Risk
concentration limits were regularly breached and few banks met new regulations on capital.
Staff noted that one bank, in particular, consistently failed to comply with a large number of
banking regulations for an extended period, and underscored the importance of the strict
enforcement of the regulatory and supervisory framework.25 In addition, they recommended
that the Rwanda Development Bank (BRD) should not be exempted from the regulatory and
tax obligations that apply to other financial institutions, and urged the authorities to promptly
bring the UBPR into compliance with the new regulation on credit and saving cooperatives
(COPECs) without delay, and called for strengthening the regulatory framework for a
mortgage bank (CHR), and the Poste du Rwanda.
42.

F. Structural Issues
The authorities stated that, following the successful sale of the Pfunda tea estate
earlier this year, prompt action is envisaged in completing the privatization of the tea
sector, as envisaged in the PRSP and in line with the export promotion strategy for tea.
In addition, the authorities indicated that government shares in the telecommunications
parastatal (Rwandatel), the coffee exporter (Rwandex), and the hotel holding company
(Prime Holdings) would be privatized as rapidly as feasible.
43.

24

Rwanda’s foreign exchange rate is market determined with the NBR occasionally intervening to smooth out
disturbances. The formal foreign exchange market in Rwanda is dominated by commercial banks and foreign
exchange bureaus. Weekly foreign exchange auctions for banks were introduced in January 2001, with the
central bank offering a predetermined amount of foreign exchange on a marginal price basis.

25

In response to a request from the authorities, MFD will provide technical assistance to assess the financial
position of a bank and propose remedial actions.

- 21 -

In other structural matters, the authorities indicated that civil service reforms,
including a substantial reduction in force outside of teachers and health workers, are
nearing the implementation phase. While several of Rwanda’s development partners have
signaled misgivings regarding the accelerated pace of reform, noting that it could impair the
government’s ability to implement its operations, the authorities viewed this effort as a
critical support to the decentralization of government and indicated that they were confident
that it would succeed. On the subject of land reform, the authorities stated that land reform
legislation, which would assign transferable title, is being reviewed by parliament.
44.

G. Statistical Issues and Technical Assistance
Staff welcomed steps taken to improve the quality of national accounts, price
and balance of payments statistics. In particular, it was noted that the introduction of a
revised consumer price index, beginning with January 2004, should improve the reliability of
inflation estimates. The authorities noted that efforts were continuing to improve the
statistical basis for national accounts estimates, including an improved frame for agricultural
data. In reviewing inconsistencies between the export data collected by the RRA and the
NBR, discussions focused on approaches to more fully recording trade and the
comprehensive capture of external project financing. While acknowledging the substantial
progress achieved, staff recommended that strengthening of statistics continue in the context
of the GDDS, with technical assistance from Fund staff, including through East AFRITAC.
45.

The authorities recognized the substantial contributions provided by Fund
technical assistance. They noted that Fund staff had provided critical support in
strengthening revenue administration and internal accounting and auditing at the Ministry of
Finance, as well as in the drafting of the organic budget law, financial instructions, and
revised tax, customs and investment codes. The constructive role played by Fund long term
advisors in the areas of monetary policy and internal accounting at the central bank was also
commended. Staff welcomed the authorities’ productive use of technical assistance
resources.
46.

H. Staff Appraisal
The Rwandese economy is nearing a turning point. Having established the key
elements of a market economy, and given progress towards macroeconomic stability, there is
now a window for improving economic productivity, generating employment, and
strengthening export performance. However, uncertainty remains regarding the timing and
magnitude for such growth.
47.

Rwanda will need to both strengthen substantially the implementation of its
economic policies and shift to grant-based financing of its growth strategy. Even with
strengthened implementation and improved productivity, there is a considerable risk that the
productivity of investments financed by additional borrowing will turn out lower than
projected. Given Rwanda’s present high net present value of debt-to-exports ratio, external
viability and the achievement of medium- and long-term growth objectives therefore require
a substantial shift to grant assistance on the part of development partners. Borrowing—even
48.

- 22 -

on highly concessional terms and with long grace periods—would only postpone potential
external debt service problems.
While Rwanda has made substantial advances in the design and implementation
of programs for the health and education sectors, the agricultural growth strategy
needs to be expeditiously updated, in consultation with the World Bank and other
partners. The export promotion strategy, which appears to be feasible, should be
implemented urgently. Jump-starting growth in these sectors, which account for the largest
part of the economy, is key to the realization of faster economic growth and external
sustainability.
49.

Achieving sustained high growth rates for GDP could require significant
increases in investment over a long period. At present, the focus of attention is on public
investment in health and education, infrastructure, and government support for energy and
tourism initiatives. However, signs that private investment is set to increase—a critical
element in the realization of sustained growth in a market economy—are not readily
apparent. Despite strengthened economic legislation and institutions, outside of cellular
telecommunications and the methane energy project, the formal sector has foundered. This
may point to the critical role of regional peace in creating conditions conducive for private
investment.
50.

Given Rwanda’s lack of natural resources and scarce human capital, the
achievement of a durable peace and the associated expansion of commerce with the
eastern DRC remain critical prerequisites for growth and investment. A number of the
initiatives that are under way to expand regional commerce, including entry into the EAC
and SADC and the establishment of an EPZ, are targeted at increasing market size and
creating competitive niches. However, escape from a tragic history will depend on the efforts
of Rwanda, its neighbors, and the international community to establish the conditions for
peace.
51.

Looking forward, Rwanda’s fiscal sustainability remains a serious concern.
Given the lackluster performance of the formal sector, the achievement of domestic
revenue targets is likely to prove challenging. At the same time, the planned scaling-up of
programs, including for health, education, water, and infrastructure, would increase the
structural deficit. While increased borrowing from the World Bank and AfDB could finance
part of this expansion, this policy departs from the progressive reduction in imbalances
targeted under the PRGF, the availability of such resources is not assured over the long run,
and continued borrowing at the level projected for 2005 would be imprudent, given
Rwanda’s vulnerability to shocks and debt sustainability considerations. In these
circumstances, the Rwandese authorities and supporting partners should work to increase
external grant financing, to the full extent possible. Beyond this, the authorities will need to
clearly prioritize budgetary operations, establish contingencies and limit spending to a
sustainable level.
52.

The recent slower-than-targeted money growth is appropriate, given the
slowdown in formal sector activity that was induced, in large measure, by an electricity
53.

shortage. Nonetheless, as a result of the unexplained shift in the structure of the monetary
base, the money multiplier has fallen and the effectiveness of central bank security auctions
has been reduced. In these circumstances, given the skew of government spending to the
second half of the year, it will be a challenge to maintain monetary stability in the months
ahead. The authorities will need to improve their understanding of the increase in currency in
circulation, further strengthen coordination between the central bank and Treasury to assure
that spending increases are not destabilizing, and work to improve the responsiveness of the
banking system to changes in economic fundamentals.
The current floating exchange rate regime continues to serve Rwanda well.
Given Rwanda's continued vulnerability to external shocks and Rwanda's
demonstrated capacity to limit inflation to moderate levels, a market-based exchange
rate system appears to be a natural choice for the country. However, with large
government spending increases in prospect, financed by external assistance, the operation of
the weekly foreign exchange auction will need to improve in order to assure the effectiveness
of central bank policy implementation. In this regard, the authorities' recent step to increase
the out-of-market limits is welcome. The prompt implementation of the export promotion
strategy should help to improve the competitive position of Rwanda's export sector.
54.

The recent sale of majority shares in BCR and BACAR marks a significant step
towards strengthening the health of the banking system, and could help to reinvigorate
the interbank market. Nonetheless, compliance with banking regulations during the first
half of 2004 remained partial and uneven. When commercial banks do not provide acceptable
action plans for moving into compliance and/or when those action plans are not
implemented, the central bank should act promptly, instituting close supervision and
enforcing cascading sanctions as necessary.
55.

With solid macroeconomic performance during 2004, Rwanda could reach the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. With this, Rwanda’s external debt
stock could be reduced to a sustainable level. While the government’s commitment to
improving export performance is clear, as performance during 2002–03 shows, the
realization of high growth rates for exports is not assured. Rwanda continues to be vulnerable
to climatic and international price shocks. Given this, borrowing plans should take such risks
into account and aim to stay below the 150 percent NPV of debt-to-exports ratio over the
medium to long term.
56.

Rwanda's statistical base suffers from significant limitations for surveillance
purposes. Further strengthening, particularly in the areas of national accounts, government
finance, balance-of-payments, and banking sector statistics remains a priority of the
authorities. Given this, they should take full advantage of available technical assistance,
including from the Fund.
57.

Rwanda’s productive use of Fund technical assistance is commendable. Given the
limited human resource base and the agenda for further strengthening government
institutions and building capacity in the civil service, it is important that the authorities
58.

- 24 -

continue to efficiently use the technical assistance resources provided by the Fund and other
partners.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Rwanda be held in
accord with the provisions of Board Decision No. 12793-(02-76) approved on July 15, 2002.

1/ Converted at the program exchange rate for 2003 (equal to the end-year rate 2002) of Rwanda franc (RF) 511.9/U.S. dollar.
2/ Converted at the program exchange rate for 2004 (equal to the end-year rate 2003) of RF 580.3/U.S. dollar.
3/ Converted at the nominal exchange rate.
4/ The definition of reserve money as performance criteria or structural benchmark differs from the definition in the monetary program in that it excludes the
deposits of a defunct savings bank, import deposits, and dormant accounts. For 2003, the performance criteria benchmark is based on a three-week average, while
data in this table refer to the last day of the period.
5/ Broad money plus deposits in UBPR and Rwanda Development Bank (BRD).

2/ Current transfers include budgetary and HIPC Initiative grants, and humanitarian and technical assistance.
3/ In the "Prog." and "PRGF" columns for 2002 and 2003, official transfers and/or budgetary loans exclude expected but not yet disbursed budgetary assistance.
4/ Includes disbursed project and budgetary loans through end-2003 and committed loans thereafter. For 2004, including two tranches of a World Bank IRC credit (US$ 40 million),
for which the conditionality has been substantially met.
5/ In 2003, representing the restructuring of loans by the OPEC Fund. The restructuring of one such loan is part of the HIPC relief granted by the OPEC Fund, resulting in an NPV reduction of
US$2.44 million.
6/ Excluding Fund.
7/ Other capital includes long-term private capital, commercial credit, the change in the net foreign assets of commercial banks, and unrecorded imports.
8/ The program assumes clearance of all outstanding arrears (including arrears to non-Paris Club creditors) in 2004.
9/ Signed rescheduling and cancellation, as well as reschedulings expected to be signed with Paris Club creditors before the end of the June 30, 2004 deadline for the conclusion of
bilateral agreements.
10/ Data in the "Prog." and "PRGF" columns for 2002 and 2003 include expected but not yet disbursed budgetary assistance.
11/ Tentative rescheduling by non-Paris Club creditors. For the years 2004-06, it also includes assumed debt relief by Paris Club creditors on Cologne terms, in the form of flow rescheduling
delivered after the end of the current consolidation period. Following the completion point, the data for "debt service due" will be revised to reflect the impact of the stock-of-debt operation.
12/ The financing gap refers to the difference between the overall balance and the identified financing (actual and expected).
13/ After rescheduling, including arrears and new debt (the latter includes assumed project and budgetary disbursements for the period 2004-07). The data under the "PRGF" and the
"Prog."/"Est." columns are not comparable since they are based on a different treatment of projected loan disbursements. Data are preliminary and do not reflect changes in exchange rates.

implemented.
IX.

Exchange System:

On March 6, 1995, Rwanda adopted a market-determined exchange rate system. Before then,
the Rwanda franc was pegged to the SDR. On December 1998, Rwanda accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF, requiring it to ensure that the
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. In 2001, a foreign exchange auction system was put in place with
technical assistance from MFD. Since February 7, 2001, auctions have been taking place on a
weekly basis.

APPENDIX II

Rwanda: Relations with the World Bank
(As of August 5, 2004)
Partnership for Rwanda’s Development Strategy
Donor agencies have been key players in Rwanda since the genocide. With the support from
the international community, Rwanda has made notable progress along an ambitious path of
reconstruction, national reconciliation, and economic reform. In recent years, the
Government has made some ambitious efforts, based on its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), to reduce poverty and improve living conditions of the poor. The PRSP was
completed in June 2002. This strategy was supported and discussed by the Boards of the IDA
and the IMF on August 12, 2002. The PRSP targeted the halving of poverty by 2015 through
a private sector and rural sector strategy. The strategy mainly focuses on six priority areas:
(1) rural development and agricultural transformation; (2) human development; (3) economic
infrastructure; (4) good governance; (5) private sector development; and (6) institutional
capacity building—as the focus for public actions on poverty reduction. Civil society,
government agencies and ministries, and donors have all been actively involved in the PRSP
process and monitoring. The first PRSP progress report was issued in July 2003 and a BankFund JSA produced in May 2004. The second PRSP progress report is currently under
preparation and is expected to be issued end-August 2004.
World Bank Group Program and Portfolio
The last Country Assistance Strategy for Rwanda was discussed by the World Bank Board in
December 2002. The CAS sets out an assistance program consistent with the country’s PRSP
and emphasizes the need to move progressively from project-based approaches to budget
support. In line with this approach, a Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) is currently
under preparation. The proposed credit would help strengthen GoR capacity to (i) plan and
budget results-oriented public sector actions supporting the implementation of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy; (ii) develop incentive frameworks through performance-based payments
and contracting; (iii) establish strong accountability mechanisms enhancing the capacity of
Rwandan citizens to monitor and provide feedback to service providers—both public and
private; and (iv) implement a sound fiduciary framework, as well as a monitoring and
evaluation system to facilitate transparency and accountability in the service delivery in the
sectors of focus (i.e., health, education, water, energy). The credit is expected to go to the
Board in October 2004.
International Development Agency (IDA) Program: Since 1970, Rwanda has received
58 IDA credits and grants totaling US$1,268.6 million. As of end-July 2004, disbursements
from IDA to Rwanda have totaled about US$921.3 million, with a total undisbursed balance
of US$231.1million. Rwanda’s current portfolio of ten operations represents, as of July 2004,
a total commitment value of US$281.3 million of credits and grant facilities of US$30.5
million for an HIV/AIDS project and US$20 million for a decentralization and community
development project.

APPENDIX II

Overall, IDA has financed projects in (i) infrastructure, particularly road construction and
maintenance, electricity and water supply, and sanitation infrastructures; (ii) agriculture, rural
development, and forestry; (iii) social infrastructure, including health and population, and
education and training; (iv) private sector development, public enterprise reform, financial
development, and technical assistance; and (v) two policy-based quick-disbursing operations.
During the immediate post-genocide period, IDA financed two emergency budget support
operations and a social fund-type project, and restructured its prewar portfolio of investment
projects to meet the high-priority needs associated with the emergency and the transition
from conflict to development.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Program: The IFC has made some investments
in Rwanda, in various industries. Investments have been made in the Rwandan match factory
(SORWAL). In FY1998, IFC approved a US$0.53 million investment in Highland Flowers
and in FY2000, a US$6.0 million in RWANDACELL. In December 2000, an investment of
US$0.8 million was approved for an apartment hotel in Kigali. In addition to these
investments, IFC has also provided some technical assistance support to Rwanda focusing on
privatization, SMEs, the financial and industrial sectors.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Program: Rwanda signed and
ratified the MIGA Convention on October 27, 1989. On September 27, 2002, it became a full
member of MIGA with the completion of its membership requirements, including payment
of the usable currency and the local currency portions of its initial subscription, and deposit
of the promissory note. The membership was followed by Rwanda’s election to MIGA’s
Board of Directors during the World Bank/IMF annual meetings held in Washington. As one
of its cooperative initiatives, MIGA seconded a senior underwriter for more than a year to
COMESA (of which Rwanda is a member) to work on the creation of the Africa Trade
Insurance Agency, which was officially launched in Uganda in July 2001. Rwanda is a
founding member of ATI, along with seven other COMESA countries. Headquartered in
Nairobi, Kenya, ATI provides political risk insurance for trade credits in African countries.
All African countries are eligible to participate.
World Bank-IMF Collaboration in Specific Areas
The World Bank and IMF are closely coordinating their lending and policy advice to the
Government of Rwanda. This collaboration has deepened in recent years especially in the
context of the PRSP and HIPC processes.
Areas in which the Fund leads: The IMF leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic
policies, including fiscal and monetary policies. The IMF has supported Rwanda through
several arrangements under ESAF/PRGF. The Government had requested a new three-year
arrangement, which started in August 2002. The second and third review of the arrangement
were completed in June, 2004. This new arrangement under the PRGF is to support a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster
growth and reduce poverty in Rwanda. Structural reforms under the PRGF center around

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

measures to raise revenue to make sufficient room for increased poverty-related spending and
development needs, and to strengthen public expenditure management and financial
governance.
Areas in which the World Bank leads: The Bank leads the policy dialogue on structural
and institutional reforms in a number of areas. These include: infrastructure, including roads,
communication, water, sanitation, and energy; private sector development; agriculture and
rural development; social sectors, including health and HIV/AIDS, education, community
development, and demobilization and reintegration.
x

Broad Structural and Policy reforms: The first structural adjustment loan for
Rwanda was approved in June 1991. In 1995 and 1997, the World Bank approved
two emergency recovery credits (US$50 million each) as quick-disbursing budget
support to assist in the rehabilitation and recovery efforts. In March 1999, an
economic recovery credit (ERC) equivalent to US$75 million was approved to
support the economic reform efforts and the overall transition from conflict to peace.
The credit was disbursed in three tranches; the last one was at end-March 2001. The
Board also approved a supplement to the ERC in the equivalent of US$15 million in
December 2000, which was disbursed in full in March 2001.
Supported by the new CAS, an Institutional Reform Credit (IRC) of US$85 million
was approved on December 2, 2002, with the first tranche of US$45 million
disbursed in December 2002 and the second tranche in May 2004 to support the
implementation of the government’s poverty reduction strategy. Many key
institutional and structural reforms have been identified as triggers for the tranches
release. Important measures identified are the adoption of an MTEF approach to
budget planning and execution, completion of a Financial Accountability Review and
Action Plan, which is now under implementation, privatization of key government
undertakings in energy, telecommunications, tea factories, legal reforms to promote
gender equality, and privatization of the Banque Commercial de Rwanda (BCR).
Although progress on some of these measures has been slow, a number of measures
are either at advanced stages or have been completed. Privatization of the BCR—
which is a specific condition for the floating tranche—was completed at the
beginning of August 2004; hence the disbursement of the remaining US$20 million is
expected very soon.
In addition to strengthening the reforms initiated under previous adjustment credits,
the upcoming PRSC will focus on the following key areas: (i) pro-poor public
expenditures—in education, health, water/sanitation, and energy; (ii) improved
quality, efficiency, and equity of service delivery; and (iii) policies to promote
sustainable economic growth that support increased productivity of rural populations,
through increased access to social services, and support to export agriculture.

x

Infrastructure and private sector development: A number of World Banksupported infrastructure projects that closed recently helped to strengthen capacity

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

and rebuild infrastructure in post-genocide Rwanda. The Transport Sector Project
helped to reform sector policies, develop the planning capacity of the government,
improve road maintenance ability, and promote private sector activity in the sector.
The project supported main road construction, improved road maintenance, and
promotion of communal activities. The Second Communications Project, which
closed on June 30, 1999, promoted efficient communications through institutional
reform and investments. It sought to create autonomous, commercially oriented
operating entities for the telecommunications and postal services, and to provide a
regulatory framework to permit the entry of the private sector into the
telecommunications industry. The Energy Sector Project helped to establish national
energy policies as the basis for efficient utilization of Rwanda’s energy resources and
provided a framework for private sector participation in the sector. The Second Water
Supply Project helped to repair damaged water supply systems, financed an
evaluation of the water needs in secondary cities, and rehabilitated rural water supply
systems. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation, approved by the Board in June
2000, will continue the activities of the Second Water Supply Project in a framework
that emphasizes greater community participation. The Bank is preparing new projects
in transport, energy, and urban infrastructure to continue the support of the closed
projects. In addition, an upcoming Poverty Reduction Support Credit will support key
reforms and policies in water/sanitation, and energy to improve the quality, efficiency
and equity of service delivery.
x

Private Sector Development: The emphasis of the Bank’s support in private sector
development has been on enabling the establishment of a liberal institutional, legal,
and policy environment to accelerate private sector activity and enhance external
competitiveness. In this vein, the Private Sector Development Project, which closed
in September 2000, sought to promote expansion of the private sector through the
provision of both incentives and means to engage in labor-intensive, export-oriented
activities within an improved economic and legal framework. A follow-on project,
the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP), was approved by
the Board on April 19, 2001. The CEDP will continue to support the reform of the
telecommunications sector and the privatization of the current telephone monopoly,
and tea factories. It will also provide support to the energy and water sector by
providing management and rehabilitation funds (including management contract
fees), and assist the government in privatizing the remaining state-owned enterprises.
One of the main components of this project is support to financial sector reforms,
which aims at (i) addressing certain issues in the commercial banking sector, and
(ii) strengthening the micro-finance sector. Another key component of the project is
the support to private sector development of enterprises, associations and institutions
that support private sector development including investment promotion and
improvement of the business environment in Rwanda. Many of the components are
well advanced. In addition, the Regional Trade Facilitation Project (RTFP) aims to
contribute to poverty alleviation through private sector led growth in participating
countries by improving access to financing for productive transactions and crossborder trade.

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

x

Agriculture and Rural Development: The World Bank has been supporting
government efforts through the Rural Sector Support Project, which was approved in
March 2001. The aims of this operation are to reduce the smallholders’ incentives for
autarchy, to promote the adoption of improved inputs, and to raise productivity and
incomes among rural populations. Furthermore, the RSSP has been supporting
programs that increase agricultural productivity, develop rural agricultural and
nonagricultural enterprises, and promote farmers' organizations as agents for the
adoption and dissemination of new farming technologies.

x

Social sector: The World Bank’s activities have been aimed at restoring social
infrastructure and services in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide through the
Education Sector Project, approved in 1991, and the Health and Population Project,
also approved in 1991. The Education Project was finalized in June 2000, and on June
6, 2000 the Board approved a US$35 million Human Resources Development Project
(HRDP) aimed at improving quality and access to education. The Health and
Population Project supported the operation of six health districts, the supply of
essential drugs, a national information, education, and communications (IEC)
capacity, and the restructuring and decentralization of the National AIDS Control
Program. US$7 million supplemental to this project was approved by the Board at
end-2000 to continue activities pending the design of a new project. The Community
Reintegration and Development Project (CRDP), approved in October 1998, has
promoted community reintegration and development through community
participation. CRDP is strengthening the capacity of local communities and the
administration at the communal and national levels to identify, design, and implement
development projects. This has supported the decentralization process. The Bank
recently approved a grant of US$30.5 million for HIV/AIDS Prevention to support
the fight against the pandemic. In addition, the HRDP, and the CEDP have
HIV/AIDS components that are used to assist the relevant ministries to spread the
message of prevention among their staff and clients. The Demobilization and
Reintegration project, which was approved by the Board on April 25, 2002, is to help
demobilize and subsequently reintegrate ex-combatants into civilian life. Additional
support to reforms in the social sectors, and implementation of the PRSP will be
provided through an upcoming PRSC.

x

Community Development. The Decentralization and Community Development
Project (DCDP), funded by a US$20 million grant approved in June 2004, will
consolidate a framework in four provinces and two districts in a fifth province, to
boost the emergence of a dynamic local economy, through communities who are
empowered to lead their own development process under an effective local
government. This is a key plank in the national poverty reduction strategy and is
underpinned by the government’s decentralization policy. The project therefore
contributes to Rwanda’s long-term goal for decentralization and a realigned mandate
for central government, through the empowerment and improved accountability of
local governments and communities. The project will help to strengthen District
capacity for planning, and consultation with local communities. It will also support

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

local procedures for project finance and management, while promoting transparency
and public awareness.
Areas of Shared Responsibility: The IMF and the World Bank staff continue to collaborate
in supporting the government’s structural reforms in the areas of budgeting, expenditure and
financial management, revenue control, and financial sector management.
x

Budgeting, public expenditure management, and revenue control. A joint World
Bank-Fund assessment of the government’s capacity to track poverty expenditures
was completed in 2001, which highlighted the key areas for improvement. An update
of the 2001 exercise is planned for May 2004. IMF technical assistance missions have
been fielded in the areas of financial management, fiscal decentralization, and
revenue management. The Bank has provided support in this area under the
Institutional Reform Credit, with the completion of a Financial Accountability
Review. Based on the results of this review, a detailed action plan for strengthening
the public financial management system was recently completed. This action plan
was developed through a highly consultative and participative process that engaged
all stakeholders. The Bank will support implementation of the action plan through the
IDA Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) currently under preparation.

x

Public Sector Reform and Capacity Building. The Fund follows public service
reforms through their impact on macroeconomic aggregates, and engages in
discussion with government on the trade-offs. Currently, the government is in the
process of consulting various partners to launch a number of reforms in the sector.
DfID as the lead donor in public service reform is preparing a sizable program to
support implementation of Rwanda’s Public Sector Reform Strategy. The Bank will
join DfID and other development partners in supporting public service reform in
Rwanda through the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP), whose US$20
million credit was approved by the Bank Board in July 2004. The PSCBP aims to
support public sector entities at the central level to strengthen the capacity for more
efficient, effective, transparent, and accountable performance of their redefined roles
and functions and to achieve their strategic objectives contributing to the PRSP. More
specifically, the PSCBP aims to (i) attract, manage, and retain qualified staff; (ii) seek
to improve the quality and efficiency of service delivery through support to
“contracting for performance” based on functional reviews of all ministries,
departments, and agencies to identify functions to be contracted out to the private
sector and civil society and those to be decentralized; and (iii) use financial resources
in an effective, transparent and accountable manner toward achieving the objectives
of their intended use. PSCBP attention to issues of public accountability and
monitoring impacts will further be complemented by the Bank’s PRSC.

x

Financial Sector. In this area, the World Bank has provided support in the
restructuring of the banking sector, and in addressing the problem of nonperforming
loans. The Bank has also supported the government to complete reviews of the micro-

- 46 -

APPENDIX II

finance sector, to feed into the development of a sector strategy. Upcoming technical
assistance will support the central bank in dealing with issues pertaining to money
laundering. The IMF has supported technical assistance in banking supervision and
prudential regulation. A Financial Sector Assessment Program is planned later in
2004. Currently, the IMF is providing long-term technical assistance to the Central
Bank in monetary policy analysis, banking supervision, and internal audit. The Fund
is also providing technical assistance on the development of securities markets.

APPENDIX III

Rwanda: Statistical Issues
The macroeconomic database of Rwanda is weak, in part due to the destruction
caused by the 1994 war. Since the end of the war, Rwanda has received considerable
technical assistance in rebuilding the country’s statistical database, and there has been some
progress in the compilation and dissemination of economic and financial statistics. The
authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund. Rwanda has very few
statistical publications, but the authorities initiated in 1998 a new annual publication covering
most of the major economic and financial statistics. The publication includes historical data
(or estimates based on partial, available data) dating back to1990. National accounts and
price statistics, government finance, and balance of payments statistics suffer from
significant quality weaknesses. Monetary statistics are adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring, but their quality and timeliness likewise need to be further improved. There is
also scope for improving the data relevant for banking supervision.
60.

Significant technical assistance is being provided to Rwanda. A DFID project is
supporting the establishment of the “Institut National des Statistiques de Rwanda” with a
component on national accounts. The objective of this is to establish a program of economic
surveys and to develop leading economic indicators which will provide the basic data to feed
into the compilation of GDP.
61.

East AFRITAC assistance is focused on capacity building to enable the construction
of short term indicators on the formal sector, starting with a monthly PPI for the
manufacturing (formal) sector. This is a joint project with the central bank (BNR). DFID is
providing financial support. PPI for the months of October 2003-June 2004 have been
computed and are currently being analyzed.
62.

Real sector
The Statistics Directorate of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MINECOFIN) prepares data on national accounts. After the 1994 war, the authorities
compiled national accounts data starting from 1990. Nevertheless, the quality of these data is
weak, reflecting shortages of human and material resources. While considerable effort was
made to improve the reliability of GDP estimates using the production approach, significant
weaknesses in data collection on expenditures, and income remain. These weaknesses are
reflected in uncertainties regarding the composition of GDP and they complicate, in
particular, an adequate assessment of developments in savings and investment. The reliability
of national accounts estimates are further hampered by weak external sector statistics. In
2003, an East AFRITAC mission visited Kigali to advise the authorities on real sector
statistics issues, especially in the area of secondary sector statistics. In February 2004 the
EREBS group (Equilibre resources-emploi des biens et services) assisted the MINECOFIN
to develop new benchmarking GDP estimates (2001) and the manufacturing PPI. The new
GDP estimates show an increase by about 7 percent as compared to previous ones, with
greater differences in many of the component categories.
63.

- 49 -

APPENDIX III

The NBR has set up an improved consumer price index (CPI). The index addresses
problems regarding regional and consumption basket coverage and covers 438 goods, for
which a total sample of more than 25,000 is observed in Kigali (weighted 77 percent) and in
eleven provincial towns. The index is based on a survey of 6,450 households in 2000/01 (the
last survey had been done in 1989) and on average 2003 prices. Local goods amount to 70
and imported goods to 30 percent, while food and drinks amount to 37, and housing and
energy amount to 16 percent. Shortcomings remain, however: The index aggregates
infrequently purchased products in groups with all products in the respective group assigned
the same weight; and the index of underlying inflation is too narrow as it excludes 53 percent
of the goods as seasonal or exchange-rate-determined. In 2003, the old and the new index
developed closely in line, although the old index indicated higher inflation pressures during
the period of monetary overhang during the last quarter of 2003 than the new index.
64.

Data on employment and wages are not collected, except for the central government
and for daily informal work.
65.

Real sector data are reported regularly for publication in International Finance
Statistics (IFS), although with some lags, particularly for GDP estimates.
66.

Government finance statistics
The authorities report to the African Department detailed monthly data on revenue
and expenditure with a lag of three–four weeks. These data are compiled by a flash-reporting
unit which was established in the MINECOFIN, with the assistance of the Fund, in 1996. A
functional classification of government expenditure has been designed and was presented
with the 2003 budget. Within the economic classification, expenditures belongings to areas
identified by the PRSP as “priority areas” are clearly identifiable. The fiscal data do not
capture consistently capital expenditure data because capital projects (almost entirely foreign
financed) are mainly carried out by line ministries outside the regular budget procedures.
Efforts are under way to integrate the development budget into the normal budgetary
procedures. Fiscal data have often shown a discrepancy between the deficit as derived from
above the line with that derived from below the line (i.e., its financing). Together with the
Fund staff, the authorities have made adjustments for changes in the balance of non-core
government accounts, for changes in cash in vault at the revenue authority, for accounting
errors, and for other factors.
67.

Selected aggregates on annual central government operations through 2002 have been
reported to the Statistics Department (STA) and are published in IFS. These data exhibit
large statistical discrepancies, mainly due to the time of recording of expenditures. No subannual data are reported to STA and government finance statistics (GFS) have been reported
for publication in the GFS Yearbook only through 1993.
68.

Monetary statistics
The balance sheet of the NBR is transmitted to the African Department on a weekly
basis with a lag of one week, and the monetary survey and the consolidated balance sheet of
69.

- 50 -

APPENDIX III

the country’s commercial banks are transmitted on a monthly basis with a lag of about four
weeks. Detailed data on interbank money market transactions are also provided upon request
to mission staff. Monetary data are reported separately to the Statistics Department on a
timely basis and published in IFS. The NBR established a working group to implement the
recommendations of previous STA and MFD missions in the area of collection, compilation
and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics, including, a monetary and financial
statistics mission which visited Kigali in November 2000. The NBR has effectively
implemented the medium-term action plan of the November 2000 mission and continues to
make progress on the longer-term recommendations. For example, it adopted in June 2002 an
improved classification of the central bank balance sheet accounts, specifically those related
to transactions with the government. In addition, in early 2004, the NBR successfully adapted
its existing compilation framework to that of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
These actions have contributed to, among other things, improved inter-sectoral consistency
of the monetary and financial statistics.
Balance of payments statistics
Foreign trade data are provided to Fund missions by the NBR. There are
inconsistencies between data reported by the NBR and data recorded by customs. There is
also significant unrecorded trade, and information on invisible transactions is scarce. There
are indications of significant under recording of official external transfers, and data on the
level and composition of private flows are poor. The lack of well-trained staff for balance-ofpayments compilation is a major impediment for improvement of the quality of data. Trade
in goods data are mostly collected by customs with the major exception of imports and
exports of electricity, tea, and coffee. Customs is expected to take over responsibility for the
reporting of the latter goods in the near future. The implementation of supplementary surveys
to companies, recommended by a STA mission to Kigali in September 2000, is currently
being implemented: the NBR launched a unit in charge of these surveys, which, however,
still lacks adequate training.
70.

A recent multisector statistics mission to Kigali (June 2003) identified the following
areas of improvements in the short run: (1) reorganizing data entry and production of external
trade statistics, using ASYCUDA and Eurotrace softwares; (2) adapting survey forms to
companies to the BPM5 methodology, and (3) work with CEPEX to obtain exhaustive data
on international and bilateral aid. A follow-up mission visited Kigali in January 2004
71.

Annual balance of payments and quarterly import and export data are reported to
STA, albeit with some lags, and are published in IFS. Rwanda sent methodology notes
describing the compiling methods for balance of payments statistics which were included in
Part 3 of the 2002 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
72.

Databases on external public debt are maintained by both MINECOFIN and the NBR.
The authorities have established a committee, composed of the staffs of the ministries of
Finance and Economic Planning and Foreign Affairs and the NBR, to collect, harmonize, and
monitor information on external public debt.

APPENDIX IV

Rwanda: Note on Medium- to Long-Term Scenarios
As a way to focus discussions on Rwanda’s long-term economic challenges, scenarios
were developed to assess investment requirements for achieving long-term development
objectives and their implications for required donor assistance and fiscal and external debt
sustainability. Each of the resulting scenarios is anchored by one explicit target to be reached
by 2020. The targets are (i) GDP per capita of US$900; (ii) GDP per capita of US$630;
(iii) NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent. Each of these scenarios further incorporates
three additional paths of export growth (“optimistic,” “base,” and “status quo”), which
extend the range of debt sustainability outcomes.
74.

The framework incorporates several simple-to-understand assumptions and is bound
firmly by past historical trends and statistical averages applicable to a developing economy
such as Rwanda. The objective of the exercise is to match the requisite capital resources with
the borrowing requirements, fiscal stability rules, and prudential balance of payments
management. Overall, the targets set are ambitious but the assumptions are realizable.
75.

The central relationship is a production function that converts public and private
investment into output. Labor supply adjusts to changes in capital resources one-to-one and
labor productivity growth matches exactly that of capital. This assumption eliminates labor
input from consideration and allows policymakers to focus entirely on capital resources,
which are the constraining factor. Private capital mobilization is difficult in a country with
historically low saving ratios and widespread poverty. For this reason, private sector
investment (both domestic and foreign) is assumed to grow moderately faster that GDP
throughout the period under study. This makes public investment flow one of the key policy
variables and a focus for the income generation part of the model.
76.

The framework assumes that Rwanda’s population growth slows gradually from
today’s 2.7 percent annual rate to 2 percent by 2010 and then stays there until 2020. The
investment growth relationship is set on the basis of an assumed incremental capital-output
ratio (ICOR) of 3.5 (compared to a realized ICOR of 4.8 during 2000-03), which corresponds
to a 29.5 percent rate of return on investment (on aggregate).30 The scenarios assume no
change in the real exchange rate, with values projected in constant 2004 Rwanda francs.
77.

In the first two scenarios (bound by the GDP target), public investment is set to
increase faster than GDP but otherwise its growth path and annual levels are the outcomes of
the exercise. In the third scenario (bound by the debt ratio), public investment is capped by
the borrowing requirement in the fiscal sector.
78.

30

As some part of social investment will affect productivity only over the longer term, this assumption
corresponds to a higher rate of return for other investment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 16, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Rwanda
On October 6, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.1
Background
Rwanda undertook an extraordinary national regeneration following the 1994 genocide, with
an estimated one-third of its population dead or displaced, its human capital, economic
infrastructure, and government institutions in ruins. The economic agenda included
macroeconomic stabilization, the establishment of new economic and financial institutions, the
development of human resource capacity, and repair of infrastructure.
Some aspects of the macroeconomic recovery were achieved rapidly, while others proved
more challenging. While the recovery in primary activities was relatively rapid, formal sector
activity registered a mixed performance. While growth in most services was strong, neither
manufacturing nor commerce had regained their 1993 levels by end-2003. The wholesale
destruction of Rwanda’s human capital, along with an initial phase of domestic security threats,
followed by regional conflict, clearly contributed to this disappointing performance.
A significant part of the authorities’ political agenda for 2003–04 was realized. In particular, a
new constitution was adopted by popular referendum in May 2003, followed by presidential
and legislative elections during August–October 2003. On the social agenda, proceedings
against the genocide-accused were introduced on a trial basis during 2003, and the
completion of hearings planned for 2004í05. The demobilization process is ongoing.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The implementation of Rwanda’s growth strategy lagged during 2003–04, reflecting continuing
human resource constraints. In these circumstances, the vulnerability of Rwanda’s real
economy to exogenous shocks became evident during 2003-04. Failed rains in 2003 led to a
decline in agricultural output, which accounts for 40 percent of value added, and limited
overall real GDP growth for the year to about 0.9 percent. There is a risk that real GDP growth
may also fall short of target in 2004 as construction activity is slowing and, reflecting the
impact of a drought-related electricity shortage, manufacturing activity contracting.
While some progress was made toward strengthening the government revenue base during
2003-04, the structural fiscal imbalance remained large. The revenue-to-GDP ratio rose to
13.5 in 2003 and is on-track to maintain that level in 2004, reflecting the impact of income tax
reforms that went into effect in 2003 Government spending has become increasingly focused
on social programs and capital expenditure. The overall fiscal deficit after grants, which
amounted to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2003, is programmed to decline modestly in 2004, to
2.2 percent of GDP. Data for the first half of 2004 indicate that the implementation of the 2004
budget was on track.
The external current account relative to GDP widened during 2003, before narrowing modestly
during the first half of 2004. A moderate improvement in the external terms of trade during
2003, as market prices for coffee and tea rose, was more than offset by a drop in coltan and
coffee export volumes. The continued significant depreciation in the real effective exchange
rate did little to slow import growth during 2003, and the external current account deficit before
grants increased by 3 percentage points of GDP, to 19.2 percent of GDP in 2003. During the
first part of 2004, however, coffee export volumes increased substantially, as international
market prices recovered from the previous year’s lows.
Rwanda’s external debt steadied in 2003, as new borrowing, excluding a new government loan
guarantee, was limited. Nonetheless, according to preliminary estimates based on a debt
sustainability analysis update, Rwanda’s net present value (NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio rose
to about 315 percent at end-2003, after enhanced HIPC Initiative relief. Slower-than-envisaged
export growth and discount rate changes had led to this deterioration in Rwanda’s net present
value of debt-to-exports ratio.
Rwanda’s medium-term macroeconomic strategy is to gradually reduce the fiscal and current
account deficits, and to bring its external debt to a sustainable level over the medium- to longterm. Supporting these objectives, Rwanda aims to strengthen regional relations and trade,
and further improve the environment for private investment. Rwanda’s economic program
includes a comprehensive structural reform agenda, which has been set in line with its Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, which was issued in June 2002.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted Rwanda’s substantial strides since the 1994 genocide in macroeconomic
stabilization, the establishment of key elements of a market economy, and the restoration of
state institutions. Nevertheless, the economic base of the formal sector remains narrow, with
the economy heavily dependent on agriculture, and extremely vulnerable to external and
climatic shocks. Capacity limitations are acute and human capital constraints severe.

-3Directors noted that Rwanda now faces the major challenge of implementing further economic
reforms aimed at faster and sustained economic growth to fight poverty, while aiming for
achieving fiscal and external sustainability and stabilizing the very heavy debt burden.
They looked forward to the realization of regional peace to help bolster confidence and
encourage private investment.
Directors welcomed the substantial advances made in the design and implementation of
essential social sector programs. They urged the authorities to update and implement the
agricultural growth strategy and press ahead with the export promotion strategy. Improved
productivity in the agricultural sector will be crucial for boosting economic growth.
They welcomed the initiatives under way to develop new products for niche markets, establish
an export processing zone, and expand export markets, including through Rwanda’s
prospective entry into the East African Community and Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
On the fiscal side, Directors observed that revenue collection in Rwanda is constrained by the
limited size of the formal sector and, accordingly, the achievement of government revenue
targets remains a challenge. In light of this, Directors underscored the importance of continued
efforts to improve tax efficiency by strengthening tax administration, reforming tax, customs,
and investment code legislation, and avoiding new tax exemptions. In addition, budgetary
operations will need to be clearly prioritized, spending contingencies established, and
expenditure limited to a sustainable level.
Directors noted that the scaling up of spending programs currently under consideration could
lead to a substantial increase in the structural deficit. Directors welcomed that borrowing
targets under the PRGF-supported programs have been observed. However, most Directors
expressed concern that significant further reliance on long-term external borrowing to finance
the planned higher spending may both hinder achievement of the progressive reduction in
imbalances targeted in Rwanda’s PRGF-supported program, and be imprudent given the
economy’s vulnerability. Given that the outlook for debt sustainability has worsened, Directors
urged the authorities to limit further external borrowing, and supported the view that Rwanda’s
development partners should be prepared to substantially shift their support for Rwanda
toward grant assistance. Several Directors pointed to the importance of improved
macroeconomic performance in 2004 to bring Rwanda to the completion point under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.
Directors indicated that the recent slowing of money growth is appropriate. They called on the
authorities to further strengthen coordination between the central bank and Treasury to ensure
that spending increases programmed for the second half of 2004 do not generate instability in
the money market.
Directors considered that the current floating exchange rate regime continues to serve
Rwanda well, given Rwanda’s continued vulnerability to external shocks and the regime’s
success in limiting inflation to moderate levels. Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent
adjustment of the auction rules, and looked forward to further steps toward increasing
exchange rate flexibility.

-4Directors commended the recent sale of the government’s majority shareholdings in two
commercial banks, and urged the central bank to act promptly to bring all commercial banks
into compliance with banking regulations.
Directors looked forward to a continuation of the progress in governance and public financial
management and accountability that has taken place since 2003. Directors urged the
authorities to continue to utilize efficiently available technical assistance—including from the
Fund—to address weaknesses in Rwanda’s statistical base, which suffers from significant
limitations for surveillance purposes.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire,
Alternate Executive Director for
Rwanda
October 6, 2004
1. Purpose and obligations under article IV: The extent of compliance
At the outset, we would like to express the appreciation of our Rwandese authorities to the
staff for the constructive discussion they had during the 2004 Article IV consultation and for
the excellent Selected Issues paper providing useful information on the economy. Our
authorities also express their appreciation to Fund management for their continuous support
and they are grateful for the continued assistance received from the international community
in their efforts to fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Developments Goals (MDGs).
As indicated by staff, our authorities have in their policy implementation endeavors complied
with the obligations under Article IV. As correctly documented by staff Rwanda’s trade
regime is open with tariff rates reduced and with no non-explicit tariff barriers. Moreover,
Rwanda maintains a floating exchange rate regime, which continues to serve the country
well. Authorities have furthermore adopted measures to ensure financial stability. Thus, inter
alia they have adopted measures to increase tax effort, which has risen to 13.5 percent and
are determined to maintain that level in 2004. Going beyond that level requires increasing the
tax base, which is currently constrained by the limited size of the formal sector. As they
pursue their efforts to bring about formal sector growth, our authorities are committed to
avoiding any new tax exemption and to continue with strengthening the revenue authority.
On the expenditure side, data for the first half of 2004 indicate that measures to restrain
growth in recurrent outlays while accommodating external grant-financed increases in social
spending are keeping the overall spending targets on track. External borrowing has also been
held below the level projected in the HIPC decision point document. Regarding monetary
aggregates there has been a curb in net credit to government and reduction in broad money.
On the external front, the first half of 2004 experienced a favorable modest narrowing
because of increase in exports volume for coffee and tea, terms of trade and decline of
imports.
Structural reforms, which underpin financial stability, have also been implemented. On the
financial sector, this includes privatization of BCR and BACAR, conclusion of bank
recapitalization plans as well as compliance with other prudential regulation. On the public
finance front, a new Auditor General’ Act to enforce control on public finance has been
submitted to Parliament for consideration, a new organic budget law has been enacted by
Parliament and preparation of finance instructions to accompany the organic budget law is
underway. With the assistance of Fund staff, a new tax law was drafted and a new custom
registration has been submitted to Parliament.
Over the period 2003-04, the political and institutional framework underpinning a marketoriented economy has been strengthened as the political agenda set out by the authorities has
been realized. Indeed, a new Constitution was adopted in May 2003 followed by presidential
and legislative elections organized in August and October 2003. Concerning the

-2demobilization and the GACACA process considerable progress has been made as well as on
the social front. Moreover, our authorities have not ceased to make their contribution towards
peace in the region. However, they are concerned that the Security Council resolution 1493
(2003) of 28 July 2003 requiring all parties to take the necessary measures to prevent the
supply, sale or transfer of arms or any related material and of any assistance or training to all
armed groups and militias which are not parties to the global and all inclusive agreement, is
not being enforced as required a fact which they believe would bring about the lasting peace.
2. Economic Performance and Challenges
The vulnerabilities of the Rwandese economy to shocks were evident in 2003-04. Due to rain
shortfalls, the agriculture output declined sharply. Manufacturing activity also shrank,
causing real output to grow by less than 1 percent, in 2003. In their resolve to achieve
sustainable growth and poverty reduction, our authorities have identified poverty in Rwanda
as being a rural phenomenon because 90 percent of the population live in rural sector. For
this reason when articulating their strategy to achieve growth and poverty reduction, our
authorities have emphasized achieving higher and sustained growth in agricultural
production. We share the concern of staff that statistical base which has been used to set
target growth rates in agricultural production can be inadequate due to limited resources and
technical capacities. Therefore, we call upon Fund staff and the international community to
provide the needed assistance.
We appreciate staff analysis in the issues paper which has identified the main constraints to
the realization of the agriculture growth strategy namely limitation in the marketing and
distribution of fertilizer input, limitation in the input credit system, limited agricultural
extension services (farmers education, seed multiplication) and land tenure system. As
already mentioned our authorities have prepared a land law which they submitted to
Parliament for promulgation. As for other limitations, we also call upon the Fund and the
Bank as well as the international community to provide needed assistance in establishing
appropriate systems. We also appreciate the analysis done on coffee and the need for further
diversification in the exports. The authorities are currently refining their export promotion
strategy with the help of the World Bank and other donors. We take note of the staff’s
concern over the performance of the manufacturing and commerce sectors, which up to now
have not achieved their previous peak out put, achieved in 1993. It is true the decline in these
sectors out put is attributed to post genocide aftermath. However, it is also a fact that before
the genocide, these sectors operated under a high protectionist policy and undoubtedly have
failed to with stand stiff competition from imports as the government implemented market
liberalization. In deed at the time when Rwanda would have benefited from such market
friendly policies put in place, now new shocks which constrain private investment in the
formal sector have set in namely shortage of electricity and oil price rises.
As we said earlier above, debt sustainability is an other challenge facing Rwanda‘s economy.
We agree with staff that the new priority social spending, which our authorities have
programmed, will, if not matched by increase in grant financing, likely worsen debt
sustainability. However, there is a need to reiterate that our authorities have exercised
restraint on other government expenditure and their not making such priority social spending

-3risk being a default on delivery on poverty reduction and the MDGs. We hope, the Fund will
give this due consideration including assistance in mobilizing grant financing.
3. Policies for 2004-05 and Medium-Term Prospects and Policies
The Rwandese authorities agree that the main and immediate challenges are achieving high
and sustained GDP growth, assuring fiscal and external sustainability as well as reducing
poverty. They are cognizant of the need to further strengthen the implementation of structural
reforms and adjustment measures in order to improve the institutional environment and
develop the basic infrastructure and social investment.
Fiscal policy
Our Rwandese authorities are determined to reinforce fiscal reforms implemented in 2002-03
through enhancing revenue authority and reducing tax exemptions. They also recognize the
importance to move towards fiscal balance. The authorities agree with staff that, given the
country’s debt sustainability problem, there is a need to limit external borrowing... Therefore,
in close cooperation with supporting partners, the authorities will continue to look for
external grant financing and Fund support is called for.
Monetary and Financial policies
The monetary objectives set out for 2004 are to contain inflation and build up the
international reserves. In this regard, the authorities will ensure that monetary and fiscal
policies operate effectively. To this end, efforts will continue to improve the responsiveness
of the banking system to changes in economy Regarding the exchange rate, the market –
based exchange rate system will be enhanced in order to assure the effectiveness of central
bank policy implementation. As we have already stated, the sale of majority shares in BCR
and BACAR reflects not only the authorities’determination to strengthen the health of the
sector but will also enhance the banking system’s supervision by the central bank.
Structural reforms
As mentioned in previous Board discussions on Rwanda, the objectives pursued by the
authorities in the structural area are to improve economic productivity, governance,
efficiency and external sustainability. Efforts towards the attainment of these goals will be
intensified in 2004 and beyond as outlined in the PRSP. After the successful sale of the
Pfunda tea estate, the privatization process of the telecommunications parastatal (Rwandatel),
and the Hotel company will be completed as rapidly as possible. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that civil service reforms are nearing the implementation stage, and the land reform
legislation including title transferability is being reviewed by the Parliament.
External viability
Our Rwandese authorities are cognizant of the need to reduce external imbalances over the
medium term in order to sustain the growth strategy. To this end, measures to articulate an

-4appropriate export strategy are underway. Efforts are also being made to gain benefits of
regional integration through entry in East African Community (EAC) and in South African
Development Community (SADC).
4. Conclusion
We would like to reemphasize that our Rwandese authorities are fully cognizant of the
challenges facing the economy and are committed to implement, under the PRGF Fundsupported program, all necessary measures in order to boost economic growth, stimulate
economic diversification and fight against unemployment and poverty.
Our Rwandese authorities are hopeful that they can rely on the international community’s
assistance in their reform efforts. They hope that, in view of the efforts they have undertaken
and the progress made in program implementation, they can reach the completion point under
the enhanced HIPC initiative very soon, thus enabling them to devote more resources to
poverty reduction.

macroeconomic stabilization, the establishment of new economic and financial institutions, the
development of human resource capacity, and repair of infrastructure.
Some aspects of the macroeconomic recovery were achieved rapidly, while others proved
more challenging. While the recovery in primary activities was relatively rapid, formal sector
activity registered a mixed performance. While growth in most services was strong, neither
manufacturing nor commerce had regained their 1993 levels by end-2003. The wholesale
destruction of Rwanda’s human capital, along with an initial phase of domestic security threats,
followed by regional conflict, clearly contributed to this disappointing performance.
A significant part of the authorities’ political agenda for 2003–04 was realized. In particular, a
new constitution was adopted by popular referendum in May 2003, followed by presidential
and legislative elections during August–October 2003. On the social agenda, proceedings
against the genocide-accused were introduced on a trial basis during 2003, and the
completion of hearings planned for 2004í05. The demobilization process is ongoing.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The implementation of Rwanda’s growth strategy lagged during 2003–04, reflecting continuing
human resource constraints. In these circumstances, the vulnerability of Rwanda’s real
economy to exogenous shocks became evident during 2003-04. Failed rains in 2003 led to a
decline in agricultural output, which accounts for 40 percent of value added, and limited
overall real GDP growth for the year to about 0.9 percent. There is a risk that real GDP growth
may also fall short of target in 2004 as construction activity is slowing and, reflecting the
impact of a drought-related electricity shortage, manufacturing activity contracting.
While some progress was made toward strengthening the government revenue base during
2003-04, the structural fiscal imbalance remained large. The revenue-to-GDP ratio rose to
13.5 in 2003 and is on-track to maintain that level in 2004, reflecting the impact of income tax
reforms that went into effect in 2003 Government spending has become increasingly focused
on social programs and capital expenditure. The overall fiscal deficit after grants, which
amounted to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2003, is programmed to decline modestly in 2004, to
2.2 percent of GDP. Data for the first half of 2004 indicate that the implementation of the 2004
budget was on track.
The external current account relative to GDP widened during 2003, before narrowing modestly
during the first half of 2004. A moderate improvement in the external terms of trade during
2003, as market prices for coffee and tea rose, was more than offset by a drop in coltan and
coffee export volumes. The continued significant depreciation in the real effective exchange
rate did little to slow import growth during 2003, and the external current account deficit before
grants increased by 3 percentage points of GDP, to 19.2 percent of GDP in 2003. During the
first part of 2004, however, coffee export volumes increased substantially, as international
market prices recovered from the previous year’s lows.
Rwanda’s external debt steadied in 2003, as new borrowing, excluding a new government loan
guarantee, was limited. Nonetheless, according to preliminary estimates based on a debt
sustainability analysis update, Rwanda’s net present value (NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio rose
to about 315 percent at end-2003, after enhanced HIPC Initiative relief. Slower-than-envisaged
export growth and discount rate changes had led to this deterioration in Rwanda’s net present
value of debt-to-exports ratio.
Rwanda’s medium-term macroeconomic strategy is to gradually reduce the fiscal and current
account deficits, and to bring its external debt to a sustainable level over the medium- to longterm. Supporting these objectives, Rwanda aims to strengthen regional relations and trade,
and further improve the environment for private investment. Rwanda’s economic program
includes a comprehensive structural reform agenda, which has been set in line with its Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, which was issued in June 2002.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted Rwanda’s substantial strides since the 1994 genocide in macroeconomic
stabilization, the establishment of key elements of a market economy, and the restoration of
state institutions. Nevertheless, the economic base of the formal sector remains narrow, with
the economy heavily dependent on agriculture, and extremely vulnerable to external and
climatic shocks. Capacity limitations are acute and human capital constraints severe.

-3Directors noted that Rwanda now faces the major challenge of implementing further economic
reforms aimed at faster and sustained economic growth to fight poverty, while aiming for
achieving fiscal and external sustainability and stabilizing the very heavy debt burden.
They looked forward to the realization of regional peace to help bolster confidence and
encourage private investment.
Directors welcomed the substantial advances made in the design and implementation of
essential social sector programs. They urged the authorities to update and implement the
agricultural growth strategy and press ahead with the export promotion strategy. Improved
productivity in the agricultural sector will be crucial for boosting economic growth.
They welcomed the initiatives under way to develop new products for niche markets, establish
an export processing zone, and expand export markets, including through Rwanda’s
prospective entry into the East African Community and Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
On the fiscal side, Directors observed that revenue collection in Rwanda is constrained by the
limited size of the formal sector and, accordingly, the achievement of government revenue
targets remains a challenge. In light of this, Directors underscored the importance of continued
efforts to improve tax efficiency by strengthening tax administration, reforming tax, customs,
and investment code legislation, and avoiding new tax exemptions. In addition, budgetary
operations will need to be clearly prioritized, spending contingencies established, and
expenditure limited to a sustainable level.
Directors noted that the scaling up of spending programs currently under consideration could
lead to a substantial increase in the structural deficit. Directors welcomed that borrowing
targets under the PRGF-supported programs have been observed. However, most Directors
expressed concern that significant further reliance on long-term external borrowing to finance
the planned higher spending may both hinder achievement of the progressive reduction in
imbalances targeted in Rwanda’s PRGF-supported program, and be imprudent given the
economy’s vulnerability. Given that the outlook for debt sustainability has worsened, Directors
urged the authorities to limit further external borrowing, and supported the view that Rwanda’s
development partners should be prepared to substantially shift their support for Rwanda
toward grant assistance. Several Directors pointed to the importance of improved
macroeconomic performance in 2004 to bring Rwanda to the completion point under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.
Directors indicated that the recent slowing of money growth is appropriate. They called on the
authorities to further strengthen coordination between the central bank and Treasury to ensure
that spending increases programmed for the second half of 2004 do not generate instability in
the money market.
Directors considered that the current floating exchange rate regime continues to serve
Rwanda well, given Rwanda’s continued vulnerability to external shocks and the regime’s
success in limiting inflation to moderate levels. Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent
adjustment of the auction rules, and looked forward to further steps toward increasing
exchange rate flexibility.

-4Directors commended the recent sale of the government’s majority shareholdings in two
commercial banks, and urged the central bank to act promptly to bring all commercial banks
into compliance with banking regulations.
Directors looked forward to a continuation of the progress in governance and public financial
management and accountability that has taken place since 2003. Directors urged the
authorities to continue to utilize efficiently available technical assistance—including from the
Fund—to address weaknesses in Rwanda’s statistical base, which suffers from significant
limitations for surveillance purposes.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire,
Alternate Executive Director for Rwanda
October 6, 2004
1. Purpose and obligations under article IV: The extent of compliance
At the outset, we would like to express the appreciation of our Rwandese authorities to the
staff for the constructive discussion they had during the 2004 Article IV consultation and for
the excellent Selected Issues paper providing useful information on the economy. Our
authorities also express their appreciation to Fund management for their continuous support
and they are grateful for the continued assistance received from the international community
in their efforts to fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Developments Goals (MDGs).
As indicated by staff, our authorities have in their policy implementation endeavors complied
with the obligations under Article IV. As correctly documented by staff Rwanda’s trade
regime is open with tariff rates reduced and with no non-explicit tariff barriers. Moreover,
Rwanda maintains a floating exchange rate regime, which continues to serve the country
well. Authorities have furthermore adopted measures to ensure financial stability. Thus, inter
alia they have adopted measures to increase tax effort, which has risen to 13.5 percent and
are determined to maintain that level in 2004. Going beyond that level requires increasing the
tax base, which is currently constrained by the limited size of the formal sector. As they
pursue their efforts to bring about formal sector growth, our authorities are committed to
avoiding any new tax exemption and to continue with strengthening the revenue authority.
On the expenditure side, data for the first half of 2004 indicate that measures to restrain
growth in recurrent outlays while accommodating external grant-financed increases in social
spending are keeping the overall spending targets on track. External borrowing has also been
held below the level projected in the HIPC decision point document. Regarding monetary
aggregates there has been a curb in net credit to government and reduction in broad money.
On the external front, the first half of 2004 experienced a favorable modest narrowing
because of increase in exports volume for coffee and tea, terms of trade and decline of
imports.
Structural reforms, which underpin financial stability, have also been implemented. On the
financial sector, this includes privatization of BCR and BACAR, conclusion of bank
recapitalization plans as well as compliance with other prudential regulation. On the public
finance front, a new Auditor General’ Act to enforce control on public finance has been
submitted to Parliament for consideration, a new organic budget law has been enacted by
Parliament and preparation of finance instructions to accompany the organic budget law is
underway. With the assistance of Fund staff, a new tax law was drafted and a new custom
registration has been submitted to Parliament.
Over the period 2003-04, the political and institutional framework underpinning a marketoriented economy has been strengthened as the political agenda set out by the authorities has
been realized. Indeed, a new Constitution was adopted in May 2003 followed by presidential
and legislative elections organized in August and October 2003. Concerning the

-2demobilization and the GACACA process considerable progress has been made as well as on
the social front. Moreover, our authorities have not ceased to make their contribution towards
peace in the region. However, they are concerned that the Security Council resolution 1493
(2003) of 28 July 2003 requiring all parties to take the necessary measures to prevent the
supply, sale or transfer of arms or any related material and of any assistance or training to all
armed groups and militias which are not parties to the global and all inclusive agreement, is
not being enforced as required a fact which they believe would bring about the lasting peace.
2. Economic Performance and Challenges
The vulnerabilities of the Rwandese economy to shocks were evident in 2003-04. Due to rain
shortfalls, the agriculture output declined sharply. Manufacturing activity also shrank,
causing real output to grow by less than 1 percent, in 2003. In their resolve to achieve
sustainable growth and poverty reduction, our authorities have identified poverty in Rwanda
as being a rural phenomenon because 90 percent of the population live in rural sector. For
this reason when articulating their strategy to achieve growth and poverty reduction, our
authorities have emphasized achieving higher and sustained growth in agricultural
production. We share the concern of staff that statistical base which has been used to set
target growth rates in agricultural production can be inadequate due to limited resources and
technical capacities. Therefore, we call upon Fund staff and the international community to
provide the needed assistance.
We appreciate staff analysis in the issues paper which has identified the main constraints to
the realization of the agriculture growth strategy namely limitation in the marketing and
distribution of fertilizer input, limitation in the input credit system, limited agricultural
extension services (farmers education, seed multiplication) and land tenure system. As
already mentioned our authorities have prepared a land law which they submitted to
Parliament for promulgation. As for other limitations, we also call upon the Fund and the
Bank as well as the international community to provide needed assistance in establishing
appropriate systems. We also appreciate the analysis done on coffee and the need for further
diversification in the exports. The authorities are currently refining their export promotion
strategy with the help of the World Bank and other donors. We take note of the staff’s
concern over the performance of the manufacturing and commerce sectors, which up to now
have not achieved their previous peak out put, achieved in 1993. It is true the decline in these
sectors out put is attributed to post genocide aftermath. However, it is also a fact that before
the genocide, these sectors operated under a high protectionist policy and undoubtedly have
failed to with stand stiff competition from imports as the government implemented market
liberalization. In deed at the time when Rwanda would have benefited from such market
friendly policies put in place, now new shocks which constrain private investment in the
formal sector have set in namely shortage of electricity and oil price rises.
As we said earlier above, debt sustainability is an other challenge facing Rwanda‘s economy.
We agree with staff that the new priority social spending, which our authorities have
programmed, will, if not matched by increase in grant financing, likely worsen debt
sustainability. However, there is a need to reiterate that our authorities have exercised
restraint on other government expenditure and their not making such priority social spending

-3risk being a default on delivery on poverty reduction and the MDGs. We hope, the Fund will
give this due consideration including assistance in mobilizing grant financing.
3. Policies for 2004-05 and Medium-Term Prospects and Policies
The Rwandese authorities agree that the main and immediate challenges are achieving high
and sustained GDP growth, assuring fiscal and external sustainability as well as reducing
poverty. They are cognizant of the need to further strengthen the implementation of structural
reforms and adjustment measures in order to improve the institutional environment and
develop the basic infrastructure and social investment.
Fiscal policy
Our Rwandese authorities are determined to reinforce fiscal reforms implemented in 2002-03
through enhancing revenue authority and reducing tax exemptions. They also recognize the
importance to move towards fiscal balance. The authorities agree with staff that, given the
country’s debt sustainability problem, there is a need to limit external borrowing... Therefore,
in close cooperation with supporting partners, the authorities will continue to look for
external grant financing and Fund support is called for.
Monetary and Financial policies
The monetary objectives set out for 2004 are to contain inflation and build up the
international reserves. In this regard, the authorities will ensure that monetary and fiscal
policies operate effectively. To this end, efforts will continue to improve the responsiveness
of the banking system to changes in economy Regarding the exchange rate, the market –
based exchange rate system will be enhanced in order to assure the effectiveness of central
bank policy implementation. As we have already stated, the sale of majority shares in BCR
and BACAR reflects not only the authorities’determination to strengthen the health of the
sector but will also enhance the banking system’s supervision by the central bank.
Structural reforms
As mentioned in previous Board discussions on Rwanda, the objectives pursued by the
authorities in the structural area are to improve economic productivity, governance,
efficiency and external sustainability. Efforts towards the attainment of these goals will be
intensified in 2004 and beyond as outlined in the PRSP. After the successful sale of the
Pfunda tea estate, the privatization process of the telecommunications parastatal (Rwandatel),
and the Hotel company will be completed as rapidly as possible. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that civil service reforms are nearing the implementation stage, and the land reform
legislation including title transferability is being reviewed by the Parliament.
External viability
Our Rwandese authorities are cognizant of the need to reduce external imbalances over the
medium term in order to sustain the growth strategy. To this end, measures to articulate an

-4appropriate export strategy are underway. Efforts are also being made to gain benefits of
regional integration through entry in East African Community (EAC) and in South African
Development Community (SADC).
4. Conclusion
We would like to reemphasize that our Rwandese authorities are fully cognizant of the
challenges facing the economy and are committed to implement, under the PRGF Fundsupported program, all necessary measures in order to boost economic growth, stimulate
economic diversification and fight against unemployment and poverty.
Our Rwandese authorities are hopeful that they can rely on the international community’s
assistance in their reform efforts. They hope that, in view of the efforts they have undertaken
and the progress made in program implementation, they can reach the completion point under
the enhanced HIPC initiative very soon, thus enabling them to devote more resources to
poverty reduction.
