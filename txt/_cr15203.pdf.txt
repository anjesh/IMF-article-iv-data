IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas
On June 8, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with The Bahamas.1
Real GDP expanded by an estimated 1 percent in 2014 on the back of increased tourist arrivals,
but growth remains well below pre-global crisis levels. Supported, in part, by rising US
economic activity, air arrivals grew by almost 5 percent in 2014 and applied room rates
improved by 7 percent. Domestic demand has been weighed down by the weak macroeconomic
outlook, high household indebtedness, and high unemployment which stood at 15.7 percent in
November 2014. Inflation rose to 2.2 percent in January 2015 (1.2 percent in December 2014),
as the imposition of the value added tax (VAT) offset the effects of declining oil prices.
The fiscal deficit in FY2013/14 is estimated to have narrowed to 3.3 percent of GDP from
5.4 percent in FY2012/13. Revenue was lower-than-budgeted, but a substantial reduction in
current spending resulted in an overall fiscal deficit below the budget target. The debt GDP ratio
is estimated to have reached 61 percent in FY2013/14 from 56 percent in FY2012/13.The
external current account continues to record sizable deficits, 22 percent of GDP in 2014,
reflecting the large import component of the Baha Mar resort project. International reserves
totaled US$839 million at end-March 2015, equivalent to 2.3 months of next year’s projected
imports of goods and services. Nonperforming loans remain elevated at 16 percent of total loans
at end-March 2015, and continues to constrain private sector credit growth. While domestic
banks continue deleveraging, the banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid.
Growth is expected to strengthen over 2015–16 with the improvement in US activity and the
opening of Baha Mar but significant structural impediments remain. Potential GDP growth is
estimated at about 1½ percent over the medium term, insufficient to generate a significant
reduction in the high unemployment rate. Absent structural reforms, including in the labor
market and the energy sector, significantly higher growth than currently projected will be
required to absorb new entrants to the labor force and reduce the unemployment rate to single
digits over the medium term. The full opening of Baha Mar and two smaller projects, together

with the strengthening US economy could represent a major boost to exports in the near-term.
Beyond 2016, growth would taper off as US growth decelerates, and the base effects from the
opening of Baha Mar fade. Inflation is expected to remain low, but VAT implementation early
this year would add an estimated 2½ percentage points to the CPI. Over the medium term, the
external current account deficit would return to single digits as construction-related outflows are
anticipated to be replaced by a rise in travel services receipt. Risks to the outlook continue to be
tilted to the downside, necessitating continued fiscal consolidation, and implementation of
structural measures to strengthen competitiveness, raise potential growth and lower
unemployment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the economy is recovering but the outlook remains challenging.
Despite the U.S. recovery and the imminent opening of the Baha Mar resort, growth is expected
to remain below pre-global crisis levels, and the current account deficit remains elevated.
Against this backdrop, Directors called for structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness, raise
potential growth, and lower unemployment; and for continued efforts to strengthen the fiscal
position.
Directors underscored the importance of finalizing and implementing the National Development
Program (NDP) to accelerate medium-to-long-term economic and social development, including
through diversification of the economy. Active labor market policies could help foster job
creation and, in this context, Directors urged the authorities to build on existing training
programs and placement services, while easing restrictions on labor mobility. Over the medium
term, enhancing the efficiency of labor market regulations and institutions and greater
investment in human capital will be essential to increasing productivity and competitiveness.
Directors also stressed the importance of stepping up reforms of the state-owned enterprises, in
particular in the energy sector.
Directors commended the authorities for the substantial progress on fiscal consolidation, and
successful introduction of the VAT. They called for steadfast implementation of the planned
fiscal consolidation in order to rebuild buffers and place public debt on a declining path. In this
regard, they stressed the need for continued revenue reforms, including strengthening tax
administration. They also recommended rationalization of current expenditures in the context of
a medium–term budget framework.
Directors generally agreed that the exchange rate peg has continued to serve The Bahamas well.
To support the peg going forward, they stressed the importance of structural reforms to improve
competitiveness, noting that this would also avoid placing an excessive burden on fiscal policy.
Directors welcomed continued progress in financial sector reforms, including the planned
introduction of a new credit bureau. They noted that the financial sector remains well capitalized
and liquid, and agreed that efforts to further strengthen financial sector regulation and

3
supervision should continue. Directors recommended that the authorities adopt policies that will
address persistently high non-performing loans to allow the banking system to play a more
effective role in supporting growth.

THE BAHAMAS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 21, 2015

Context. Economic activity strengthened somewhat in 2014 while the external current
account deficit worsened primarily as a result of Baha Mar construction-related imports. The
authorities continue to make substantial progress on fiscal consolidation with successful VAT
implementation in January 2015 setting the stage for continued improvements in the fiscal
position. Lower oil prices helped keep inflation anchored in 2014. Still, notwithstanding the
capital flow management (CFM) regime, international reserves remain low.
Key policy advice: Despite the U.S. recovery and the imminent opening of the Baha Mar
resort, the growth outlook remains well below pre-global crisis levels, and strong and timely
measures should be implemented to strengthen competitiveness and raise potential growth.
In addition, rebuilding fiscal and external buffers will be essential for sustaining
macroeconomic stability:


Reigniting strong and inclusive medium-term growth. Structural reforms are
needed to address longstanding competiveness issues including labor market
impediments to growth. Energy sector reforms could substantially lower energy
costs, boost productivity and facilitate economic diversification in the medium term.
A diversification strategy should explore the potential for increasing value added in
the tourism sector, including through deepening linkages with agriculture.



Rebuilding fiscal and external buffers. Notwithstanding the CFM regime, the fixed
exchange rate peg constrains monetary policy, leaving fiscal policy as the main
instrument for macroeconomic stabilization. Steadfast implementation of the VAT
and expenditure rationalization in the context of a medium-term budgetary
framework, together with public enterprise reforms, would help rebuild fiscal buffers
and support international reserves.



Preserving financial sector stability. The pre-crisis credit boom has left the
banking system with an overhang of non-performing loans, which will likely continue
to generate headwinds for the economy. Despite this, the banking system remains
very well capitalized and liquid. Measures should be put in place to resolve the debt
overhang while further strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework.

almost 5 percent in 2014 and applied room
rates improved by 7 percent. Domestic
demand has been weighed down by the weak
macroeconomic outlook, high household
indebtedness, and high unemployment which
stood at 15.7 percent in November 2014.
Inflation rose to 2.2 percent in January 2015
(1.2 percent in December 2014), as the
imposition of the value added tax (VAT) offset
the effects of declining oil prices.

2.
The fiscal deficit in FY 2013/14 (July to June) is estimated to have narrowed to
3.3 percent of GDP (from 5.4 percent). Revenue was lower-than-budgeted, but a substantial
reduction in current spending, including on wages and salaries, and on goods and services resulted
in an overall fiscal deficit below budget target. The debt-GDP-ratio is estimated to have reached
61 percent in FY2013/14 from 56 percent in FY2012/13. Key public enterprises including Bahamasair,
Bahamas Electricity Corporation (BEC) and the Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) continue to
be a drag on government finances. In September 2014, Moody's downgraded The Bahamas' rating
one notch to Baa2 citing deterioration of the government's balance sheet and subdued economic
growth.
3.
The external current account continues to record sizable deficits. Reflecting the large
import components of the Baha Mar resort project, the external current account deficit surged to
22 percent of GDP in 2014. The investment/GDP ratio remains in excess of 25 percent of GDP, and
an improved fiscal position has raised the rate of public saving, albeit overwhelmed by an implied
reduction in the private saving rate (Figure 4). Foreign financial inflows, including government
borrowing, are estimated, however, to have helped cushion reserve losses.

The real and nominal GDP data for 2010–2014 were revised in March 2015, which affected staff’s macroeconomic

Traditional external competiveness indicators do not unambiguously indicate real
effective exchange rate (REER) misalignment. A simple average of the three methodologies used
suggests an improvement in competitiveness, albeit under 10 percent, would be needed to close the
external current account balance. On the other hand, The Bahamas’ share of Caribbean tourism
arrivals has been stable recently with upside prospects

External reserves remain low. Reserves totaled

of US$175 million from the government following an
external bond placement early last year (Box 1).

subdued lending prospects, banks also continue to be liquid (with the liquid/total asset ratio at
23 percent at end–2014).

B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks

and the opening of Baha Mar, but significant structural impediments remain. Staff estimates

The new EBA-lite methodology suggests a 38 percent depreciation in the real effective exchange to close the

market and the energy sector, imply that significantly higher growth than currently projected will be
required to absorb new entrants to the labor force and reduce the unemployment rate to single
digits over the medium term. However, the full opening of Baha Mar and two smaller projects would
increase hotel room inventory by about 20 percent, and together with the strengthening U.S.
economy could represent a major boost to exports and the near-term growth outlook. Nonetheless,
staff growth projections are tempered by the significant risk that Baha Mar would cannibalize
arrivals to other Bahamian destinations unless existing structural challenges are addressed. The
improvement in activity from lower oil prices is broadly offset by VAT introduction and ongoing
private sector deleveraging. U.S. dollar appreciation is expected to have only a marginal impact on
activity, given the peg and

to single digits as construction-related outflows are anticipated to be replaced by a rise in travel
services receipt.
8.
Risks continue to be tilted to the downside although with considerable uncertainty
(see Table 8). Spillover risks to The Bahamas stem mainly from the U.S. economy, mostly through
the trade and financial channels, but oil price shocks are also important (Annex 3). While the
offshore financial system remains substantial, the 2012 FSAP concluded that the domestic financial
sector’s susceptibility to offshore spillovers is limited (Annex 4). Nonetheless, the eventual
normalization of U.S. monetary policy could further strengthen the dollar, worsening the external
competitiveness of The Bahamas vis-à-vis non-U.S. dollar pegged competitors. This, together with
adverse shocks to the U.S economy, weaker than projected activity in the global economy, and a
disappointing Baha Mar performance would dampen economic recovery, make fiscal consolidation
challenging, and weigh on the current account and foreign reserves. However, the net effects of
these adverse risks on the external balance are uncertain, as the winding down of Baha Mar
construction and lower oil prices are expected to reduce imports going forward. VAT
implementation setbacks, and a weak fiscal consolidation generally, could undermine the
authorities’ policy credibility, and heighten risks to long-term debt sustainability and the country’s
credit rating. The persistently elevated non-performing loan (NPL) ratio poses a tail–risk threat to
financial sector stability. Meanwhile, the recent rapprochement in U.S./Cuban relations poses an as
yet un-quantified risk to the economic model of many tourism-based Caribbean economies.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
While growth momentum is improving amid U.S. recovery, it remains weak. With relatively low
international reserves, policy discussions focused on rebuilding fiscal and external buffers and raising
productivity and competitiveness to reignite growth. Specifically, staff’s recommendations centered on
policies to (i) reignite strong and inclusive medium term growth; (ii) restore fiscal and debt
sustainability; (iii) rebuild external buffers; and (iv) preserve financial sector stability.

A. Reigniting Strong and Inclusive Medium-Term Growth
9.
Staff noted that The Bahamas faces several challenges in boosting its growth
potential. First, the country must attract sufficient tourist demand to fill the large impending
increase in supply. Second, labor market rigidities constrain the potential supply of labor in the
medium term. Persistently high unemployment rates suggest the presence of wage rigidities while
business surveys cite a lack of skilled labor as an important constraint to growth. Third, there are
significant impediments to the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Fourth, there are
more general constraints to investment. The 2015 World Bank Doing Business Indicators ranks The
Bahamas 97th out of 189 countries. Moreover, The Bahamas had a Distance to (best practice)
Frontier score of 61.37 out of a maximum of 100, indicating much room for improvement. The
Bahamas has particularly low rankings in getting credit, protecting investors, and registering
property.
10.
Persistently high unemployment underscores the need for policies to promote more
inclusive growth (Box 2). The Bahamas enjoys a relatively high per capita income (third highest in
the Western Hemisphere behind the U.S. and Canada), which has helped to maintain high living
standards. However, since the onset of the global financial crisis, the unemployment rate has
remained in double digits mostly due to depressed domestic demand and exports and may have
contributed to the recent rise in crime rates. There is evidence of significant structural
unemployment, which suggests the existence of impediments to job creation and proper
functioning of the labor market. Evidence points to skills mismatches, which partly reflects
deficiencies in the education system and migration of skilled labor. At the same time, according to
the private sector, efforts to hire foreign labor to fill skill shortages are occasionally hampered by
difficulties in securing work permits. Moreover, the job content of growth appears relatively low and
is compounded by low productivity and high real wages.
11.
Inclusive growth policies would also reduce inequality and gender imbalances (Box 2).
Income inequality appears relatively high as indicated by the Gini coefficient estimated at 46 percent
in 2011. Although the 2014 World Economic Forum’s global gender gap report ranks The Bahamas
high in attaining gender balance (35th out of 142 countries), males appear to be lagging in
educational attainment, and much more in securing technical and professional jobs. Females, on the
other hand, seem to be lagging in political empowerment as indicated by the proportion of women
in parliament and cabinet.

THE BAHAMAS

12.
Staff concurred with the authorities on the need to finalize and implement the
National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP would assess the country’s macroeconomic
performance, institutions, and governance and propose strategies to accelerate economic,
institutional, and social development over the medium term and long run. The NDP should review
The Bahamas’ economic diversification strategy with a view to exploring scope for increasing value
added, including in the tourism sector through deepening linkages with agriculture. In view of the
employment and labor market challenges, staff recommended enhancing active labor market
policies to foster job creation and deliver more inclusive growth. In the short term, the focus should
be on building upon existing vocational and on-the-job training programs, and job placement
services, while seeking to attract skilled Bahamians in the Diaspora and easing restrictions on intraCaribbean labor mobility. In the long term, improving educational outcomes, better alignment of
educational curricula with skills demand, aligning wages to productivity, and enhancing the
efficiency of labor market regulations and institutions would be essential to increasing productivity
and competitiveness. In addition, greater investment in infrastructure and human capital would be
necessary to ensure that growth is broad–based and that the benefits are spread more widely.
13.
Affordable and dependable electricity supply is critical to maintaining The Bahamas’
image as a high-end tourist destination (Annex 5). Improving the efficiency of the electricity
company could substantially lower energy costs, boost productivity, and facilitate economic
diversification over the medium term. There appears to be significant scope for boosting energy
efficiency through more efficient generation, appropriate pricing (balancing cost reduction and
investment needs), expanding the use of alternative energy sources, and improved monitoring
(including the collection of arrears).
14.
Advancing far reaching reforms at the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is key to
reigniting growth. The pace of reforms in loss–making public entities, including the BEC,
Bahamasair, and WSC, appears to be lagging and could hamper efforts towards alleviating
infrastructure bottlenecks and enhancing medium term growth. Staff urged speedy reform of these
entities, focusing on lowering operating costs, rationalizing tariffs, increasing capital investment,
enhancing the regulatory framework and generally raising the quality and reliability of service. In
particular, staff urged the authorities to press ahead with plans to place the electricity company on a
commercially–sound basis and to liberalize the regulatory framework.

The authorities fully agreed with staff on the need to promote higher and more inclusive growth,
observing in particular that there was an urgent need to reduce the very high youth
unemployment rates, thus also helping to stem rising crime rates. They noted that growth has
not been strong enough to absorb new entrants to the labor force, but are optimistic that Baha
Mar opening and other new projects could potentially lower unemployment. They
acknowledged that income inequality is high, but it is partly due to highly paid expatriates,
especially in the financial sector.



They regarded the NDP as critical to their efforts to strengthen and diversify the Bahamian
economy and have set up the Bahamas Investment Promotion Agency (BIPA) within the Office of
the Prime Minister to spearhead efforts to finalize the NDP. The BIPA would be tasked with
monitoring all priority projects in a centralized fashion, ensuring timely implementation.
Currently, work on the NDP is focusing on diagnostic studies along several dimensions,
including educational policy, the business environment, and policies pertaining to the Family
Islands. The authorities also indicated that energy sector policies would be integrated with the
NDP to ensure consistency. They are building an agriculture school that would train students in
commercial farming, among other activities, which would help reduce food imports.



On energy sector reforms, and in addition to those already announced (Annex V), the authorities
indicated that they would be outsourcing the management of the Bahamas Electricity
Corporation to a private sector company with a mandate to run the BEC on a fully commercial
basis. This would imply rationalization of tariffs and employment policies, and laying the basis
for increased investment and the modernization of generation plants. In addition, they were
considering options to set up an independent regulator for the electricity sector. Transformation
of the BEC should lower energy prices, and enhance the competitiveness of the tourism sector.

B. Rebuilding Fiscal and External Buffers
15.
The lack of fiscal space and modest external buffers constrain the use of demand-side
policies to stimulate growth. Notwithstanding capital controls, the exchange rate peg constrains
monetary policy. Furthermore, the scope for fiscal stimulus to support the recovery is limited by low
international reserves and the need to reverse the debt trajectory.
16.
The introduction of the new VAT reaffirmed the authorities’ commitment to mediumterm fiscal consolidation. Staff commended the authorities for the introduction of a broad-based
VAT on January 1, 2015 with a standard rate of 7.5 percent and very few exemptions. This represents
a significant step towards boosting policy credibility, and bolstering market confidence. The
implementation of the VAT appears to have been relatively smooth despite some transitional issues
that are being resolved. Early indications of its performance are encouraging, and the authorities
seem on course to achieving their initial revenue targets. Following the VAT implementation, the
authorities should advance other revenue reform measures on which progress had lagged, including
modernization of customs and property tax administration, and establishment of a central revenue
agency.

17.
Over the medium term, the government proposes to continue its fiscal consolidation
efforts. The fiscal position is projected to improve steadily in the medium term as envisaged during
the 2013 Article IV consultation, with the fiscal deficit expected to narrow to about 2 percent of GDP
in FY2015/16 reaching 0.3 percent in 2019/20. The primary balance is projected to move into a
surplus in 2015/16. In addition to enhancing revenue, the government proposes to rein in current
spending while keeping capital spending around 3 percent of GDP.
18.
The central government debt to GDP ratio will remain elevated, but decline slowly
over the medium term as the fiscal position strengthens. Under the baseline scenario of the debt
sustainability analysis, central government debt is projected to peak at 63 percent of GDP in
FY2014/15, declining marginally thereafter to 62 percent in FY2019/20. Gross financing requirements
will decline from 5.7 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 to about 2.0 percent of GDP in FY2019/20.
External financing requirement is highlighted as a significant risk to the debt profile, which could be
mitigated by the projected strengthening of the external current account in the medium term. The
main risks to debt sustainability remain slower than expected growth and weak fiscal efforts (Annex
1).
19.
Staff agreed that the pace of consolidation planned by the authorities was broadly
appropriate, notably in view of the relatively weak growth outlook. Staff urged the authorities
to intensify efforts with regard to the implementation of other tax reforms. Steadfast
implementation of the planned fiscal consolidation is key to placing debt levels on a declining path.
On the expenditure side, staff welcomed ongoing efforts to tighten spending control, and plans to
reform public procurement and payroll management. Currently, the fiscal consolidation plan
envisages a small saving on expenditures reform. Accelerated rationalization of current expenditure
in the context of a medium–term budgetary framework is therefore warranted to help preserve the
hard-won benefits of the VAT and help to restore fiscal and debt sustainability. Staff also urged the
authorities to press ahead with plans to introduce fiscal responsibility legislation.
20.
SOE reforms would facilitate fiscal consolidation. Staff noted that key state-owned
entities continue to record sizable financial losses as a result of their public service mandates,
operational inefficiencies and inadequate enabling regulatory framework. In particular, operating
costs are notably high, mainly reflecting aged facilities and generous employment policies, while
productivity is low. Moreover, SOE tariffs have not kept pace with the cost of service delivery,
necessitating continued budget support. For example, government support to both Bahamasair and
WSC is expected to reach US$60 million (0.7 percent of GDP) in FY2014/15. Aggregate SOE debt was
16 percent of GDP in FY2013/14. Reforms of these entities are thus critical to stemming the drag on
public finances.
21.
The large band of uncertainty on the growth outlook calls for continued fiscal
vigilance. Staff recommended the identification of contingency measures for meeting fiscal targets,
including offsetting measures, should downside risks materialize. Such measures should aim to
protect growth enhancing capital spending given the large infrastructure requirements. In addition,
with growth remaining tepid, staff underscored that fiscal consolidation is not only needed to
achieve fiscal and debt sustainability, but also critical to rebuilding external buffers in the near term,
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

and to sustaining the peg. Over the longer term, measures would need to be taken in the area of
pensions and health insurance to put these on a fiscally sustainable footing, notably in view of
population aging.
Authorities Views:


The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the fiscal position, and reiterated their
commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation. They acknowledged the need to further
contain expenditure growth, in the context of a medium term budgetary framework, as
recommended by staff, especially in light of future aging–related spending. They noted that the
recently introduced VAT had started bearing fruit and highlighted outstanding issues that are
being resolved, including transitioning of the current VAT administrative structure to a new,
fully–fledged central revenue administration (CRA) along with the other major domestic taxes,
such as real property tax, business license, and stamp duties. A new CRA is expected to come on
stream by end–2015, starting with the co–location of the VAT and Internal Revenue
Departments. They also noted that the ongoing modernization of customs and property tax
departments will further enhance revenue collections.



As for fiscal contingency measures, the authorities indicated that, in the event of revenue
underperformance, they could cut current spending, and prioritize capital spending in order to
achieve fiscal targets. They acknowledged that the government will continue to support state–
owned enterprises, such as the Water and Sewerage Corporation, and Bahamasair, but at
manageable levels while making efforts to improve their efficiency. The authorities remain
committed to examining options for fiscal responsibility and, based on a soon to be released
discussion paper, plan to have a stakeholder consultation on the issue with recommendations to
Cabinet later this year.

22.
The exchange rate peg and system of capital controls continue to serve The Bahamas
well as an anchor for price and financial stability. With a long-standing US$1=B$1 peg, the
system has helped deliver real and financial sector stability, facilitating The Bahamas’ comparatively
high and rising living standards. However, this peg could likely also pose tensions, with the eventual
normalization of U.S. monetary policy, and should the U.S. dollar appreciate further relative to other
major currencies. With foreign exchange reserves expected to remain at modest levels over the
medium term, improvements in macroeconomic resilience through diversification, including in the
tourism sector, are crucial, in light of The Bahamas’ susceptibility to external shocks. Therefore, staff
argued that structural reforms to improve competitiveness are even more urgent to avoid placing an
excessive burden of adjustment on fiscal policy.
Authorities Views:


The authorities concurred that enhancing competitiveness was crucial for sustainable growth
and maintenance of the exchange rate system. They noted recent successes in diversifying the
tourism experience in sports, and highlighted progress in enhancing the business environment,
in particular, through trade facilitation and online payment of taxes. They recognized that the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

THE BAHAMAS

opening of Cuba to U.S. tourists presented new challenges, but viewed that the Bahamian
product would be able to compete effectively. The authorities pointed out that the current level
of international reserves remain within target levels (US$800–US$850 million, above 90 percent
of base money) and further accretion to reserves would depend largely on improvement in
tourism earnings, as growth strengthens, as well as from foreign direct investment. They will take
measures, should they become necessary, to protect reserves from falling below their target
levels.

C. Enhancing Financial Sector Stability
23.
Staff concurred with the authorities’ view that the current monetary policy stance
remained appropriate. Given the fixed exchange rate, modest reserves, continued slow growth and
contained “core”—non-VAT related, non-energy—inflation, neither loosening or tightening would
be appropriate in the current circumstances. However, upward adjustments may eventually be
required as U.S. policy rates are increased.
24.
Staff noted that the Bahamian credit channel remains impeded by a nagging debt
overhang. Persistently high NPLs, in the context of the CFM regime, have further limited the local
transmission of the expansionary U.S. monetary stance (see also Annex 3). Given the private sector’s
sizable loan burdens, subdued employment prospects, and tightened credit requirements, new loan
demand creation remained muted amid overall deleveraging. Staff noted recent efforts of the
authorities and some banks to address long-standing NPLs, and discussed the potential advantages
of establishing a specialized agency, including a possible successor to the government’s Mortgage
Relief Plan. Resolving the debt overhang will help preserve financial stability, allow for specialized
management to maximize the value of distressed assets and permit banks to focus on their core
business of lending, thereby supporting the recovery. Despite facilitating bankruptcy laws, banks
remain reluctant for both economic and social reasons to press for accelerated resolution of
nonperforming mortgages. Staff noted that excessive time delays and high costs of property
registration and inefficiencies in the enforcement of contracts also likely weighed on the
resuscitation of bank lending. However, recently introduced rules for civil procedure focused on
streamlining court proceedings and promoting less costly dispute resolutions may prove beneficial.
25.
Staff welcomed the planned introduction of a new credit bureau, including its broad
scope. However, staff noted that while more comprehensive information regarding existing debt
obligations and repayment histories would eventually facilitate access to credit, it may initially raise
additional lender reluctance if the true level of private sector indebtedness exceeded expectations.
26.
The Bahamian financial sector remains well capitalized and liquid, and progress in
improving the supervisory framework continues apace. Staff welcomed the results of recent
banking system stress tests, which indicated that the majority of banks remain resilient to the most
extreme shocks given their very high capital to risk-weighted assets ratios. The authorities are
further strengthening their regulatory and supervisory framework, largely in accord with FSAP
recommendations (Box 3). Staff also noted that implementation of the Basel framework was on

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

track, and that the AML/CFT evaluation was, after some delay, in train. The authorities are
encouraged to enhance compliance and effectiveness of the AML/CFT framework in line with the
2012 FATF standard.
Authorities Views:


The authorities agreed that credit growth will remain subdued, given the weakness in consumer
demand, elevated unemployment and as banks continue applying tighter credit standards. They
noted that banks were more aggressively writing off and provisioning for bad debts, in some
cases incurring sizable losses, and foregoing dividends. A resumption of lending was thought to
depend on an improvement in employment prospects, particularly as The Baha Mar resort
opens. The resort is expected to employ about 5000 people within 6–7 months of its opening.
On the credit bureau, they noted that credit exposures may not be unexpectedly high upon its
introduction since banks are conducting due diligence and are dealing with the same set of
borrowers.



The authorities explained that the government’s previous mortgage relief program required
restructuring to enhance its effectiveness. While they noted that banks had already restructured
many mortgages, they suggested that a revamped program was still needed and that they
intended to re-launch it soon.

D. Others
27.
Data provision is generally adequate for economic surveillance, but some gaps remain
in both coverage and timeliness, including in national accounts, the consolidated accounts of the
public sector, and the economy-wide international investment position (IIP), due to capacity
constraints. Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to compile and publish quarterly national accounts
and IIP statistics. Accordingly, additional resources are needed to address remaining data
shortcomings.
28.
Staff supported addressing ongoing and expanded technical assistance (TA) needs.
CARTAC advisors have identified several areas to support the authorities’ efforts including:
continuing assistance with implementation of VAT; strategic and medium-term budgeting; adopting
the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual; and developing estimates of The Bahamas’ IIP.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Economic activity is slowly recovering, but the outlook holds significant uncertainty.
Real GDP growth remains well below pre-global crisis levels as tourism continues to face headwinds
from persistent softness in the high-value-added segment and increased competition from low cost
regional destinations. Moreover, domestic demand continues to be weighed down by the weak
macroeconomic outlook, high household indebtedness, and high unemployment. Even with the
opening of Baha Mar, the medium term growth outlook remains weak.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

THE BAHAMAS

30.
Policies to support strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth are needed. In this context,
it is essential to finalize and implement the NDP, which would propose strategies to accelerate
economic, institutional, and social development over the medium term and long run. Enhancing
active labor market policies could help foster job creation and deliver more inclusive growth. The
authorities should build on existing vocational and on-the-job training programs, and job placement
services, while seeking to attract skilled Bahamians in the Diaspora and easing restrictions on intraCaribbean labor mobility. In the long term, improving educational outcomes, reducing skills
mismatch, and enhancing the efficiency of labor market regulations and institutions would be
essential to increasing productivity and competitiveness. In addition, greater investment in
infrastructure and human capital would be necessary to ensure inclusive growth.
31.
Fiscal consolidation is critical to sustaining macroeconomic stability over the medium
term. The authorities’ planned pace of consolidation appears broadly adequate but implementation
risks remain. While VAT is off to a good start, progress on other revenue reforms has been slow
given limited implementation capacity, and the authorities will need to reinvigorate efforts in those
areas. With the debt level projected to remain elevated in the medium term, accelerated
rationalization of current expenditure in the context of a medium–term budgetary framework is
therefore warranted to help restore fiscal sustainability. Fiscal consolidation is also critical to
rebuilding external buffers in the near term, and to sustaining the peg. Over the medium term,
policies should be implemented in the area of pensions and health insurance to put these on a
fiscally sustainable footing, notably in view of population aging.
32.
The exchange rate peg and system of capital controls continue to serve The Bahamas
well as an anchor for price and financial stability. However, this peg will likely also face tensions,
with the eventual normalization of U.S. monetary policy, and should the U.S. dollar appreciate
further relative to other major currencies. In light of the low international reserves, structural reforms
to improve competitiveness are therefore urgently needed to avoid placing an excessive burden of
adjustment on fiscal policy.
33.
The authorities should consider the merits of an adequately capitalized specialized
agency to help resolve debt overhang in the banking system. More broadly, policies should be
adopted that will facilitate addressing persistently high NPLs in order for the banking system to play
a more effective role in supporting growth, including encouraging further responsible provisioning
and write-down of bad loans and improving the operations of the land registry. Nonetheless, The
Bahamian financial sector remains well capitalized and liquid and progress to strengthen financial
sector regulation and supervision should continue.
34.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-

month cycle.

Box 1. Assessment of Reserve Adequacy
The Bahamas’ international reserves remain low. At end–March 2015, reserves totaled $839 million, up
from $742 million at end-2013, equivalent to 2.3 months of
next year’s imports of goods and services. While current and
projected reserves fall short of some standard metrics, these
levels are broadly consistent with historical trends, as capital
controls and one-off inflows have helped maintain reserve
levels. Nonetheless, rebuilding reserve buffers is essential to
building resilience to external shocks to which The Bahamas,
like other small states, is very susceptible.

and is projected to continue meeting this test, after adjusting imports for FDI inflows.
The Bahamas’ reserve adequacy outlook is not clear-cut when analyzed under the broad money-based
method that is used to capture the risks from currency mismatches and drains arising from possible bank
runs. The country’s reserve holdings are projected to remain below the broad money norm of 20 percent,
but related risks would be relatively limited given the central bank’s restrictions on capital flows—all outward
capital transfers require exchange control approval, and outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted.
Reserves easily meet the Central Bank’s statutory 50 percent of total bank liabilities (comprising reserve
money, government and other public sector deposits).
The country’s reserves holdings are projected to be
adequate relative to the recently revised risk-weighted
benchmark for economies with capital controls, that is

3,000

designed to reflect a broader range of sources of risk, such

desirable levels when assessed against the more stringent
adjusted measure for small island developing states (SIDS)2
because of their greater vulnerabilities to shocks. This
strengthens the case for fiscal consolidation to help build
external buffers.

about three-quarters of the poor and 85 percent of

the country’s population, income levels in the Family Islands are notably lower.
Evidence points to significant inequality and moderate gender imbalances. An income-based Gini
coefficient is estimated at 46 percent in 2011 indicating that the income share of the top 20 percent of the
population was about 16 times the share of the bottom 20 percent. The relatively high income disparity
could be partly explained by a significant number of expatriates (12 percent of the employed in 2011 were
non–Bahamians), in high paying private sector jobs, particularly in the financial sector. With regard to gender
issues, the 2014 World Economic Forum’s global gender gap report ranks The Bahamas high in attaining
gender balance broadly in several key areas. However, males appear to be lagging in educational
attainment, and much more in securing technical and professional jobs. Females, on the other hand, seem to
be less politically empowered as measured by the proportion of women in parliament and cabinet.

Caribbean, migration of skilled labor is high in
The Bahamas. According to the private sector, efforts to hire foreign labor to fill skill shortages are
occasionally hampered by difficulties in securing work permits partly because of delays in the approval
process and weaknesses in the government’s mentorship program.
A relatively low job content of growth is compounded by low productivity and high real wages. A
recent IMF study3, estimates growth–employment elasticity to average 0.5 percent for The Bahamas. This
implies that without structural reforms, higher than currently projected real GDP growth will be needed over
the medium term to absorb new entrants to the labor force and to significantly reduce unemployment from
its current high level. Moreover, despite a relatively high labor force participation rate, 73 percent in 2014,
labor productivity, for the most part, has not kept pace with real wage growth in the last decade.
A comprehensive set of policies is needed to address these multi-faceted issues. In the context of a
national strategy, such policies should aim to reignite strong medium term growth, remove impediments to
job creation, strengthen existing active labor market programs, and combat crime. Government’s social
safety net programs need to be streamlined, while the educational system should be reformed to better
align curricula with skills demand and improve educational outcomes. It will also be critical to align wages to
productivity, and enhance the efficiency of labor market and immigration regulations and institutions.

Box 3. Recent Financial Sector Regulatory and Supervisory Developments
In July 2012, The Bahamian authorities participated in a Financial Sector Assessment Program. At that
time, the FSAP mission found no short-term threats to financial stability. Moreover, the mission concluded
that the oversight of the financial system is independent and strong, particularly with respect to banking
supervision. Nonetheless, the authorities continue to further improve the regulatory and supervisory system,
including in the following areas:



Risk-based supervisory framework/crisis management: The Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBB) and
other regulatory authorities continue strengthening their frameworks, including with IMF technical
assistance (most recently by the Legal Department in March 2015 to discuss the bank resolution,
crisis management framework, and in April 2015 by CARTAC to the Securities Commission
regarding risk-based supervision). Banking system stress tests for credit quality, liquidity and
interest rate sensitivity indicated most recently that, with the exception of one institution (now
undergoing restructuring), the banking systems’ capital buffers are resilient to extreme shocks;



Basel II/III: A roadmap for implementing Basel II/III was introduced in 2013, envisaging a 30-month
timeline ending in 2015Q4, with live implementation to commence in 2016Q1. Progress has been
on schedule, with most foreign-owned institutions already observing Basel III;



Anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT): The authorities had
committed to undergo an assessment within 18 months of the FSAP. Consistent with the greater
flexibility in the timing of assessments relative to FSAPs as agreed in March 2014, this assessment is
tentatively scheduled to be undertaken by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in
November 2015.



Deposit Insurance: The Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC), under the supervision of the CBB, is
implementing a three-year (2013–16) strategic plan to adopt FSAP recommendations, including
improving transparency and disclosure, generating adequate pre-funding (and identify ex ante
borrowing resources), and ensuring prompt payout periods;



Credit unions: Seven credit unions with assets totaling $345.3 million (3.5 percent of the domestic
banking systems’ assets), are to be brought under the regulatory and supervisory ambit of the CBB.
Legislation is before Parliament, but the CBB undertook its first onsite inspection of credit unions
during 2014. Upon adoption, credit union deposits will have DIC protection;

Credit Bureau: The CBB issued in September 2014 a consultation paper containing key provisions of
a Draft Credit Reporting Bill and Draft Regulations, followed in November with a Request for

September 2015 following the signing of an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United
States in November 2014.

1/ The equilibrium value is computed using the equilibrium real exchange rate approach as in Vitek
(2010).
2/ The current account (CA) norm is computed using the estimated parameters from the panel
regression in Vitek (2010), and staff medium-term projections for the conditioning variables. In
particular, the CA norm depends positively on the country's oil trade balance, the level of net foreign
assets, relative fiscal balance, and negatively with respect to relative income growth.

High
Lower-than-anticipated potential growth and
persistently low inflation from a failure to fully
address crisis legacies, leading to secular
stagnation and lower commodity prices.

Weaker recoveries in advanced countries, especially
the U.S. which accounts for 80 percent of tourism
arrivals to The Bahamas will undermine growth,
weaken public finances, and put pressures on the BOP
and international reserves.

High
Maturing of the cycle, misallocation of investment,
and incomplete structural reforms leading to
prolonged slower growth.

A further slowdown of emerging economies would
lower medium term growth prospects, particularly as
tourism strategy is beginning to be oriented towards
growing market share in EMs.

Medium
Improving U.S. economic prospects versus the rest
of the world leads to a further dollar surge,
boosting non-U.S. trade but creating balance sheet
strains for dollar debtors

Relative to low cost destinations and countries whose
currencies are not pegged one-to-one to the dollar, a
further dollar strengthening would lower tourism
arrivals from the U.S., widen the current account deficit
and lower reserves.

Diversify growth drivers and

Medium
Sustained tensions in Russia/Ukraine depress
business confidence and heighten risk aversion,
amid disturbance in global financial, trade and
commodity markets. Heightened risk of
fragmentation in the Middle East, leading to a
sharp rise in oil prices, with negative spillovers to
the global economy

Spikes in global oil prices will feed into higher
inflation, weaken external current account balance,
raise travel costs and possibly lower tourist arrivals.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Low
The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remains high.
There is some degree of uncertainty on the value
of underlying collateral for nonperforming

The banking system’s capital buffers provide shockabsorbing capacity. However, NPLs that remain on the
balance sheet for prolonged periods could gradually
result in higher provisioning and charge-offs, dragging
down banks’ future profitability.

Further strengthen financial
sector supervision and
oversight.

Low
Protracted failure to agree on a credible medium
term plan for fiscal sustainability in the United
States could lead to a sustained loss of confidence.
Such developments could undermine the recovery
of private domestic demand and severe global
market repercussions.

Weak recovery of private demand in the U.S. will affect
tourism arrivals in The Bahamas, which in turns would
undermine its growth prospects, weaken public
finances, and put pressures on the BOP and
international reserves.

Annex I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
The public debt1 to GDP ratio will remain elevated, but sustainable in the medium term as the fiscal
position strengthens. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to peak at 63 percent of GDP
in FY 2014/15, declining marginally thereafter to 62 percent in FY 2019/20. Financing conditions
would also improve as gross financing requirements gradually decline from 5.7 percent of GDP in FY
2014/15 to about 2.0 percent of GDP in 2019/20. External financing requirement is highlighted as a
significant risk to the debt profile, which could be mitigated by the projected strengthening of the
current account in the medium term. The main risks to debt sustainability remain slower than expected
growth and weak fiscal efforts.
Public debt is estimated to have reached 60.9 percent of GDP in FY 2013/14 compared with
56.3 percent in FY 2012/13, reflecting weak fiscal stance and lackluster growth performance.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt is expected to peak at 62.8 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15
and thereafter fall slightly to 62.1 percent of GDP in 2019/20, as the fiscal position gradually
strengthens with the authorities’ ongoing fiscal consolidation program. A slight reduction in real
interest rates will also help stabilize the debt level. Financing conditions would improve as gross
financing requirements will gradually decline from 5.7 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16 to about
1.9 percent of GDP in 2019/20. The liquidity in the domestic banking system and a captive investor
base limits rollover risks.
Overall, the heat map reveals moderate or low risks to debt sustainability. Compared with the
benchmark for emerging markets, however, the external financing requirement is highlighted as a
significant risk to the debt profile. As a share of total public debt, foreign currency denominated
debt rose by 7.6 percentage points to 30 percent in 2013/14. The practice of borrowing to build
reserves should be discouraged given that it increases the country’s external debt service burden
and leaves government’s balance sheet more vulnerable to external shocks. The composition of
public debt remains very favorable—a large proportion of the debt is held in local currency and only
about 13 percent is short term. The projected strengthening of the current account in the medium
term is expected to reduce the need for large external financing.
With respect to real GDP assumptions in the baseline, there appears to be no systematic bias
in recent years (2011–2013) as staff projections were close to the outcomes, although in the
past, there was a tendency towards optimism. With median forecast errors of -1.04 percent of
GDP and -1.19 percent of GDP respectively, the projections for primary balance appear to have been
relatively optimistic, while those of inflation tended to be persimistic during 2006–14. Reflecting the
low debt level in the past, historical primary balance is probably not an appropriate comparator.
Indeed, staff’s projected primary balance over the medium term is broadly consistent with the
authorities’ planned fiscal adjustment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

Macro-fiscal stress tests indicate a moderate sensitivity of public debt to a variety of shocks,
with the greatest sensitivity being to real GDP growth shocks, buttressing staff’s
recommendation for policy measures to boost growth potential in the medium term. However,
the gross financial requirements are especially sensitive to the real interest rate. Among the various
shocks analyzed, sensitivity to real exchange rate shocks remains the lowest. A combined macrofiscal shock would raise debt to 74 percent of GDP, and gross financing requirements to 4.4 percent
of GDP in FY 2019/20.
Additional results from two alternative scenarios using constant primary balance and
historical average of real GDP growth indicate a sharp further rise of public debt to 80
percent of GDP over the medium term with gross financing requirements also rising to
6 percent of GDP. This reinforces the need for a steadfast implementation of fiscal consolidation
program to achieve a more sustainable debt path.
Estimated at 23 percent of GDP in 2013/14, external public debt, (central government and
public corporations) remains relatively low and is projected to stabilize at 22 percent in the
medium term. Bound test results suggest that the external public debt profile is moderately
sensitive to shocks to the non-interest current account and the real exchange rate.

Annex II. External Current Account Prospects and External
Competitiveness
Standard external competitiveness indicators present a mixed picture, but suggest that there
may be emerging concerns. The results of CGER methodologies are somewhat contradictory, with
the ERER approach suggesting the exchange rate to be slightly (2.1 percent) undervalued, while the
macroeconomic balance approach suggests that a 16½ percent improvement in the external
competitiveness would be required to align the 6¼ percent of GDP current account deficit projected
for 2020 with the 2 percent “norm” (Figure 3).1 Another estimate is available from the External
Balance Assessment (EBA) “lite,” although it must be noted that this methodology is acknowledged
to be of possibly limited applicability in “special cases,” including for tourism-based economies and
financial centers. A straightforward application of the analysis for the 2015 projected current
account deficit (12½ percent of GDP) suggests a 38 percent improvement in external
competitiveness would be needed to obtain the 2¾ percent of GDP deficit “norm.” However, the
combined one-off effects of continued Baha Mar-related construction expenses, as well as the lessthan-full-year effect for its tourism earnings potential (estimated to account for about a combined
5¾ percent of GDP), as well as the assumed import component from standard non-debt creating
foreign direct investment capital flows (some 2¼ percent of GDP) would reduce the “underlying”
current account deficit to about 4½ percent of GDP. This suggests that an improvement in external
competitiveness of about 7½ percent would be necessary to result in the current account “norm.”
Thus, these three methods suggest on balance that an improvement in external competitiveness
may be necessary to achieve external sustainability, especially were petroleum prices to increase
beyond present WEO forecasts, but the scale of uncertainty regarding the degree of misalignment is
considerable.
Forecasts of future external balances are especially uncertain, notably given the lumpiness of
investment. The sheer magnitude of the Baha Mar project (some 40 percent of 2012 GDP), its
sizable increase in tourism capacity (by 2,200 rooms—about 16 percent of current capacity) and
potential employment equivalent to 2½ percent of the labor force), and recent delays in its opening
complicates forecasts of The Bahamas’ external accounts. Additional uncertainties also arise from
prospective changes in petroleum prices (to which the Bahamian economy is particularly sensitive,
given their almost total reliance on imported energy), and potential increased competition following
the U.S./Cuban rapprochement, although these also cloud external prospects throughout the
Caribbean. Nonetheless, this suggests taking as broad an approach as possible in viewing external
prospects, keeping in mind the unusual degree of uncertainty at present.
Recognizing that the current account imbalance is the external counterpart to the difference
between national investments and saving flows provides another approach to understanding
1

recent developments. As seen in Figure 4, the investment/GDP ratio has remained relatively stable
since the turn of the century at about 26 percent of GDP. But this masks marked changes in its
composition with two notable periods of greater activity, one in the mid 2000s with a sizable
expansion of the Atlantis resort along with an emerging boom in residential construction, and in the
last few years, the result of Baha Mar (and despite a collapse in other domestic, including residential,
construction). National saving appears to have exhibited a trend decline this century, which is
somewhat more difficult to explain. The relatively low and generally declining saving rate in
Caribbean economies has been documented elsewhere, the reasons for which appear to result from
a combination of factors, including a persistently weak post-boom economy, a prolonged worsened
terms of trade (the result of higher petroleum prices), and possibly by lower returns to saving.2
Going forward, projecting the external balance as the difference between projections of
saving and investment flows highlights its inherent uncertainty, but also focuses on the need
for policies that support growth and bolster domestic saving. Recent revisions to the national
accounts, which resulted in much lower real and nominal growth rates in the past few years (and
upward revisions in the size of the current account deficit), have tempered growth expectations
going forward and, ceteris paribus, worsened external sustainability dynamics. Looking forward,
without a decisive implementation of a national development plan that improves the economy’s
growth prospects, staff foresee a strong possibility of a slow-growth scenario, with the domestic
debt overhang and labor market mismatches continuing to dampen employment prospects, thereby
retarding income growth and restraining increases in saving rates. Meanwhile, weak demand and
breakdown of the credit channel reduces domestic investment prospects and potential output
growth rate.
In light of the mixed picture provided by standard Fund assessments of external
competitiveness, and from the uncertain outlook based on recent saving/investment trends,
the staff continues to rely on basic indicators of external performance, which provide a
somewhat less subdued picture. The Bahamas is perceived to be a comparatively desirable tourist
destination, targeting more affluent clientele. Its relatively expensive reputation has recently been
documented in a “Week at the Beach” index.3 And while the share of Caribbean tourism arrivals has
recently stabilized at a lower level than recorded in the early 2000s, reflecting growth in a number of
lower-cost destinations, The Bahamas share of Caribbean tourism receipts (and its share of
Bahamian GDP) have remained more robust, and the opening of Baha Mar is anticipated to boost
2

See Grigoli et al (forthcoming), “Saving in Latin America and the Caribbean: Performance and Policies.” The authors
found that the saving rate for small Caribbean economies is influenced by real income growth, and displays a strong
degree of serial correlation, suggesting that persistently slow economic growth depresses saving as agents anticipate
the weakness to be temporary. The authors also found that lower returns to saving (observed in the Bahamian
context as continued high banking system NPLs have widened the lending/deposit rate spread) depressed Caribbean
saving rates, but that the coefficient estimate was not significant. The decline in the Bahamian saving rate last year
may also have reflected a one-off increase in consumption in anticipation of the VAT’s introduction in 2015.

these shares going forward. Furthermore, relative to its comparators, The Bahamas’ REER has been
stable reflecting its close economic ties with the U.S. Moreover, the magnitude of foreign direct
investment continues to be substantial, averaging over 6 percent of GDP over the last five years, and
which is thought to be understated as it fails to include re-invested earnings. Thus, while not
discounting the challenges facing The Bahamas in continuing to provide a comparatively attractive
tourist experience (including with the likely emergence of Cuban competition), both vacationers and
investors continue finding it an attractive location. Nonetheless, in light of the limited external
buffers, efforts to further improve external competitiveness would be prudent.

Annex III. Spillovers to The Bahamas
As a small very open economy, The Bahamas is vulnerable to external shocks. Staff estimated the
response of the Bahamian economy to typical shocks using a 5-variable VAR, including U.S. GDP,
S&P 500 stock price index, oil prices, Bahamas GDP and Bahamas public debt, using annual data for
1990-2014:

A shock to the U.S. economy that raises U.S.
GDP by one percent contemporaneously
increases Bahamian GDP by 2¼ percentage
points. Moreover, the positive effect on the
Bahamian economy persists for one additional
year before dissipating.

The VAR indicates a surprisingly strong and
persistent response of Bahamian GDP to oil
price shocks. A one percent shock to oil prices
causes Bahamian GDP to contemporaneously
decline by 0.08 percentage points, and with the
effect strengthening somewhat for three years
following the shock.

-1.0

Shocks to Bahamian public debt do not have a
significant effect on Bahamian GDP. This result
is however likely to be influenced by the
relatively low level of Bahamian debt.

-0.1

A one percent shock to the S&P 500 index
contemporaneously increases Bahamian GDP
by 0.13 percentage points. Moreover, the effect
intensifies in the year after the shock, rising to
0.3 percentage points before dissipating in
subsequent years.
Staff also investigated the impact of shocks to
U.S. interest rates by incorporating either U.S.
10 year Treasury bond yields or U.S. 6-month
LIBOR into the VAR. In both cases, shocks to
either 10-year bond yields or the LIBOR did not
have significant effects on the Bahamian
economy, and the magnitude of the Bahamian
GDP response was close to zero.
A decomposition of variance indicates that
shocks to U.S. GDP and oil prices explain a
large fraction of the fluctuations in Bahamian

Annex IV. The Bahamian Financial Sector: Structure, Trends,
and Prospects
The Bahamian financial system is sizable with both domestic and offshore activities. In addition to a
relatively sophisticated domestic financial system (with private sector credit totaling almost 80 percent of GDP),
The Bahamas historically has a significant offshore sector. All told, while employing only about 3 percent of the
labor force (of which less than 1 percent in the offshore subsector), financial intermediation services narrowly
defined account for more than 10 percent of GDP (with additional spillover activities for affiliated real estate
and business services, as well as for tourism). The financial sector also, through various taxes and fees,
contributes markedly to government revenue. Although these total only about 1–2 percent of GDP in recent
years, they account for some 6–10 percent of total government revenues.
While the offshore financial system assets are large, the domestic financial sector’s susceptibility to
offshore spillovers is thought to be limited. The recent 2013 FSAP concluded that the domestic commercial
banking sector is well insulated from the offshore sector, and mainly conducts traditional banking activities.
The mission found that connections between the domestic banks and offshore banks are minimal (confined to
intra-group activities). Only

The Bahamas: Selected Financial Sector Statistics, 2010-13

½ percent of domestic
banking sectors assets and
liabilities are with offshore
counterparties. Thus, while
the potential for offshore
sector spillovers to the
domestic financial sectors
appear limited, they

revenues.
In addition to changes in the external regulatory environment, the continued vibrancy of financial
sector will depend, in part, on the availability of a highly trained domestic employment pool. Changes in
the international regulatory environment, as well as more firm- or country-specific influences, have resulted in
a marked decline in offshore sector assets. These have declined from a 67 times domestic GDP in 2011 to less
than one-half that amount in 2013 (and further to 22 times GDP in September 2014). Nonetheless, its
employment and GDP shares have yet to be appreciably affected. Going forward, however, the Bahamian
financial sector’s continued health will depend on a number of factors. The domestic banking system’s health
will need to deal effectively with the legacy costs of previous over-lending. The external sector’s health will be
influenced to a great degree by changes in the international regulatory environment. But its future vibrancy will
also depend on maintaining and improving the Bahamian business climate more generally and in expanding its
pool of well-trained domestic financial sector employment prospects, which requires active engagement with
the domestic educational system.

The Bahamian economy is extremely reliant on petroleum-based energy, in part a reflection of
its geographic peculiarities, leaving it vulnerable to volatile price developments. The Bahamas
has a population of 367,000 (2013) inhabiting 30 of the nation’s 700 islands and some 2000 cays,
although about three quarters of the population reside in the capital of Nassau (New Providence
Island), and in Freeport (Grand Bahama Island), the second largest city. While electrification of the
archipelago is nearly universal, The Bahamas’ entire economy, as with a number of other Caribbean
economies, is almost entirely

The Bahamian economy’s per capita energy consumption is easily the highest in the
Caribbean, but this is mitigated once allowance is made for its high per capita income. The

about the average for tourism-based Caribbean economies, and well below the average of
commodity-based economies.
As in other Caribbean economies, the structure of nation’s electricity sector is inefficient,
worsening the overall economy’s and the tourism industry’s competitiveness. This is due in part
to technical reasons and the country has been slow to recognize the potential from renewable
energy sources. Virtually all of the electricity is supplied by two utilities, the state-owned Bahamas
Electricity Company (BEC), which provides about 80 percent of total production (servicing Nassau
and the rest of New Providence, as well as

electricity generation, together with the

archipelagic nature of the country, results
in substantial transmission and
distribution losses, albeit on par with
other Caribbean economies. This is reflected in high electricity prices, although again similar to those
in many other Caribbean Island economies, but substantially above rates in North American
economies. As a result, electricity accounts for a substantial component of total expenses in the
tourism industry, and therefore has a significant bearing on the sector’s external competitiveness.2
The Bahamian authorities recognize the importance of addressing these shortcomings, and
have recently taken actions that should lower production costs, boost energy efficiency, and
reduce the reliance on imported petroleum. The authorities adopted The Bahamas National
Energy Policy: 2013–2033 in 2014, which set four general goals: improving energy efficiency
(including through conservation); modernizing the energy infrastructure; become a world leader in
developing and implementing sustainable energy solutions; and having a dynamic and appropriate
governance, institutional, legal and regulatory framework, with civic participation. In addition,
recognizing the ample potential for renewable energy, the government has proposed to raise the

Respondents to the 2014 KPMG Caribbean Hotel Benchmarking Survey reported that utility expenses were
6.5 percent of total revenue, substantially more than the 3.7 percent average of the STR’s U.S. survey. While The
Bahamas competes with other Caribbean economies in providing tourism services, the authorities notes that it also
views family resorts in central Florida and gaming properties in Las Vegas to be major competitors as well.

contribution from this source to 30 percent
by 2030.3 To this end, it amended in March
2015 the Energy Act to allow for renewable
energy self generation (NESG), which
allows for individuals to attach to and sell
back excess electricity generation to the
national grid. The Bahamas has also joined
the Carbon War Room’s “10 Island
Challenge,” in which is obliges itself to
advance 20 MW of solar utility-scale farms
on several islands in the national
archipelago.

The authorities have also recently selected a private company to manage the BEC and are
considering altering the energy sector’s regulatory framework. While details of the management
contract are still to be finalized, the state will retain 100 percent ownership of the BEC, and intends to
employ a business model similar to that used in operation of the capital’s airport authority. It is
anticipated that the operating company, whose compensation would be largely based on achieving
service level targets relating to improved fuel efficiency, reductions in costs, and enhanced reliability,
would be able to reduce electricity production costs by some one-third (to about $0.30 per KwH). In
addition, the BEC’s liabilities would be taken over, financed by a “rate reduction” bond, which would
also fund new investments in more efficient electrical generators. The authorities are also considering
establishing an independent electricity regulatory authority, (possibly the Utilities Regulation and
Competition Authority, the current telecoms regulator), which would oversee the transformation of
the BEC’s effective monopoly generator/distributor position, toward one allowing for multiple
(including private sector) generators.

The IADB’s Energy Matrix states that the technical potential for renewable energy exceeds current energy demand
by a factor of 50, although its economic potential, given current technologies, is presumably much less.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The Bahamas has a conventional fixed peg arrangement, with the Bahamian dollar pegged to the
U.S. dollar at B$1 per US$1. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. There have been no
changes in exchange restrictions since the last Article IV consultation.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular, all critical macroeconomic data,
including comprehensive central government finance statistics, are regularly published in the Central
Bank of the Bahamas’ “Monthly Economic and Financial Developments” and “Quarterly Statistical
Digest”. However, the authorities have yet to develop the institutional capacity for the compilation of
international investment position (IIP) statistics and general government accounts data. Also, The
Bahamas has still not started compiling balance of payments statistics consistent with the Balance of
Payments Manual 6. The authorities have expressed interest in technical assistance in the latter two
areas, and Fund is ready to provide assistance upon their formal request.
Last Article IV Consultation:
The Bahamas is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by
the Executive Board on January 17, 2014 on a lapse-of-time basis (IMF Country Report No. 14/75).

Country Strategy with The Bahamas 2013-2017
Given the negative impact of the international economic crisis on economic growth, productivity
and social cohesion in The Bahamas, the strategic intent of the current CS is to support Government
of The Bahamas (GoBH) efforts to ensure macroeconomic sustainability, social stability and
employment; and to increase resilience to the negative impacts of natural disasters and climate
change. The Bank is supporting: (i) the implementation of fiscal and debt sustainability reforms in
public sector finances and management; (ii) assisting with fostering social cohesion, with an
emphasis on preventing crime and violence and strengthening the criminal justice system; (iii)
assisting with modernizing the electricity subsector and diversify the energy matrix; (iv) facilitating
diversification of both the economy and its trading partners by enhancing areas of comparative
advantage and removing constraints to private sector activity; and (v) building resilience to natural
disasters through improved coastal zone management, incorporating disaster risk reduction and
climate change adaptation measures in development planning, control and monitoring. The Bank
support focuses on the following priority areas: (1) Public Finances and Management; (2) Citizen
Security and Justice; (3) Energy; (4) Private Sector Development; and (5) Coastal Risk Management
and Climate Change Adaptation. Interventions in these areas will contribute to stemming the
erosion of per capita incomes by protecting public investment space and promoting growth. Efforts
are being made to generate non-sovereign guaranteed (NSG) lending that is closely aligned to the
development and diversification of the private sector, as well as direct financing in alternative energy
and energy efficiency. This is taking place in addition to seeking opportunistic interventions in
sectors where IDB participation provides financial and non-financial additionality.

Other areas for future dialogue: In addition to the priority areas identified above, the Bank is
supporting diagnostic and analytical activities in the following dialogue areas: (a) Education: The
provision of quality education services: (i) via strengthening capacity at the secondary education
level to improve transition from school to work, including potential areas for PPPs, and (ii) for special
needs children and youth throughout all levels of the educational system also with an emphasis on
the transition from school to work; (b) Food Security: The country depends almost entirely on
imports for food. An analysis will be undertaken of the options for increasing the production and
consumption of local food; (c) Transport: An analysis of (i) the potential impacts and opportunities
that the completion of the Panama Canal will have for The Bahamas, (ii) how inter-island mobility
could be made more efficient across the 28 inhabited islands; (iii) enhancing trade links with the rest
of the Caribbean and Latin America; and (d) Informal Immigration: There are significant pockets of
poverty that are often associated with the phenomenon of informal immigration. The profiles and
needs of such areas will be assessed.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but some weaknesses remain
in both coverage and timeliness, partly reflecting capacity constraints. The central bank
produces annual, quarterly, and monthly reports on macroeconomic developments, and monetary
and fiscal data, and is the main source of economic information. The operations of public
corporations are not compiled into a consolidated set of public sector accounts, although their debt
is included in the public debt data. Thus, a presentation of the general government accounts,
including revenue, expenditure, and overall balance is not available.
In March 2015, the Department of Statistics (DoS) updated the CPI methodology with technical
assistance from CARTAC. Using the results of the 2013 Household Expenditure Survey, it revised the
CPI weights to 2013 from 2006 and changed the base period to November 2014 from February 2010.
The coverage was expanded to include new local and foreign items reflecting current expenditures
by households. New sample outlets were also introduced to reflect those that are frequently visited
by Households.
The DoS continues to develop the Export-Import Price Indices (XMPIs) to meet international
standards. CARTAC missions have assisted in compiling the XMPIs, including Tourism Services Price
Index (TSPI) on quarterly basis. New XMPIs for goods and major services have been developed,
while procedures for systematic re-sampling and re-weighting were modified in order to keep the
market basket representative of what is being measured. The DoS is also receiving technical
assistance from CARTAC to produce quarterly GDP estimates. A July 2014 mission assessed the
quarterly volume estimates and noted that further work is needed for a few industries. It assisted in

THE BAHAMAS

identifying suitable indicators for deriving quarterly current price estimates using the production
approach.
The Bahamas does not prepare data covering the economy-wide external debt position, nor an
international investment position (IIP), although they have stated their intention to do so. In August
2014, a CARTAC mission advised the authorities on the requirements for transitioning to Balance of
Payments Manual 6 (BMP6) and disseminating statistics on the IIP. The mission noted that most of
the conversion from BPM5 to BPM6 is straightforward and some of the data required, such as
reserve assets and public sector debt, are already available. However, the authorities will need to
collect new data on the nonbank private sector. The authorities are considering publishing BPM6
statistics in June 2015 and IIP statistics in September 2015.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with the technical support of the United States Census
Bureau (USCB), has promoted the development of a methodology called “Tool for Assessing
Statistical Capacity” (TASC). This is a self-assessment instrument, the general purpose of which is
measuring and evaluating the statistical capacity of a country’s National Statistical System (NSS),
and more specifically, the operational capacity of its National Statistical Office (NSO), to produce
and disseminate basic statistics drawn from censuses, surveys and administrative records. There was
a mission to The Bahamas to meet with the Department of Statistics and other agencies that
produce statistics to apply the TASC in late November, 2013. As part of the statistical component of
the IDB’s Public Financial Management reform program (PFM) with the government, the TASC
assessment will be applied again to assess how things have evolved since 2013. This assessment is
likely to be conducted in a few years once several of the key project activities under the PFM have
been undertaken.
The Bahamas began participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2003. Its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on February 14, 2003.
