STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 18, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Economic prospects. After having successfully completed its 20-year investment program
to commercialize its substantial natural gas resources in 2011, Qatar has embarked on an
infrastructure investment program in the nonhydrocarbon sectors, advancing its ongoing
diversification agenda. Real GDP growth is projected at 6.6 percent in 2012, driven mainly by
nonhydrocarbon sector growth of 9 percent. Average inflation is expected to remain low at
2 percent in 2012. The overall fiscal surplus is projected to remain high at 8.1 percent of GDP
in 2012/13, and the external current account is projected to record a surplus of 29.8 percent
of GDP in 2012.
Risks to the outlook emanate from a sustained decline in hydrocarbon prices and a
tightening of external financing. Despite adequate financial cushions to mitigate potential
risks, it is crucial to have a contingency plan against external risks to ensure timely and full
implementation of the large infrastructure investment program.
Addressing macroeconomic challenges. Headline inflation remains low, and the current
monetary stance is expected to stay accommodative in the context of the dollar peg. The
government’s fiscal stance for 2012/13 is contractionary, which is appropriate. The central
bank should (i) strengthen liquidity management to absorb the structural liquidity surplus,
and (ii) use macroprudential measures to manage risks arising from excessive credit growth
or risk-taking in specific sectors. Increasing fiscal savings in the medium term is important,
given the government’s objectives of fully financing the budget after 2020 from
nonhydrocarbon revenues, building buffers against shocks, and saving for future
generations. Strengthening the medium-term fiscal framework to help insulate spending
from volatile hydrocarbon revenues requires efforts to increase the credibility of the annual
budget, and to establish macroeconomic forecasting through a macro-fiscal unit.
Strengthening financial regulation and stability. The banking system remains resilient to
shocks but there is a need to reduce foreign funding risks and contain exposure to the real
estate sector before they become excessive and impose a strain on financial stability.
Financial deepening. Continuing to develop deep and liquid domestic debt markets can
bring important benefits to Qatar, including raising funding for the large infrastructure
investment program, enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism, and facilitating
liquidity management.
Improving economic statistics. More needs to be done in the areas of national income,
prices, fiscal, external debt, balance of payments, and international investment position
statistics.

INTRODUCTION
1.
As the world’s third largest producer of natural gas accounting for one-third of the
world’s proven reserves, and the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Qatar has
successfully translated its natural resource wealth into advances in social and economic
outcomes, and has emerged as an important donor and labor importer (Box 1). Largely
insulated from the global crisis thus far, Qatar’s annual per capita income in 2011 was $98,000
(averaging Qataris, and non-Qataris who constitute 85 percent of the population) with an
unemployment rate at 0.6 percent in 2011 (Figure 1). Qatar ranks favorably in the GCC in social and
governance indicators, but remains below advanced economy averages (Figures 2 and 3).
2.
The government has now shifted its focus to economic diversification and growth in
nonhydrocarbon sectors through targeted infrastructure investments. Qatar’s 20-year
investment program, which focused on a strategy to commercialize its substantial natural resources,
culminated in 2011. The State has placed a moratorium on the development of new hydrocarbon
projects until 2015 to give itself time to assess its production performance and carry out a
comprehensive study of its North Field. As emphasized in the National Development Strategy (NDS)
2011–16, total investments are expected to average 27 percent of GDP per year during 2012–17,
predominantly in the nonhydrocarbon sectors, compared to 31 percent of GDP per year during the
previous five years. Such investments are expected to create financing and investment opportunities
for the private sector and to have positive spillover effects on the domestic economy. This will also
have global and regional spillover effects through expatriate workers’ remittances.1
3.
The authorities implemented important reforms in 2011–12 to strengthen the
macroeconomic policy framework consistent with Fund Policy advice.


Progress toward fully adopting a three-year budget framework is a crucial development as
the government embarks on a major infrastructure investment spending program.



Issuance of 3-, 6-, and 9-month Treasury Bills (T-bills) despite large fiscal surpluses, is
conducive to the development of financial markets and liquidity management.2



The newly established debt office in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) aims
among others to modernize policies and strategies for cost-risk tradeoffs including those for

Estimates in the NDS document suggest that one percentage point of additional public-sector capital spending
would generate 0.1 percentage point short-run acceleration of growth in nonhydrocarbon output, with the dilution
of the effect being attributed to leakages through imports and expatriate workers’ high marginal propensity to remit
their incomes to their home countries. Staff’s independent studies for the GCC suggest that the long-run effect of
capital spending on non-oil growth is significantly larger than the short-run effect due to relatively long gestation
lags for capital formation.

Steps have been taken to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for financial
stability.
Status of Other Staff Recommendations Made in the 2011 Article IV Consultation

Pension reforms

The Pension Fund has been recapitalized. The
General Retirement and Social Insurance
Authority is working with the World Bank on other
reforms to the pension system.

Reducing (and eventually eliminating) subsidies

The authorities reiterated that currently there are
no plans to review any of the subsidies.

Developing macroprudential framework

The laws of the QCB, Qatar Financial Markets
Authority (QFMA), and Qatar Financial Center
Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) have been
amended to give the mandate of financial stability
to the QCB.

Collating and disseminating real estate data

The QCB in collaboration with the Ministry of
Justice has started publishing a monthly real
estate index, and the Ministry of Justice publishes
a weekly newsletter on real estate transactions.

Ensuring timely and full implementation of the large infrastructure investment
program in the face of international uncertainties is the key medium-term challenge.
The baseline scenario envisages that the government-executed part of the investment program
of $110 billion during 2012–17 (about 9 percent of GDP each year) will be fully financed through
the budget while continuing to build fiscal buffers. This government investment program is
being complemented by an estimated $50 billion investment by Qatar Petroleum (QP) (wholly
owned by the State), and about $100 billion by other public enterprises and the private sector
(about 16–18 percent of GDP each year). These public enterprises will finance their capital
investments through a combination of retained earnings, cash surpluses, foreign borrowing, and to
a lesser extent by domestic bank financing. In the baseline scenario, the medium-term risks of a
buildup of foreign funding seem to be contained and manageable, given the government’s available
financial cushion. Nevertheless, it is crucial to have a contingency plan against external risks, the
right domestic policy mix to avoid potential overheating, and to create an enabling environment for
uninterrupted financing of investments.

Box 1: Macroeconomic and Financial Linkages and Spillovers
As the largest LNG exporter in the world, Qatar is playing a systemic role in the global gas market by ensuring adequate
LNG supply. This role has helped stabilize the global gas market, benefiting Qatar and consumers.
In addition, Qatar has provided substantial assistance in recent years to Arab Countries in Transition. Official
disbursements in the form of aid and investments have been $3.2 billion since 2010. In addition, Qatar announced that it would
invest $18 billion in tourism and industry projects in Egypt.

The policy of investing a share of the hydrocarbon wealth in global assets through the sovereign wealth fund (SWF) has
benefitted global financial markets. According to staff’s estimates, Qatar’s investment abroad has been on average $60 billion
each year between 2008 and 2012, and given the projected benchmark oil prices, a similar magnitude of investment is expected
during the next five years.
Qatar has made an important contribution to regional and
global economies through remittances, which are important
sources of income for many emerging market and developing
countries. To overcome domestic constraints on labor supply,
Qatar has relied on large inflows of expatriate workers, who now
account for 90 percent of the labor force. Outward remittances
from Qatar were over $60 billion between 2006 and 2012—one
of the highest shares in the world. Directionally, the main
destinations were Asia (54 percent), Arab region (28 percent),
US (8 percent) and Europe (7 percent).The top 10 receiving
countries accounting for 72 percent of the remittances were
India, Philippines, USA, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Nepal,
Bangladesh, UK, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

Our alternative macroeconomic scenarios confirm the
sensitivity of the fiscal accounts, and to a lesser degree, of external current accounts to oil price shocks. A downside
scenario, consisting of a one standard deviation ($28) drop in oil prices each year from 2013 onwards, suggests that the fiscal
and current accounts will turn into deficit by 2014 and 2016, respectively.
Qatar’s financial system has shown resilience to the global financial crisis, though it remains exposed to global financial
conditions. The banking system remains well-capitalized and profitable. While moderately exposed to Europe, the authorities’
and staff’s stress tests show that the banking system has adequate liquidity and capital buffers to withstand substantial shocks.
With regard to liquidity risks, the substantial reliance on wholesale funds from international banks points to some plausible risks
(Third Financial Stability Report, QCB, 2012).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
Qatar has benefitted from high oil and natural gas prices and production, with expansionary
government spending and an accommodative monetary stance providing additional stimulus. Fiscal
and external surpluses are large, and consumer price inflation (CPI) is low.
5.
Growth rates are stabilizing in 2012 after strong increases in the past several years.
Following the construction boom in 2006–09 and hikes in hydrocarbon production to full capacity in
2011, which raised real GDP growth to 18 percent over 2006–11, real GDP growth is estimated to
slow down to 6.6 percent in 2012. The nonhydrocarbon sector, which has been the fastest growing
in the GCC region over the last decade, is projected to grow at a pace of 9 percent in 2012, driven
by the construction, transport and communications, trade and hotels, and services sectors.
Hydrocarbon sector growth will see a major reduction to 3.6 percent in 2012 (Figure 4).
6.
Inflation remains low mainly due to
depressed rents. Headline and core (nonrent and non-food) CPI inflation have been on
a downward trend thus far in 2012, with
average headline inflation up to October at
1.7 percent and core inflation at 4.0 percent,
largely on account of a significant slowdown
in inflation for the transport and
communication subcomponent, which has the
second largest CPI weight after rent.

7.
The overall fiscal surplus of 8.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12 was higher than expected,
reflecting strong hydrocarbon revenues, and is projected to remain high at 8.1 percent of GDP
in 2012/13, despite a 45 percent overrun in current expenditures in 2011/12 compared to the
budget, primarily due to spending on goods and services. The surplus was also boosted by the
underperformance of development expenditures. The projected surplus in 2012/13 will be driven by
a marked rise in corporate taxes, as new companies start paying corporate tax, and by high
investment income (profit transfer from QP), in addition to high hydrocarbon revenue. The external
current account is projected to record a surplus of 29.8 percent of GDP in 2012 following a surplus
of the same magnitude in 2011, reflecting continued high volumes and prices of crude oil, LNG and
condensates exports.
8.
Monetary and credit conditions have remained accommodative as policy rates have
stayed low. Credit growth accelerated from 17 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2011, and to
32 percent in September 2012. Amid increased public spending on infrastructure-related activities,
public-sector credit, primarily denominated in foreign currency, increased sixfold between end-2010
and mid-2012. Private sector credit grew by 19 percent in 2011—primarily driven by loans to the

overall GDP is expected to increase to
60 percent on average over 2012–17.



Inflation is projected between 3 to 5 percent in the medium term. Despite public-sector wage
increases, inflation is expected to remain low at 3 to 4 percent in 2013–14 due to dampening
effects of the supply overhang in the real estate sector. As infrastructure-related construction
activities pick up, as the demand-supply situation in the real estate market converges, and as the
expatriate population increases, inflation is projected to increase gradually increase to 5 percent
in the following years.



Fiscal and external surpluses are projected to taper off significantly, due to flat LNG production
and a declining trend in crude oil production and exports, and higher fiscal expenditure.

10.
Despite the availability of large financial buffers to cushion even a sizeable shock,
Qatar will need to actively manage risks. The commitment to complete the infrastructure plan
increases Qatar’s vulnerability to external risks and poses domestic macroeconomic management
challenges. Qatar’s broad international linkages make it vulnerable to spillovers from the global
economy through trade and financial channels, similar to those observed in 2008–09 (Appendix I
Risk Assessment Matrix). The strongest link is through global oil and gas demand and prices, but
external financing risks could also emerge as an important channel. Other downside risks include
(i) potential disruptions to transportation of LNG as a result of the temporary closure of the Strait of

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

Hormuz; (ii) competition to Qatar’s LNG exports towards the end of the decade from increases in
unconventional gas production in the US, and the emergence of Australia as a leading producer of
LNG; and (iii) price shifts in the LNG market (Appendix II).
11.
Continued emphasis on reducing fiscal and financial sector vulnerabilities will be
important alongside greater focus on strengthening the foundations for longer-term growth.
Although Qatar’s external debt profile does not indicate any debt servicing or rollover problems
(Appendix III), a worsening of the euro area debt crisis could lead to reduced access to foreign
funding for GCC borrowers. These risks might materialize in a tightening of Qatar’s current ample
fiscal space and may test available external buffers. The authorities agreed with staff’s
characterization of the major risks, and added that a slowdown in China and India could affect the
global demand for oil and gas.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A.

Contingency Planning for Key Risks

The commitment to complete the infrastructure plan by 2020 underscores the importance of building
contingencies in case risks materialize.3
12.
Financing for the investment
program under the baseline scenario is
feasible. The government will fund its capital
spending through the budget. To fund its
investments, QP depends primarily on internal
sources of financing along with loans from
financial institutions and the export credit
agencies of its trade partners. Many of the
past projects undertaken by QP are through
loans amortizing over 15 to 25 years, and
repayment obligations are expected to be
met through the cash flows. Investment
outside the hydrocarbon sector is driven by
other government-linked corporates in
manufacturing, and in residential and
business construction projects among others.
Some of these corporates hold huge cash
balances.4 The repayment profile of the
current outstanding total external debt is

spread out over the long term; and the government pursued a deliberate policy of building a
sovereign U.S. dollar benchmark yield curve after the global crisis to help government-owned
corporates to raise foreign debt through loans and bond issuances to finance their operations
(Appendix 3). Recent foreign borrowings by the public enterprises have been for similar long
maturities.
13.
Nevertheless, managing external risks calls for building a contingency plan for
prioritizing and sequencing capital projects, refraining from further ad hoc increases in
current expenditures, and boosting fiscal buffers and international reserves when oil prices
are high. Qatar remains dependent on

downside scenario, based on a one-standarddeviation ($28) drop in oil prices, implies that from 2015 onwards fiscal breakeven prices would
exceed oil prices.5,6 This scenario implies that the cumulative fiscal deficits over 2015–17 would
amount to $34 billion, constituting about 80 percent of the combined projected capital expenditures
for FY 2016 and FY 2017. While feasible, financing this gap would compromise savings for
intergenerational equity and asset diversification strategies.
14.
The authorities are cognizant of the risks and have been building adequate financial
cushions to withstand even strong shocks. In addition to large reserves with the sovereign wealth
fund (SWF) and the central bank, the government has other funds to mitigate the impact of
fluctuations from oil price shocks and financial risks. Part of the risk mitigation effort is to fully
finance the budget from 2020 onwards from nonhydrocarbon revenues. With regard to potential
financing risks, the authorities pointed out that the government has been able to issue bonds
abroad at favorable interest rates, reflecting a combination of good credit rating, considerable
investor interest, and the safe haven status of Qatar. Since 2008, the government completed four
bond issuances, including one sukuk at competitive rates. The government is also resorting to
5

Downside and upside scenarios of higher and lower oil prices from 2013 onwards are generated by using a band of
one standard deviation (amounting to a $28 change every year) compared to the benchmark WEO oil price
assumptions of August 2012. The analysis assumes no change in the hydrocarbon production profile for the high and
low price scenarios compared to the baseline scenario.
6

Alternative downside scenarios, calculated based on deviations of Brent futures contracts from their baseline
according to 68 percent, 86 percent, and 95 percent confidence intervals, imply that from 2015, 2014, and as early as
2013, respectively, WEO (downside scenario) prices would fall below both current and fiscal breakeven prices.

strategic stockpiling of raw materials for construction, and also nonperishable commodities to
mitigate inflationary risks.
15.
The authorities highlighted a number of factors that should continue to preserve
Qatar’s competitive position in the LNG market over the medium term. First, the projected
increase in global demand for natural gas during 2012–17 should absorb the emerging new supplies
in the medium term.7 Second, Qatar’s strategy has been to diversify into all major markets, adjusting
the mix of destinations and contract types according to market needs. Moreover, a majority of its
exports is in long-term contracts, which provides certainty of pricing and volume off-take, while the
built-in diversion clauses in gas contracts provide additional flexibility to manage quantity and price
risks. Third, Qatar will continue to have a cost advantage over many of the new projects. Since Qatar
produces and exports significant quantities of condensate and natural gas liquids in association with
natural gas, the effective average cost of producing LNG is much lower.
16.
The authorities shared their plans to contain expenditure pressures by line ministries
and ensure efficient spending under the medium-term budgeting framework. Line ministries
and agencies will now receive allocations for capital spending based only on concrete proposals that
are integrated with national priorities, and monitored through performance measures. With regard
to current expenditures, the authorities explained that their aim is to maintain the wages and
salaries at their current share of total expenditure. In the event of a sustained fall in oil prices, they
would exercise flexibility by reducing other current expenditures and implement capital projects
through public-private partnerships (PPP), instead of financing through the budget. To this end, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) is working toward developing a model PPP legal
framework.
17.
The authorities have also been taking steps to manage implementation risks of the
government’s large infrastructure investment program. Current efforts are focused on
prioritizing projects in the transportation sector, which accounts for a major part of total
investments. A reprofiling exercise in the transportation sector aims to mitigate potential
construction bottlenecks and wider congestion stresses. The coordination function of the Central
Planning Office is a welcome development. The authorities have established a framework for
coordination with the agencies responsible for the delivery of infrastructure projects for reporting
on progress, identifying and implementing efficiencies, and providing for early warning to ensure
timely implementation. The early passage of the draft procurement law that aims to bring greater
transparency and decentralization in the tendering process would bring efficiency gains to the
investment program. Staff is of the view that meeting development needs efficiently would be best
served by an integrated public investment management process that covers all sectors and public
enterprises, and which embeds within it processes to manage scrutiny, selection, delivery, and
funding of major capital projects.

fundamentals as the deviations of the real exchange rate and the current account from their
benchmarks are moderate.
19.
Headline inflation pressures remain muted, and the current monetary stance is
expected to stay accommodative for the next few years in the context of the dollar peg. Thus,
any signs of overheating need to be managed through fiscal policy, in particular through restraining
further increases in current expenditures to control aggregate demand, combined with liquidity
management by the QCB to absorb the structural liquidity surplus, and through macroprudential
measures to help smooth excessive credit growth and mitigate pressures from excessive leverage or
risk-taking in specific sectors. The fiscal stance for 2012/13 is contractionary, which is appropriate.8
However, the ramp-up in expenditures by public enterprises could increase aggregate demand
pressures in the economy. The authorities are confident of preventing overheating of the economy,
and have taken several steps to avoid the high-inflation episode of 2008 (Box 2).

8

The government’s fiscal stance is measured by the nonhydrocarbon deficit (excluding investment income) as a
percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP. The stance is contractionary since the large increase in expenditures is more than
compensated by increase in nonhydrocarbon revenues.

Box 2: Inflation Outlook: Pressures and Alleviating Channels
A question that emerges is whether inflation will increase again as it did in 2007–08, when average CPI

mainly by infrastructure bottlenecks and real

inflation, which has now turned into deflation,
the macroeconomic drivers of inflation that
were present in 2005–08—depreciation of the
nominal effective exchange rate, credit
expansion, rising government current
expenditure, and population growth—are still
present now, but the increases in these
drivers are currently smaller and are projected
to remain so over the medium term.

To quantify the historical response of inflation
to its various exogenous and endogenous drivers, different specifications of a VAR model were estimated on
annual data in Qatar over 1980–2008. The model found that the pass-through from food prices into the CPI
is higher in deflationary times, suggesting that the expected deflation in food prices over the medium term
will have a bigger alleviating impact on inflation in Qatar. The model also found current expenditure to be
more inflationary than capital expenditure as expected, with the elasticity of inflation to capital spending
only a fraction of the elasticity of inflation to current spending. With the shares of capital and current
expenditure in total

spending increases as
well as lower expected current spending growth over the medium term, increased government spending is
expected to be less inflationary than in the 2005–08 episode. Moreover, the authorities are working on
alleviating transportation bottlenecks, increasing storage capacity, and strategically stockpiling raw materials
to prevent escalation of costs.

The lack of historical real estate data prevents its inclusion in our VAR model. Our inflation forecasts are,
however, based on a gradual narrowing of the deflationary impact of the rent component of CPI. First, the
real estate index, collated by the QCB, which had appreciated by 166 percent between Aug 2006 and Aug
2008, depreciated by about 50 percent by Aug 2009, and has been on an upward trend since then,
appreciating by 45 percent between Aug 2009 and Aug 2011. Second, some private-sector real estate
research observed a pick-up in rental rates in Q2 of 2012, and forecast that the market might experience a
healthy supply and demand balance or might actually be undersupplied, depending on whether and when
the assumed population increases in these forecasts will gain momentum. In the current situation, there is an
oversupply in high-end luxury housing segments, and an undersupply in affordable housing. In that respect,
satisfying the expected growing demand from a growing expatriate population will ensure that the low-to
middle-end segment of the real estate market does not overheat, and will also keep the high-end segment
in check.

Macroprudential policy can support fiscal policy by managing financial risks.
Notwithstanding that about 70 percent of the increase in credit is to the public sector, past

experience has shown that surplus liquidity and persistent foreign currency inflows can result in
excessive credit growth and real estate booms. The central bank should closely monitor credit
growth in order to distinguish credit going to infrastructure-related projects, in line with the overall
growth strategy, from lending that may lead to excessive asset price increases or inflationary
pressures. The QCB has a number of tools, including reserve requirements, credit ratio, sectoral
credit exposure limits, liquidity ratio, and loan-to-value ratio, to address both generalized and
sector-specific credit booms and capital flows, and it stands ready to contain excessive credit growth
through a more proactive but judicious use of existing tools.
21.
With recent initiatives to develop domestic financial markets, the QCB is now moving
toward a more active and market-based liquidity management framework. However, with a
shallow interbank market and the absence of an active secondary market for T-bills, the QCB
acknowledged that its ability to engage in open market operations is currently limited. To this end,
the authorities saw merit in strengthening the liquidity forecasting capabilities to better target the
absorption of structural liquidity surplus through T-bills. Although for now the instruments available
with the QCB are adequate to manage day-to-day liquidity, the authorities are exploring the
possibility of using open market operations to actively keep the interbank rate close to a policy rate
consistent with the exchange rate peg. To achieve this, it would be useful to have not only a repo
instrument to inject liquidity but also a reverse repo instrument to absorb liquidity (see
accompanying Selected Issues Paper).
22.
The government should continue to build robust buffers. Staff’s medium-term fiscal
sustainability exercise shows that fiscal space is contracting, but still consistent with
intergenerational equity.9 Surpluses are not excessive, and given the authorities’ objectives of fully

Strengthening Financial Regulation to Maintain Financial Stability

25.
The banking system remains highly capitalized and profitable. The capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) of commercial banks rose from 16.1 percent in 2010 to 21.1 percent in June 2012, while
nonperforming loans (NPLs) declined from 2.0 percent to 1.7 percent over the same time period.
The banking system remains profitable with return on assets amounting to 2.5 percent in June 2012.
Analysis pertaining to stressing to breaking point shows that the banking system will breach the
minimum regulatory CAR of 10 percent only when NPLs rise to 27 percent and 39 percent for Islamic
and conventional banks, respectively. However, strong credit growth has led to an increase in the
loan-to-deposit ratio to 121 percent at end-June 2012, and the resulting funding gap has primarily
been filled through foreign financing.
26.
Funding risks have increased, which warrant careful examination of implications on
banks’ balance sheet, an issue that the QCB is closely monitoring. Wholesale interbank foreign
liabilities, predominantly short-term in nature, have risen as domestic funding sources have been
unable to keep up with rising credit demand. Funding from European banks is significant, but direct
exposure to GIIPS banks is limited (see Appendix III). On the asset side, credit dollarization has risen
noticeably, with the share of foreign currency-denominated credit to the public sector as high as
80 percent in mid-2012, leading to a buildup of currency and maturity mismatches (Figure 5). The
authorities agreed with staff’s assessment on the need to limit the buildup of liquidity risk related to
short-term foreign borrowings channeled into funding medium- and long-term domestic lending,
including through the use of additional prudential liquidity ratios.
27.
The banking system is exhibiting resilience in terms of credit risk, but there is a need
to prevent buildup of excessive exposure of the banking system to the real estate sector.
Credit to real estate in the public and private sectors constitute 25 percent of total credit, of which
about 56 percent is in foreign currency (including lending for projects outside Qatar). Since the
credit concentration is not homogenous across the banking sector, individual banks’ exposure needs
to be monitored. Overall credit to real estate seems to have temporarily stabilized in 2012, but in
case there are signs of a renewed pick-up of real estate credit, the QCB agreed to contain it through
the use of macroprudential tools, for instance higher risk weights for real estate lending for the CAR.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment but pointed out that current regulations related to
the classification of loans based on real estate collaterals tended to overestimate the banking
system’s exposure to real estate, and in that sense provided a built-in cushion against the buildup of
risks.12 Despite the cushion, since real estate risk tends to be procyclical, borrowers’ repayment
capacity is likely to fall in tandem with real estate prices. Staff and the authorities agreed on the
importance of risk management and regular stress testing by banks to strengthen financial stability.
In this context, staff reiterates that collating and disseminating detailed price and volume data on
Qatar’s real estate market segments would help enhance risk assessment.

12

For loans extended for purposes other than real estate, if the bank depends on real estate or real estate collaterals
as source of repayments, they are classified as real estate credit.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

28.
The steps taken to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for financial
stability are welcome. The new draft central bank law, when passed, will give the legal mandate of
financial stability to the central bank, which would be operationalized through the establishment of
a Financial Stability and Risk Control Committee (FSRCC). The planned FSRCC and the regulatory
agencies responsible for implementing its recommendations (the QCB, QFMA, and QFCRA) should
have clear roles and responsibilities and governance structure, consistent with the institutional
mandates and coordination arrangements.

E.

Deepening Financial Markets

29.
Current efforts to develop local debt markets are commendable and will enhance
options for domestic financing and reduce reliance on foreign funding. Although the
government is running large fiscal surpluses, it has been issuing local currency–denominated
government securities with the stated objective of domestic debt market development and liquidity
management. T-bill issuance is a welcome first step in the process of deepening financial markets
and building a robust yield curve. Current plans are to issue three- and five-year domestic bonds in
2013 to further extend the yield curve. Developing deep and liquid domestic debt markets can bring
important benefits, including raising funding for the large infrastructure investment program as
Qatar advances its diversification agenda, enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism, and
facilitating liquidity management. Facilitating market participation of a diversified set of professional
institutional investors would help secondary market development (see accompanying Selected
Issues Paper). Plans to list government bonds on Qatar Exchange, and the lead taken by the QCB in
setting up a domestic credit rating agency and a central securities depository are important steps
toward developing a local debt market.
30.
Staff and the authorities agreed that there are several key conditions required to
establish a liquid and well-functioning market for long-term government and corporate debt.
Staff recommends that the authorities’ agenda include:


initially concentrating on developing the short end of the yield curve by enhancing
liquidity in the T-bills market, where issuance is backed by improved liquidity forecasting and
a transparent public debt management strategy;



developing a well-diversified domestic and foreign institutional investor base (including
pension, insurance, and investment funds) that can help diversify financial intermediation to
capital markets by increasing the demand for long-term financial assets;



creating a sound institutional infrastructure—a credible rating system, high corporate
governance standards, transparency in reporting requirements, and the adoption of
international accounting standards— to foster market discipline; and



improving pricing transparency and microstructures—effective trading mechanisms, and
custody and settlement systems— that can play a crucial role in enhancing liquidity and
efficiency, while reducing trading costs and volatility.

Longer-term Structural and Data Issues

31.
Developing the nascent small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector is a policy
priority in Qatar's National Vision 2030’s strategic goal to build a well-diversified economy.
While some steps have been initiated to promote this sector, a clear definition of the distinct and
complementary roles of institutions supporting SMEs is warranted in order to remove a number of
constraints in SME development, including issues related to access to finance, establishing a legal
structure for speedy arbitration, providing capacity to conduct feasibility studies, and facilitating the
use of movable collateral (Box 3).

SME development globally. Financing obstacles persist, despite the credit guarantee scheme, as commercial
banks are still reluctant to lend to SMEs, due to the small size of the market, its high risk and set-up costs,
the absence of a legal structure for quick arbitration, and lack of SME-specific credit rating in the credit
bureau. Bank lending to SMEs as a share of total lending is 0.5 percent, substantially lower than the GCC and
MENA averages, which are already far below advanced country levels. Greater coordination and
collaboration between the institutions responsible for promoting SMEs in Qatar are required to create
synergies between providing access to finance and developing business support services, enhancing human
capacity, promoting research and development, and entrepreneurship.

32.
Despite significant improvements in statistics, which staff welcomes, much more needs
to be done, requiring a step up in the collaboration between different agencies. Data advances
include national accounts statistics, and the Qatar Statistics Authority is now publishing a quarterly
real GDP series. The QCB has developed a partial international investment position (IIP) statement at
end-June 2012, which is expected to be enlarged based on the recent technical assistance provided
by the Fund for conducting the 2012 Foreign Investment Survey. More needs to be done, however,
in the areas of national income, prices, fiscal, external debt, balance of payments, and international
investment position statistics.
33.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts in strengthening Qatar’s Anti Money
Laundering (AML)/Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework. During 2010, Qatar
enacted a new AML/CFT law (Law No.4, 2010) and established a Financial Supervisory Coordination
Committee to harmonize rules and regulations, which were adopted by various financial sector
supervisors. As a consequence of the AML/CFT system improvements, Qatar was removed from the
Financial Action Task Force’s International Cooperation Review Group monitoring process in
October 2010. A new draft central bank law provides for the inclusion of insurance companies under
the QCB’s regulatory purview. Staff encourages the authorities to establish and develop a sound and
effective risk-based approach to supervision, for both prudential (financial risks) and AML/CFT
matters.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The government has now shifted its focus to economic diversification and growth in
nonhydrocarbon sectors through targeted infrastructure investments. Increased government
capital expenditure for infrastructure investments and accommodative monetary conditions are
expected to sustain nonhydrocarbon growth of 9 to 10 percent in the medium term.
35.
However, since growth hinges on the successful implementation of the infrastructure
plan, it is crucial to have a contingency plan against external risks, and the right domestic
policy mix to avoid potential overheating and to create an enabling environment for
uninterrupted financing. Managing the implementation of projects would be best served by an
integrated public investment management process that covers all sectors and which embeds within
it processes for scrutiny, selection, delivery and funding of major capital projects.
36.
While headline inflation remains low, if inflationary pressures were to emerge, further
increases in current expenditures should be restrained to control aggregate demand, combined with
liquidity management by the QCB to absorb structural liquidity surplus, and macroprudential
measures to help smooth excessive credit growth and mitigate pressures from excessive leverage in
specific sectors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

QATAR

37.
Developing a liquidity forecasting framework will be imperative to enhance liquidity
management. Effective monitoring and reliable forecasts of liquidity conditions will help guide
liquidity management operations, smooth interest rate volatility and encourage interbank trading.
Greater transparency in the operational framework for T-bill issuance would allow banks to better
anticipate liquidity conditions in the interbank market and would help market development.
38.
The banking system is exhibiting resilience in terms of credit risk. However, it is
essential to reduce the buildup of liquidity risk related to short-term foreign borrowings channeled
into funding medium- and long-term domestic lending. Likewise, there is a need to prevent buildup
of excessive exposure of the banking system to the real estate sector.
39.
In the medium term, the government should continue to build robust buffers. Fiscal
space is contracting but still consistent with intergenerational equity, according to staff’s mediumterm fiscal sustainability exercise. Surpluses are not excessive, and given the authorities’ objective of
fully financing the budget from 2020 onwards from nonhydrocarbon revenues, and to build buffers
against shocks, more saving in the medium-to-long term is warranted, mainly through a
combination of containing current expenditures and prioritizing capital expenditure.
40.
The recently taken steps to introduce a MTBF would help enhance the predictability of
spending decisions and link its medium-term development plans to the budget. Successfully
implementing medium-term fiscal planning will require parallel efforts to enhance the credibility of
the annual budget and of macroeconomic forecasting—through a macrofiscal unit—as well as to
build and enhance capacity at the Ministry of Economy and Finance and line ministries.
41.
Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to develop deep and liquid domestic debt
market as they can bring important benefits, including raising funding for the large infrastructure
investment program as Qatar advances its diversification agenda, enhancing the monetary
transmission mechanism, and facilitating liquidity management.
42.
Further improvements in statistics will be essential, which will require greater
coordination across agencies.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

as a percent of GDP is slightly below the OECD
average, the latter increasing the share of
education in total spending from 8 percent in
2006/07 to 13 percent in2009/10.

Despite improvements, mean years of
schooling underperformed in Qatar as in
other GCC countries , and remained well

Figure 3. Qatar: Business Environment and Governance Indicators, 2011–12
Due to its stable macroeconomic environment, business sophistication, high-quality institutional
framework ,and efficient goods market, Qatar ranked first in the region and 14th worldwide in the
Global Competitiveness Index 2011–12. This is also due to its high performance in labor market
efficiency, where it ranks well ahead of GCC , OECD, and emerging economies. Qatar also ranked
highly on ease of doing business, slightly below the OECD average, and improved governance in
the last decade to levels at par with the OECD, and well above emerging markets and oil exporters.

Appendix II. Outlook for Qatar’s Liquefied Natural Gas Market1
This note discusses the latest developments in the global Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) market and the
outlook for Qatar’s LNG exports. Qatar’s export strategy has been to reach all major markets, adjusting
the mix of destinations and contract types. Currently, the bulk of Qatar’s LNG exports are directed to
Asia Pacific and to Europe, including in the spot market. With a global demand increase of 17 percent
between 2012 and 2017 projected by the International Energy Agency, Qatar’s LNG export outlook
remains positive in the medium term. Competition to Qatar’s exports could emerge toward the end of
this decade from increases in unconventional gas production in the United States, the emergence of
Australia as a leading LNG producer, and price shifts in the LNG market. Despite some cost advantages
in production and transportation infrastructure, and certainty of volume off-take from current longterm contracts derived from its competitive position as a low-cost producer, Qatar’s LNG exports are
likely to face competition beyond 2017.

A. Qatar’s Current Dominance
1.
Qatar holds the third largest reserves of natural gas in the world. Proven global gas
reserves at the end of 2011 were estimated at 7,361 trillion cubic feet (tcf) globally.2 Qatar holds

At current global production rates, today’s worldwide proven reserves (conventional and unconventional) could
sustain current production for 58 years (IEA, World Energy Outlook, 2009), whereas the combined resources–for
which there is more uncertainty about its recoverability–equal 250 years of current production.

A substantial portion of Qatar’s LNG exports are derived from long-term sale and
purchase agreements that provide certainty of volume off-take and pricing. Qatar’s export
market is well diversified. It exports LNG to 15 countries around the world: Europe (United Kingdom,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France,

B. Future Challenges
4.
Unconventional gas resources and production have also started to alter market
conditions. Unconventional gas represented 16 percent of global gas production as of 2011, half of
which was tight gas and only one-third shale gas. The potential reserves (and resources) are large,
and many other countries have started exploring shale gas resources, including Australia, Austria,

consumption.5 However, the United States is only expected to become a net exporter of natural gas
by around 2022 (Annual Energy Outlook 2012). More specifically, the United States is projected to
become a net exporter of LNG in 2016, a net pipeline exporter in 2025, and an overall net exporter
of natural gas by 2022. These developments have brought down prices for LNG in the U.S. spot
market.

gas prices has significantly increased, with the oil price parity reaching a 20-year high of 40 in
February 2012. However, U.S. gas production is landlocked and U.S. prices are disconnected from
the rest of the world. Average Japanese import prices strongly recovered in 2010 and 2011, reaching
$17 MBtu during the second half of 2011. Similarly, European gas price recovery averaged between
$8 and $10 per MBtu.6 Qatar has also benefited from high Asian prices for gas at upward of $15 per
MBtu.
6.
Qatar’s ability to benefit from higher Asian and European gas prices may face
competition from a number of LNG projects that are coming onstream in the next several
years. Australia is expected to become the largest LNG producer by the end of the decade (IEA
LNG Projects Under Construction
2012). If these projects proceed as planned,

7.
There are however, many uncertainties that might delay new production by
competitors, which augurs well for Qatar. These uncertainties relate mainly to Australia’s capacity
to complete its projects in time, as there is farmers’ opposition in Australia. China has yet to start
shale gas production, although it is believed to hold 25 tcm of recoverable shale gas reserves. In
addition, China’s challenges include mastering of drilling technologies. The outlook for
unconventional gas production in Europe is doubtful. There has been opposition to hydro fracking
in France and moratoriums have been imposed in France, Switzerland, Germany, Northern Ireland
and Bulgaria. Poland, Hungary, and Romania are advancing with caution, while the United Kingdom
is neutral to unconventional gas production. The United States is the only country producing
unconventional gas, despite the current adverse factors, which include increases in material and
labor costs. But, U.S. gas production is currently driven by unconventional oil production, which

LNG prices have tended to be higher than for gas traded through pipelines because of its higher production costs
and since it can be shipped to the highest bidder.

produces associated gas that cannot all be moved to market through the existing infrastructure.
Significant import infrastructure would also be needed to meet additional import requirements.

Qatar will continue to have a cost advantage because many of the new projects tend
to be more expensive. According to the IEA, LNG development costs have more than doubled

Appendix III. External Debt of Qatar1
Qatar pursued a deliberate policy of building a sovereign U.S. dollar benchmark yield curve after the global
crisis. Government-owned corporates also raised foreign debt through loans and bond issuances to finance
their operations. Available data show little evidence of immediate rollover risks or debt servicing difficulties.
Despite improved data availability, the absence of comprehensive data constrains a full evaluation of the
cost-risk tradeoffs and risks to macro-management.

Qatar holds the third largest reserves of natural gas in the world, concentrated in the
North Field, the largest non-associated gas reservoir in the world. Qatar Petroleum (QP) plays a
dominant role in the natural gas

Government
sector in both upstream and
downstream production. Qatar’s
strategy is focused on “megaprojects” and vertical integration
including downstream natural gasintensive industries like fertilizer and
gas-to-liquid projects (GTL). Qatar Gas
Transport Company Ltd. (Nakilat)
handles all the shipping of Qatari
liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Government ownership prevails
across the natural gas value chain. The
state is also the main driver of growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector, through the large investment
programs of public enterprises. Qatar saves a large part of its hydrocarbon revenues through Qatar
Investment Authority (QIA), its sovereign wealth fund, which owns Qatari Diar, a major real estate
development company active both domestically and abroad. The government has majority
ownership in the country’s largest bank, Qatar National Bank (QNB).

B. Current Policy and Legal Framework for Sovereign Debt
2.
Qatar has a legal framework to undertake sovereign borrowings, issue Islamic notes
and extend guarantees. The ability of the Qatari government to borrow and provide guarantees is
addressed by Law No. (2) of 1962, as amended by Decree Law No. 19 of 1996 (the “Financial Policy
Law”), and the Constitution. Law No. (18) of 2002 on Public Debt and Islamic Finance Notes, as
amended by Law No. 22 of 2009, (the “Public Debt Law”) authorizes the State to borrow and issue
public debt and Islamic Finance notes.

3.
The legal framework in Qatar is, however, narrowly focused on borrowing type. The
analytical aspects of strategy development and evaluation are not established. It provides a clear
authorization to the Minister of Economy and Finance to borrow and issue new debt and loan
guarantees. It further elaborates that the purposes, objectives, amount, maturity, and instrument
type for each internal and external debt (conventional and Islamic) must be determined by the
Minister in collaboration with the central bank. So far, inter-agency coordination is fostered to some
extent by the State Finance Policy Committee. The Committee comprises the Minister as chairman, a
representative of Qatar Central Bank (QCB) as deputy chairman, and representatives of the Qatar
Investment authority (QIA) and QP. The role of the Committee is to provide guidance to all
government related entities that seek access to the international capital markets, and coordinate
debt offerings by Qatari issuers in order to increase liquidity and optimize borrowing costs.

C. Qatar’s External Debt Profile

Qatar’s external debt more than doubled since 2008. Led by the government, which first
issued sovereign bonds in April and November 2009, there was a flurry of external borrowing by

The decision to establish an independent debt office is in line with staff’s advice during the
last two Article IV Missions. The independent debt office, titled the Office for Management of Credit
Policies and Debt, will be vested with the following functions.


Modernize policies and strategies for financing, with the objectives of achieving lower costs
of funding and increased diversification in the local and international markets.



Execute financial policies and strategies for government agencies.



Analyze cash flows and liquidity of government agencies and entities, with a view to
managing debt servicing.



Adhere to the standards of creditors, investors, and credit rating agencies.



Manage interest rate, currency, and liquidity risks.



Improve the overall debt structure (direct and indirect).



Improve overall credit ratings for Qatar.

Appendix IV. Exchange Rate Assessment1
Estimates from an application of three different CGER-type methodologies broadly indicate that the
Qatari Riyal was undervalued in 2011, but show mixed results over the medium term with one
approach indicating an overvaluation of 15 percent and thus the need to accumulate larger current
account surpluses, and the other indicating an undervaluation of 2.0 percent.
1.
Since end-2008, a depreciation
trend is observed for both nominal and
real effective exchange rates. Following a
strong appreciation in 2005–08, the tradeweighted real effective exchange rate
(REER) depreciated by 17 percent between
end 2008 and Sept 2012. The nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) has been
more stable relatively, following a mild
depreciation trend over 2005–12.

The equilibrium real exchange

(Cashin, Ouliaris, and Poghosyan,
forthcoming), a co-integration relationship between the logarithm of the REER and the logarithm of
the real oil prices is found. A novel and robust band pass filter methodology (IBPF) for unit root
testing indicates a statistically significant long-run co-integrating relationship between Qatar’s REER
and the real oil price, with an elasticity coefficient of 0.23. It suggests that the Qatari Riyal is
currently undervalued by 6 percent, given trends in oil (and gas) prices.

3.
The macroeconomic balance approach indicates overvaluation of the Riyal. The
estimation employs the generalized method of moments’ (GMM) in a dynamic panel setting,
controlling for potential endogeneity of regressors by applying GMM-IV system estimator of
Blundell and Bond (1998). This method tests with the addition of underground oil and gas wealth
and a proxy for accumulated financial assets at sovereign wealth funds or underreported
international investment positions. In Qatar’s case, as with several commodity-exporters, only a
modest amount of NFA is held at the central bank, and hence the choice of the preferred
specification. This yields an average current account norm surplus of 19.3 percent of GDP in 2017.
Contrasting the norm to the projected “underlying” current account position in 2017 (9.8 percent of
GDP) suggests an overvalued Riyal; with the implication being that Qatar should accumulate larger
current account surpluses, given its fundamentals.
4.
The external sustainability approach indicates an undervaluation. The underpinning of
this approach is that the sustainability of the current account trajectory requires that the net present
value (NPV) of all future oil and financial or investment income (wealth) be equal to the NPV of
imports of goods and services, net of non-oil exports. Subject to this constraint, the economy would
choose a path for imports, and hence a current account norm, that would support intergenerational
equity, given volatile oil prices and

functions. Choosing the middle ground rule
in terms of generosity (the constant real per capita annuity, green line) as a benchmark indicates an
ER undervaluation of 1.9 percent, as the implied current account norm (8.6 percent of GDP in 2017)
is smaller than the projected current account (9.8 percent of GDP in 2017), with the implication that
Qatar could save less. Naturally, changing the oil production and price path, population growth, or
initial NFA, could have a significant impact of the implied current accounts of each allocation rule, as
they are sensitive to parameter assumptions.

2

Assuming for illustrative purposes 864 billion barrels of reserves and a 4 percent recovery rate, oil and gas
production would grow gradually (by 2 percent). Oil prices and the GDP deflator increase by about 2 percent after
2017, and real non-oil GDP grows by 5 percent. Future oil revenues are nominally discounted at 6 percent, the
assumed rate of return on externally held financial wealth/NFA.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of November 2012)
The program of cooperation with Qatar is relatively recent. It began in April 2003 with a Public
Transport Sector Reform study. A manpower planning exercise launched in 2003 with the support of
the World Bank evolved in 2004 into a Labor Market Strategy for Qatar which could serve as a
model for the GCC countries with similar labor issues. In 2005, the World Bank provided technical
assistance on payment systems to the Qatar Central Bank, in the context of supporting the
development of payment and securities clearance and settlement systems in the Arab region
through the Arab Payments and Securities Settlement Initiative, led jointly by the World Bank, the
Arab Monetary Fund and the International Monetary Fund. In 2007, the Bank conducted a study on
the Knowledge Economy (KE) Development in Qatar the results of which were discussed at several
high-level workshops.
More recently, the Government, represented by the Minister of Economy and Finance, signed the
Framework Agreement for Advisory Services with the Bank in order to further develop of the
cooperation program. The Bank provided technical support to the government on a number of
strategic issues including strategic planning, public-private partnerships, and macroeconomic
modeling. A recently completed program with the Ministry of Business and Trade addressed the
issues of improving business environment.
The Bank currently supports the Ministry of Environment to strengthen environmental policies and
procedures consistent with the regional Gulf Environment Program and Action Plan (GEPAP), and
expects to help develop a National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. The Bank also expects
to support the General Retirement and Social Insurance Agency to enhance institutional capacity,
sustainability of existing programs, and asset management.
The Bank has been helping the authorities prepare for and deliver the Convention of the Parties
(COP 18) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) taking place in
Qatar on November 26–December 7, 2012 and will continue to assist the authorities in this regard
focusing on dryland agriculture and food security.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November, 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance but there is substantial scope for
improving their frequency, timeliness and coverage. The most affected areas are the real gross
domestic product (GDP), financial accounts of the balance of payments, and external debt
statistics.
National Accounts: Qatar publishes quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices.
The accuracy of data in the nonhydrocarbon sector is undermined by the lack of comprehensive
source data. In July 2011, Qatar Statistics Authority (QSA) published the final annual series of
nominal and real GDP data for 2004 and 2009.
Price statistics: There have been some improvements in the compilation of the consumer price
index (CPI). The authorities are now publishing monthly CPI data based on a reweighted and
rebased (2007=100) basket, but the index remains deficient. The information related to domestic
rentswhich form a sizeable share of the basketis based on field visits by QSA staff in Doha
and nearby areas. In that respect, there are plans to rebase the CPI to the year 2012, after the full
response of the latest household survey is received, and the newly based CPI is likely to place a
lower weight on the rent component.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities presented to the mission, Government budget
and outcomes data according to Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM) guidelines.
However, budget data should be rendered consistent with the data on public sector in the
monetary survey and the balance of payments. Data on financing items in the budget are not up
to date. Access to this information along with data on the budget outcome for previous fiscal
years would enhance the basis for analysis.
Monetary statistic: Monetary data for Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and commercial banks are
generally timely and of high quality. The QCB reports monetary data regularly to STA for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a monthly basis with a lag of about three
weeks. Monthly and quarterly data are also published in the Monthly and Quarterly Statistics
Bulletin.
Financial stability: Qatar Central Bank published and disseminated its third Financial Stability
Report in 2012, and plans to make it an ongoing process.
Balance of Payments: Since the 2010 technical assistance mission on balance of payments
statistics, as well as the participation of STA staff in the 2011 Article IV Consultation, the
authorities are publishing quarterly BoP data in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The
financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the
Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Exchange. Continuing efforts are needed to
further develop data sources, particularly for the private sector. To this end, close collaboration
with the QSA in the development of surveys is strongly encouraged. In addition, close monitoring
of investment income is needed, particularly for foreign investments in the hydrocarbon sector.
The authorities presented the mission with a partial compilation of an International Investment
Position (IIP) statement for the period June 2012. They need to continue their efforts to develop
their external sector statistics by working towards a comprehensive IIP. The 2012 TA mission on
CPIS will facilitate the process.

QATAR

External debt: Detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are
provided to missions during the Article IV consultation discussions. In the recent period, Qatar
has issued several international bonds. The authorities are disseminating data on external debt
through the QCB website. It is important to improve the information flow on external debt and its
maturity profile. The MoEF is according priority to the collation and dissemination of complete
data on external debt (including government, government enterprises, and non-government
corporates).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Qatar is a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant since December 2005. The
GDDS mission of April 2007 updated the GDDS Summary Table II Data Coverage, Periodicity, and
Timeliness; assessed dissemination practices relative to the requirements of the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness; and identified major
milestones that Qatar would have to reach to graduate from the GDDS to the SDDS. To enhance
data dissemination practices, staff assisted the authorities in developing a National Summary Data
Page (NSDP) and an Advance Release Calendar (ARC).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 16, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Qatar
On January 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Qatar. 1
Background
Qatar has benefitted from high oil and natural gas prices and production, with expansionary
government spending and an accommodative monetary stance providing additional stimulus.
The government has now shifted its focus to economic diversification and growth in
nonhydrocarbon sectors through targeted infrastructure investments. Growth rates are
stabilizing in 2012, mainly due to a slowdown in hydrocarbon sector growth, as the self-imposed
moratorium on increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity kicks in. The nonhydrocarbon
sector is projected to grow at a pace of 9 percent in 2012, driven by the construction, transport
and communications, trade and hotels, and services sectors. For the second year in a row,
average CPI inflation is expected to average around 2 percent in 2012, mainly due to depressed
rents.
The banking system remains highly capitalized and profitable. The capital adequacy ratio of
commercial banks rose from 16.1 percent in 2010 to 21.1 percent in June 2012, while
nonperforming loans declined from 2.0 to 1.7 over the same time period, and the return on
assets recording 2.5 percent in June 2012.
The economic outlook remains strong with robust nonhydrocarbon growth, and inflation rising
only gradually over the medium term. The main downside risks are lower hydrocarbon prices,
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
tightening of external financing conditions, and potential disruption in transportation of LNG due
to increased geopolitical tensions. Growth in the nonhydrocarbon sectors will range between
9 and 10 percent over the medium term, while the hydrocarbon sector is projected to grow
between -1.1 percent and 3.5 percent over the medium term. As infrastructure-related
construction activities pick up, as the demand-supply situation in the real estate market
converges, and as the expatriate population increases, inflation will gradually increase from
3 percent in 2013 to 5 percent by 2016. Fiscal and external surpluses are projected to taper
down significantly, due to flat LNG and a declining trend in crude oil production and exports, and
due to higher fiscal expenditure.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Qatar’s
continued strong macroeconomic performance, underpinned by sound policies and growth in
the nonhydrocarbon sector. Fiscal and external surpluses are high, consumer price inflation is
low, and the medium-term outlook for the economy remains favorable. Directors noted the
positive regional spillover effects of Qatar’s high growth, public spending, and increased
financial assistance.
Directors commended the authorities’ focus on advancing economic diversification and growth
in nonhydrocarbon sectors. To ensure the smooth implementation of the large infrastructure
investment program, Directors saw merit in developing a contingency plan against potential
risks from fluctuations in hydrocarbon prices and a tightening of external financing. Directors
also underscored the importance of an integrated public investment management process to
manage implementation risks.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a three-year budget framework to help shield government
spending from revenue volatility and enable better utilization of resources. They underscored
the need to enhance the credibility of the annual budget and initiate macroeconomic forecasting
through a macrofiscal unit. A formal fiscal rule could reinforce the fiscal framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to contain current expenditures
and prioritize capital spending. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to increasing fiscal
savings in the medium term for building buffers against shocks, saving for future generations
and fully financing the budget after 2020 from nonhydrocarbon revenues.
Directors noted that inflation remains subdued. However, they advised the authorities to remain
vigilant of any emerging inflationary pressures and stand ready to restrain current expenditures
to control aggregate demand, and to manage liquidity by absorbing the structural liquidity
surplus. Directors encouraged development of a liquidity forecasting framework and
macroprudential measures for effective policymaking, especially to smooth excessive credit
growth. They welcomed the measures to boost financial oversight further, by providing the legal
mandate of financial stability to the central bank and establishing the Financial Stability and Risk
Control Committee to provide a formal structure for coordination among the regulatory bodies.

3
Directors noted that the banking system is resilient and remains well capitalized. They
underscored the need to reduce the buildup of liquidity and currency mismatch risks and to
prevent accumulation of excessive exposure to the real estate sector. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to develop a deep and liquid domestic debt market, which will bring important
benefits in financing, monetary transmission and liquidity management.
Directors recognized the improvement in statistics, and looked forward to continued efforts in
this area, particularly through greater coordination across agencies.

QATAR

Statement by Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director for Qatar
January 11, 2013
1.
On behalf of the Qatari authorities, I thank staff for their comprehensive papers and the
constructive Article IV Consultation discussions. The authorities value the views of the Fund on
Qatar’s economic and financial policies.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
Qatar’s economic performance remained strong over the past two years, mainly on account
of prudent policies and buoyant activity in the non-hydrocarbon sector. In 2011, Qatar completed a
large 20-year investment program in the hydrocarbon sector. It has since shifted its focus to
economic diversification and growth in the non-hydrocarbon sectors through targeted infrastructure
investments, as part of its National Development Strategy. These actions are expected to maintain
Qatar’s medium-term growth outlook strong on account of robust growth in the non-hydrocarbon
sector, in spite of the moratorium on the development of new hydrocarbon projects until 2015.
3.
The authorities are aware of the potential risks to the outlook emanating from fluctuations in
oil prices and tightening external financing. In addition to large reserves with the sovereign wealth
fund and the central bank, they aim at mitigating these risks by fully financing the budget from 2020
onwards from non-hydrocarbon revenues. With regard to potential financing risks, it is well to recall
that the government has built a sovereign U.S. dollar benchmark yield curve after the global crisis
and has been able to issue bonds abroad at favorable interest rates. This reflects a combination of
good credit rating, considerable investor interest, and the safe haven status of Qatar. The authorities
are also taking steps to mitigate implementation risks of the large infrastructure investment
program, and have assigned the Central Planning Office the task of coordinating among agencies.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
4.
The authorities attach great importance to increasing fiscal savings in the medium term,
given their objectives of fully financing the budget after 2020 from non-hydrocarbon revenues,
building buffers against shocks, and saving for future generations.
5.
The fiscal stance for 2012/13 is contractionary and the overall fiscal surplus is projected to
remain high at about 8 percent of GDP. This is due to a marked increase in corporate taxes―as new
companies start paying corporate taxes―high investment income, and hydrocarbon revenue. The
authorities also aim at maintaining wages and salaries at their current share of total expenditure
while containing expenditures by line ministries. In this connection, they see that the adoption of a
three-year budget framework in the 2012/13 budget would enable more efficient sectoral planning
and better utilization of resources by ministries and government agencies. Should oil prices
sustainably fall below target, other current expenditures would be reduced and investment projects
would be financed through public-private partnerships (PPP) instead of the budget. To this end, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) is working on developing a model PPP legal framework.

QATAR

6.
The authorities see merit in staff’s recommendations to enhance the annual budget
procedure and eventually adopt a formal fiscal rule. They are, however, currently focused on
strengthening the medium-term budget reforms initiated last year.
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
7.
The price level is expected to remain low at 2 percent in 2012, mainly due to depressed
rents. The current monetary stance is expected to stay accommodative, although the authorities
are careful to prevent overheating of the economy and are taking steps in this regard as detailed
in Box 2.
8.
With recent initiatives to develop domestic financial markets, the Qatar Central Bank (QCB)
is now moving toward a more active and market-based liquidity management framework. In this
regard, the authorities agreed to continue to absorb liquidity surplus through Treasury-bills.
9.
The banking system remains well capitalized and profitable, and it is showing resilience to
credit risk. The authorities agreed with staff on the need to limit the buildup of liquidity risk related
to short-term foreign borrowings channeled into funding medium-and long-term domestic lending.
Additional prudential liquidity ratios could be used to that end. Credit to the real estate sector
appears to have stabilized in 2012. QCB has adequate macroprudential tools to contain any
resumption in real estate credit growth, including by employing higher risk weights for real estate
lending for the capital adequacy ratio. As part of its continuous efforts to improve the resiliency of
the banking sector, QCB has advised banks to increase the risk reserve balance to 2.0 percent
effective from the financial year ending 2012 and subsequently to 2.5 percent, effective from the
financial year ending 2013. The central bank laws have also been amended to give the legal
mandate of financial stability to the QCB.
10.
The authorities recognize that developing deep and liquid domestic debt markets can bring
important benefits by raising financing and enhancing monetary transmission. They are facilitating
market development through regular issuances of Treasury-bills and have plans to issue Treasury
bonds. QCB is also taking the lead in setting up a domestic credit rating agency and a central
securities depository.
Statistical Issues
11.
The authorities are committed to further improve statistics in order to assist decision making
and improve macroeconomic management. They wish to express their appreciation for the provision
of Fund technical assistance in this regard. Considerable progress has been made in improving the
timeliness and quality of national accounts statistics, and the Qatar Statistics Authority is now
publishing a quarterly real GDP series. QCB has also developed a partial international investment
position statement at end-June 2012.
