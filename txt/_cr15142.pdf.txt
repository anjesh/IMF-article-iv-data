IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Colombia

On May 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Colombia.1
Colombia has enjoyed strong growth over the past several years, among the highest in Latin
America. Credible fiscal and inflation targeting frameworks have supported sound
macroeconomic policy management, which underpinned robust economic performance during
the last decade. Social indicators have improved steadily over this period. Public debt remained
low, Colombia’s foreign exchange reserve position strengthened, and the Flexible Credit Line
arrangement provided a buffer against elevated external tail risks. The authorities continued to
improve the fiscal policy framework and strengthen the social safety net.
Real GDP grew by 4.6 percent in 2014. Unemployment declined to an average of about 9 percent
during the year. In the second half of 2014, global oil prices fell sharply by about 40 percent and
the peso depreciated, especially in the fourth quarter. As inflation began rising to the mid-point
of the target band, and given the slightly positive output gap, the central bank raised the policy
rate by 125 basis points to 4.5 percent between May and August. The central government fiscal
balance remained broadly unchanged from 2013, meeting the structural balance target, although
the headline fiscal deficit increased slightly. The consolidated public sector deficit rose to
1.6 percent of GDP, pushing public debt to about 39 percent of GDP.
The current account deficit widened to 5.2 percent in 2014, but capital inflows were buoyant.
Strong inflows of foreign direct investment and portfolio flows more than offset the current
account deficit, and gross international reserves rose to 47 billion at year end. This level appears
adequate for precautionary purposes but may be insufficient for tail risks. The current account
deficit is projected to widen in 2015 due to the oil price decline, but would gradually narrow over

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

the medium term with the slight recovery in oil prices and growth in Colombia’s trading
partners, especially the U.S. Moreover, the sharp peso depreciation should help contain imports
and spur non-traditional exports.
The banking system and corporate sector have remained in good financial health. Financial
soundness indicators have been strong and financial system exposure to the oil sector is very
low. Growth in credit to the private sector was buoyant, at 14.7 percent in 2014 (nominal yearover-year) and house price growth has slowed. Corporate profitability was strong, and liquidity
remained adequate. Corporate and household debt has increased in 2014, but remains modest by
international standards and leverage is within historical norms.
Growth is expected to slow to 3.4 percent in 2015 given a subdued outlook for investment,
especially oil-related, and private consumption. Inflation rose to 4.6 percent in March, due to a
weather-related agricultural output supply shock and some pass-through from exchange rate
depreciation, but is expected to diminish to 3.6 percent year-over-year by end-December with
inflation expectations remaining anchored within the target band of 2−4 percent. In response to
lower corporate profits and a partial postponement of dividends from the state oil company, the
central government announced an expenditure reduction of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2015, which
will also act as a drag on growth. However, the impact of oil shock on the budget and economic
growth will be mitigated by the sharp depreciation of the peso (20 percent vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar since mid-2014), and the operation of the fiscal rule, which allows a smoother adjustment
to the permanent decline in wealth.
Growth is expected to gradually rise toward its potential (around 4.25 percent) over the medium
term, supported by the government’s Public-Private Partnership-based infrastructure program
and a gradual recovery in oil prices and external demand. However, risks threaten on the
downside, including higher interest rates and financial volatility, a protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and emerging economies, economic or political stress in neighboring
countries, and a delayed implementation of the infrastructure program.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Colombia’s continued robust economic performance and
financial stability, underpinned by prudent management and strong policy frameworks including
a fiscal rule, an inflation targeting regime, and a flexible exchange rate. Substantial progress has
also been made in reducing unemployment and poverty in recent years. Directors noted,
however, that Colombia is facing headwinds from the sharp fall in the price of oil, a key export.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Given elevated external risks, Directors stressed the need for stepped-up efforts to further
enhance the resilience of the economy. They supported an eventual exit from the Flexible Credit
Line arrangement with the Fund once external risks have receded.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to the structural fiscal rule. They
highlighted the importance of mobilizing non-oil revenues to meet the authorities’ medium term
fiscal targets while protecting social and infrastructure spending. This requires a comprehensive
tax reform, with the objectives of simplifying the tax structure, increasing progressivity,
broadening the tax base, and improving tax administration. Directors looked forward to the
recommendations of the recently established expert commission on these matters.
Directors supported the broadly neutral stance of monetary policy, but encouraged the authorities
to stand ready to take appropriate action if growth falters. They noted that the current level of
official international reserves provides adequate insurance in normal times, and that the
exchange rate has adjusted flexibly in line with fundamentals. Directors considered that the
widening current account deficit, largely financed through foreign direct investment, is likely to
narrow over time on the back of the exchange rate depreciation and ongoing fiscal consolidation.
Directors noted that the financial system is sound, profitable, and well-provisioned, with low
exposure to the oil sector. They commended the authorities for the progress in addressing crossborder risks and strengthening the regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Continued efforts are
nonetheless crucial to boost the resilience of financial institutions, and to strengthen supervision
of complex financial conglomerates. Directors also underscored the importance of further
improving risk-based supervision, enhancing regional cooperation primarily in Central America,
deepening the capital market, and promoting financial inclusion.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ inclusive growth agenda. They agreed that key priorities are
to reduce informality in the economy, improve competitiveness and infrastructure, and foster
social mobility, especially through better education and health care. Directors recognized the
benefits of the authorities’ fourth generation road investment program—implemented with
appropriate funding and safeguards—in reducing infrastructure gaps and helping diversify
sources of growth. More broadly, they supported initiatives to promote private participation in
the economy, including through divestiture of a public utility company.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Prudent macroeconomic policies have underpinned Colombia’s strong growth
during the last few years, which exceeded that of most Latin American peers. Last year,
the economy posted real growth of 4.6 percent, and average inflation remained near the
center of the target range. Monetary and fiscal policies were mildly supportive of
growth. The infrastructure agenda is expected to advance this year. Colombia’s
government is engaged in ongoing peace negotiations with the main guerilla group
(FARC).
Outlook and risks. Starting from a position with slightly positive output gap, Colombia
faces a large adverse terms of trade shock. Staff projects growth to slow to 3.4 percent in
2015 and gradually rise toward its potential (around 4¼ percent) over the medium-term
supported by the government’s PPP-based infrastructure program and a gradual
recovery in oil prices and external demand. Risks are mainly on the downside, including
higher interest rates and financial volatility, and a protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies, and a delayed implementation of the infrastructure
program.
Macroeconomic policies. Strong headwinds from the severe oil price decline pose
significant challenges to the near-term economic outlook. The structural fiscal rule will
only partially shield expenditure plans from the oil shock and some fiscal tightening will
be required to accommodate lower-than-expected oil revenues. A broadly neutral
monetary policy stance will be consistent with achieving the inflation target in the nearterm.
Medium-term challenges. Colombia’s key challenge will be preserving macroeconomic
stability while sustaining strong and inclusive growth through structural reforms.
Revenue mobilization is urgently required to protect key social and infrastructure
spending while adhering to the medium-term fiscal rule targets amid less favorable
external conditions (weaker terms of trade and tighter financing conditions).

BACKGROUND
1.
A strong policy framework and prudent macroeconomic policy management have
underpinned Colombia’s vigorous economic growth during the last several years, which has
been among the highest in Latin America. Colombia’s robust and broad-based growth in recent
years has contributed to a decline in poverty, inequality, and unemployment (Figure 1). Economic
stability has underpinned strong capital inflows, especially FDI, which have also benefited from
steady upgrades in Colombia’s sovereign credit rating, and, more recently, an increase in its weight
in global bond indices. The central bank has taken advantage of the abundant capital inflows to
rebuild net international reserves and the government has been able to lengthen the average
maturity of its debt, issue at historically low yields, and widen the foreign investor base. The inflation
targeting framework has served to maintain low and stable inflation and anchor inflation
expectations. Prudent financial supervision and regulation have supported financial deepening and
macro-financial stability.
2.
Colombia’s government is engaged in ongoing peace negotiations. The government has
been holding peace talks with the main guerilla group (FARC), now counting some 8,000 members,
since 2012. The parties have reached agreement on three out of six points on the peace agenda, and
in early January 2015, President Santos announced the intention to discuss a bilateral ceasefire. A
peace accord would end five decades of armed conflict.
3.
Exchange regime and economic data. Colombia has a floating exchange rate regime
(de jure and de facto). Colombia maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector (IMF Country Report 13/35 for
details). Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
4.
Past Fund advice. Since the 2014 Article IV Consultation, the authorities have enacted a tax
reform to raise revenue and have taken steps toward consideration of a broader tax reform. They
have been implementing key recommendations from the 2012 FSAP Update. They continue to
advance an agenda of inclusive growth, with measures set out in the recent development plan.
5.
Colombia’s Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangements have served the country well. The
successive FCL arrangements have provided a cushion of international liquidity and complemented
the authorities’ countercyclical policy response to heightened external risks, including after the
2008–09 global financial crisis and during the euro area crisis. The arrangements have allowed the
authorities to preserve policy frameworks and to rebuild buffers, while sending a positive signal to
international financial markets on the strength of the economy. Empirical analysis conducted by the
Colombian central bank and Fund staff’s econometric analysis found that the FCL reduced the
sovereign risk premium, improved consumer confidence and growth, eased exchange rate pressures,

and mitigate the confidence effect of a surge in sovereign yields after the taper talk episode in mid2013.1

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Brisk growth continued in 2014, with mildly supportive macroeconomic policies.
Despite strong headwinds from the external environment, real GDP increased by 4.6 percent in 2014,
driven by domestic demand. An expansion of civil works and the government’s mortgage subsidy
program for middle-income households boosted construction activity. Strong economic growth
underpinned historically low unemployment rates and increased labor formality. As inflation
returned quickly to the midpoint of the target band from a low level in 2013 and Q1 growth surged
to 6.3 percent, the central bank normalized the monetary stance, increasing the policy rate by
125 bps between May and August, to 4.5 percent (Figure 2). However, real interest rates remained
moderately supportive. The central government fiscal balance remained broadly unchanged from
2013, and met the structural balance target embedded in the fiscal rule. However, subnational
governments posted strong expenditure growth, which drove a widening of the consolidated public
sector deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP and pushed public debt to about 39 percent of GDP (Figure 3).
7.
From position of strong growth, Colombia confronted a severe oil price shock in the
second half of 2014. The economy was operating slightly above potential in mid-2014 and inflation
expectations were anchored near the center of the central bank’s 2−4 percent target band. During
the second half of 2014, oil prices plummeted by about 40 percent, leading to a moderation of
portfolio inflows as well as a decline in asset prices, including sovereign debt and Ecopetrol
securities (Figure 4). Reflecting some pass-through from a sharp peso depreciation (17 percent
during Q4), and a weather-related agricultural output supply shock, inflation accelerated to
3.7 percent at end-December.
8.
Despite a higher current account deficit, reserve buffers remained strong through
2014. The current account deficit widened to 5.2 percent of GDP, owing to strong import demand
from buoyant economic activity and the temporary shutdown of the Cartagena oil refinery. Partly
due to its favorable economic conditions, Colombia experienced heightened portfolio inflows from
the beginning of the year, triggered by an increase in Colombia’s weight in the J.P. Morgan’s
Emerging Markets Bond Index. Despite some moderation in the last part of the year, portfolio
inflows (net 3.1 percent of GDP) added to the ample inward foreign direct investment (net
3.2 percent of GDP) to more than finance the current account deficit (Figure 5). Consequently, gross
international reserves rose (by US$3.7 billion in 2014), reaching US$47 billion at end-2014,
representing 131 percent of the reserve adequacy metric for commodity exporters (Figure 6). Total
external debt remained low (28.6 percent of GDP).

y/y; Figure 4). Vulnerabilities stemming from the
cyclical increases in house prices in recent years remained contained given low household leverage,
a low share of mortgages in banks’ portfolios and very conservative, forward looking loan-loss
provisioning (Box 1). Corporate profitability was strong, and liquidity remained adequate. Corporate
debt increased to some 29 percent of GDP of which over ⅔ was due to domestic banks, but
remained modest by international standards and total leverage was within historical norms.3
Moreover, the share of corporate debt in firms with weak debt servicing capacity-interest coverage
ratios (EBITDA divided by interest expense) less than 2— has declined during 2010–14 by about
15 percent points to 1 percent.4

10.
The 4G PPP program was successfully launched, with a first wave of projects awarded.
The authorities aim to attract private investment to reduce the existing infrastructure gap, which is
most acute in the area of transportation, particularly roads. With that objective in mind, the PPP
framework was strengthened recently through regulatory and institutional changes
(i.e. standardization of contracts and better linking of government payments to project completion
points; Box 2). According to the official timetable, project awardees would arrange their financing
sources this year and start the building phase in 2016.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The severe oil price decline constitutes a strong headwind to the near-term economic
outlook, although some rebound in conditions is expected over the medium term. Staff
projects growth to slow to 3.4 percent in 2015, reflecting a deceleration of private investment,
especially in the oil sector, a negative fiscal impulse (¶15), and a slowdown in private consumption.
Oil production has been above 1 million bpd in the first quarter of 2015 and is projected to remain
high throughout the year, benefitting from past investments in exploration and development,

The new capital adequacy measure better defines Tier 1 capital, but still includes a broader recognition of Tier 2
(subordinated debt) as capital and is not as strict in terms of deduction of future intangibles and goodwill from the
base capital calculations relative to Basel III capital standards.

Stress tests undertaken by the central bank in June 2014 indicate that the corporate sector is resilient to interest
rate shock.

improved pipelines, and competitive production costs (Box 3). However, oil companies’ cutbacks in
investment, mainly due to cash flow constraints after the fall in prices, will likely limit the growth of
the sector over the medium term despite an expected partial recovery of oil prices by 2020. The
negative growth impact of the terms of trade shock is expected to be partly offset by the authorities’
fourth generation (4G) infrastructure investment program and a slight improvement in external
demand, which would boost growth to about 4¼ percent by 2018. The growth dividend from the 4G
infrastructure agenda is projected to be frontloaded,

Large risks threaten on the downside. A massive oil price shock has already materialized,
far beyond risk scenarios envisaged only a year ago, and there are risks of a further decline and
increased volatility in energy prices. While latest data still show relatively solid economic activity, the
impact of the oil shock on the Colombian economy may turn out significantly worse than expected
in the baseline outlook. Private investment is the most likely component of GDP to disappoint,
particularly if FDI inflows slow significantly, and could lead to a more subdued medium-term growth
outlook. Private consumption might also falter beyond the expected moderation in consumption of
durable goods. Any delays in the implementation of the PPP program could undercut potential
growth and competitiveness. At the same time, additional external risks loom. The global
environment continues to toil under the legacy of financial fragility and a high debt overhang in
many advanced countries. The main risks stem from the expected asymmetric exit from
unconventional monetary policy in the U.S. where a faster decompression of term premiums could
lead to rapidly rising yields and substantially higher volatility, which coupled with further dollar
appreciation and surging global risk aversion could have strong knock-on effects on emerging
markets’ growth and commodity prices, including oil. Further, an intensification of sovereign distress
in the Euro Area could generate a surge in bond yields, large movements in the value of major
currencies, or an increase in global financial volatility. In the context of Colombia’s greater economic
vulnerability after the oil price decline, including a stronger reliance on portfolio inflows, such global
shocks could lead to sharp repricing of Colombian assets and exchange rate, as well as spillovers to
export revenue, FDI, and growth. In addition, further oil price decline stemming from weaker global

demand due to protracted period of slower growth, including in the Euro Area and China, or supply
factors could lessen Colombia’s exports receipts and FDI inflows, while economic distress in Central

region.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

13.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of risks. They
projected near-term growth to be below potential, reflecting economic adjustment to the significant
decline in national income associated with the fall in oil prices. They saw Colombia as more
vulnerable to adverse shocks during this process of adjustment, and also considered that downside
external risks had become more elevated. In particular, the authorities expressed concern that the
continued delays in the normalization of U.S. monetary policy had increased vulnerabilities in global
financial markets, which could exacerbate volatility and spur sharp capital flow reversals in emerging
markets as soon as U.S. interest rates begin to rise. The still tepid economic recovery in advanced
countries and slower growth in emerging markets posed a risk to external demand. The authorities
underscored that regional risks had risen significantly, with growth in neighboring countries
projected to decline, thereby undermining the potential export boost from the peso depreciation.
The oil price shock is likely to dampen growth in Ecuador (which has also recently raised import
tariffs), and to exacerbate the economic distress in Venezuela, both of which remain key destinations
for Colombia’s nontraditional exports. In addition, any potential civil unrest in Venezuela could
spillover to Colombia’s border areas, where unemployment could increase due to migration.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the appropriate macroeconomic policy stance to adjust to the oil
shock in 2015; policies to maintain fiscal, external, and financial sector stability; reforms
to mobilize fiscal revenue; and actions to foster inclusive growth and competitiveness.

A. Near-Term Policy Stance: Mitigating the Impact of the Oil Shock
14.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the macroeconomic framework provided
sufficient buffers and flexibility to mitigate the impact of the oil price shock and smooth the
adjustment to a lower level of national income. As a result of the strengthening of the fiscal
framework (e.g. new royalty system; structural fiscal rule) during the last few years, and moderate
levels of public debt, Colombia is in a strong fiscal position to absorb the oil price shock. In addition,
the flexible exchange rate regime, credible inflation targeting framework, and comfortable level of
foreign exchange reserves, complemented by the FCL from the Fund, provide the central bank with
powerful tools to respond to shifts in cyclical economic and financial conditions. Indeed, the oil price
shock led to a sharp depreciation of the peso (20 percent against the U.S. dollar and 14 percent in
real effective terms estimated on average for 2015), which should boost exports in the non-resource
sectors and partially offset the impact of lower oil prices on the domestic currency value of oil
revenues. In addition, with inflation expectations well-anchored, there is ample space to adjust
monetary policy rates if needed.
15.
The structural fiscal rule will partially shield expenditures from the oil shock. The
central government’s structural balance rule includes an adjustment for the deviation of the actual
oil price from the long-term price set by an expert committee in spring 2014, which helps protect

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the expenditure envelope for 2015 (Box 4).5 The headline deficit would widen to about 3.4 percent
of GDP and gross public debt increase to 40 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, lower-than-expected
income taxes and a partial deferral of Ecopetrol’s dividend will affect structural fiscal revenues this
year.6 Consequently, the government enacted a tax reform in late 2014, targeting corporations, and
announced a reduction in planned expenditures of about 0.7 percent of GDP for 2015, in order to
comply with the fiscal rule target ex post. The decree-based expenditure adjustment would be
confined to the central government, and be slightly more heavily tilted towards investment
spending, but would also imply some (yet to be specified) across-the-board cuts in current outlays,
possibly excluding education and compensation of civil victims of the conflict. The authorities
acknowledged the potential (first round) negative impact of the expenditure cuts on growth, but
suggested that fiscal multipliers in Colombia could be low (between 0.4 and 1).7 By demonstrating
their commitment to the rule, they also expected to reinforce confidence and private investment.
The central government’s negative fiscal impulse will be partly offset by strong expenditure
execution at the subnational level ahead of elections in the fall. The authorities and the staff agreed
that the experience with the oil shock will provide an opportunity for the fiscal rule committee to
revisit the operation of the fiscal rule and the sensitivity of fiscal revenue to oil shocks.
16.
With the economy operating close to potential, a broadly neutral monetary policy
stance would support economic activity and be consistent with achieving the inflation target.
The monetary policy rate, at 4.5 percent, is currently near its neutral level. The authorities pointed
out that the exchange rate pass-through to prices is low (estimated at about 4 percent) because
Colombia is relatively closed and the share of tradables in the CPI is only 26 percent (excluding
food). In addition, domestic energy prices are also expected to decline and the currency
depreciation is lower in trade-weighted terms. Therefore, inflation pressures are expected to unwind
later this year, especially as the disinflationary impact of the slowdown in domestic demand takes
hold. Staff advised that if growth slows more than expected there would be scope for monetary
policy easing as long as inflation expectations remain anchored. With the peso broadly aligned with
fundamentals, and already strong buffers, the pace of reserve accumulation will likely abate as
reflected by the central bank’s decision to suspend foreign currency purchases during the first
quarter of 2015.

5
Most of Colombia’s oil revenue accrues to the public sector. Ecopetrol, with 88 percent government ownership,
constitutes 65 percent of oil exports.
6
Includes lower dividends and income tax from 2014 Ecopetrol profits, and subdued income tax collection this year
(pre-payments of the 2016 tax bill) from oil companies. The government also decided to smooth the shortfall in
income accrued by Ecopetrol, postponing part of the mandated dividend transfers to 2016. The strategy would
improve Ecopetrol’s cash flow and also smooth central government revenues as dividends are expected to decline in
2016.
7

There is no broad consensus in the size of fiscal multipliers in the literature. Recent empirical estimates for
expenditure multipliers in emerging and low income countries range from -0.4 to 1.7 (IMF Working Paper/14/93).

B. Adjusting Fiscal Policy to the Dimmer Medium-Term Outlook
17.
The subdued outlook for oil revenues represents an important challenge for achieving
medium-term fiscal targets.8 The authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework implies a 1½ percent
of GDP reduction in the structural deficit between 2015 and 2020 with structural oil revenues
declining as a percent of GDP. While this path will represent a mild annual fiscal withdrawal (average
fiscal impulse at -0.3 percent of GDP), under unchanged tax policy, consolidation would require
primary expenditure cuts of about 1½ percent of GDP (text table), leaving limited room to
accommodate social and infrastructure expenditure pressures.9 Similarly, regional and local
governments will face expenditure constraints arising from the subdued medium-term outlook for
oil-related royalties. In the near term, the fiscal balance of the subnational governments is expected
to improve as the start of a new administration is typically associated with lower expenditure
execution. While public debt is now some 4 percentage points higher than a year ago at
38.7 percent of GDP—due to the widening of the central government deficit and the valuation
effects of the peso depreciation—it will gradually decline over time and remain in line with other
investment-grade countries and sustainable (Table 8 and Figure 8). Additional downward revisions
to the oil price outlook would, however, further constrain expenditure plans and increase debt levels
(Box 4). 10

8
Oil revenues (dividends and income tax) are indirectly related to both exports and domestic sales. For Ecopetrol
(which represents about 62 percent of oil production), domestic sales represented 37 percent of total sales in 2014.
The rest of the oil companies are mostly devoted to the export market. Further, direct fuel consumption taxes
amounted to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2014.
9

The baseline scenario does not assume new tax measures, and the gradual decline in central government revenues
as a fraction of GDP is due to a reduction in oil-related revenues. Further, the outlook for expenditure in the baseline
scenario is broadly based on the 2014 Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) which includes a plan for achieving
the consolidation path mandated by the fiscal rule through reductions in expenditure, including a moderation in
investment (about ½ percent of GDP between 2015 and 2020). The 2015 MTFF will be published in June and would
be in line with the expenditure priorities arising from the upcoming National Development Plan 2014−18.
10

Staff projections are broadly guided by the authorities MTFF, which includes the expected outlays related to PPP
investment program, existing pension programs, and some existing programs to compensate victims of the civil
conflict (e.g. Victims’ Law; Law 1448 of 2011).

18.
The authorities agreed on the urgent need to mobilize revenue in order to protect
social and infrastructure spending, especially given falling oil revenues. They concurred that
additional revenue, gained through tax reform and better enforcement, would help replace the
expected decline in oil revenues and finance key social and infrastructure expenditure programs
which could bolster the outlook for inclusive medium-term growth, while complying with the fiscal
rule targets. Therefore, the government established an independent expert commission in early 2015
to advise on options for tax reform. As a pragmatic first step, with the potential to boost revenue in
time for the 2016 budget, the authorities were considering revamping the tax system for non-profit
organizations, which had proliferated in recent years. They also reassured staff that the expenditure
plans set out in the forthcoming MTFF would be well-aligned with the new National Development
Plan (NDP) agenda. Further, they thought that a potential peace agreement was not likely to entail
significant unfunded mandates but would facilitate stronger agricultural development and create
political and social support for future reforms.
19.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the broad objectives for tax reform. Revenues
should be mobilized in a way that simplifies the existing tax structure, increases progressivity,
broadens the tax base, and facilitates private investment by ensuring international competitiveness.
Staff advised that the tax system currently imposes a comparatively high burden on companies, and
will continue to over the medium term as the wealth tax on companies is phased out and replaced

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

by higher corporate income taxes. Some options for a broad tax reform could include strengthening
the income tax system and increasing the VAT rate and base (Box 5).11 Staff considers that if
sufficient revenues could be gained from these sources, they could help reduce existing
non-conventional taxes (e.g., personal wealth tax, financial transaction tax, VAT on capital goods) to
foster investment and growth.12 The authorities believe that the personal wealth tax has been an
important instrument for achieving more progressivity. There was also consensus that enormous
gains in revenue could be achieved through improving tax administration, including by imposing
criminal penalties for tax evasion, increasing the number of officials, and strengthening the
information technology of the tax administration authority.
20.
The authorities remain confident of the success of their infrastructure program.
Although Colombia compares well with peers in some areas of infrastructure, such as the quality of
electricity supply, a significant road infrastructure deficit generates bottlenecks and hinders
competitiveness and inclusive growth. The fourth generation (4G) infrastructure program of road
concessions is being implemented in a context of a much strengthened risk framework, which
includes a framework Law, standardized PPP contracts, contingency planning, and ex-post financing
of functional units. Continued efforts are underway to develop alternative financing options and
instruments for risk hedging, including by amending the financial regulatory framework to facilitate
participation of institutional investors. Colombian banks and pension funds are already showing
strong interest despite their limited experience with project financing. The first set of roads
concessions has been awarded and the authorities expect contractors to establish financing
agreements by year end. The authorities intend to use proceeds from the prospective sale of the
power company Isagen to increase resources in the development fund. They consider that
infrastructure investment would support aggregate demand in the short run, offsetting part of
negative growth impact of the terms of trade shock, and raise long-run potential growth by about
0.7 percent (estimate of the national planning department, DNP).
21.
The details of a potential peace agreement remain uncertain, but the impact on fiscal
spending is likely to be manageable. A peace agreement would likely entail continued
expenditures for the re-integration of demobilized combatants (up to 0.1 percent of GDP), victims’
reparations (1 percent of GDP), health, and education benefits for victims, most of which would likely
reflect programs that have already been included in the MTFF. Financing for additional outlays
would likely include redistribution of government assets through the ongoing land and rural
development reforms, and be partly financed also through lower military spending. As security has
considerably improved over the last decade, risk premia have come down and the investment
climate has improved. However, while there might be some further gains from stability, any
11

The traditional corporate income tax (CIT) could be replaced with a higher corporate income surcharge (CREE)
which has a broader base (e.g. fewer deductions). The traditional personal income tax could be substituted with an
extended alternative minimum tax (IMAN).
12

The VAT regime does not grant a credit for VAT paid on the purchases of capital goods. This feature is a deviation
from standard practice, disproportionally affects capital-intensive activities and is an important contributor to the
overall corporate tax burden.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

additional peace dividend for growth would likely materialize beyond the medium-term horizon,
given long implementation lags for land reform and rural development.

C. Preserving External Stability
22.
The current account, currently adjusting to a new equilibrium, is weaker than
fundamentals and desirable policy settings, while the real exchange rate has adjusted quickly
in line with fundamentals. The External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodologies assessing the
current account directly show a gap of around 2 percent of GDP (adjusted for potential oil reserves)
whereas the EBA REER methodology estimates the exchange rate fully in line with fundamentals
(Box 6). The difference between these results highlights the transition to the new equilibrium of
lower oil prices. Prices have adjusted quickly, with a REER depreciation of 18 percent at end-2014,
but import compression and the growth in exports of non-traditional goods will occur more
gradually. The CA gap is therefore expected to narrow in the medium term. The remaining gap
reflects Colombia’s very high levels of investment and elevated repatriation of profits. The
authorities noted that the current account deficit is temporarily somewhat higher than historical
levels and agreed that the exchange rate was in line with fundamentals by the end of 2014. They
emphasized that the peso is allowed to float freely and has depreciated more than other currencies
in the region since mid 2014, driven mainly by oil prices and to a lesser extent by expectations of
U.S. monetary policy normalization and the widening of global risk premia.
23.
Due to the oil price shock, the current account deficit is projected to widen in 2015,
but remain predominantly financed by FDI inflows. Oil export receipts are projected to drop
significantly in 2015 due to the fall in global oil prices, but lower profit repatriation of foreign-owned
firms and a decline in imports should partially compensate the impact on the current account. FDI
inflows are expected to moderate from recent high levels (from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to
3.3 percent by 2020), but will finance about 80 percent of the current account deficit over the
medium-term. As a result, the current account deficit will continue to be financed largely through
stable funding sources, as in the past.
24.
The current account is expected to strengthen over the medium term. Staff and the
authorities expect the current account deficit to narrow going forward as the peso depreciation
supports growth of non-traditional exports and reduces growth of capital and consumer imports
after a lag, although the associated improvement in the trade balance would be partly offset by a
higher cost of external debt. The authorities pointed to a similar delayed improvement in the current
accounts of other countries in the region following a negative terms of trade shock (e.g., Chile’s
copper price shock in 2009). Over the medium-term, oil export receipts are projected to increase as
prices partly recover and help offset some decline in oil production in response to decline in
oil-related investment (Box 3). The authorities concurred that further efforts to diversify the
economy would lower reliance on oil receipts and help dampen current account volatility, while
productivity-enhancing labor market reforms, and efforts to diversify export markets and products
would improve competitiveness. They noted, in addition, that the planned fiscal consolidation would
play a role in strengthening the current account balance over the medium term.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

25.
The authorities have built an adequate level of international reserves, adapting their
intervention to changing external conditions. Staff and the authorities concurred that Colombia
has an adequate reserve buffer for normal times, though they might be insufficient to cope with tail
risks. The authorities reiterated that reserve ratios prevailing prior to the global financial crisis of
2008–09 had proved to be an important buffer in confronting that large external shock. Therefore,
the central bank took advantage of abundant capital inflows through 2014 to rebuild external
buffers. As of end-2014, the stock of international reserves covered approximately 7 months of
imports and about 100 percent of 2015 gross external financing needs, but reserves measured
relative to short-term external debt plus the current account deficit are still below pre-crisis ratios.
As reserve ratios increased and in light of the significant depreciation of the peso, in line with its
fundamental value, the central bank halted its foreign exchange purchases in 2015.

D. Safeguarding Macro-Financial Stability
26.
The financial system is sound, and exposure to the oil sector is limited. Financial
indicators are strong (Table 7). Because oil sector companies do not borrow domestically and
finance themselves largely through re-investment of profits, and some issuance of local bonds,
banks’ exposure the oil sector is extremely low (about 1–3 percent of assets), mitigating the risk
from the oil shock to direct lending portfolios. Non-banks’ exposure to the oil sector is also
moderate and does not pose macro-stability risks.


Financial sector institutions13 exposure to the oil sector, including loans and bonds, is
concentrated in Ecopetrol (97 percent) whose liquidity position remains strong and with
moderate leverage. There is also no evidence of high concentration in the volume of deposits of
oil companies at any of the credit institutions.



Exposure to oil shares in the repo and futures markets and to oil securities in private debt
arbitrage trading is small.14



Some individual non-systemic insurance companies and broker-dealers’ investment portfolios
have a significant share of their equity exposed to oil companies.



Households’ exposure to the oil sector is negligible. Less than 5 percent of shares of the three
major oil companies were held by minority shareholders at end-2014. Individual shareholders
(domestic and foreign) kept 0.018 percent of shares of Ecopetrol, 0.15 percent of shares of
Pacific Rubiales and 19 percent of Canacol.

13

Including banks, financial corporations, fiduciary institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, cooperatives,
and the stock exchange.
14

At end-December 2014, exposure to Ecopetrol stock in standardized derivatives market represented 1.2 percent of
this market. Pacific Rubiales standardized derivatives consisted of 0.6 percent of the standardized derivatives market.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

COLOMBIA



According to a central bank stress test conducted in June 2014, the banking sector would remain
solvent even under an extreme macroeconomic shock.15 A liquidity stress test suggests that the
liquidity coverage ratio would remain well above the regulatory minima of 100 percent for banks
and non-banks.

27.
Risks from the credit cycle appear moderate and the macro-financial system is stable
on both microprudential and macroprudential dimensions. While financial sector vulnerability
risk has increased reflecting a recent pick-up in credit and is marginally above the “low” threshold in
the last quarter of 2014, banking system balance sheets have remained strong and buffers are ample
(Appendix I). Moreover, while household and corporate leverage has been increasing, it remains low
and the low exposure to the oil sector is expected to dampen the effect of the oil shock on
households and corporate borrowing and consumption. The authorities agreed that house price
increases have stabilized more recently, as the mortgage subsidy on middle-income households was
discontinued, and do not pose a significant risk to the banking sector.
28.
Credit growth has remained robust, at

have fuelled substantial payroll and consumer loan
growth, which will need to be monitored closely against potential worsening of underwriting
standards and turnaround in the economic cycle. Credit growth was also boosted by government’s
housing subsidy program targeted to middle-income households and will continue to be strong
going forward through financing of the 4G infrastructure program (see below). Although consumer
lending for durable goods is expected to slow, due mainly to lower credit demand as economic
activity and private consumption moderates, total credit growth will continue to outpace nominal
GDP growth. This is in line with the authorities’ financial inclusion policy which has resulted in credit
deepening and will boost microfinance going forward, and the strong drive for home ownership that
will support mortgages as incomes continue growing.
29.
According to scenario analysis, Colombian banks have sufficient capacity to help
finance the 4G infrastructure program. The financial system supervisor (Superintendencia
Financiera de Colombia, SFC) ran a macro-financial scenario to gauge the banking system’s capacity
to fund Col$14 billion (30 percent of total financial need) of fourth generation (4G), PPP-based road
infrastructure projects. The scenario assumed staff’s baseline macroeconomic projections for

15

The combined shock consists of an 8 percent decline in real GDP, an increase in the real interest rate to 12 percent,
17 percent fall in house prices, and an increase in unemployment rate to 15 percent.

2016 and 2017 and normal growth of credit and provisioning. The results indicate that bank
financing for 4G is manageable without crowding out lending to other sectors or unduly increasing
concentration and banks could maintain strong capitalization. The authorities were optimistic about
bank’s appetite for financing the 4G projects, including because of lower business prospects for
other credit lines due to the cooling of the consumer lending cycle and slowdown in activity.
30.
Colombian banks' large presence in Central America continues to pose risks. Economic
risks have declined in some of the Central American countries where Colombian banks have
expanded in recent years, as these countries benefit from close linkages to the U.S. and lower
energy costs. However, concerns persist over lower loan quality, higher FX exposures, and weaker
prudential standards and AML/CFT framework. The absence of common regulatory and supervisory
standards and confidentiality obstacles on information sharing create challenges for cross-border
supervision, including for AML/CFT purposes. A network contagion analysis suggests that, at this
point in time, Colombian banking conglomerates are systemic for the region (including Central
America and Panama) while they are not vulnerable to shocks on individual banks in other countries.
However, banks’ capital, while currently above regulatory minima, could prove insufficient against
risks run by banking groups in case of system-wide shocks. Moreover, removing goodwill from
banks’ capital results in a more negative scenario in which Colombia becomes significantly more
contagious for the region and its banks more vulnerable to shocks. Consideration should be given
to strengthening capital buffers further and building a regional body in charge of financial stability
that would act as a forum for the coordination of regional macro-prudential surveillance (Box 7 and
Selected Issues Paper).
31.
The Colombian authorities are making good progress in implementing FSAP
recommendations, including those that help address cross-border risks. Draft laws granting
independence and legal protection of the supervisor, and laws awarding regulatory powers over
holding companies of financial conglomerates currently lie before Congress. Extended delays in
approving the laws would weaken supervisory oversight of the financial system. The SFC continues
to move ahead with risk-based supervision to enable the supervisor, together with banks and
nonbanks, to tailor prudential requirements to the risks that their operations entail. The authorities
noted that while work on addressing risk from financial conglomerates has progressed, assessing
risks from mixed conglomerates remains challenging given complex family ownership and offshore
structures where SFC regulatory reach is limited. The Ministry of Finance is working on proposals to
implement the Basel III capital adequacy measure, Basel II (Pillar 2) buffers, the capital conservation
buffers, and domestic systemically important banks’ (D-SIB) buffers for large internationally active
Colombian banks. These measures build on an already enhanced capital adequacy measure
(introduced in 2013) and will provide increased loss absorbency for Colombian banks against crossborder and domestic risks once fully implemented (Box 8).

have been growing in size, with some large entities accounting for around 30 percent of key public
debt and derivatives markets.16 Since the collapse of a large broker-dealer, Interbolsa, in 2012,
regulations such as the management of liquidity risk of broker-dealers and investor protections
were strengthened. The authorities agreed that notwithstanding such enhancements, risks from a
larger presence of systemic broker-dealers in capital markets require continued monitoring. To that
end, the SFC continues to move ahead with risk-based supervision to enable the supervisor to tailor
prudential requirements to the risks that their operations entail, which would also instill better risk
management practices at banks and nonbanks.

transactions. To address risks they are developing
analytical and supervisory tools for on-site and
off-site surveillance of derivatives transactions. Their risk-based approach to supervision currently
addresses counterparty risk, including risks flowing from institutions' regional exposure, and should
be upgraded to monitor concentration risk as well as leverage and collateral quality in the OTC
derivatives market (Box 9, and Selected Issues Paper).
34.
Development of capital markets should focus on creating depth and enhancing
liquidity. Liquidity in interbank money markets (e.g. repo) tends to be concentrated at overnight
maturities while money markets at maturities beyond the overnight are illiquid. This limits the scope
of Colombian capital markets to provide liquidity management and financial intermediation services
for a variety of corporate (financial and non-financial) institutions. While good progress has been
made to limit counterparty access to routine open market operations, thereby encouraging
counterparties to manage liquidity through the money markets, further development of money
markets could benefit from imposing a higher cost of overnight credit, and from a greater issuance
of short-term government securities.

E. Fostering Inclusive Growth
35.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda, enshrined in the national development plan,
targets key areas to foster inclusive growth. Despite significant progress over the past decade,

Total nonbank financial system assets amounted to Col$532.2 billion in June 2014 (72.5 percent of GDP).

18

COLOMBIA

Colombia’s poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and informality are still elevated (Box 10).
Labor market formalization has improved as a result of the 2012 tax reform, which lowered taxation
on labor (see Selected Issues Paper). However, the high minimum wage relative to the average wage
hinders further formalization gains, particularly for youth and unskilled labor. Going forward, plans
to streamline the requirements to make formal contributions to pension and health systems could
further reduce labor informality and strengthen the social safety net. Female labor participation
should also increase through easier access to maternity leave benefits. Streamlined regulation,
aligned with OECD standards, could lower uncertainty for firms and facilitate resource planning. A
centralized database of vacancies at municipal level, developed by the Labor Ministry, is expected to
support the search and application processes of first-job seekers, mainly unemployed youth. The
development plan’s goal to improve access to quality education would help reduce inequality and
promote medium-term growth prospects. The authorities are also working on a pension reform that
would strengthen the safety net of the poor through expanded coverage of non-contributory
pensions (with 2 million recipients compared to the current 1.3 million). Efforts to foster innovation
and economic diversification are also planned and, a potential peace accord would provide further
opportunities for institution building and rural development, which will help improve growth
prospects and inclusiveness, and strengthen competitiveness.
36.
Financial inclusion remains one of the main tools for fighting poverty and
marginalization. Over the past year, the main achievements on the financial inclusion front have
been the launch of the electronic money issuers license and the implementation of the centralized
electronic movable property registry. These initiatives have the potential to lower transaction costs,
promote usage of new products, and contribute to financial deepening and inclusion. The
authorities are currently setting up the regulatory framework to operationalize electronic deposit
taking institutions, while the movable property registry will benefit from new regulation to lower the
period for the execution of guarantees and from the improved methodology for asset valuation.
Concomitantly, various national institutions are coordinating to provide financial education through
schools and media, which should also contribute to financial system stability. Given that informal
finance remains pervasive in Colombia and may underlie the low usage of bank accounts, household
surveys could be expanded and deepened to incorporate questions on the role of informal finance
for different segments of the population throughout the country (see Selected Issues Paper).

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Supportive economic policies underpinned strong economic growth in 2014 despite a
worsening of global conditions. Real GDP grew by 4.6 percent last year, among the highest in the
region, supported by strong aggregate demand resulting in part from a broadly neutral fiscal policy
and an accommodative monetary stance. After the collapse in oil prices during the second half of
the year, growth ebbed to 3.5 percent y/y in the fourth quarter.
38.
The strong and flexible macroeconomic framework is expected to moderate the
growth slowdown in 2015 following the severe oil shock. A subdued outlook for investment,
especially oil-related, and private consumption and some fiscal tightening will cause growth to slow
to 3.4 percent. However, the sharp real effective exchange rate depreciation should help contain
imports and gradually spur non-traditional exports. The recent rise in inflation reflects temporary
factors and slower growth is expected to close the output gap; thus, a broadly neutral monetary
policy stance remains consistent with achieving the inflation target, and staff sees scope for easing if
growth falters. The structural fiscal rule helps protect key expenditure programs from cyclical oil and
output fluctuations, and the government’s decision to adhere to the rule ex post rightly bolsters
fiscal policy credibility. Plans for the fiscal rule committee to revisit the operation of the fiscal rule
and the sensitivity of fiscal revenue to oil shocks are welcome.
39.
The outlook is clouded by large downside risks. Especially during its adjustment to the
negative terms of trade shock that has already materialized, Colombia is exposed to heightened risk
of additional adverse external shocks, including a further decline in commodity prices, deterioration
in global financial conditions, and negative growth shocks in key trading partners. Oil prices may fall
further or be exposed to bouts of volatility. Economic slowdown or stress in neighboring countries
would limit the potential to take advantage of the peso depreciation. A bumpy normalization of
monetary policy in the U.S. or an intensification of sovereign distress in the Euro Area could
generate a surge in bond yields, large movements in the value of major currencies, or an increase in
global financial volatility.
40.
The oil shock has amplified the urgency of mobilizing fiscal revenue to protect key
social spending. The structural fiscal rule has served the country well; however, amid the weaker oil
revenue outlook, it will be necessary to increase fiscal revenues to meet medium-term targets and
simultaneously protect key social and infrastructure needs. The recently formed expert advisory
commission is a welcome step. Revenues should be mobilized in a way that simplifies the existing
tax structure, increases progressivity, broadens the tax base, and facilitates private investment by
ensuring international competitiveness. Equally important, tax administration reforms should further
advance, including by imposing criminal penalties for tax evasion, and strengthening human and
technological resources of the tax administration authority.
41.
Moving forward with infrastructure investment is key to improving competitiveness
and boosting growth. The authorities’ infrastructure program, including the fourth generation of
road concessions to be executed through public-private partnerships (PPPs), is expected to address

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

a key bottleneck for Colombia’s strong and inclusive growth. Efforts to develop alternative financing
options and instruments for risk hedging should continue while other potential sources of financing
should be tapped, including from multilateral institutions and from the sale of government assets,
such as the power company Isagen, to increase resources in the national development fund.
Colombian banks have sufficient capacity to help finance the 4G infrastructure program without
crowding out lending to other sectors. Efforts to develop alternative financing options and
instruments for risk hedging should continue.
42.
Recent efforts have further strengthened financial supervision and regulation, but
some remaining areas warrant continued attention. Financial soundness indicators are strong
and exposure to the oil sector is very limited. Recent work has advanced risk-based supervision
including from financial conglomerates. However, supervision of complex financial conglomerates
and exposure to concentration risk continue to pose challenges. A deeper framework to monitor
and stress-test a wide variety of cross-border risks is required, given the recent expansion of
Colombian banks into other countries in the region, primarily in Central America. A clear timeline for
the implementation of the Basel III capital adequacy measure for large internationally active banks
would also be an important step forward.
43.
The external position of the economy is strong, and international reserves appear
adequate for precautionary purposes. The current account deficit is weaker than implied by
fundamentals while the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Moreover, risks to
external stability are mitigated by a stable financing of the current account deficit, still largely
through foreign direct investment. The central bank has appropriately taken advantage of periods of
strong capital inflows over the past few years to strengthen international reserves, which are
adequate but might be insufficient to cope with tail risks.
44.
Measures to foster more inclusive growth would be welcome. While poverty has
declined, improvement in income inequality has lagged in recent years. Further reducing poverty,
unemployment, inequality, and informality will require structural reforms in the labor market, and
the fiscal and financial sectors. The high level of the minimum wage relative to the average wage
might be hindering employment opportunities for the youth and unskilled.
Expanding non-contributory pension coverage would strengthen the safety net of the elderly poor.
Financial inclusion could be fostered by promoting financial education, encouraging competition in
the banking sector to lower costs, and shortening the period for the guarantees on movable
property.
45.
Staff does not recommend approval of the retention of the exchange restriction
arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector, since the authorities have no
plans for its removal.
46.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12‒month cycle.

Box 1. House Prices and Household Debt
Housing prices have increased rapidly in recent years, raising concerns that the market may be
undergoing a bubble. House prices have nearly doubled in real terms over the last decade, equally for
subsidized and commercial housing, and are almost 40 percent above their peak in 1996. The price hikes
have outstripped increases in construction prices and were mainly driven by a rising trend in the capital and
two other large cities. However, the increase in housing prices has been less pronounced after adjusted for
income levels and the quality of newly constructed housing. House price increases have also surpassed
rental increases (a common indicator used to gauge the relationship between prices and fundamentals).
However, household income has also increased strongly in the recent decade, alleviating the burden of
mortgages on households and boosting demand for housing.

The exposure of households and the financial sector to house price developments continues to be low
(see Selected Issues Paper for the 2014 Article IV Staff Report). The growth of mortgages in banks’ loan
portfolios remains high, although it has slowed marginally to 17.3 percent in real terms in September 2014.
Credit risks are, however, mitigated by a low overall stock of mortgages (about 10.5 percent of total loans),
conservative provisioning, and lower housing finance interest rates, which are capped to the lowest rates
prevailing for other type of lending. Banks have also been moving towards greater amounts of fixed rate
funding for mortgages from variable rates, which should strengthen profitability in a low interest rate
environment. Moreover, housing loans extended in recent years have shown less deterioration compared to
those made in the past. At 17.5 percent of GDP and 28 percent of disposable income, household debt is
moderate, and debt service-to-disposable income is low (9 percent).1 Although slightly higher than a year
ago, LTVs remain low (52 percent).
The government has supported housing construction and finance through tax incentives and interest
subsidies. The programs are primarily designed to support social housing to low-income earners. However,
in 2013, the government introduced a mortgage interest rate subsidy for middle-income earners as a
counter-cyclical measure to spur construction. The program was effective as a temporary fiscal measure to
support growth, and was since discontinued,

Box 2. Infrastructure Investment in Colombia
Poor infrastructure quality is a drag on Colombia’s potential growth and competitiveness. Total
infrastructure investment averaged 4.3 percent of GDP during 1980−2000, but has slowed down to
3.2 percent of GDP over the last decade. Bottlenecks in fiscal, legal, and environmental areas have been the
main impediments to infrastructure investment, with the transport sector most affected. Over 2002−08,
transport infrastructure investment was below 1 percent of GDP per year, and only in 2009−13 reached
2 percent of GDP.
Colombia’s infrastructure gap is most acute in road transport. Various studies indicate that
infrastructure quality is relatively low and logistic costs are high both at regional and global level. In the
World Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance Index, Colombia ranks 97th among 160 countries. The country

During 2010−14 the authorities undertook regulatory and institutional changes to enhance the
efficiency infrastructure investment and facilitate financing by institutional investors. The institutional
framework was strengthened by creating the Vice-Ministry of Infrastructure, the National Infrastructure
Agency (ANI), and the National Development Bank (FDN). The 2012 PPP law addressed numerous
bottlenecks: (i) eliminated the possibility for the private sector to request cash advances; (ii) limited
amendments to PPP contracts to a maximum of 20 percent of the value of the original contract; (iii) linked
government payments to the quality of infrastructure services provided; (iv) required that the decision to
pursue a PPP be based on sound socio-economic and technical studies; (v) defined the responsibilities of the
parties involved in the PPP process; (vi) included an improved gateway process for the Ministry of Finance;
and (vii) regulated unsolicited proposals for PPPs. The Infrastructure Law was expedited to address
bottlenecks in the relocation of utilities networks and purchase of land. In addition, the 2014 regulatory
framework amendments related to investment regimes and larger individual credit limits for institutional
investors are expected to incentivize domestic private sector participation in projects.
The authorities are undertaking an ambitious 4G infrastructure investment program totaling about
Col$48 trillion (US$25 billion, about 6.2 percent of 2014 GDP) over 2014–22. Fiscal outlays (in the
MTFF) would be around 0.4 percent of GDP per year, including contribution to a contingency fund.
Implementation of the program is planned in three waves: 9 projects in the first wave (about US$7 billion),
9 projects in the second wave (about US$6−7 billion), and 12 projects in the third wave (about
US$6−7 billion). The first wave projects have already been awarded and financing agreements are expected
by end 2015. The bidding process for the second wave projects is expected to be completed in May, with
financing agreements required within a year. Bidding for the third wave projects has not commenced yet.
To finance investment, concessionaires will need to attract funding from various sources. Authorities
target the following structure of potential financing: (i) local banks―30 percent; (ii) foreign
banks―26 percent; (iii) equity of the concessionaries (domestic and foreign)―20 percent; (iv) private capital
funds―14 percent, attracting institutional investors for the construction stage; and (v) multilateral
institutions (FDN)―10 percent. After the construction phase, project maintenance and repayment of debt
incurred in the construction phase would be financed from the concessionaries’ tolls, future cash
appropriations from the budget, and income received from commercial activities in the concession area.

Box 3. Oil Sector Prospects
Since 2006, an increase in investment supported a
strong expansion in oil production. Oil production
expanded by about 90 percent between 2006 and
2013, and surpassed one million barrels per day. The
2.5 percent decline in 2014 was due in part to security
and other operational constraints but it has recovered
in recent months. An important factor behind this
expansion is the government’s measures to improve
the investment climate for foreign oil companies. FDI
and Ecopetrol investment more than tripled over this
period.

While production costs remain competitive, cash
flow constraints have driven oil companies to scale down investment plans. Oil companies are actively
timing their capital expenditures, especially exploration-related, to revenue inflows; some companies are
also considering divesting from non-core activities to finance capital expenditures. The two largest
operators, Ecopetrol and Pacific Rubiales, announced strong cuts to their investment plans, by 25 percent
and 50 percent respectively. Given the still competitive

In this context, the authorities’ draft development plan targets measures to improve oil-contract
flexibility. Amid lower oil prices, more flexible targets for exploration and production would improve
competitiveness especially for medium-size oil companies. The draft development plan also includes
measures to foster better recovery rates at existing fields as well as tax incentives (expected to be included
in the expenditure envelope of the next MTFF) for off-shore exploration and production.

Box 4. Oil Shock and Colombia’s Fiscal Rule
In Colombia, the fiscal rule represents an important
buffer against cyclical fluctuation in oil prices and
GDP. The rule (which became effective in 2012)
includes a numerical target path for the central
government’s structural deficit which is computed by
removing the impact of the cyclical variation of oil
prices and GDP on fiscal revenue. Further, the rule calls
for a gradual fiscal consolidation―about ¾ percent of
GDP reduction of the structural deficit during 2016 and
2022. Something important to highlight is the fact that
for each budget, the long-run price is determined by
an expert committee that meets in April of the
previous year.

halving in 2015, structural oil revenues would further
decline by 0.4 percent of GDP by 2020 amid the weak
outlook for oil production (about 8 percent production
decline by 2020). Absent revenue mobilization
measures, fiscal expenditure would have to be reduced
by about 1¾ percentage points of GDP―reflecting the
combination of the required consolidation and
reduction in structural oil revenues.

0.15 percent of GDP lower than in the baseline
in order to achieve the structural deficits targets. In contrasts, scenario 2 would allow expenditure to be on
average about 0.2 percent of GDP higher.
Different outlooks for oil prices will also have implications for debt accumulation. Within the fiscal
rule, net debt accumulation (reduction) becomes the key tool to respond to cyclical declines (increases) in
GDP and oil prices. Case in point, net debt levels would about 1 percentage points of GDP higher by 2020
under the scenario of continued low oil prices. In contrast, net debt levels would be about 3.5 percent of
GDP lower by 2020 if oil prices were to return to high levels. The impact on the debt trajectory would be
long-lasting; for instance, the net debt levels that would be achieved in 2025 under the baseline, would take
about 7 extra years if oil prices were to remain low.2 It follows that achieving a defined path for structural
balances does not ensure also achieving a desired debt target.

Box 5. Recent Tax Reforms and the Road Ahead1
The 2012 tax reform has had mixed success in achieving its goals of improving progressivity and
lowering the burden on labor income. The 2012 reform aimed to improve progressivity and reduce the tax
burden on labor which was hindering formality and competitiveness while being revenue neutral. The reform
was designed to be revenue neutral and included the reorientation of taxes in favor of personal income,
introducing a minimum personal income tax (IMAN/IMAS) and away from labor, partially replacing social
security contributions with corporate profit-based taxes (CREE). In terms of results, labor formality has
increased compared to the period preceding the reform. However, progressivity of the system did not
improve markedly as personal income taxation has increased only marginally.
At the same time, the revenue performance of the reform was somewhat below expectations. The
IMAN’s very narrow tax base has facilitated evasion. Further, as the CREE was built on top of the existing
corporate tax code, it has inherited some of its loopholes and room for evasion. As a result, the reform’s
yield has been lower than expected, albeit it is relatively early to do a full assessment. Further, the
earmarking of CREE to compensate foregone social security revenue has reduced budget flexibility
somewhat.
The 2014 reform was designed as a short-term tool to offset scheduled revenue declines. The reform
was approved last year, and became effective in 2015. The reform yield (1.5 percent of GDP until 2018) was
designed to make up for the scheduled elimination of the wealth tax and financial transaction tax (FTT) and
some expected decline oil revenue due in part to a dimmer outlook for production costs and prices. The
reform measures include the gradual increase of CREE (from 9 percent in 2014 to 18 percent in 2018) for
middle and large firms (annual profits in excess of US$0.4 million) and the continuation of the personal
wealth tax and financial transaction tax until 2018.The reform also phases out the firm-level wealth tax over
this period. The reform entails a combined relatively high level of corporate tax rate of 43 percent (CREE +
corporate tax rate of 25 percent) which could hinder investment; further conditioning the rate of CREE on
firm’s profit level might lead to further distortions.2
Future revenue mobilization efforts should build upon instruments introduced in the 2012 tax
reform. CREE’s simplified exemption structure could replace traditional corporate taxation; similarly, the
traditional personal income tax system can be replaced by an improved IMAN by eliminating loopholes for
high income individuals, increasing rates and widening the tax base to cover middle income individuals. The
tax base of the VAT could be further expanded and its rate increased. At the same time, replacing existing
non-conventional taxes (personal wealth tax, FTT, VAT on capital goods) with alternative revenue sources

Box 6. External Sector Assessment
Colombia’s current account, temporarily adjusting to a new equilibrium, is weaker than implied by
medium term fundamentals and desirable policies. The External Balance Approach (EBA) External
Sustainability (ES) estimates suggest that the CA is about 2 percent below the level needed to stabilize
Colombia’s NIIP over the medium term. The EBA CA method estimates a CA gap of 5 percent of GDP,
reflecting a very high unexplained residual and poor model fit in the case of Colombia, which is―to a large
extent―due to the treatment of oil reserves.1 The

to the ES method. This gap is likely to be temporary

and to narrow over the medium term as the country
adjusts to a new equilibrium of lower oil prices. The
remaining gap reflects Colombia’s high levels of investment and elevated repatriation of profits.
The exchange rate has adjusted quickly and is in line with fundamentals. EBA’s real effective exchange
rate (REER) method suggests that the exchange rate was overvalued by only 1.4 percent at end 2014. This
result is consistent with the full flexibility of Colombia’s exchange rate regime, as demonstrated recently by
the quick adjustment to the sizable terms of trade shock. In fact, the REER depreciated by 18 percent y-o-y
at end-2014, returning to levels preceding the global financial crisis and the subsequent commodity boom.
The CA deficit has widened since 2000 mainly driven
by strong imports from investment and consumption,
declining remittances, and weaker manufacturing
exports. In 2014, the deficit reached 5.2 percent of GDP
and is expected to widen to 5.9 percent in 2015 mainly
reflecting the 40 percent decline in oil prices since mid
2014. Due to the significantly depreciated exchange
rate, import compression will help contain the
worsening of the trade balance already in 2015. This
would be in line with the REO (2015)3 results as well as
the authorities’ estimations, according to which import
elasticities have increased in recent years.
1

The EBA CA methodology estimated the current account norm at +3.2 percent of GDP in 2013, compared to
2.6 percent of GDP in 2012, largely due to the introduction of years remaining of proven oil reserves (as a proxy
for oil wealth) as a new variable in the model. The oil industry officials (including foreign multinational companies)
share the view that the country’s oil resources are substantially larger than indicated by the proven reserves
measure, as further supported by a high ratio of potential oil reserves to proven reserves.
2

With significantly lower oil investment, the transformation of potential into proven reserves is likely to slow at
current low prices, but oil stocks will remain in place even if not converted into commercially viable proven
reserves in the short term. In addition, initial off-shore explorations have already started.

Box 6. External Sector Assessment (concluded)
Backed by a significantly depreciated exchange rate, the CA is projected to improve gradually. Nontraditional exports were around 5 percent of GDP before the global financial crisis and could reach these
levels again, notably with more competitive prices and improvements in infrastructure. However, based on
studies on export elasticities for Colombia, recently estimated at 0.5 over two years, the impact is likely to
occur with a lag.4 Moreover, firms will have to reorient toward new export markets given the situation in
neighboring countries, including new tariffs in Ecuador and economic stress in Venezuela, two key export
destinations for non-traditional exports.
Colombia has seen a strong increase in capital inflows
in 2014, triggered by an increase in Colombia’s weight in
the J.P. Morgan’s Emerging Markets Bond Index. Portfolio
inflows, mainly invested in longer term government
securities, have overtaken FDI inflows for the first time in
2014. FDI remains strong at around 3 percent of GDP but is
expected to decline by 20 percent in 2015 due to falling
oil-related investment. Given Colombia’s relatively high
competitiveness, FDI would pick up in the medium term to
continue financing a major share of the CA deficit.

The NIIP is at moderate levels and mainly in the form

70 percent of GDP―an increase of 10 percentage points relative to 2013―with FDI liabilities (40 percent of
GDP) twice as large as portfolio liabilities. With

The floating exchange rate has been a key shock absorber and reserve buffers remain adequate.
Colombia remains committed to a floating exchange rate which was demonstrated by the recent
depreciation of the peso. These developments also led to a halt in reserve accumulation, but strong buffers
had been built up in past years with foreign exchange reserves amounting to 131 percent of the adjusted
ARA metric in 2014.

Box 7. Financial Integration: A Network Contagion Analysis
Colombian large banking groups have seized opportunities for diversification through regional
expansion in recent years. Colombian banks have expanded mainly in Central America and Panama
following withdrawal of global banks (in particular, HSBC and GE) in response to tighter post-crisis
regulatory and supervisory environment. Benefits of this expansion included higher profitability and
diversification from Colombia’s GDP and commodity cycles. The low interest rate environment after the
financial crisis also generated abundant liquidity allowing

Colombian conglomerate headquarters and their
subsidiaries act as an important connection hub for
different parts of the network. Colombia has sizable bilateral
linkages with U.S. and Panama, with the latter accounting for
the largest counterpart of interbank exposures within the
region. Further, interbank exposures account for 43 percent of
external exposures in Colombia, while direct external
exposures to private sector and non-bank financial institutions
play a more significant role than in other countries.

Colombian conglomerates are of systemic importance for the region.1 A baseline simulation of
interbank contagion suggests that, while Colombia appears moderately contagious for the region, its banks
are not vulnerable. The stress test computes a cumulative macro impact from an individual bank shock to
the whole system taking into account two possible spillover channels: a credit shock and a funding shock. In
the simulations, spillovers are transmitted only through on-balance sheet interbank connections, although
there may be other possible inter-group contagion channels not covered by this exercise. Interbank
contagion remains in large part concentrated in the country where the shocks originated, although there are
some cross-border spillovers, while exposures to non-bank financial institutions are generally limited. Capital
losses induced by shocks in the banks are smaller in Colombia than in other countries considered suggesting
that, while some countries appear less fragile individually than as a system, Colombia clearly benefits from
regional integration. This occurs because, on average, Colombian banks have higher capital above
regulatory requirements which provides loss absorbing capacity and shelters them from the significant size
of interbank exposures they have in other countries. However, removing goodwill from banks capital results
in a more negative scenario in which Colombia becomes significantly more contagious for the region and its
banks more vulnerable to shocks.
Despite significant progress in recent years, existing institutions in the region are insufficient for a
comprehensive cross-border supervision of regional financial conglomerates and economic groups.
Consideration should be given to building a regional body in charge of financial stability, building from
exiting forums and Ministries of Finance. The body would act as a forum for the coordination of regional
macro-prudential surveillance but would also have the regulation authority over specific aspects that are
relevant for the region as a whole.

Box 8. Summary of Progress with Implementation of FSAP Reforms
The authorities have made good progress in implementing recommendations of the 2012 FSAP
Update. Gains have been achieved in a few high priority short-term reform areas, including independence
and legal protection of supervisors, and supervision and regulation of holding companies of financial
conglomerates. Some progress has also been achieved in the area of bank regulation and money markets,
but gaps are still evident and further effort will be necessary.
The FSAP recommended that the authorities strengthen independence and legal protection of
supervisory staff. Specifically, it was suggested to include the requirement to appoint the superintendent
for a fixed term―or require a public explanation of the reasons for dismissal―and amend the legal
framework to clarify that liability for failure to perform the regulatory mandate in good faith is equivalent to
acting in bad faith. The authorities have put a draft law before Congress which will strengthen independence
of the Superintendent by requiring a clear fixed-term appointment and reasons for removal. SFC staff will be
provided legal assistance and protection from lawsuits when acting in good faith. This will enable
supervisory decisions to occur with greater autonomy and independence. A key issue will be to ensure
passage of draft law without extended delays.
The FSAP recommended, as a high priority, to approve a law that gives SFC supervisory and
regulatory powers over the holding company of a financial conglomerate. The draft law defines a
financial holding company (FHC) and the SFC is provided power to supervise FHCs with special powers to
obtain information from domestic and foreign entities not currently subject to supervision. The SFC can
order changes to conglomerates if any entity presents a risk to the group. However, prudential regulations
are established by the government which could result in weaker enforcement actions for conglomerates. The
SFC has no enforcement powers over non-financial institutions that form part of mixed conglomerates,
enabling unregulated entities to bypass prudential norms.
Adopting Basel II Pillar 2 supervisory framework to strengthen bank regulation was also deemed a
high priority reform. Progress in this area is good but further developments are necessary. Risk based
supervision (RBS) is being developed only for lending institutions and insurance companies, but other nonbanks are not yet covered. The SFC has developed an integrated supervision framework to monitor risks on
a forward-looking, granular, and at a business model level. Moreover, RBS will also take many years to be
implemented fully and, together with stress tests, will facilitate tailoring capital requirements to
concentration and country risks faced by large banking groups and conglomerates.
In money markets, the range of counterparties in open market operations (OMOs) should be
narrowed. Authorities have limited access to OMOs by non-systemic counterparties. This should help
enhance own liquidity risk management by broker-dealers and reduce moral hazard. However, RBS is still
evolving, including for broker-dealers some of whom could pose liquidity and contagion risks to financial
system. It could therefore be envisaged to widen the range of supervised counterparties temporarily in crisis
times for financial stability reasons. Development of longer-maturity money markets would be helped by
increasing the cost of overnight credit and the issuance of short-term government securities. Finally, sharing
of supervisory data between the SFC and the central bank through MoUs should ensure that confidentiality
concerns do not limit exchange of information that is deemed essential for ensuring financial system
stability.

Box 9. Colombia’s Framework for Supervision and Regulation of Derivatives
The derivatives market in Colombia has grown in recent years, mainly to hedge currency and
maturity mismatches for real sector currency exchange transactions. The over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives market is the largest market, dwarfing derivatives traded at the Colombia Stock Exchange or
other trading platforms, including standardized derivatives cleared through the Central Counterparty Risk
Clearinghouse. Equity-based derivatives (including on stock index) and local commodities-based derivatives
(including based on electricity) are traded only in small volumes. At end-2014, gross derivatives exposures in
the OTC market amounted to US$65 billion. Net exposures in the OTC derivatives market remain
manageable though identifying counterparty concentrations of large long and short positions should remain
a priority.

Colombia’s derivatives regulatory regime has evolved over time to meet the needs of the growing
market. Derivatives regulation was originally intended to meet the needs of exchange rate hedging, with
regulation issued by the central bank (BR). Over time, the regulatory framework changes have facilitated
development of the derivatives market, by enabling authorizations and restrictions for financial institutions
in undertaking derivative transactions. At the same time, regulation sought to address risks from that
expansion by ensuring all credit exposures are fairly priced using standard legal agreements and appropriate
risk measures (such as value-at-risk). However, development of financial regulations has created a regime
characterized by duplication that can be difficult to comply with and enforce.
Efforts to provide greater clarity and enforceability should focus on streamlining existing regulation
and procedures. Responsibility for supervising derivatives is currently shared between the SFC and the BR.
Regulation by the BR should be confined to matters related to exchange rate issues and avoid going beyond
strict exchange rate regulation. Continued coordination and data sharing for risk assessment and prudential
and conduct enforcement remains key to this relationship. Moreover, risk-based supervision could be further
upgraded to monitor and address concentration risk as well as leverage and collateral quality in the OTC
derivatives market.
The BR and the SFC should enhance existing joint working arrangements and information to develop
analytical and supervisory tools for surveillance of derivatives transactions. The availability of a wider
information set than each regulator has access to, and development of techniques for joint analysis of
derivatives transactions and exposures will allow a connected and comprehensive view of the risks that such
transactions pose for financial stability. Another area of interest includes strengthening on-site and off-site
supervision of derivatives transactions, from the viewpoint of risks flowing from institutions' regional
exposure.

Various economic and social factors explain the high levels of inequality in Colombia.

Labor market. Income inequality stems mostly from labor income inequality which arises in part
from high wage-skilled gap and high levels of informality.

Education. Colombia has achieved important gains in primary and secondary enrollment, however
access to high quality education is very uneven across income groups and tertiary education is completed
mostly by the better-off.

Pensions. Pensions are an important contributing factor to overall inequality. Moreover, pension
coverage is low by international standards, and also highly concentrated among the rich.

Tax and transfers system. Social transfers in Colombia have a limited impact on income inequality
and the tax system is regressive and evasion is rampant especially among the better-off.
A sustainable and steady reduction of income inequality will require coordinated efforts in the areas
listed above. Success in reducing inequality would in turn improve the prospects for achieving strong
economic growth over the medium and long-term.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ It does not assume any drawings under the Flexible Credit Line arrangement.
2/ Derived as [r - g - p(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; p = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar
terms, g= real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-p(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp) times previous period debt stock. p increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e >
0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

COLOMBIA

Colombia’s macro-financial system is stable. A comparison of Colombia’s latest macro financial
stability map with the same period a year before, shows that the macro-financial system remains
stable on both microprudential and macroprudential dimensions, albeit with some signs of
increased macroeconomic risk (Figure 1) reflecting an increase in bank credit and a rise in CDS
spreads. The level of macroeconomic risk is consistent with the level reported in the April 2015
Global Financial Stability Report. Inward spillover risks have declined since end-2013, on account of
some improvement in the ratio of reserves to broad money. The reduction in risk appetite reflects
recent increases in CDS spreads, and heightened exchange rate and stock market volatility. The
tightening in monetary and financial conditions reflects a decline in real broad money growth.

Sources: Fund staff estimates based on authorities data.

The financial sector vulnerability risk is assessed as “medium” while balance sheets are sound.
The overall financial rating has moved from “low” to “medium” vulnerability in the last quarter of
2014, on account of strong credit growth that has pushed the change in the credit-to-GDP indicator
marginally above the threshold of 3 percent. However, non-performing loan ratios of deposit-taking
institutions remain low, and provisioning has been strong (151.3 percent), mitigating risks from the
slight pick-up in credit. Banks have large buffers, with a capital adequacy ratio above regulatory
minima (17.1 percent, against the minimum requirement of 9 percent), strong profitability (ROE 19.8)
and low leverage (14.9 percent).

WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
The current IBRD Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 12–16 aims to support selectively
Colombia’s National Development Plan. The World Bank Group (WBG) is stepping up efforts to
enhance development impact through selectivity, as a means to provide added value to the country.
The WBG has been carrying out activities for which the Government or the private sector have
expressed explicit need through financial, knowledge, and convening services. Activities are
managed under an enhanced thematic business model approach, aimed at improving the impact of
the Bank’s engagement in Colombia. These activities are combined as a results-focused package of
support grouped under three strategic themes: (a) Expanding Opportunities for Social Prosperity;
(b) Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate Change Resilience; and (c) Inclusive Growth with
Enhanced Productivity. Each of these strategic themes has three areas of results with specified
outcomes. In some cases, outcomes in this CPS cannot solely be attributed to the WBG since
activities are often jointly accomplished with the Government or other partners.
For FY 14‒16 the lending program is expected to be US$870–1,025 million per annum. Actual
delivery of the lending program will depend on Colombia’s performance, IBRD lending capacity,
demand from other borrowers, global economic developments, and disbursement profiles that keep
exposure within the country limits. Trust funds have continued to be an integral part of the Bank’s
engagement with Colombia. As trust fund resources are not predictable for the purpose of the CPS,
the WBG is ensuring that activities financed by trust funds follow the thrust of this strategy in
agreement with the government counterparts.
As of April 2015, Colombia is IBRD’s 7th largest Bank borrower with US$7.9 billion in
outstanding debt. The active portfolio is composed of 15 IBRD and 1 stand-alone GEF project with
IBRD net commitments of US$2.8 billion. Colombia also has a considerable Trust Fund portfolio with
US$61 million represented in a variety of sectors, with close to 42 percent (US$26 million) in small
and micro trust funds under US$5 million. In FY 15, 2 large DPF operations for US$1.4 billion were
approved. The pipeline for FY 16 includes two DPFs of US$700 million each for Sustainable
Development and Growth and Convergence, respectively, as well as potential one IPFs in support of
Plan Pacifico and Financial Systems Strengthening, each. A Multi-Donor Trust Fund has been
launched for support of the peace agenda and post-conflict initiatives. The WB chairs the steering
committee. Current overall contributions are at US$6.5 million, of which the Swedish Development
Cooperation contributed SKr 19.5 million and the WB-administered State and Peace Building Fund
US$4 million.
IFC's outstanding portfolio in Colombia is US$779 million in 60 projects. It is the 10th largest
portfolio worldwide and 3rd regionally. In terms of commitments, the top sectors are: finance and
insurance (55 percent), transport and warehousing (14 percent), oil, gas and mining (8 percent) and
electric power (6 percent). In terms of products, 44 percent is in loans and guarantees and
56 percent in equity and equity-type products. Participants' outstanding loans total US$353 million.

INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK RELATIONS1
The Bank is developing the new country strategy with Colombia (2015–18) and identifies
three policy areas of dialogue with the government: productivity, effectiveness of public
management and social mobility. These areas are part of a comprehensive vision for the
development process of the country, aimed at a vision where the country can achieve a path of
sustainable growth and become a developed country in the long run. There are cross-cutting
requirements associated with this objective and to growth and overcome conditions of poverty and
inequity, which are: (i) increase tax-fiscal revenues in order to ensure a sizable flow of public goods,
and (ii) recognizing both infrastructure development, and human and social capital development as
necessary factors for greater productivity and strengthen the middle class.
The sovereign guarantee lending envelope under the current Strategy (2014–18) was
estimated at US$852 million per year, which total US$3.4 billion for the years 2012 to 2014. In
2014, the Bank approved 5 operations for US$1032 million in sovereign guarantee operations.
The Bank portfolio is currently composed of 25 sovereign guarantee operations, totaling
US$2.3 billion, with a disbursed percentage of 34 percent. Operations are concentrated in
infrastructure (50 percent), governance (31 percent) and social development (20 percent).2 The
non-reimbursable technical cooperation portfolio includes 131 operations, with an approved value
of US$58 million.
The current portfolio of private sector initiatives (non-sovereign guarantee) in Colombia
totals US$209 million. The Inter-American Investment Corporation has a portfolio of US$87 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 31, 2015)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real Sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the national
accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial accounts. Annual and
quarterly estimates of GDP by the production and the expenditure approaches use 2005 as the
reference year. GDP compilation conforms to the methodological recommendations of the System
of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) and some recommendations of the 2008 SNA. The rebasing
of the national accounts’ base year included a methodological change regarding the volume
measures from a fixed-base Laspeyres index to a Laspeyres chain index with 2005 as the reference
year. The main implications of the rebasing are that the 2000 and 2005 series are not comparable
and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components. The rebasing also resulted
in an upward revision of the nominal GDP, reflecting improvements in source data. DANE currently
compiles a monthly indicator of economic activity for internal purposes, but has decided to start
disseminating it to the general public during the third quarter of 2014.
DANE is also responsible for price statistics. It currently compiles and disseminates the consumer
price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI). The basket and weights of the CPI were updated
in 2008 according to the latest Income-Expenditure Survey (2006–2007), which resulted in an
increase in the number of products collected. DANE is currently updating the PPI, which is expected
to be available during the third quarter of 2014.
Government Finance Statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of public
revenue, expenditure, and financing data. The Colombian authorities have reaffirmed their
commitment to adopt the GFSM 2001 framework, enhance inter-institutional coordination, and
increase the resources allocated to compiling government finance statistics. While significant
progress has been made, there is still a need to take additional steps. In the short term, these
include: adopting a common list of public sector entities, and disseminating high-frequency data on
a national and international level. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single
accounting framework for the public sector based on International Public Sector Accounting
Standards and maintains a financial management information system containing accounting
information of all public sector units. The MFPC’s Macroeconomic Policy Unit and the GAO
developed a bridge table that converts national accounting classification to the GFSM 2001
framework to compile GFS on accrual and cash bases, which are reported annually to the IMF’s
Statistics Department for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

Financial Sector Statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Financial Superintendence
(FS) and the Superintendence of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund technical
assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data quality, including
interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency.
External Sector Statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics. Quarterly data
have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in 1998. Balance of
payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade zones. Improved
surveys, particularly in the services sector, have enhanced coverage and consistency and financial
account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE, develop a
methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely basis. Although
DANE developed a methodology to estimate unrecorded trade, the BdR does not include these
estimates in the balance of payments statistics. Also, the BdR has been working to identify
government bonds issued abroad and held by residents, but the task has not been completed yet
due to coverage issues. In line with the mission’s recommendations, the BdR reclassified some FDI
equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjusted the related investment income series
accordingly.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics, External
Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
Colombia reports data to the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).

B. Data Standards and Quality
Colombia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata are posted
on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A data ROSC was published in October 2006.

C. Reporting to STA
Colombia reports annual GFS to STA for general government and its subsectors on accrual and cash
bases for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook). Data for the
consolidated general government are only available from 2008 onward after a major revision was
performed in stock data. Currently, no high frequency data are reported for publication in IFS.
However, an action plan currently being implemented by the authorities is aimed to address this
issue. Colombia is also expected to start reporting debt statistics for the IMF-WB Public Sector Debt
Statistics database. The BdR uses the standardized report forms for reporting monetary data for the
central bank (Form 1SR), other depository corporations (Form 2SR), and other financial corporations
(Form 4SR) to STA. The FS reports 11 of the 12 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and 10 of
13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers on a regular monthly basis.

Statement by Maria Angelica Arbelaez, Alternate Executive Director for Colombia
May 18, 2015

The Colombian authorities are grateful to the mission team for the constructive and fruitful
discussions held in Bogota. They broadly agree with the staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations.
Economic outlook
The Colombian economy has continued to show resilience while reducing unemployment
with a 4.6 percent growth in 2014. However, the recent deterioration of the terms of trade
stemming mainly from the collapse in oil prices, coupled with low growth in Europe and
deceleration in China as well as in other Colombian trade partners in Latin America, has
changed the economic outlook. Growth is projected to slow down to around 3.5 percent in
2015 and start to recover in 2016 to converge in the next years to a long-term growth of
around 4.5 percent.
The authorities expect that part of the decline in oil prices is of a permanent nature that will
negatively impact national income. In this scenario, the economy needs to adjust to a new
reality in the coming years, and lower domestic absorption may be foreseen. Recent data
show a deceleration in consumption and investment in some natural resource sectors and
lower proceeds from commodity exports.
However, some factors may compensate for the economic decline: the reduction in poverty
and the strength and formalization observed in the labor market can mitigate the slowdown in
consumption; investment in public works and construction is expected to remain strong; and
depreciation will gradually bolster non-traditional exports and curve imports. In addition, the
ambitious package of infrastructure projects (4G) whose construction begins in 2016 is
estimated to support growth and to add around 0.7 percentage points to the potential output,
and the re-entrance into operation of the Cartagena oil refinery late this year will also bolster
manufacturing performance.
The authorities acknowledge that the room for countercyclical policies to offset growth
slowdown may be limited: fiscal space is restricted by the fiscal rule, and the scope for
supportive monetary policy depends on the magnitude of the slowdown, inflation
expectations and the degree of the pass-through of depreciation to inflation. In this context,
the authorities are focusing their efforts on moving ahead with structural reforms to boost
non-traditional tradable sectors and help them make the most use of the recovery in the US
and of free trade agreements recently signed by Colombia.
The authorities agree with staff that risks threaten on the downside. The main hazards stem
from instability and higher volatility in global financial markets associated with monetary

2
policy normalization in the US and intensification of sovereign distress in the Euro Area,
rising vulnerabilities in emerging markets, and lower growth in Europe, China and important
Colombian trading partners. In addition, a further decline in oil prices would have a
pronounced impact on investment and growth. To face global financial risks, the authorities
are committed to maintaining good macroeconomic policies and strong fundamentals,
floating exchange rate, keeping an adequate level of international reserves and closely
monitoring banks, corporate and households’ balance sheets.
Fiscal policy
The fiscal stance embedded in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework is well-anchored by the
fiscal rule. According to new data released by the Ministry of Finance on May 19th, the
Central Government posted a structural deficit of 2.30 percent of GDP, smaller to the 2.32
percent recorded in 2013, and a headline deficit of 2.43 percent, similar to that of 2013
(2.36%). The Combined Public Sector reached a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP due to a
reduction in the surplus of sub-national governments resulting from the political cycle and
higher investment. For 2015 the situation is more challenging, as oil-related revenues are
expected to drop and debt service to increase as a result of the exchange rate depreciation.
Owing to the smoothing of the mining and economic cycles, the fiscal rule allows this year
for a higher total deficit. The rest of the adjustment will come from increasing revenues from
the tax reform approved in December 2014, and a budget cut, although protecting social
spending.
Under the new normal of oil prices, the government is fully aware that further revenue
mobilization will be needed in the years to come in order to comply with the fiscal rule.
Indeed, it commissioned a group of independent experts to design a comprehensive tax
reform, which counts on the advice of multilateral organizations, such as the IMF and
OECD. Among others topics, the group will focus on tax administration, VAT, personal
income taxes, non-profit organization taxes and tax simplification. The final blueprint has to
be submitted to the government by the end of October 2015, but proposals on specific areas
will be delivered before that deadline in order to have time to go through Congress, if
necessary.
Complying with the fiscal rule is a priority for the authorities, even in the midst of less
favorable conditions. They are convinced on the virtual cycle of fiscal discipline: lower fiscal
deficit leads to higher confidence, lower interest rates, more investment, stronger economic
growth and higher tax revenues. Fiscal consolidation is also necessary to strengthen the
current account balance over the medium term.

Monetary Policy and External Position
Inflation targeting serves the economy well and inflation expectations are firmly anchored. In
2014 inflation was 3.6 percent and it is expected to finish this year in the upper part of the
target range of 2-4 percent. Headline inflation went up due to agricultural supply shocks and
some pass-through effect from depreciation, but it is projected to abate by the end of the year.
Core inflation measures are within the target range. The monetary policy stance has remained
supportive in the context of an economy expected to slowdown starting from near full
utilization of productive capacity. Looking ahead, the room for monetary easing will depend
on whether the expected slowdown exceeds or falls short of the adjustment required to ensure
the nominal and financial stability of the economy, on the extent to which inflation
expectations remain anchored to target and on the size of the pass-through effect. Fueled by
capital flows, the central bank (Banco de la República) continued to build up international
reserves in 2014 and stopped its program of FX purchases by the end of that year, as reserve
buffers became broadly adequate for normal times and most indicators were close to precrisis levels.
Exchange rate flexibility has been the main shock absorber and the peso depreciated quickly
and strongly, although it is broadly aligned with fundamentals. The current account deficit
widened last year to 5.2 percent of GDP, and is expected to narrow gradually in dollar terms
as domestic absorption adjusts and expenditure switching effects kick in. As a percentage of
GDP the deficit will remain close to 5 percent due to the impact of the real depreciation of
the COP on the dollar valuation of GDP. The reduction in dollar terms of the current account
deficit will be mirrored by declines in FDI and portfolio inflows. The decrease in FDI will be
especially felt in the oil and mining sectors. The reduction in portfolio investment will occur
after an atypical year in 2014, when the increase of the weight of Colombian local public
bonds in Emerging Economy benchmark indices induced record inflows of this kind.
Financial sector
The financial sector is sound, profitable and well provisioned and capitalized. As mentioned
by staff, the authorities have been making significant progress in adopting the FSAP
recommendations. Given that 2015 will be marked by lower growth, depreciated exchange
rate and lower oil prices, the authorities are devoting their efforts to preventing negative
spillovers to the financial system both through adopting regulatory measures and
implementing a strict vigilance. As an example, following its mandate to monitor the
financial system's stability, the Financial Superintendency conducted stress tests on the loans
associated with the oil sector, which accounts for 1.9 percent of the total portfolio. The
results show that even under a downgrade in the rating scale of these loans (up to three
notches), the impact on the capital adequacy ratio of credit institutions is limited and would
not pose a significant threat to the vulnerability of the financial system. Risks to the financial

4
sector stemming from depreciation are also limited given low exposure to foreign currency
and mismatches, both in banks and corporate.
The Colombian authorities are committed to strengthening financial institutions capital and
moving forward with the adoption of best practices in line with Basel III and Pillar 2 of Basel
II. Nevertheless, it is important to analyze the regulatory framework in a comprehensive way.
There are some more conservative aspects of the Colombian regulation than the principles
proposed by the international standard setting bodies and some others in which regulatory
measures taken in the country already cover some of the aspects raised by international best
practices. Accordingly, the comparisons made among jurisdictions regarding solvency levels
should consider these characteristics.
Authorities continue to closely monitor financial stability risks. Data show that household
debt has increased in line with deeper financial inclusion, reaching historically high levels
(30 percent of disposable income) while the financial burden has also risen, but remains
below the level established by the IMF as risky. Corporate private debt is also manageable
(37 percent of GDP), with a low share of foreign currency denominated debt (11 percent of
GDP) and no evidence of large currency mismatches. The regulation of foreign currency in
banks’ balance sheets is strict, so their exposure and currency mismatches are contained.
Structural Reforms
A comprehensive development plan1 is being discussed by Congress outlining the social and
economic strategies, policies and targets for the next four years. It is founded on three pillars:
peace, equity and education which will be developed through, among others, the following
cross-cutting strategies: improving competitiveness and infrastructure, social mobility, and
rural transformation. On infrastructure, besides the 4G project, other measures are envisaged
to enhance urban transportation, broaden access to technologies of information and
communication and bolster social housing. On social mobility, actions are concentrated on
improving education, attention to early childhood, health care services delivery, and labor
market. In addition, important measures will be adopted and powers granted to the
government to reform the agricultural sector, redesign the institutionality and modify land
management. Finally, the plan also incorporates actions to boost competitiveness and reduce
informality.
Social progress
We welcome staff’s analyses on social aspects in the selected issues papers. Although there
is still much to be done, Colombia has made enormous progress on reducing poverty,

5
inequality and informality, as well as on boosting financial inclusion. Indeed, between 2010
and 2014 4, 4 million people were lifted out of poverty and 2.6 million out of extreme
poverty. The poverty rate declined from 37.2 percent to 28.5 percent in four years, and
extreme poverty from 12.3 percent to 8.1 percent. The government’s goals are to reach 25
percent of poverty and 6 percent of extreme poverty by 2018. Inequality has also decreased
although slowly. Colombia has put in place many measures to achieve more inclusive
growth, but time is needed to bear fruit. For example, a tax reform was undertaken in 2012
with the main objective of reducing inequality and generating formal employment. Increasing
education attainment and improving quality are also key priorities of the Development Plan.
Although it takes time to have an impact on inequality, better education, lower poverty,
higher formal employment and financial inclusion are powerful tools to tackle it. Indeed,
unemployment declined from 12 percent in 2010 to 9.1 percent in 2014, with the majority of
new employment being in the formal sector, as presented by staff.
