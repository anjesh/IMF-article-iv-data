IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Algeria
On May 16, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Algeria, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
The economic outlook has deteriorated since the 2014 Article IV consultation, with the fall in
oil prices increasing the urgency to reshape Algeria’s growth model. The impact of the oil
price shock on growth has been limited thus far, but the fiscal and external balances have
deteriorated significantly.
In 2015, real GDP grew by 3.9 percent and inflation increased to 4.8 percent. The fiscal
deficit doubled to 16 percent of GDP as a result of the decrease in hydrocarbon revenues, and
the fall in hydrocarbon exports by nearly half caused the current account deficit to widen
sharply. Reserves, while still substantial, declined by US$35 billion to US$143 billion, down
from a peak of US$192 billion in 2013. External debt remains very low.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV Consultation with Algeria, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal as follows:
Algeria’s economy is facing a severe and likely long-lasting external shock, calling for a
vigorous policy response built on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The collapse in
oil prices has exposed longstanding vulnerabilities in a state-led economy that is overly
dependent on hydrocarbons. Thus far, the impact of the oil price shock on growth has been
limited, but fiscal and external balances have deteriorated significantly. Thanks to buffers
accumulated in the past, Algeria has a window of opportunity to smooth the adjustment to the

shock and reshape its growth model. Restoring macroeconomic balances will require
sustained fiscal consolidation over the medium term combined with a critical mass of
structural reforms to diversify the economy, while exchange rate, monetary, and financial
policies should play a supporting role. Communication to build a consensus around the
needed reforms will be important to ensure their timely implementation.
Fiscal consolidation will need to be sustained over the medium term to restore fiscal
sustainability, ensure intergenerational equity, and support external stability. It will require
controlling current spending, pursuing further subsidy reform while protecting the poor,
mobilizing more nonhydrocarbon revenues, increasing the efficiency of investment, and
strengthening the budget framework. Rapidly declining fiscal savings mean that Algeria will
need to borrow more to finance future deficits. In addition to increasing domestic debt
issuance, the authorities should consider borrowing externally and opening the capital of
some state-owned enterprises, in a transparent way, to private participation.
Wide-ranging structural reforms are needed to help support economic activity during the
fiscal consolidation and to diversify the economy. Key reforms include improving the
business climate, opening up the economy to more trade and investment, improving access to
finance and developing capital markets, and strengthening governance, competition, and
transparency. Increasing the flexibility of labor markets while better matching the skills
produced by the educational system to those needed by the private sector is also needed.
Import restrictions, while perhaps providing a temporary relief, introduce distortions and
cannot substitute for reforms aimed at boosting exports. As structural reforms take time to
bear fruit, they should be started without delay.
Together with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, greater exchange rate flexibility
would support the adjustment to the oil price shock. Despite some depreciation in 2015, the
REER remains significantly overvalued. Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, together
with greater exchange rate flexibility, would help bring the REER in line with its equilibrium
value and contribute to the rebalancing of the economy.
Monetary policy must adjust to a changing liquidity environment while guarding against
potential inflationary pressures. The BA is appropriately adjusting to a changing liquidity
environment by reactivating its lending instruments and strengthening its liquidity forecast
and management capacity. Going forward, it should carefully calibrate monetary policy to
guard against potential inflationary pressures.
Financial sector policies should be further strengthened to address growing financial stability
risks. The banking sector as a whole is well capitalized and profitable, but protracted low oil
prices increase financial stability risks. Moreover, the strong links between the financial,
hydrocarbon, and public sectors increase the vulnerability of banks to systemic risks and call
for preemptive actions. The authorities should continue their efforts to strengthen the

prudential framework, including by enhancing the role of macroprudential policy, and
improving crisis preparedness and management.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The oil price shock has hit Algeria’s economy hard and exposed the
longstanding vulnerabilities of a growth model dependent on hydrocarbon and public
spending. The fiscal position—already weakened by a ramp-up in spending in the wake
of the Arab Spring—has deteriorated further as oil revenues plummeted. Oncesubstantial fiscal savings have been nearly depleted to finance large budget deficits.
Following several years of comfortable surpluses, the current account balance has
swung sharply into deficit and official reserves, while still large, are diminishing. The
banking system as a whole appears healthy, but financial stability risks are increasing.
The policy response in 2015 was insufficient, but the 2016 budget calls for a sharp
reduction in spending, and the authorities have initiated some reforms, including a
much needed reform of the subsidy system.
Outlook and risks. The outlook will crucially depend on the appropriateness of the
policy response to the oil price shock. The impact on economic activity has been limited
thus far, with fiscal policy remaining expansionary through 2015, but growth is
expected to slow because of the needed fiscal consolidation. Medium-term financing
needs will remain large and require increased recourse to borrowing. External risks
remain important, and concerns about social stability, in a volatile regional context,
could slow the pace of reforms.
Policy recommendations. The magnitude and expected persistence of the oil price
shock require a vigorous policy response to restore macroeconomic balances and foster
sustainable growth and jobs creation. To ensure fiscal sustainability, address external
imbalances, and promote intergenerational equity, the government needs to achieve a
durable and ambitious fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Deep structural
reforms are necessary to offset the impact of fiscal consolidation on growth, improve
medium-term prospects, and facilitate a much-needed diversification to reduce the
dependence on oil. These efforts would help bring the real effective exchange rate in
line with fundamentals and should be accompanied by greater exchange rate flexibility,
a carefully calibrated monetary policy that guards against inflation, and policies to
mitigate risks in the banking system. Thanks to buffers accumulated in the past, Algeria
has a window of opportunity to smooth the adjustment to the oil price shock and
reshape its growth model. This opportunity needs to be seized swiftly to avoid a more
drastic adjustment down the road.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The collapse in oil prices points to the urgent need to reshape Algeria’s growth model.
Following a devastating civil war in the 1990s, Algeria experienced over a decade of relatively steady
growth and social stability. Thanks to rapidly increasing oil prices, it was able to accumulate large
fiscal savings and international reserves while paying off most of its debt. However, Algeria did not
take advantage of over a decade of high oil prices to overcome the structural shortcomings in its
growth model, as the economy remained overly dependent on hydrocarbons and public spending.
From 2002 (when oil prices started to rise) until 2014 (when they started to fall), hydrocarbons on
average accounted for 98 percent of exports, 69 percent of fiscal revenues, and 36 percent of GDP.
Government spending swelled as the authorities granted wage increases and provided employment,
social housing, and subsidies—most recently in the wake of the Arab Spring. Furthermore, the public
sector remains a dominant actor in the economy through many and often large public enterprises,
including in the energy and banking sectors. Indeed, public banks account for 87 percent of total
banking assets. With the fall in oil prices, Algeria needs to confront an old challenge with new
urgency: how to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons and find new sources of growth
that will create jobs for a youthful and fast-growing population.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
2.
Growth was sustained in 2015 while inflation picked up. After a decade of contraction,
hydrocarbon production increased slightly last year (0.4 percent), while nonhydrocarbon growth was
steady. Overall growth edged higher from 3.8 percent to 3.9 percent. Average inflation exceeded the
central objective of the Bank of Algeria (BA), likely driven by supply effects and the depreciation of
the dinar (Box 1). The unemployment rate increased from 10.6 percent in September 2014 to
11.2 percent in September 2015. It remains particularly high among the youth (29.9 percent) and
women (16.6 percent).
3.
The budget deficit reached a record high in 2015 due to the collapse in hydrocarbon
revenues and a significant fiscal expansion. The overall budget deficit reached an all-time high of
16.4 percent of GDP. Lower oil prices translated into a 30 percent decline in hydrocarbon revenues,
while spending grew by 10.2 percent, driven by a surge in capital spending. The deficit was mainly
financed by drawings from the Fonds de Régulation des Recettes (FRR), Algeria’s oil saving fund,
which declined to 12.3 percent of GDP from 25.6 percent in 2014.
4.
The current account deficit also widened significantly, but foreign reserves remained
at comfortable levels. The current account deficit widened to 16.2 percent of GDP in 2015 from
4.4 percent in 2014, as hydrocarbon exports fell almost by half. Gross inflows of foreign direct
investment remained weak at 1 percent of GDP. Foreign exchange reserves declined by nearly
US$35 billion but remain substantial, equal to 2½ years of imports or 833 percent of the Fund’s

metric to assess reserve adequacy (ARA metric). External debt stood at 1.8 percent of GDP at end2015.
5.
The real effective exchange rate depreciated but remains significantly overvalued.
Despite a 25 percent depreciation of the dinar against the dollar, the nominal effective exchange
rate depreciated by only 6.7 percent in 2015, owing to the depreciation of other trading partners'
currencies. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by 4.3 percent, as the nominal
depreciation was partly offset by an increase in Algeria's prices relative to those in its trading
partners. The REER remains significantly overvalued, hurting Algeria's competitiveness (Annex III).
6.
Broad money growth slowed, driven by a decline in net foreign assets. Credit to the
economy expanded by 16.1 percent in 2015. However, broad money growth slowed sharply to
0.5 percent from 14.4 percent in 2014, largely due to the decline in net foreign assets, and despite
liquidity injections resulting from the government’s drawdown of the FRR to finance the fiscal deficit.
Bank deposits declined, partly due to the government’s purchase of a majority stake in a major
telecom company.
7.
On aggregate, the banking sector remained well capitalized and profitable, but
liquidity tightened. According to preliminary figures, the overall capital-adequacy ratio was
17 percent at end-2015 compared to 16 percent in 2014. Bank profitability improved in 2015, with
an aggregate return on assets of 2.2 percent. The ratio of gross non-performing loans (NPL) to total
loans, which had been on a declining trend thanks in part to growth in credit, edged higher to
around 9.5 percent at end-2015. However, the net NPL ratio was 3.6 percent owing to high
provisioning levels (around 61 percent on aggregate). Liquidity in the banking system contracted
sharply due to the impact of lower oil prices on bank deposits and to rapid growth in credit to the
public sector (partly used to finance imports). On aggregate, 27 percent of bank assets were liquid at
end-2015 (compared to 38 percent at end-2014), sufficient to cover almost two-thirds of their shortterm liabilities.
8.
A new constitution includes provisions to foster greater transparency, better
governance, and a more market-based economy. The new constitution, adopted in February
2016, makes a number of changes aimed at strengthening democracy and promoting a more
market-based economy. Achieving a diversified economy and fighting corruption become explicit
objectives. Freedom of trade and investment is recognized, and the government is to “strive to
improve the business climate.” Monopolies and unfair competition are prohibited. On the political
side, the constitution re-introduces two-term limits on the presidency (lifted in 2008).

Box 1. Algeria: Inflation Developments in 2015
Headline inflation stood at 4.8 percent on average at end-2015. Year-on-year inflation accelerated in the
second quarter, largely driven by higher food prices (including regulated food prices) and products with
high import content. However, during the second half of the year, year-on-year food inflation was more
volatile and slowed sharply toward the end of the year, while year-on-year imported goods inflation
accelerated. Overall, the effects of the depreciation of the dinar on imported prices, likely combined with
some market failure effects (related to inadequate market infrastructure and the presence of oligopolies),
kept average headline inflation above the central bank’s 4 percent central target.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Hydrocarbon growth is expected to increase in 2016, but fiscal consolidation will
weigh on nonhydrocarbon growth. Hydrocarbon growth is expected to accelerate to close to
2 percent as new fields come on stream and a key gas facility that closed after a terrorist attack in
2013 resumes full production. However, fiscal consolidation should weigh on nonhydrocarbon
growth, which is expected to slow to 3.7 percent. Headline inflation will likely remain higher than
4 percent, driven by further dinar depreciation and increases in administered energy prices. The
spending cut envisaged in the 2016 budget, combined with higher tax revenues, is projected to
reduce the nonhydrocarbon deficit to 29.9 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP from 37.8 percent in
2015. The current account deficit should widen further as oil prices continue to fall, and reserves are
projected to fall to 712 percent of the ARA metric. Broad money growth should remain low due to a
continued decline in net foreign assets compensated in part by increased domestic debt issuance by
the government.
10.
Beyond 2016, the outlook hinges on the strength of the policy response to the oil
price shock. Over the medium term, Algeria's macroeconomic prospects will depend on the size
and pace of fiscal consolidation, the extent of structural reforms, and the appropriateness of other
policies. Staff developed three scenarios to illustrate the possible outcomes under different policy
responses and highlight the policy trade-offs at play (Annex I). All scenarios factor the fiscal
adjustment embedded in the 2016 budget.


The baseline scenario represents the minimum effort necessary to preserve macroeconomic
stability over the medium term (Tables 1-4). It assumes a gradual fiscal adjustment beyond 2016,
some structural reforms, and some further real exchange rate depreciation. Under this scenario,
the nonhydrocarbon deficit is projected to decline to 22.3 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in
2021. Nonhydrocarbon growth initially slows under the effects of fiscal consolidation but
eventually accelerates as structural reforms start bearing fruit. Debt increases rapidly given large
financing needs and limited remaining savings in the FRR. The current account deficit narrows as
oil prices recover (as in all scenarios) and fiscal consolidation dampens import demand. Foreign
exchange reserves continue to fall but remain at comfortable levels.



A more ambitious reform scenario would further reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities and
increase growth potential. This scenario assumes greater fiscal consolidation through greater
efforts to contain the wage bill, more efficient public investment and deeper subsidy reform,
a more significant mass of structural reforms, and larger real exchange rate depreciation. This
stronger policy package leads to lower debt accumulation, higher reserves, and, ultimately,
faster growth.



By contrast, under an illustrative no-policy-change scenario, the fiscal and external positions would
quickly deteriorate. Significant government borrowing would lead to rapidly increasing debt
levels and crowd out private investment, contributing to slower nonhydrocarbon growth and
continued high unemployment.

Risks are tilted to the downside (Box 2). A further prolonged decline in oil prices (which
could result from lower-than-expected global growth) would worsen economic imbalances and
increase financial strains. Algeria, however, is insulated from world financial market turbulence given
existing capital account restrictions. Domestically, difficulties garnering a political and social
consensus, particularly in a volatile regional context, could complicate the implementation of
necessary reforms and ultimately lead to a more abrupt adjustment.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability
between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
The discussion focused on the policy response to the oil price shock, given short and
medium-term objectives. Addressing the large external shock will involve difficult choices. On the
one hand, the authorities must restore fiscal sustainability, reduce external vulnerabilities, contain
inflation, and preserve financial stability. On the other hand, they need to reduce the economy’s
dependence on oil, boost medium-term growth potential and create jobs, and maintain social
stability and cohesiveness. The consultation explored the policy choices that these multiple
objectives involve, in a difficult external environment.1
13.
The mission argued that the magnitude and durability of the external shock call for a
vigorous policy response built on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Algeria, whose
fiscal policy was already unsustainable when oil prices were high, needs to undertake ambitious and
sustained consolidation combined with a critical mass of structural reforms to diversify its economy
and promote private sector-led growth and job creation. Greater exchange rate flexibility should
support these efforts, while monetary policy should guard against inflationary pressures and
financial policies need to address rising risks in the financial sector. Existing buffers allow for an
orderly adjustment, but action should start now on many fronts, as reforms will take time to bear
fruit while buffers will continue to erode. The authorities agreed with the broad strategy laid out by
the mission but occasionally differed on its specific translation into concrete actions. They are also
concerned about how fast the adjustment can be implemented. Staff remains ready to support the
authorities’ efforts though close dialogue on policy options and technical assistance.

The 2016 budget is ambitious
and should be followed by sustained
consolidation efforts over the medium
term. The 2016 budget marks an
important step toward fiscal consolidation.
Staff stressed that additional consolidation
efforts will be needed over many years to
ensure medium-term debt sustainability
and help support the external rebalancing
(Annex II).2 Since fiscal consolidation will
unavoidably have a negative impact on
growth, it should rely primarily on fiscal

While the consolidation assumed in the baseline scenario would ensure debt sustainability, it would not be enough
to ensure intergenerational equity. The permanent income hypothesis (PIH) rule suggests that a nonhydrocarbon
primary deficit equal to 5.6 percent on a permanent basis would ensure adequate savings for future generations.

levers that have the smallest multipliers and be accompanied by ambitious structural reforms. It
should also be implemented as part of a clear medium-term strategy that establishes the
appropriate pace of consolidation toward a well-defined medium-term objective taking into
consideration the time necessary to implement various reforms. The more-wide ranging the
structural reforms are, the more ambitious the fiscal objective can be (as illustrated in staff’s
ambitious scenario). At a minimum, to ensure medium-term stability, the authorities should consider
a fiscal consolidation path in line with staff’s baseline scenario. The authorities agreed that further
fiscal consolidation was necessary beyond 2016 while stressing the importance of mitigating the
impact on growth and employment.

amount. In addition to their fiscal cost, subsidies
are mostly regressive. For example, households in

more on subsidized fuel products than households in the poorest quintile. Subsidies have also led to
increased domestic energy consumption, squeezing exports. The increase in fuel and electricity taxes
contained in the 2016 budget is an important first step toward subsidy reform, but much more
needs to be done.5 Staff urged the authorities to pursue comprehensive subsidy reform over time,
starting with the most regressive and expensive subsidies. Subsidy reform should entail raising
energy prices further, adopting a rule-based mechanism for setting energy prices, and gradually
removing other subsidies. Concurrently, the government should put in place a well-targeted cash
transfer program for the poor, building on existing infrastructure. The authorities agreed with the
need to deepen subsidy reform and are considering options to both phase out subsidies and
introduce a cash transfer system.
Box 3. Algeria: Main Recommendations on Subsidy Reform

Carefully prepare the reform and implement it gradually. Both explicit and implicit subsidies
should be gradually phased out. Price increases should be spread over time. A well-prepared reform
increases the chances of success.

Put in place a targeted cash transfer program. The government should gradually move from the
current system of subsidies on goods and services to a program of targeted cash transfers to low-income
households.

Explain the reform. Well-designed communication is essential to generate broad support for the
reform. It should explain the cost of subsidies (including the distortions they create), who benefits from
them, and how the public stands to gain from subsidy reform.

Start with the costliest and most regressive subsidies. In light of their large fiscal cost, regressive
nature, and negative externalities, energy subsidies should be first in line for reform (with the exception of
butane, which is important in the consumption basket of poor households).

Adopt a depoliticized and rules-based mechanism for setting prices. An automatic pricing
mechanism, especially when communicated clearly to the public, can reduce the chances of reform reversal
by distancing the government from pricing decisions, and would also help cap the cost of the subsidy.

17.
With hydrocarbon revenues significantly reduced, Algeria needs to mobilize more
nonhydrocarbon revenues. To raise more nonhydrocarbon revenues, tax exemptions (e.g., on VAT)
should be significantly reduced, excise taxes increased, and property taxes overhauled. These
measures would also help level the playing field among enterprises. It is also critical to improve tax
administration, in particular tax enforcement. To bring the informal sector into the formal economy,
the authorities should avoid offering tax amnesties and instead pursue other well-established
measures in this area.6 The authorities indicated that they are focused on improving tax
enforcement, including with respect to arrears. They have also launched a welcome cost-benefit
analysis of tax expenditures.

The increase in fuel taxes has resulted in retail price increases in the range of 34 to 37 percent, but prices remain
very low (e.g., unleaded gasoline went from US$0.21 to US$0.29 per liter).

18.
Public investment spending should be strategically curtailed and its efficiency
substantially improved. Capital spending averaged 15 percent of GDP over the last decade—
higher than the averages in the region and in emerging market and developing countries. At the
same time, Algeria’s investment efficiency is weak compared to other oil exporters in the region and
well below the global average, implying that the adverse impact of investment cuts on growth could
be modest initially if implemented strategically.7 Given that the multiplier effect will increase over
time as the least productive projects are eliminated, the government should strengthen investment
efficiency by improving the selection, implementation, and ex-post assessment of investment
projects. Better governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) would also improve investment
efficiency while reducing the need for episodic fiscal bailouts. The authorities acknowledged that
public investment spending had grown beyond Algeria’s absorptive capacity and needed to be
rationalized.
19.
To meet large financing needs over the medium term, Algeria will need to borrow
more. Fiscal savings in the oil savings fund will likely be depleted this year, requiring more
government borrowing to finance budget deficits over the medium term. An increase in government
domestic debt issuance is also needed to help develop nascent monetary and capital markets. In a
context of tightening liquidity conditions, interest rates on government debt will likely increase.
Given very low external debt, the authorities could also consider borrowing externally (on
international capital markets or from bilateral or multilateral creditors) to mitigate crowding out
effects of domestic borrowing and reduce pressure on international reserves. Furthermore, the
mission encouraged the authorities to open the capital of some SOEs to private participation, in a
transparent way, not only to help meet financing needs but also to improve their governance. The
authorities indicated a willingness to consider borrowing externally from bilateral or multilateral
sources, but they are not considering borrowing on international capital markets at this time. In April
2016, they issued a domestic bond aimed at mobilizing savings in the informal sector. They consider
partial or total privatization of some SOEs to be an option but not a short-term priority.
20.
Broad public financial management (PFM) reforms are needed to support fiscal
consolidation and improve governance. The mission supports the authorities’ efforts to adopt a
medium-term budget framework and performance-based budgeting. The ongoing revision of the
organic budget law could support these efforts, notably by including a fiscal rule that would help
insulate fiscal policy from oil price volatility. The mission also recommended improving expenditure
and revenue forecasting and the capacity to control spending, including by putting in place an
integrated financial management information system. The authorities agreed with the need for PFM
reforms and welcomed further technical assistance in this area. They are considering introducing a
rule in the organic budget law that would tie current spending to nonhydrocarbon revenues.

B. Promoting Diversification and Private Sector-led Growth
21.
An ambitious structural reform agenda is needed to diversify the economy, increase
potential growth, and create jobs.8 Algeria’s state-led economic model is characterized by a large
share of economic activity conducted by the public sector and based directly or indirectly on
hydrocarbons. Pervasive bureaucracy and cumbersome administrative procedures hinder private
sector activity. To adapt to a world of lower oil prices, the state will need to retrench and allow the
private sector to take the lead. A critical mass of structural reforms is needed to unleash the
potential of the private sector and should be implemented urgently, as reforms will take time to
bear fruit. The authorities agreed with the need to change Algeria’s economic model, but they
continue to see a large role for the state in directing the economy.

22.
Algeria should continue its efforts to improve the business environment. Recent efforts
in this area—for instance to facilitate the creation of enterprises and the granting of building
permits—go in the right direction. However, they have yet to translate into improved rankings in
international surveys. Indeed, Algeria's 2016 Doing Business ranking slipped two places to 163rd out
of 189 economies. Staff urged the authorities to continue streamlining administrative procedures
related to starting a business, trading across borders, and registering property. The authorities
stressed that improving the business environment required considerable coordination among
agencies and therefore would take time. They nevertheless reiterated their commitment to pursue
reforms, noting that a provision in the new constitution explicitly commits the government to
improving the business environment.

To promote greater economic diversification, the government should open the
economy to more trade and foreign investment. Trade openness would support diversification
through lower costs of inputs, technological transfers, and increased competition. Staff stressed that
import restrictions, which the authorities have tightened in an effort to contain imports, should not
be the response to the terms-of-trade shock, as they introduce distortions and rent-seeking
opportunities, are likely to drive more activity underground, and may create inflationary pressures.9
The authorities are currently overhauling the investment code. As a priority, staff urged them to
seize the opportunity offered by this revision to eliminate or relax the requirement of a minimum
51 percent Algerian ownership in foreign investments (“51/49 rule”), which remains a major obstacle
to foreign investment. Staff also reiterated its call for Algeria to pursue WTO accession, which has
languished for decades.

24.
Improving governance, transparency, and competition are also needed. According to
the World Bank, Algeria ranks behind regional peers and emerging market countries in terms of
governance. Other surveys find that poor governance and corruption are significant obstacles to
doing business in Algeria, with negative implications for growth and job creation. Another feature of
the economy is a lack of competition in certain sectors. More competition would lead to better
functioning markets, where prices ensure the most efficient allocation of resources. Strengthening
anti-corruption efforts, including by mobilizing the AML/CFT framework, would also assist in
improving the business environment and social inclusion.

C. Implementing Supportive Exchange Rate, Monetary, and Financial
Policies
Exchange rate policy
27.
Fiscal and external sector adjustment should be supported by a further real
depreciation of the dinar. Various methodologies point to a substantial current account gap,
implying that the REER remains significantly overvalued (Annex III). Most of the adjustment should
come from fiscal policy and structural reforms. Greater exchange rate flexibility would also help
eliminate this overvaluation and rebalance the economy over the medium term, but cannot be the

primary lever, considering the insufficient diversification of the economy (and therefore the limited
short-term potential for nonhydrocarbon exports) and the possible inflationary impact of further
nominal exchange rate depreciation. The authorities agreed that the dinar remains overvalued and
that fiscal policy should play a major role in reducing the overvaluation.
28.
Measures are needed to deepen and unify the foreign exchange market. Staff called on
the BA to take action to eliminate the premium in the illegal parallel foreign exchange market, which
reportedly stands at around 50 percent. As a first step, the indicative foreign exchange ceiling for
individuals should be raised to more realistic levels and related exchange procedures simplified. The
relaxation of the 51/49 rule would also contribute to the supply of foreign exchange. In the longer
term, it will be important to further diversify the supply of foreign exchange as part of a gradual and
properly sequenced plan to develop foreign exchange markets. The plan would include lifting some
capital account restrictions as well as relaxing repatriation and surrender obligations of
nonhydrocarbon export receipts and the de facto high reserve requirement rate on foreign currency
deposits. The authorities did not see an urgent need to relax foreign exchange controls, but they
recently announced their intention to increase the indicative foreign exchange ceiling for individuals.

Monetary policy
29.
Banque d'Algérie (BA) is adjusting to a changing liquidity environment. As a result of
the collapse in oil prices, Algeria is transitioning from a long period of structural excess liquidity to a
situation of structural refinancing needs. This offers the BA an opportunity to reestablish control
over domestic liquidity conditions and short-term interest rates, which would strengthen monetary
policy transmission mechanisms. The BA is preparing to reintroduce its refinancing instruments and
is working to strengthen its liquidity forecast and management capacity, in coordination with the
Treasury. Staff recommended that the BA continue to absorb excess liquidity using its term deposits
until neutral or quasi-neutral liquidity conditions are achieved (i.e., no excess reserves or close to
banks' voluntary excess reserves). The BA should also reactivate the overnight lending facility in
order to establish a ceiling on the (short-term) interest rate corridor. Thereafter, the BA should
introduce open-market refinancing operations to signal its policy stance and take steps to
encourage the development of the interbank repo market. The government can help by issuing
more debt securities on a regular and predictable basis. The BA is continuing to absorb excess
liquidity in the banking system, taking into account the government’s debt issuance plans, and
welcomed further technical assistance to help them manage the transition to the new liquidity
environment.
30.
The BA should carefully calibrate monetary policy to guard against potential
inflationary pressures. Despite the anticipated fiscal consolidation, several factors could push
inflation higher, including further dinar depreciation, the increase in subsidized prices, the impact of
import restrictions, and the recent lifting of the ban on consumer credit. Because of these
uncertainties, staff recommended that the BA maintain the existing interest rate corridor, rather than
change existing rates, which may prematurely signal a shift in policy stance. In practice, as liquidity
conditions normalize and banks turn to the BA or to other banks to meet their liquidity needs,
funding costs will necessarily increase. The authorities agreed with the need to guard against
20

potential inflationary pressures and indicated that monetary policy would not be accommodative in
the short term.

Financial sector policy
31.
The impact of the oil price shock on banking system stability has been moderate so
far. At end-2015, the banking sector remained well capitalized, profitable, and with little maturity
mismatch. Supported by robust growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector and a high level of public
investment, the sector remained profitable while asset quality was broadly unchanged. Liquidity
buffers have declined markedly, reflecting rapid credit growth and, since 2014, the decline in oil
prices. Nonetheless, liquidity buffers at the system level remain high compared to other countries in
the region.10

Preliminary.

32.
However, protracted lower oil prices can negatively affect the banking system through
multiple channels.11 The banking system exhibits strong linkages with the hydrocarbon and public
sectors. Public banks, which represent the bulk of the system, channel most of their lending to the
public sector and rely heavily on oil-related public deposits. Private banks primarily focus on
corporate banking business (both credit and funding), which remains highly sensitive to changes in
hydrocarbon-driven fiscal spending. These linkages make the banking system vulnerable to oil price
fluctuations, which can induce sharp reversals in liquidity and credit conditions due to the
economy’s insufficient diversification and fiscal policy procyclicality.
33.
The slump in oil prices is expected to increase liquidity, interest rate, and credit risks.
In the short term, excess liquidity will give way to structural refinancing needs, triggering higher
funding costs in the banking system and reducing bank profitability. Over the medium term,
liquidity risks could increase quickly if fiscal consolidation is not sustained, in part because of the
high import content of capital expenditures and also because of increased debt issuance. By

For example, liquid assets represent 26.5 percent of total bank assets on average in the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries.

contrast, the fiscal consolidation needed to restore macroeconomic balances could result in a
slowdown of nonhydrocarbon activity and increase, possibly substantially, credit risks. The exchange
rate channel is muted, as banks can only have small open foreign exchange positions and their
foreign exchange funding source—nonhydrocarbon exports—is limited.
34.
Macro-financial linkages increase the vulnerability of the banking sector to systemic
risks. The large public banks, some of which are systemically important, are heavily reliant on public
deposits and highly involved in financing public enterprises. A weaker fiscal position could lead
public enterprises to increasingly draw down their deposits and take on long-term financing, putting
liquidity pressures on both sides of public banks' balance sheets, increasing competition among
banks for funding, and heightening systemic liquidity risks. In the event of a sharp slowdown of the
economy, large exposures to the same set of public enterprises could lead to synchronized
deterioration in bank asset quality. Furthermore, the expected return of banks to the interbank
market will strengthen their interconnectedness, possibly opening up new channels through which
potential problems in individual banks could spread to the system as a whole.
35.
The mission supported the recent improvements to regulatory and supervisory
frameworks, which strengthen the resilience of the banking sector. In 2014, the BA
strengthened its regulatory and supervisory frameworks in response to the 2013 FSAP
recommendations (Annex V). It introduced new regulations on capital adequacy related to pillar one
of Basel II and elements of Basel III, and tightened existing large exposure requirements.12 Although
the new Basel III net stable funding ratio (NSFR) has not yet been implemented, the BA introduced a
number of liquidity instruments to help reduce risk taking behaviors, including a minimum liquidity
ratio that requires banks to hold highly liquid assets to meet short-term obligations, and a limit to
the ratio of long-term liabilities to long-term assets. In addition, loan classification requirements
were strengthened to cover the treatment of overdraft and restructured loans. The BA continues
rolling out its CAMELS-based bank risk rating methodology to cover all banks, and new and
improved offsite prudential indicators have been introduced. The mission also welcomed the
ongoing bank stress tests and crisis simulation exercise conducted by the BA.
36.
The mission encouraged the BA to continue its efforts to strengthen the prudential
framework. Further efforts are needed to improve the surveillance of the build-up of risks in
individual banks and in the system as a whole. Currently, important data gaps limit the BA’s ability to
monitor systemic risks, in particular with respect to common exposures and corporate and
household leverage. The BA should also pursue its efforts to strengthen liquidity forecasting
capabilities and conduct more frequent liquidity and solvency stress testing of the banking sector.
Loan classification rules should be further tightened and existing regulations should be amended to

12

The new regulations increased minimum capital adequacy requirements (from 8 percent to 9.5 percent, including a
capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent). They also tightened prudential limits on large exposures, reducing both
the threshold of the aggregate large exposure limit to 8 (from 10) times the regulatory capital, and the threshold of
individual exposures to be included in the aggregate limit to 10 (from 15) percent of regulatory capital.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

include more detailed governance requirements for public banks.13 The BA should strengthen its
macroprudential framework, including by better defining the objectives of the financial stability
committee, implementing a framework for systemic risk analysis, and improving data quality.14 The
BA should also implement a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit to address the buildup of
systemic risks. Time-varying reserve requirements and dynamic provisioning could be envisaged.
The authorities agreed with staff’s recommendations and are seeking further technical assistance to
implement them.
37.
The authorities should improve crisis preparedness and management. A well-defined
crisis resolution framework that provides a clear description of roles and responsibilities of the
different agencies is lacking, and the range of available bank resolution options is limited to the
liquidation of insolvent banks under the general insolvency regime. An explicit framework for bank
resolution should be prepared while the insolvency framework should be strengthened. The
authorities agreed with staff’s recommendations but noted that implementation would take time
given the need to coordinate with many stakeholders.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Algeria’s economy is facing a severe and likely long-lasting external shock, calling for
a vigorous policy response built on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The collapse in
oil prices has exposed longstanding vulnerabilities in a state-led economy that is overly dependent
on hydrocarbons. Thus far, the impact of the oil price shock on growth has been limited, but fiscal
and external balances have deteriorated significantly. Thanks to buffers accumulated in the past,
Algeria has a window of opportunity to smooth the adjustment to the shock and reshape its growth
model. Restoring macroeconomic balances will require sustained fiscal consolidation over the
medium term combined with a critical mass of structural reforms to diversify the economy, while
exchange rate, monetary, and financial policies should play a supporting role. Communication to
build a consensus around the needed reforms will be important to ensure their timely
implementation.
39.
Fiscal consolidation will need to be sustained over the medium term to restore fiscal
sustainability, ensure intergenerational equity, and support external stability. It will require
controlling current spending, pursuing further subsidy reform while protecting the poor, mobilizing
more nonhydrocarbon revenues, increasing the efficiency of investment, and strengthening the
budget framework. Rapidly declining fiscal savings mean that Algeria will need to borrow more to
finance future deficits. In addition to increasing domestic debt issuance, the authorities should

A Financial Stability Committee (FSC) was created in 2009 and is responsible for macroprudential monitoring and
implementation. However, due to the lack of an effective operational structure and formalized objectives, the FSC has
not monitored systemic risks on a regular basis and has not put in place a macroprudential policy framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

ALGERIA

consider borrowing externally and opening the capital of some state-owned enterprises, in a
transparent way, to private participation.
40.
Wide-ranging structural reforms are needed to help support economic activity during
the fiscal consolidation and to diversify the economy. Key reforms include improving the
business climate, opening up the economy to more trade and investment, improving access to
finance and developing capital markets, and strengthening governance, competition, and
transparency. Increasing the flexibility of labor markets while better matching the skills produced by
the educational system to those needed by the private sector is also needed. Import restrictions,
while perhaps providing a temporary relief, introduce distortions and cannot substitute for reforms
aimed at boosting exports. As structural reforms take time to bear fruit, they should be started
without delay.
41.
Together with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, greater exchange rate
flexibility would support the adjustment to the oil price shock. Despite some depreciation in
2015, the REER remains significantly overvalued. Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms,
together with greater exchange rate flexibility, would help bring the REER in line with its equilibrium
value and contribute to the rebalancing of the economy.
42.
Monetary policy must adjust to a changing liquidity environment while guarding
against potential inflationary pressures. The BA is appropriately adjusting to a changing liquidity
environment by reactivating its lending instruments and strengthening its liquidity forecast and
management capacity. Going forward, it should carefully calibrate monetary policy to guard against
potential inflationary pressures.
43.
Financial sector policies should be further strengthened to address growing financial
stability risks. The banking sector as a whole is well capitalized and profitable, but protracted low
oil prices increase financial stability risks. Moreover, the strong links between the financial,
hydrocarbon, and public sectors increase the vulnerability of banks to systemic risks and call for
preemptive actions. The authorities should continue their efforts to strengthen the prudential
framework, including by enhancing the role of macroprudential policy, and improving crisis
preparedness and management.

A no-policy-change scenario that assumes no further fiscal consolidation beyond 2016 (i.e., the
nonhydrocarbon primary deficit is fixed at the projected 2016 level as a percent of

spending remains at the 2016 level as a percent of GDP. To meet growing financing needs, the
government begins to borrow on international capital markets.

ALGERIA

The no-policy-change scenario leads to a rapid deterioration of key economic indicators. Real
GDP growth is initially supported by continued expansive fiscal policy, but over the medium term
large deficits crowd out private sector credit and lead to a loss of confidence. High and persistent
fiscal deficits increase debt, which grows to 65 percent of GDP. Current account deficits widen over
the medium term, leading to a further depletion of foreign reserves.
In the ambitious scenario, sustained fiscal consolidation coupled with structural reforms helps
restore macroeconomic balances. Fiscal consolidation initially leads to slower growth compared to
the baseline and ambitious reform scenarios, but growth begins to accelerate in the outer years,
reflecting the impact of structural reforms. By 2021, the fiscal balance approaches equilibrium and
current account surpluses return. Reserves start to accumulate again in 2020.

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Algeria repaid most of its debt and accumulated
large fiscal savings, mainly thanks to rising oil prices. Since the crisis, debt levels have remained low,
but fiscal savings have been nearly depleted to finance consecutive fiscal deficits. The increase in public
spending in the wake of the Arab Spring and more recently the collapse in oil prices have exacerbated
the country’s fiscal position and prompted the government to begin undertaking fiscal consolidation in
2016. To meet large financing needs over the medium term, the government will need to increase
domestic debt issuance and likely resort to external financing. Under the baseline scenario that
assumes steady and sustained fiscal consolidation over the medium term, debt levels are projected to
remain at manageable levels. Stress tests, however, suggest that financing needs pose risks.
Fiscal savings have been nearly depleted, but debt remains low. In the decade leading up to the
global financial crisis, rising oil prices led to surging hydrocarbon revenues. Part of this hydrocarbon
windfall was used to pay down external debt, which fell from over 60 percent of GDP in the 1990s to
less than 2 percent by 2007. Another part was saved in the Fonds de Régulation des Recettes (FRR),
Algeria’s oil savings fund. Since 2009, Algeria has recorded consecutive fiscal deficits due to
increased spending and slumping hydrocarbon production. Since 2014, deficits have been financed
essentially by drawing down savings, allowing debt levels to remain low. At end-2015, gross public
debt was equal to 9.0 percent of GDP. Savings in the FRR, however, declined from a peak of
43.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 12.3 percent.
External debt has continued to decline while domestic debt has started to increase. Algeria has
not borrowed externally since it received its last disbursement from the IMF in 1999. Remaining
external debt is mostly on concessional terms and owed to official bilateral creditors. At end-2015,
public external debt represented less than 1 percent of GDP. Domestic debt increased from
7.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 8.2 percent in 2015. Domestic debt consists of Treasury bills and
bonds, as well as debt purchased from state-owned enterprises. About half of outstanding Treasury
securities have maturities ranging from 5 to 15 years.
Algeria will need to borrow more to meet large financing needs and preserve some fiscal
savings. Despite the significant fiscal adjustment assumed in the baseline scenario, gross financing
needs are large. With savings in the FRR near the statutory floor of DA 740 billion, Algeria will need
to increase domestic debt issuance to meet its financing needs. Tighter liquidity conditions imply
that domestic borrowing costs will increase. The authorities have announced their intention to issue
a domestic bond aimed at mobilizing savings in the informal sector. They have also publicly
expressed a willingness to consider limited external borrowing to finance large infrastructure
projects. The baseline scenario assumes US$2-$4 billion per year in bilateral external borrowing
starting in 2016.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

ALGERIA

Debt levels are projected to remain manageable in the baseline scenario. The baseline scenario
assumes steady fiscal consolidation over the projection period, with the nonhydrocarbon deficit
declining from 37.8 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2015 to 22.3 percent in 2021. The largest
single-year adjustment occurs in 2016, in line with the budget. Thereafter, current spending falls
gradually (as a share of GDP), as the wage bill approaches pre-Arab Spring levels, capital spending
falls back to 2006 levels, and nonhydrocarbon revenues increase modestly on the assumption of
continued subsidy reform and improvements in tax administration. The government is also assumed
to benefit from a small rebound in hydrocarbon revenues due to further depreciation of the dinar
and a gradual recovery in oil prices. Nevertheless, gross financing needs are large, averaging
15.5 percent of GDP over the period. The government is assumed to draw from the FRR until savings
fall to the statutory floor of 740 billion in 2016; thereafter, financing needs are met by domestic and
external borrowing. In this scenario, the ratio of debt to GDP increases from 9.0 percent in 2015 to
43.3 percent in 2021.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that projected debt levels are resilient to
shocks, but gross financing needs pose risks. Assuming no change in the primary balance (i.e., no
fiscal adjustment) beginning in 2016, public debt would increase to 80 percent by 2021—much
higher than in the baseline scenario, but only somewhat above the 70 percent benchmark for
emerging market countries. However, gross financing needs, already projected to be large, are
sensitive to shocks, particularly to real interest rates and the primary balance. The authorities are
aware of the financing challenges ahead and are weighing their options. Two provisions in the 2016
budget suggest possible ways forward should the government have difficulty meeting its financing
needs. One provision gives the finance minister the power to cut spending via decree in order to
rectify budget imbalances; the other opens the door to selling shares in state-owned enterprises.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
The collapse in oil prices has substantially weakened Algeria’s external position. The current account
registered a deficit in 2014 for the first time since 1998, and large deficits are projected over the
medium term. Reserves remain comfortably above adequacy ratios but are declining rapidly. External
debt is low but is expected to increase as the government considers options for meeting its large fiscal
financing needs. External assessment methods point to a substantial current account gap, consistent
with the dinar remaining significantly overvalued despite some depreciation last year.
Algeria’s current account declined markedly in recent years with the plunge in international
oil prices. Hydrocarbon exports have halved since 2013, mostly reflecting a decline in oil prices.
Although nonhydrocarbon exports have slightly increased, their share in total exports remains
minimal. Over the medium term, imports are projected to decline somewhat, but nonhydrocarbon
exports are expected to remain weak. As a result, the current account deficit is projected to widen
from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 17.9 percent of GDP in 2016 before starting to narrow as
hydrocarbon exports eventually recover and fiscal consolidation compresses imports.
Algeria’s external buffers are still sizeable but are vulnerable to durably low oil prices.
Although international reserves stood at US$143 billion at end-2015, equivalent to 30 months of
imports and 113 percent of broad money, they fell by US$35 billion, or 19.6 percent, in 2015 alone.
At-end 2015, reserves stood at 833 percent of the IMF composite metric. Staff projects that Algeria’s
international reserves will fall to US$41 billion by 2021, or 210 percent of the ARA metric, on current
assumptions of oil prices remaining low. External debt stood at 3 percent of GDP at end 2015 but
the government is expected to increase its external borrowing to finance the deficit.

Despite rising relative prices, the REER

fell back to levels last seen in 2010-11

50 percent.
The real exchange rate assessment is based on two methodologies:


The EBA-lite’s current account (CA) model estimates the country’s current account norm based
on non-policy fundamentals, cyclical factors, and policy variables. The current account gap is
calculated as the difference between the calculated current account norm and the actual current
account. Assuming that the exchange rate is the only instrument to bring the actual current
account to its norm, the misalignment is derived using the current account elasticity.



The EBA-lite’s external sustainability (ES) model focuses on the relationship between the
sustainability of a country’s net external assets position, its current account, and the real
exchange rate. In this approach, assuming a benchmark for the net international investment
position (IIP), the model calculates the current account balance that would need to prevail over
the medium term.

Estimates based on the EBA-lite methodologies suggest that the current account balance
remains well below the norm for 2015, pointing to a significant overvaluation of the REER.


According to the CA approach, the current account is weaker than the value consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Depending on assumptions for desirable
policies, the current account norm ranges between -4.2 percent and -6.3 percent of GDP,
yielding respectively a current gap between -12.0 and -9.9 percent of GDP in 2015. The factors
that contribute the most to the gap are domestic demand and fiscal policy. Closing the current
account gap requires primarily pursuing fiscal consolidation and fostering export diversification
through structural reforms, while greater exchange rate flexibility would support these efforts.



The ES approach also suggests that the REER was significantly overvalued in 2015. Assuming the
IIP remains stable at its 2015 level of 80 percent of GDP, the current account norm would be
2 percent of GDP, implying a gap of -10.6 percent over the medium term. When the IIP is

stabilized at its projected level in 2021, i.e., 5.6 percent of GDP, the current account norm would
be -0.4 percent of GDP, yielding a smaller gap of -8.2 percent of GDP.
Under the assumptions underpinning staff’s baseline scenario, the above current account gaps
would correspond to a degree of REER overvaluation in the 60-80 percent range. However, these
estimates are subject to significant uncertainty as the magnitude and persistence of the termsof-trade shock make the results of standard methodologies unstable: minor changes in
underlying assumptions (e.g., regarding trade elasticities, desirable policies, or target IIP) lead to
significant variations in the degree of estimated overvaluation. Furthermore, the results should
not be interpreted as the needed nominal exchange rate adjustment to restore current account
balance. As noted above, the primary levers to bring the REER closer to fundamentals should be
fiscal consolidation and structural reforms while greater exchange rate flexibility can help
support these efforts.

and trajectory

Background: Hydrocarbon exports fell by nearly half in 2015, resulting in a widening of the
current account deficit to US$27.0 billion (16.2 percent of GDP) from US$9.4 billion in 2014
(4.4 percent of GDP). The deficit is expected to narrow over the medium term as a result of
policy action and some recovery in the oil prices.
Assessment: The EBA-lite CA model yields a current account gap of around 10-12 percent of
GDP at end-2015, while the ES approach suggests a current account gap between 4-6 percent
of GDP. Fiscal consolidation combined with structural reforms and further exchange rate
depreciation would help to close the gap.
Background: Banque d’Algérie targets the equilibrium value of the REER. The REER depreciated
for most of 2015 before strengthening somewhat at the end of the year.
Assessment: Despite the depreciation of the REER in 2015, the EBA CA and ES approaches
suggest that the REER remains significantly overvalued.
Capital flows are minimal due to multiple restrictions, including restrictions on external
financing. FDI is small and is concentrated in the hydrocarbon sector.
Background: Reserves peaked at US$192 billion in 2013. Since then, reserves have declined by
26 percent and stood at US$142.6 billion at end-2015, equal to 2½ years of imports.
Assessment: Despite their rapid decline, reserves remain more than adequate, equal to
833 percent of the IMF composite metric.
Background: Algeria’s NIIP at end-2015 was 79.6 percent of GDP. Liabilities are negligible
compared to assets, which are dominated by foreign reserves. Portfolio investments do not exist
as either assets or liabilities.
Assessment: Since the stock of debt and FDI is small, the NIIP trajectory is similar to the path of
foreign reserves. Under the baseline scenario that assumes some adjustment, the NIIP is
sustainable over the medium term.

Overall assessment:
Algeria’s external position
has weakened significantly
since the onset of the oil
price shock. A large current
account gap implies that
the REER is significantly
overvalued. Reserves remain
adequate but could be
depleted in the absence of
adjustment.

ALGERIA

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Potential policy responses:
Fiscal consolidation would
help to mitigate the impact
of the oil price shock on the
external position. Structural
reforms are needed to
foster export diversification
in the medium and longterm. Further exchange rate
flexibility would help to
reduce the current account
gap and bring the REER in
line with its equilibrium
value.

Annex IV. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Recommendations
The authorities generally agree with staff’s broad recommendations, but their views about
implementation have differed. Insufficient action was taken in 2015 in response to the oil price
shock, but the 2016 budget calls for significant fiscal consolidation, and the authorities have initiated
subsidy reform. The Banque d’Algérie has allowed the dinar to depreciate against the dollar, but the
real exchange rate remains overvalued. With technical assistance from the IMF, the authorities have
taken steps to improve tax administration, enhance the banking regulatory framework, and
strengthen liquidity management and forecasting. However, little progress was seen on structural
reforms that would increase economic openness and reduce the state’s control over the economy.
Implementation Status of the 2014 Article IV Recommendations
Recommendation

Implementation status

Consolidate macroeconomic and financial stability
Adopt a full-fledge fiscal rule

The authorities are preparing a new organic budget law that is
expected to include a fiscal rule.

Undertake fiscal consolidation

The authorities took little action to contain the fiscal deficit in 2015,
other than to freeze public sector hiring. The 2016 budget, however,
calls for a 9 percent nominal reduction in spending and a 4 percent
increase in tax revenues.

Gradually phase out subsidies and develop a
targeted cash-transfer system

The authorities have initiated subsidy reform by raising the prices of
fuel, electricity, and natural gas.

Avoid a deviation of the dinar from its equilibrium
value.

The real effective exchange rate depreciated somewhat in 2015 but
remains significantly overvalued.

Strengthen public financial management

The authorities are moving toward adopting a medium-term budget
framework and program budgeting.

Preserve the stability of the financial sector

The central bank is working on better aligning its regulatory and
supervisory framework with international standards and implementing
the 2013 FSAP recommendations, including expanding the credit
registry to include households.

Ensure external stability
Relax FDI restrictions

The 51/49 rule is being taken out of the investment code so it can be
more easily amended through budget laws in the future.

Remove trade restrictions

The authorities have tightened import restrictions.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
1.
From January 21, 1974 to October 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was determined
on the basis of a fixed relationship with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time to time. On
October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through daily fixing
sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by an interbank foreign
exchange market as of January 2, 1996. On April 15, 2016, the average of the buying and selling
rates for the U.S. dollar was US$ 1 = DZD 108.96, equivalent to SDR 1 = DZD 153.15. No margin
limits are imposed on the buying and selling exchange rates in the interbank foreign exchange
market, except for a margin of DA 0.015 between the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Algeria
for the dinar against the U.S. dollar.
2.
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating and the de facto exchange
regime is classified as other managed arrangement with no preannounced path for the exchange
rate. Algeria maintains an exchange system free from restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 1, 2014 (IMF
Country Report 14/341). The discussions for the 2016 Article IV consultation were held in Algiers
from March 1 to March 14, 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Following STA recommendations, the NSO compiles annual national accounts
(ANA) at prior year prices. The ANA broadly follow the 1993 SNA recommendations, but nonprofit
institutions serving households are not taken into account. The NSO started publishing quarterly
national accounts in 2015.
Price Statistics: Data are published with a delay of less than one month.
Government finance statistics: Key shortcomings include insufficient institutional coverage
(coverage is limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts), classification problems, long lags for
production of statistics, and lack of reconciliation of financing with the monetary accounts. Key
factors behind these weaknesses include the lack of financial resources allocated to the compilation
of statistics, insufficient interagency coordination, and concern about accuracy that give rise to
reluctance to publish provisional data.

Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics compiled by the authorities are largely in line with the
methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 and its companion Compilation
Guide, 2008. Timeliness of reporting by state-owned commercial banks has significantly improved;
consequently, data on depository corporations—as well as finance companies—are usually available
within a period of two to three months. Reporting formats (balance sheet and appendices) applied to
commercial banks and finance companies were updated in 2009 and the updated version was
enforced in 2010. All respondents now provide all requested data. Data on insurance corporations
are not yet collected, but the Banque d'Algérie, with the continuing support of the IMF Statistics
Department, launched a project to this end in 2009.

Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are generally of good quality. Estimates of
international investment position data are now available for 2011-2013 but have not yet been
compiled for more recent years.
II. Data Standards and Quality
