DISCUSSIONS

KEY POINTS
Backdrop. The economy has done well, driven by a strong labor market, solid
consumption, and a boost from a rising number of Mainland visitors. More recently,
growth has slowed, in large part a result of weakening external demand. Inflation has
risen during the course of this year (due to higher food and housing costs) but should
moderate going forward.
Risks and Spillovers. The principal near-term risks are from a global slowdown,
perhaps emanating from a worsening of the economic situation in Europe or a hard
landing in the Mainland. If realized, these would spill into Hong Kong SAR, hitting the
economy hard through both trade and financial channels.
Credit Growth. Lending by Hong Kong banks has risen rapidly in the past year
(particularly foreign currency lending to Mainland entities) outpacing the rate of
deposit growth. This combination has created strains on bank funding, although loanto-deposit ratios remain low by international standards.
Property Market. For the past two consultations, staff have warned of the prospects of
an asset bubble forming in Hong Kong SAR’s residential property market, creating the
potential for macroeconomic volatility. At this juncture, the outlook for the property
market is highly uncertain. A slowdown in the local property market is evident in the
data but many of the upward drivers to housing prices are still in place.
Renminbi Internationalization. Progress on increasing trade settlement and issuing
financial instruments denominated in renminbi has accelerated. This has benefited
Hong Kong SAR greatly but the expansion of the offshore renminbi market, along with
increased lending to the Mainland, is also increasing the linkages and potential
financial spillovers between Hong Kong SAR and the Mainland.

Box 1. Exchange Rate Assessment
While the ongoing structural changes in the Hong Kong economy makes it difficult to draw a
definitive conclusion on the presence of misalignment, the available empirical methodologies do not
indicate the current level of the Hong Kong dollar is out of line with medium-term fundamentals.
Econometric methodologies
As part of the exchange rate assessment, a
number of empirical methodologies were
employed. The mission used a Generalized
Method of Moments approach to estimate
panel regressions for six international financial
centers (Singapore, Hong Kong SAR,
Switzerland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and
Belgium) and for a broader panel including 55
developed and emerging economies. The
subsample of financial centers was included to
capture the particular structural features of
small international financial centers—serviceoriented economies, with generally high
savings rates, low dependency ratios, and
driven more by investments in human rather
than physical capital. In addition, the HKMA
provided their own assessment (based upon a
methodology adapted from the IMF’s CGER);
estimates were derived from SPR’s exchange
rate assessment toolkit, and the IMF Research
Department’s (RES) estimates are shown based
on the CGER methodology.



The macroeconomic balance approach.
Estimates of the equilibrium current
account for Hong Kong SAR generally
suggest the medium-term current account
should be in the 8–11 percent of GDP
range. RES, though, estimates a smaller
current account norm, which yields an
assessment that the currency is
undervalued by around 15 percent.



The equilibrium real exchange rate
approach. Estimates of the equilibrium real
exchange rate generally show the Hong
Kong dollar to be undervalued by between
5–16 percent.

Hong Kong SAR is ultimately funding Mainland projects.

Just under half of the loans for use in Hong Kong SAR are
allocated to the property sector, but that share has dropped
over the last 12 months.

A credit-asset price cycle? For the

last two consultations, staff have expressed
concern that a credit-asset price cycle could
take hold in Hong Kong SAR, with the
potential to create future macroeconomic
volatility. Since mid-2010 the credit cycle
has become increasingly evident with bank
lending taking off, particularly loans
denominated in foreign currency, fueled by
tighter credit conditions on the Mainland
(Figure 2). However, this was not the creditasset price cycle that staff had in mind.
Credit to purchases of private residential
property has actually grown much slower
than overall credit (16 percent in the
12 months to June) and, while property
prices have risen, it has not been fueled by
leverage. Instead, the bulk of the credit
growth over the past year has been much
more related to rising cross-border lending
to the Mainland rather than the usual
financial accelerator driving a creditproperty cycle. Market participants
indicated that a large part of foreign
currency credit classified as for use in Hong
Kong SAR was being lent to Mainland
subsidiaries that were resident in Hong
Kong SAR, but were using the resources for
projects on the Mainland. Indeed, the
ongoing expansion of credit to the Mainland
has actually been tightening domestic
financial conditions, leading to a rise in
interest rates charged on mortgage loans as
banks deploy their resources in other, more
highly remunerated, directions.

17.

Issues. The rapid pace of credit

growth raises two broad questions:
 Will the surge in credit lead to lower credit
quality and, potentially, higher problem
loans in the Hong Kong banks?
International experience would suggest
that such a rapid pace of credit growth
has the potential to lead to a worsening
of average credit quality once the
business cycle swings into reverse. The
authorities indicated that they were
aware of this risk and were ensuring that
the underwriting and credit standards of
the banks were being maintained. They
noted that a sizable fraction of the
foreign currency lending to Mainland
entities carried with it credit
enhancements in the form of either
guarantees by some of the largest
Mainland banks or collateral in the form
of deposits deposited at Mainland banks
(including the subsidiaries of the Hong
Kong bank that undertook the lending).
These credit enhancements had been
authorized by the Mainland foreign
exchange regulator (SAFE) but would still
have to be enforced in the Mainland’s
legal system. As a byproduct of these
credit enhancements, Hong Kong banks’
cross-border exposure to Mainland banks
has risen briskly. In addition, the
authorities highlighted their efforts to
raise the regulatory reserve ratio as a
means to enhance the countercyclical

 Is the expansion of credit consistent with
the underlying funding positions of the
local banks? The rise in lending is
creating strains on bank funding. Average
loan-to-deposit ratios in non-renminbi

than a year ago. This is still low by

Box 2. Assessing the Effectiveness of Macroprudential Policies
Macroprudential policies appear to increase bank capital buffers and enhance bank performance, reduce
transaction volumes, and can potentially lower property price growth. Land supply appears, however, not to have
an empirically significant effect over the short-term on the pace of property price appreciation.
Context. In recent times, a number of economies have
used macroprudential policies to protect their
financial systems from the ill effects of volatile
property prices, rapid portfolio adjustments, and
sudden surges in foreign capital. In Hong Kong SAR’s
case, faced with the onset of a credit-asset price cycle,
the authorities have introduced several changes to
long-standing loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-service
ratio (DSR) requirements as well as changing taxation
and land sales policies.
Assessing effectiveness. The analysis assesses the
impact of these policies against a number of different
indicators. It approaches the issue by looking both in
a cross-country context (using a panel data approach
estimated by Generalized Method of Moments to
control for endogeneity biases) and specifically for the
case of Hong Kong SAR (using a VAR approach). 1
Cross-country results.
 The use of LTV caps tends to have a decelerating
effect on property price growth.

tools can also be used to control credit
aggregates and affect property prices, making
these economies less reliant on macroprudential
instruments.
Results for Hong Kong SAR.



The design of LTV policies appear to be forward
looking, with ceilings tightened to counter
downward movements in mortgage interest
rates, growth in mortgage lending, and rising
volumes of transactions.



More binding LTV limits appear to reduce
transaction volumes in both the luxury segment
and mass market.



Over the short term, changes in LTV ratios do
not appear to significantly affect the rate of
residential property price inflation.



However, around two years after the change in
the LTV ratios, property price inflation appears to
fall affecting both the luxury and mass market in
a similar way.



Both LTV and DSR limits appear to slow the
growth of lending to the property sector.





LTV and DSR tools also serve to strengthen bank
capital buffers and improve bank performance (as
measured by the level of nonperforming loans
and return on assets).

Unlike in the broader cross-country sample, a
tightening of maximum LTV limits in Hong Kong
SAR appears to have little effect on total
mortgage lending.



Changes in government land supply tend to be
countercyclical, with more land provided at times
when the market is most exuberant. However,
there is little empirical evidence to suggest that
changes in government land sales affect either
prices or transaction volume growth over the
short term.



LTV and DSR instruments appear to be used more
frequently in those economies that have fixed
exchange rates. This may be because, in the
broader sample of economies, interest rate

Box 3. Longer-Run Determinants of House Prices 1
Econometric analysis finds that the rise in property prices can be well explained by economic growth, the
tight land supply, low interest rates and broader financial conditions. Land supply appears to be a key
long run driver of property prices but affects the market with long lags.

Context. Property prices have undergone a
dramatic price cycle over the past few years. A
co-integration framework was deployed to
examine the longer-term drivers of property
prices and whether current price levels are
consistent with these economic fundamentals.
Long-term drivers. The model performs well
in terms of tracking the behavior of property
prices over time.

The model finds that:


A one percent rise in real GDP per capita
increases real property prices by around
1½ percent.



A one percentage point fall in the real
interest rate adds around 1½ percent to
underlying prices.



Expanding land supply by one percent can
reduce property prices by around
¾ percent although the effect shows up
with significant lags.

1



Increases in construction costs are quickly
passed through to higher housing prices,
with an elasticity of around one-half.



Domestic credit also feeds through to
higher prices as would be expected from a
credit-asset cycle model. A 10 percent rise
in credit in real terms adds 2 percent to
real housing prices.

Short-term dynamics. In modeling the
shorter-term drivers of housing prices, it
appears that both loan-to-value ratios and
stamp duties have an effect. In particular,
model estimation finds a statistically significant
but rather temporary influence of both these
policy tools on prices. This is in contrast to the
findings of the VAR approach (discussed in
Box 2).
Interpretation. Overall, the recent rise in
property prices is well explained by economic
fundamentals and it does not appear that
current prices deviate materially from the longrun model. However, that does not mean the
market will stay at the current high levels. Real
interest rates are extraordinarily low from a
historical perspective and will, at some point,
move upwards. In addition, the greater land
supply should put downward pressure on
prices, albeit with a lag.

Paper (forthcoming).

Box 4. Key Developments in Renminbi Internationalization
Several significant steps have been taken to expand renminbi offshore intermediation and Hong
Kong SAR has emerged as the principal offshore center.




Deposits. Licensed banks in Hong Kong
SAR have offered renminbi deposits and
remittances since February 2004. Initially all
deposits had to be re-deposited with the
People’s Bank of China through the Hong
Kong clearing bank and the growth of
offshore deposits was relatively slow. Since
July 2010, corporates have been permitted
to open renminbi deposits for purposes
beyond trade settlement. As other offshore
renminbi products have developed
(including bonds, trade finance, CDs,
structured deposits, and investment funds),
renminbi deposits have grown rapidly and
currently stand at around 10 percent of
Hong Kong deposits. Corporate deposits
constitute around two-thirds of this stock,
reflecting the growing use of renminbi for
trade settlement purposes. Pricing of
deposit rates continues to be driven largely
by the PBC’s remuneration rate on
reserves.
Bonds. The issuance of offshore renminbi
bonds was initially confined to Mainland
policy and commercial banks, starting with
the China Development Bank listing in July
2007. Sovereign issuance has also been an
important driver of the market since
September 2009. The most recent Ministry
of Finance auction netted RMB 15 billion in
August at yields of 0.6 to 2.36 percent. A
range of corporate issuers has also tapped
renminbi funds in the offshore market,
including foreign companies such as
McDonald’s, Volkswagen and Caterpillar.
Bond issuance has more than doubled in
the year through September. There is,
however, limited secondary market activity
as most bonds are held to maturity.



Trade settlement. Renminbi trade
settlement was first introduced as a pilot in
June 2009 and extended to all Mainland
provinces in August 2011. The use of
renminbi for trade settlement purposes has
grown rapidly over the past twelve months,
reaching around 10 percent of China’s
overall trade. Data from the People’s Bank
of China suggests that trade settlement
activity continues to be more by renminbi
invoicing of Chinese imports than exports.



Other offshore renminbi products. The
steady expansion in the use of offshore
renminbi has enabled innovation in other
renminbi products including real estate
investment trusts.



Capital flows to the Mainland. In August
2010, the People’s Bank allowed (with a
quota) some offshore central banks,
clearing banks in Hong Kong SAR and
Macau SAR, and banks participating in
offshore renminbi business access to the
Mainland interbank bond market. Beyond
this, channels for reinvesting offshore
renminbi back to the Mainland were
relatively few. However, in August 2011, a
new pilot scheme was announced to allow
up to RMB 20 billion of portfolio flows into
the securities markets (through a renminbi
Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor
scheme) and, in October, rules were
published to allow overseas firms to invest
renminbi raised offshore in the Mainland
as foreign direct investment.

higher costs of both funding and credit.

drivers that have pushed the market up over
the past years remain in place. On the other
hand, mortgage rates are moving up, the
supply of land has been increasing, and
expectations of future price growth appear
to have softened. These countervailing
forces may be sufficient to cool down the
market but it is too early to declare victory.
As a result, future policies will need to

significant and immediate fiscal stimulus

consider extraordinary measures to support

ANNEX I. HONG KONG SAR—FUND RELATIONS
I.

Membership Status

As a Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR is
not a member of the Fund. However, annual
consultation discussions have been held with
the Hong Kong SAR authorities since
October 1990, and the staff also holds
discussions with the authorities in connection
with the Fund’ Global Financial Stability
reports. STA has provided Hong Kong SAR
with technical assistance in the area of balance
of payments statistics and Hong Kong SAR
officials have attended IMF Institute courses on
balance of payments and monetary statistics,
and financial programming.
II.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Hong Kong dollar has been linked to the
U.S. dollar under a currency board
arrangement since October 1983 at a rate of
HK$7.8/US$1. The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) refined the operations of the
LERS in May 2005—the first changes since
September 1998. For the first time since the
introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

explicitly committed to sell Hong Kong dollar
at a pre-announced price (set at HK$7.75/US$),
which is referred to as the strong-side
convertibility undertaking. Previously, the
HKMA had only committed to buy Hong Kong
dollar at a pre-announced rate (the weak-side
convertibility undertaking introduced in
October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong
dollar at any price. Along with this two-way
convertibility undertaking, the HKMA also
introduced a symmetric trading band of
0.6 percent around a central parity of
HK$7.8/US$. There are no restrictions on
current or capital account transactions in
Hong Kong SAR, and the Hong Kong dollar is
freely convertible. The People’s Republic of
China accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles
of Agreement on December 1, 1996.

Resident Representative

The Hong Kong SAR sub-office of the Beijing
Resident Representative’s office was opened
on September 23, 2000. Messrs. Sean Craig
and .Andre Meier are Resident
Representatives.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II. HONG KONG SAR—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance
purposes. Hong Kong SAR provides statistics
to the Fund on a timely basis for surveillance
and publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS). Hong Kong SAR subscribes to
the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard and is fully compliant with its
requirements.
Hong Kong SAR publishes comprehensive
balance of payments data and international
investment position statistics for 2000
onwards, and also publishes quarterly external
debt statistics according to the
recommendations given in the External Debt
Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.
Hong Kong SAR reports both cash and
accrual-based annual data for the general

government according to the Fund’s
Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 2001). No subannual data are provided
for publication in the IFS.
Hong Kong SAR participated in the IMF’s
Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and its FSI data
and metadata for 2005 have been posted on
the IMF website.
In late 2009, the HKMA began reporting
quarterly monetary data using Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs) that present data
consistent with the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual. However, the SRF data for
Hong Kong SAR have not been published in
IFS, which uses monthly data periodicity.

November 30, 2011
The information below, which has become available following the issuance of the staff
report, does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.

Recently published preliminary GDP data for the third quarter estimated growth to be
4.3 percent in real terms over a year earlier, moderating from the second quarter. The growth
moderation was largely due to a sharp

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
Discussions with People’s Republic of China—Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region
On November 30, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation discussions with Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR). 1
Background
Hong Kong SAR has rebounded from the global financial crisis and growth should be
5¾ percent this year. Unemployment has fallen to very low levels and real incomes have
grown, supporting consumption. However, external demand is weakening and the sequential
growth momentum is slowing. Inflation has risen during the course of this year. Going forward,
the slowing economy and waning food prices on the Mainland should take some of the
impetus out of inflation.
The fiscal surplus is likely to exceed this year’s ‒0.5 percent of GDP budget target by a wide
margin, mostly due to high collections of profit taxes and asset-related revenues (such as the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
land premium). Nevertheless, fiscal policy is still likely to exert a modest expansionary effect
on the economy due to higher public infrastructure investment, the continuation of various
temporary stimulus measures, and a one-time transfer of HK$6,000 to every adult permanent
resident.
Lending by Hong Kong banks has risen rapidly in the past year, particularly foreign currency
lending to Mainland entities. At the same time, banks’ net interest margins continue to fall due
to the highly competitive banking environment and rising funding costs. With loan growth
outpacing deposit growth, loan-to-deposit ratios have risen but remain well below international
levels.
The housing market has slowed. Mortgage rates are rising, land supply has been increasing,
and expectations of future price growth appear to have softened. Credit to property has also
grown at a slower rate than overall credit, and average loan-to-value ratio on new mortgage
loans have fallen.
Progress on increasing trade settlement and issuing financial instruments denominated in
renminbi has accelerated. Issuance of so-called “dim sum” bonds (traded in Hong Kong SAR
and denominated in renminbi) has reached RMB 200 billion; around 10 percent of Mainland
trade is now being settled in renminbi; and the renminbi now makes up 10 percent of Hong
Kong deposits.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that growth has rebounded thanks to the authorities’ policy
response, highly flexible labor and product markets, and favorable spillovers from Mainland
China. However, Directors considered that, with external demand weakening, the forward
economic momentum would moderate in the coming year as would underlying inflation,
although headline inflation would likely remain elevated from the delayed pass-through of
higher housing costs.
Directors agreed that, while the housing market appears to be cooling off, it is difficult to
assess whether this trend will continue. They commended the authorities’ measures to protect
the financial system from a property market reversal. Directors also welcomed efforts to lessen
the social burden of higher housing costs through wider availability of public rental housing and
targeted programs to increase home ownership within lower income groups.
Directors noted that bank lending has been growing fast over the past year. They were
reassured, however, by the regulatory authorities’ continued efforts to be forward-looking and
proactive in ensuring prudent risk management at financial institutions. Directors agreed that
the macroprudential policy framework had supported high underwriting standards.
Furthermore, they noted the appropriateness of recent initiatives to boost regulatory buffers
and to ensure that bank lending remains in tune with funding availability, given the potential for
funding strains if global risk aversion intensifies.
Directors shared the view that the principal risk to economic prospects is from a significant
shock to the external environment. In light of the potentially large cost of such an event, they
stressed the need for adequate contingency plans. More broadly, Directors agreed that, if the

3
global outlook worsens significantly, fiscal stimulus, extraordinary support to the financial
system, and a roll back of recent macropudential measures linked to the property market could
be considered.
Directors agreed that Hong Kong SAR’s Linked Exchange Rate System remains appropriate.
In their view, the high degree of flexibility of the Hong Kong economy underpins the currency
regime and can facilitate a real exchange rate adjustment to changing economic
circumstances.
Directors viewed the expansion of the offshore renminbi business in Hong Kong SAR as a
positive development that could, however, increase the channels for financial spillovers
between the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR. They agreed that the deepening of the offshore
market would need to be supported by a progressive opening of the Mainland capital account
to renminbi flows and by improved provision of information.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region is also available.
