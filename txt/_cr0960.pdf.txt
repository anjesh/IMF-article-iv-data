I. INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities are growing, while the expiry of the Fund
arrangement in August means the loss of an important macroeconomic policy anchor.
Performance under the program has generally been good, especially at first (Table 1). Growth
this year is expected to reach 6 percent, up from 5 percent in 2007, while living standards and
employment have improved. However, a shift to more expansionary policies increased
external vulnerabilities, with the current account deficit rising to a projected 14 percent of
GDP this year. As a result, international reserves are projected to fall below three months of
imports, and other indicators of external vulnerability are worsening.
2.
The new government’s economic program aims to raise growth further, but does
not address these vulnerabilities. Plans to increase the central government deficit
permanently to about 2 percent of GDP (in the election manifesto) or perhaps even higher
(the new government’s revised plan presented during the mission) risk worsening external
vulnerabilities. Though the fixed exchange rate regime has served the economy well, under
these new policies it may come under pressure. The mission therefore called for containing
the current account deficit by limiting fiscal expansion to allowing the automatic stabilizers
to work. Together with some monetary tightening, this would protect the peg.
3.
Although the mission took place before the intensification of international
financial turmoil, its focus on policies to reduce external vulnerability remains relevant.
However, the turmoil means that this report’s projections have greater than normal
uncertainty. If the turmoil continues, they are subject to considerable downside risk.

trade) while industrial production growth reached double digits. Strong investment (in part
reflecting higher FDI) and the high unemployment rate (still around 35 percent; discussed in
Country Report 06/345) suggest few capacity constraints and considerable scope for
continuing this favorable supply response. But there is plenty of room for catch up.

5.
Inflation has risen despite the exchange rate anchor, mainly because of outside
supply shocks (Figure 2). From 2002 to 2006 inflation averaged less than 1 percent,
sometimes with periods of deflation. This was low given the potential for productivity
convergence and associated Balassa-Samuelson effects. Inflation jumped to around
10 percent in early 2008, similar to the region, largely because of oil and food price increases
(more than 30 percent of the basket) which should be one-off. Public sector wages have been
increased substantially (10 percent each year for three years starting September 2007; private
sector wages partially followed), as have pensions (13 percent in January 2008, a further
7.3 percent in July). Although higher inflation eroded any real wage increase, the nominal
wage increases did insulate real incomes from the supply shocks. With core inflation low at
around 3 percent, second-round effects on inflation have been limited, because of slack in the
economy and because demand has spilled over to the current account.
B. External Sector
6.
The main risk to growth and macroeconomic stability is the widening current
account deficit (Figures 3−4, Table 3). Both, the current account deficit’s size (more than
10 percent of GDP in the last 12 months, high for Macedonia and now comparable to
vulnerable countries in the region) and its rate of deterioration are significant.

The trade deficit is projected to rise from 21 percent of GDP in 2007 to
28 percent in 2008. Main causes include:
•

Rapid import growth. Imports of investment and intermediate goods, energy (due to
increasing electricity demand since retail prices are frozen, shortfalls in domestic
production, and higher world prices) and consumption have all grown rapidly.
Increased exports of metals (though prices of nickel, a major export, have recently
fallen sharply), and food (rebounding from last year’s drought) only partly offset this.

•

Private transfers fell more than 30 percent y/y in the first quarter, reflecting
uncertainties over inflation, June’s elections, and Kosovo. With political stability
returning, private transfers recovered somewhat in the second quarter.

•

A severe deterioration in the terms of trade which, after improving by 4 percent in
2007, fell 7 percent in 2008.

8.
The sudden current account deterioration reflects some increase in investment,
but mainly lower private savings. Investment is projected to increase by close to
20 percent, led by the government sector (SSO expenditure data through the first half of the

10
year suggest the increase might be even larger). Saving is projected to fall by around
7 percent of GDP, financed by rapid household credit growth.
Vulnerabilities have been growing, even before the international financial turmoil
9.
External financing has been adequate but vulnerabilities were already growing
ahead of the international financial turmoil (Box 1):
•

FDI has increased significantly and should cover over half of this year’s current
account deficit. However, more than half of this FDI represents parent company loans,
which increase external debt and are easier than greenfield investment to reverse.
Around 60 percent of the FDI is in non-tradables such as real estate and financial
services, which may not generate the future current account surpluses needed to repay
the FDI.

•

The current account deficit may be understated, as the officially measured deficit
treats all cash exchange of foreign currency into denars as current transactions. This
treatment is correct for remittances and unrecorded exports, but not for capital inflows
or conversion of mattress money. (Conversely at times of worsening confidence,
residents converting denars into foreign currency mattress money would be
misrecorded as a higher current account deficit, when really it is asset substitution.
However, in this case vulnerability would still be increasing).

•

External vulnerability indicators are deteriorating (Figure 5, Table 4).

•

As in the region, a large portion of lending (around 55 percent) is either foreign
currency linked or denominated. Banks transfer their currency risk into credit risk, as
most borrowers are unhedged against a change in the denar-to-euro rate. This makes
maintenance of the exchange rate anchor critical for financial stability. Interest rate
risk is similarly transferred by banks to their customers, with rates on most credit
products adjustable.

11

Box 1. Implications of International Financial Turmoil
The staff is in close contact with the Macedonian authorities and financial sector
representatives regarding potential spillovers from global developments.
The direct impact has been limited so far:
•

Banks rely mainly on domestic deposits rather than international credit lines to fund
lending. The banking system’s loan-to-deposit ratio is well below 100 percent.
Interbank lending is small (6 percent of GDP in 2007, largely overnight).
Macedonian banks do not seem exposed to sub-prime lending overseas, and the
domestic mortgage market is tiny (less than 3 percent of GDP).

•

Foreign bank presence has increased, but few are globally active. The two most
important mother banks—National Bank of Greece, which owns the largest
Macedonian bank (Stopanska Banka) and Nova Ljubljanska Banka, which owns the
third largest bank (Tutunska)—appear not to have incurred major losses in the
international financial crisis.

•

At €20,000, the deposit insurance level would traditionally be regarded as quite high
(eight times per capita GDP, covering 75 percent of deposits).

•

Pension funds have invested very conservatively, with foreign equities just 2 percent
of assets.

•

There have been no significant shifts from denar to euro deposits. The NBRM’s
reserves have recently increased slightly, but commercial banks’ net foreign assets
have declined.

•

Portfolio inflows have dropped significantly (1 percent of GDP in 2008), contributing
to sizeable stock market declines.

However, the indirect impact could grow. Lower world growth could worsen the current
account deficit, through lower export demand (60 percent goes to the EU), falling export
prices (metals are 40 percent of exports), or weaker private transfers (including remittances).
Major metal producers have already started to reduce production and lay off workers.
Against this, lower world oil prices would help. While increasing significantly in 2008,
foreign direct investment could be sensitive to tighter international credit markets, and
portfolio investment is declining. Liquidity pressures in the parents of foreign owned bank
subsidiaries could lead to a withdrawal of credit lines.
In short, despite its relative insulation (until recently) from international financial markets, as
a small, open economy, Macedonia would not be immune to a prolonged world recession.

III. THE POLICY RESPONSE
10.
Against the background of increasing international financial turmoil,
discussions focused on: (i) the appropriateness of the government’s plans for continued
fiscal expansion; (ii) the scope under the fixed exchange rate for monetary tightening; (iii)
competitiveness; and (iv) structural reforms to raise potential output.
A. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy has turned increasingly procyclical
11.
The government first took office in 2006, committed to reforming and lowering
taxes. To pay for this it proposed cutting government spending by 2 percent of GDP and
raising modestly the central government deficit to 1½ percent of GDP. In the event, spending
increased, but revenue overperformance (and failure to execute spending) helped the
government meet or surpass the deficit targets (Table 5). Rapid domestic demand growth
(boosting VAT), a near-doubling of corporate income tax (paradoxical given the introduction
of zero tax for reinvested profits, but perhaps explained by the government’s elimination of
the double-deduction for investment), improved tax administration (formalization of the
shadow economy), and higher non-tax and capital revenues all boosted revenues.

VAT cut from 18 to 5 percent for computers, medicines, and public transport (October 2007)
Introduction of a presumptive turnover tax for small businesses (January 2008)

12.
While the central government budget has run a surplus of almost 3 percent of
GDP in the first three quarters of 2008, fiscal policy has turned procyclical:
•

Spending accelerated at the end of 2007 (especially on investment). Though the
central government ran a 0.6 percent of GDP surplus in 2007, the fourth quarter had a
2½ percent of GDP deficit. Part of this spending was actually executed in 2008.

•

Pensions were increased 13 percent in January 2008, then another 7 percent in July—
even though the pension system is in deficit.

14
•

Rather than letting the automatic stabilizers work and save revenue overperformance,
July’s supplementary budget increased government spending by 4 percent of GDP to
almost 40 percent of GDP (Figure 6).

•

Public sector wages were increased by 10 percent in October 2008, for the second
year running.

•

While the central government deficit planned for 2008 appears low, the overall public
sector fiscal deficit including losses in the electricity sector (paid for by deferred
maintenance and deterioration of the capital stock) is much greater (see the Selected
Issues). Perhaps by as much as 1−2 percent of GDP.

The new government intends further fiscal expansion
13.
Despite the worsening current account deficit and this year’s strong growth, the
new government plans further fiscal expansion. In its successful June re-election
campaign, the government pledged to increase spending on public wages, pensions,
agriculture, and education, and to cut social security contributions substantially (reducing
minimum social contributions, and reducing rates from 32 to 22 percent over three years).
Improved tax administration and a higher central government deficit of around 2 percent of
GDP would finance this. However, the government explained to the mission that it intended
to raise the deficit even further—to 3 percent of GDP in 2009 and 4 percent in 2011—for
additional infrastructure investment. Compared to the record under the Fund program of near
budget balance, this plan would represent a paradigm shift in fiscal policy.
14.
The staff cautioned that this planned fiscal expansion could exacerbate
Macedonia’s medium-term external vulnerabilities (Table 6—Baseline Scenario):
•

The authorities’ planned 4 percent of GDP fiscal deficit in the fourth quarter will
boost growth slightly in 2008, but mostly increases the current account deficit (to
around 14 percent of GDP) and worsens external vulnerabilities.

•

Growth is assumed to slow to 4 percent in 2009 due to the international financial
turmoil. Discussions during the mission centered on the attainability of the
authorities’ medium-term 6–8 percent output growth objective (see the Selected
Issues). However, even this revised 4 percent projection is subject to considerable
downside risk.

•

Despite the widening of the fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 2011, the current
account deficit is assumed to narrow gradually. This assumes that the previous terms
of trade deterioration finally increases savings, and that past FDI boosts export
supply. The government (but not the NBRM) argued the export response and current
account adjustment would be more powerful.

15
•

However, external vulnerabilities increase significantly, with reserve cover falling
below three months of imports, external debt rising from 48 percent of GDP at end2007 to more than 75 percent by 2013, and short-term external debt increasing
significantly.

•

The likelihood of a “sudden stop” and crisis would increase, particularly if the
government’s plans for substantial external financing (averaging 4 percent of GDP
annually) fail. Abrupt current account adjustment would follow, with growth much
lower than projected in Table 6.

15.
The staff recommended postponing these spending increases and to use fiscal
policy to reduce external vulnerabilities (Table 7—Staff Alternative Scenario, Figure 7,
see also Selected Issues):
•

The staff proposed saving this year’s revenue overperformance, and not execute the
discretionary spending increases in the supplementary budget. This would produce a
central government budget surplus (excluding electricity sector losses) of around
1½ percent of GDP. This would limit the current account deficit to 12 percent of
GDP.

•

In 2009 fiscal policy would be tighter than proposed by the authorities (so growth
would be slightly lower, at 3 percent), but the automatic stabilizers give a fiscal
stimulus of around 1½ percent of GDP.

•

The current account deficit falls more rapidly, due to the tighter fiscal stance and
stronger export response.

•

External vulnerabilities are lower in this alternative scenario. Interest rates fall,
private investment increases, and medium-term growth is higher, compared to the
baseline.

16.
Notwithstanding these vulnerabilities, the government reaffirmed its plans for
further fiscal expansion. The government argued that past fiscal prudence and debt
reduction had been at the expense of a much lower public capital stock. The government
believed that its strong track record would continue to attract foreign investment, even though
international financial conditions were more difficult. Given the worsened world economic
outlook, the government argued that fiscal expansion could prove usefully countercyclical.
However, during the Annual Meetings the government made clear that it stood ready to
adjust its plans, should conditions deteriorate markedly.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector
After easing through 2007 the NBRM has started to tighten monetary policy
17.
Monetary policy eased for much of the program, driven by capital inflows and
reserve accumulation under the peg (Figures 8−9, Tables 8−9). From 2005 to 2007, gross
reserves increased by €400 million (6 percent of GDP). The NBRM issued central bank and
treasury bills to sterilize, but this attracted further inflows. With limited ability to resist these
forces, and facing pressure from the Ministry of Finance, central bank rates fell below
5 percent, low by historical standards and only a little above ECB rates.
18.
Despite expanding rapidly, the Macedonian banking system remains small
compared to the region, with credit only around 40 percent of GDP. Banks with majority
foreign ownership have increased their market share to more than 85 percent of total assets,
versus 50 percent at end-2006 (however, only one of these banks is active globally). With
increasing bank competition, commercial lending rates fell below 10 percent (real rates were
even lower) and credit growth in 2007 increased to almost 40 percent.

19.
During 2008, the NBRM started to tighten monetary policy. The NBRM switched
to a volume tender (to increase the signaling role of its policy rate) and gradually raised
central bank rates to 7 percent. In March it raised capital adequacy requirements for overdraft
and credit card loans. Given uncertainties over the transmission mechanism, in June it also
introduced quantitative controls, requiring banks to place low interest deposits if their
household credit growth was set to exceed 40 percent by end-year. In addition, the base used
for determining reserve requirements was broadened.

Increased vulnerabilities mean further action may be required
20.
The mission welcomed the NBRM’s actions but recommended further interest
rate increases to slow credit growth. Despite the fixed exchange rate, the central bank now
had room to raise interest rates, since international reserves had leveled off. Commercial
banks had increased deposit rates in line with higher NBRM rates. Lending rates had fallen,
but this reflected increased competition and that central bank rates had been too low to be
binding. If increased sufficiently, higher central bank rates should eventually cause
commercial banks to raise lending rates. However, while the NBRM was open to taking
further action should credit growth not slow sufficiently, the government opposed monetary
tightening.
21.
The staff suggested replacing the NBRM’s quantitative controls when they
expire in January. The effectiveness of controls had been undermined, since many banks
had decided to pursue market share through rapid credit growth, by paying the penalty of
compulsory low interest rate deposits. That said, if foreign credit lines dry up credit growth
could fall rapidly. The mission recommended replacing the controls with higher reserve
requirements and increased capital requirements for riskier loans (less distortionary than the
current bank-by-bank controls, and would also help protect credit quality). The mission also
encouraged strengthened reporting requirements on leasing companies, to prevent evasion of
the controls.
22.
The banking system seems relatively healthy, though rapid credit growth and
court challenges to the NBRM’s enforcement powers are of concern (Tables 10−11,
Figure 10). Stress tests for the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update indicate
the banking system is sufficiently capitalized to withstand a wide range of shocks, but recent
rapid increases in credit need to be carefully monitored (see the accompanying Financial
System Stability Assessment for details). The authorities should also develop contingency
plans for responding to crises. Although the 2007 Banking Law substantially strengthened the
legal and regulatory framework, recent Constitutional Court rulings limit the NBRM’s ability
to resolve problem banks and to ensure that bank owners are “fit and proper”. The authorities
agreed to develop new legislation, consistent with the Constitution, that restores these
essential powers.
The peg remains appropriate as long as fiscal and monetary policies are supportive
23.
Risks to future external stability are increasing (Tables 12−14). The current
account deficit is not sustainable at this year’s projected level, with estimates suggesting
modest overvaluation—although these are subject to considerable uncertainty. However, the
size and speed of the current account deterioration despite little real exchange rate movement
suggests exchange rate policies are not the cause, though these could become an issue unless
there is macroeconomic policy adjustment. As outlined in the staff scenario (Table 7), a

22
combination of policy tightening, structural reforms, and sustained strong foreign direct
investment (but which is export-oriented) could maintain external stability. Risks on the
capital account are also growing, where projections suggest that significant new external
borrowing will be needed to stabilize reserve cover. Maturities are also likely to shorten.
24.
The fixed exchange rate regime has been appropriate, but its maintenance
depends on supportive policies. Macedonia is a small open economy, with trade
concentrated towards the Euro area, incomplete financial market integration, and partial
euroization. This makes fixed exchange rates appropriate (Country Report 06/344). The fixed
exchange rate is also a valuable nominal anchor. However, unless structural reforms are able
to attract sustained FDI (at a time of increased international financial turmoil) or the terms of
trade improve, then macroeconomic policies may need to adjust to protect the peg, even if
sometimes this means sacrificing internal balance.

Box 3. Assessment of Competitiveness and External Stability
The assessment of competitiveness and external stability is mixed.
On the plus side, export growth has been strong (though not well-diversified), structural
competitiveness indicators are improving, and (until recently) unit labor costs and the real exchange
rate have shown competitiveness gains.
However, formal assessment of the real exchange rate gives diverse results. The simple PPP
approach shows undervaluation, while CGER-based assessments suggest some overvaluation:
This assessment is subject to considerable uncertainty. It is difficult to analyze “the” equilibrium
real exchange rate in a rapidly evolving transition economy. There are also significant uncertainties
over projections of private transfers, the world economic outlook, and coefficients from
econometric estimates.

inflation.

25
C. Structural Reform
25.
The fixed exchange rate makes structural reform critical for competitiveness and
raising potential growth. The new government’s strong majority makes it well placed to
accelerate these reforms.
26.
The mission welcomed the government’s plan to reduce minimum social
contributions, provided the fiscal cost is offset. Reducing minimum contributions will
encourage the low paid to enter the formal economy. While a useful first step, the mission
urged the government to go further and abolish minimum contributions altogether. The
mission strongly commended the government for preparing to include food and transport
allowances as taxable income. This would remove a source of distortion and tax avoidance,
and could help finance lower labor tax rates.
27.
However, the government’s more ambitious plan to cut rates for all workers by
10 percentage points over three years will cost more than 2½ percent of GDP. The
mission cautioned that this will worsen the social funds’ already weak financial condition. It
could lower standards of health services today and result in inadequate future pensions.
Unless compliance improves dramatically, additional measures will be needed to pay for the
fiscal costs.
28.
The mission urged the government to improve public expenditure management,
to ensure that the planned increase in public investment was not wasted. Investments
should be subjected to cost-benefit analysis, integrated into the annual budget, and future
operating and maintenance costs included. Instead of repeatedly introducing supplementary
budgets with new spending, more time should be spent improving the original budget, then
ensuring its implementation.
29.
The government has greatly strengthened tax administration. Creation of a large
taxpayer office has improved compliance and simplified tax preparation for firms, while
recent Public Revenue Office law amendments will improve staff flexibility. The authorities
also intend to harmonize the bases for social security contributions with the personal income
tax, and to make these depend on gross rather than net wages. This will ease the computation
burden and simplify tax administration, and has the potential to raise additional revenues.
The mission strongly supports this ambitious reform.
30.
The business environment is also improving (Table 15). The authorities have
implemented a ‘regulatory guillotine’ (abolishing unnecessary regulations) and expanded
coverage of the real estate cadastre. Time for business registration was cut from five days to
four hours, and tax rates lowered. As a result, Macedonia recorded excellent improvements in
the World Bank’s ‘Doing Business’ surveys. However, privatization has slowed (missing

26
opportunities to bring in outside investment and expertise) and protracted disputes with
foreign investors have complicated business conditions in the energy sector.
31.
Despite these improvements, electricity sector distortions have worsened,
increasing the trade and budget deficits (see Selected Issues). The government took the
difficult step of ending electricity subsidies for large-users, and making them pay import
prices. This saved the budget 2 percent of GDP. However, domestic retail prices have been
kept at low levels. Domestic production shortfalls due to low rainfall and insufficient
maintenance have increased the electricity trade deficit to almost 5 percent of GDP. The
mission urged the government to respect the independence of the energy regulatory
commission, especially when setting prices, so that electricity firms could cover costs. The
government also needs to develop measures to protect the poor from electricity price
increases.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Expansionary macroeconomic policies, improvements in the business climate,
and a surge in FDI have boosted growth. Though there is substantial room for catch up,
living standards have improved and employment have increased.
33.
While growth has improved, macroeconomic vulnerabilities have increased.
Inflation reached double digits this year, but now has started to decline due to lower food
prices and the exchange rate anchor. However, the current account deficit has widened
dramatically to a projected 14 percent of GDP. The real exchange rate may have become
somewhat overvalued. However, worsening terms of trade, and rapid increases in pensions
and public sector wages, public investment, and household credit have been the main causes
of the current account deterioration.
34.
Recent international financial turmoil will increase external vulnerabilities.
While the direct impact of the turmoil on Macedonia’s financial sector has been limited, the
indirect impact is growing. Export demand has started to fall, with the metals sector laying
off workers. Potentially lower FDI and portfolio inflows (due to tighter international credit
markets) and weaker remittances (driven by lower world growth) could create additional
balance of payments pressures.
35.
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities could have been reduced by letting the automatic
stabilizers work. The government should have acted countercyclically by saving this year’s
strong revenue overperformance, even if this meant running a central government budget
surplus. Instead, the government’s decision to raise spending by almost 4 percent of GDP, if
implemented, will add to domestic demand and worsen the current account deficit.
36.
Plans for further increases in the fiscal deficit ignore these growing
macroeconomic vulnerabilities and should be reconsidered. Increasing the central

27
government deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2009, then to 4 percent by 2011, will increase
pressure on inflation and the current account.
37.
Monetary policy should be in line with the fixed exchange rate regime. Despite
the constraints of the exchange rate peg, the central bank could have raised interest rates more
aggressively earlier this year, given the slowdown in reserve accumulation. This might have
reduced credit growth and lessened the current account deficit deterioration. Credit controls
should be replaced when they expire in January by raising reserve requirements, or increasing
capital requirements on riskier loans. Looking ahead, higher interest rates would also help
slow credit growth, though the international financial turmoil may also have this effect. In
either case, the priority of monetary policy should be to protect the exchange rate.
38.
Macroeconomic policy adjustment would support the fixed exchange rate. Preannouncing expansionary fiscal deficit targets over the medium term is risky, given that fiscal
policy needs to be ready to respond flexibly to defend the peg. Reversing this planned fiscal
expansion would reduce external vulnerabilities, and lessen the risk of a “sudden stop” in the
event of an unanticipated shock. The central bank would then have less need to increase
interest rates, so private investment would be higher. While projections of external
sustainability are subject to far greater uncertainty than normal, the government should be
ready to tighten fiscal policy should risks to external stability increase.
39.
Significant progress has been achieved since the 2003 FSAP in improving
banking supervision. Implementation of the FSAP update recommendations would
strengthen financial sector supervision, and address gaps in nonbank financial sector
supervision. However, residents’ unhedged foreign exchange borrowing remains a significant
vulnerability. The authorities should develop contingency plans in case of spillovers from the
international financial turmoil. They should also find a way to restore the NBRM's
supervisory powers that were recently ruled unconstitutional.
40.
Structural reform is critical to sustained rapid economic growth, and to
economic convergence. The government’s efforts to improve the business climate,
encourage foreign direct investment, and cutting labor taxes to stimulate employment will
increase potential growth. However, the government should reinvigorate its privatization
plans, address the budgetary and trade deficit problems caused by artificially low electricity
prices, and strengthen the social safety net to protect the poorest electricity consumers.
41.
In sum, while the authorities have reformed the economy and boosted growth,
increasing external vulnerabilities could put these gains at risk, and call for
reconsidering plans for fiscal expansion, and for accelerating structural reform. Since
the Stand-By Arrangement has expired in August 2008, it is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with FYR Macedonia take place in 12 months

28

Table 1. Effectiveness of Fund Policy Advice
Macroeconomic Policy
•
For much of the program, the main objectives of macroeconomic stability, boosting growth,
and reducing external vulnerability were achieved.
•
Growth averaged around 5 percent, and though inflation picked up in late 2007 through 2008
this is due mainly to food and energy price shocks, so should prove temporary.
•
International reserves increased significantly in 2006 and 2007, boosting confidence in the peg
and allowing significant interest rate reductions.
•
However, the sharp deterioration in the current account deficit in 2008—though largely covered
by increased FDI—points to increased external vulnerability.
Fiscal Policy—maintaining a low central government deficit
•
At first the government followed Fund advice and even out-performed the program’s deficit
targets, running a small 0.6 percent of GDP deficit in 2006 and a 0.6 percent surplus in 2007.
•
However, with inflation increasing and the threat of a widening current account deficit, in early
2008 Fund staff advised saving the revenue overperformance, and running a surplus of around
1-2 percent of GDP.
•
The authorities instead increased spending to try to meet this year’s 1.5 percent of GDP deficit
target, pointing to the need to raise public investment and that government debt ratios are low.
Tax Administration—improving revenue collection
•
The partnership between the government and the FAD-Dutch tax administration reform project
has been successful. Implementation of the reforms has been impressive, and government
ownership very strong.
•
In part because of these reforms, the share of revenues in GDP increased by around
1 percentage point, despite substantial cuts in tax rates.
•
Creation of a large taxpayer office has strengthened compliance and improved taxpayer
services, while recent amendments to the Public Revenue Office (PRO) law will improve
flexibility in rewarding performance.
•
The authorities have now brought forward a critical element of these reforms—integrating
collections from the three separate social funds into the PRO—to January 2009. This will
greatly simplify the collection (and payment) of taxes and social contributions.
Tax Policy
•
The Fund has supported many but not all of the government’s tax-cutting initiatives.
•
Staff concerns over lowering personal and corporate income taxes to a flat 12 percent in 2006
and 10 percent in 2007 proved misplaced, since revenues held up much better than projected.
•
Fund advice to abolish the double deduction for depreciation, to harmonize minimum
contribution bases for social insurance (and abolish so-called complexity factors), to introduce
a simplified tax system for small businesses, and to base health contributions for part-time
workers on hours actually worked rather than assuming full time work (which will reduce the
labor tax wedge and help encourage part-time work) has been followed, and generally has
been effective.

29

Table 1. Effectiveness of Fund Policy Advice (Concluded)
Rationalizing Government Spending
•
At the government’s request, FAD technical assistance gave detailed advice to help it
meet its 2006 manifesto commitment to cut the share of government spending in the
economy by 2 percent of GDP (to help pay for planned tax cuts).
•
However, with tax revenues rising sharply, the government ignored this goal and did not
implement these recommendations.
Banking Law
•
The new Banking Law, adopted by Parliament in May 2007, was prepared with the help of
extensive MCM TA.
•
In keeping with international best practice, the new law strengthens banks' governance,
tightens provisions on connected lending, and establishes a framework for consolidated
supervision.
•
The law also contains provisions to protect the governor's decisions in the areas of bank
licensing, administration and bankruptcy from reversal by the courts. This enabled the
NBRM to successfully close a small but lingering problem bank in October 2007.
•
However, contrary to the government’s earlier assessment, critical provisions of the new
Law have recently been found unconstitutional. Corrective amendments now need to be
prepared.
Central Bank Law
•
A new Central Bank law, prepared with the help of MCM and LEG TA, is expected to be
submitted to Parliament soon.
•
The primary objective of the NBRM will remain to achieve and maintain domestic price
stability, and the NBRM will retain full autonomy in achieving that goal. However,
responsibility for the exchange rate regime will be shared by the NBRM and MOF.
•
The draft law strengthens the NBRM's governance, including by providing a clearer
division of responsibilities between the Governor and the NBRM Council.

1/ The ratio differs from that used in the monetary survey due to different definitions.
2/ Includes only loans to nonfinancial sector.
3/ Adjusted for unallocated provisions for potential loan losses.
4/ Highly liquid assets are defined as cash and balances with the NBRM, NBRM bills, and accounts with foreign banks. Large drop in
2006 compared to 2005 is due to change in methodology.
5/ Short-term liabilities are defined as deposits and other liabilities with a maturity of one year or less. Large drop in 2006 compared to
2005 is due to change in methodology.
6/ The increase in 2006 is due to loans channeled through NBRM, not NBRM credit to banks.

Table 11. FYR Macedonia: Main Findings of the 2008 FSAP Update
Since the 2003 FSAP, the Macedonian financial sector has strengthened and deepened.
Favorable macroeconomic conditions helped the banking sector grow by more than 20 percent
annually during 2004−07. However, the non-bank financial sector is still small. All key
recommendations of the 2003 FSAP have been at least partially implemented.
Rapid credit growth is a concern, particularly given the recent deterioration in the current
account. Credit growth has been led by lending to households. Lending has primarily been
financed by customer deposits, but increasingly by banks drawing down their assets held abroad.
Given their net creditor position, Macedonian banks have not been directly effected by the
international financial market turmoil (Box 1).
Stress test results suggest the banking system is sufficiently capitalized to withstand a
wide range of shocks, though the large banks face some vulnerability to credit risk. This is not
surprising as they dominate the market. In addition, similar to the region, much lending is either
denominated or linked to foreign currencies. This transforms banks’ currency risk into credit risk,
as most borrowers are unhedged. Also, most loans are adjustable rate, so banks do not carry
interest rate risk.
Bank supervision has improved significantly. The new Banking Law enacted in 2007 was a
major improvement. Its provisions helped the authorities close a small problem bank in 2007.
Most elements of a financial safety net are in place with the establishment of a lender of last
resort facility since the 2003 FSAP.
Key recommendations of the FSAP update include:
• Use prudential measures to limit household credit growth and improve credit quality. The
NBRM’s controls have proved ineffective, with banks exceeding the limits.
•

Monitor trends in asset quality and strengthen stress testing, particularly for credit risk.

•

The authorities should pass new legislation, consistent with the Constitution, that restores the
NBRM’s supervisory powers in resolving problem banks, and ensuring that bank owners are
“fit and proper”.

•

Improve financial safety net arrangements by developing contingency plans and conducting
crisis simulation exercises.

•

Establish the new insurance supervisory agency—failure to do so means there is now a
regulatory and supervisory vacuum.

•

Strengthen the supervision and enforcement capacity of Macedonian Securities Exchange
Commission.

•

The pension supervisory agency should introduce risk-based supervision.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms, g = real
GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in euro value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and
rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at
their levels of the last projection year.

Annex I—FYR Macedonia: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
most affected areas are: national accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of
payments. Macedonia’s plans for improving its statistical system are posted in the Fund’s
DSBB website in line with the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) framework. A
data ROSC was prepared and published in 2004.
Real Sector Statistics
2.
Despite recent improvements, GDP statistics continue to be affected by large
discrepancies between the official quarterly and annual GDP estimates, and between these
and the behavior of a variety of indirect economic indicators. Further improvements in
production and expenditure GDP estimates are needed to better inform policy makers and
markets about economic developments. The State Statistics Office (SSO) implementation of
STA recommendations has been slow mainly due to a heavy work load, capacity constraints,
and lack of appropriate data. An STA peripatetic statistical advisor made several visits in
2008 to provide hands-on assistance to improve the methodology used by the SSO. A new
quarterly GDP series by production and expenditure, based on an improved methodology,
was published in June 2008. These data are now available from the first quarter of 2006
although there are plans to compile backward revisions for a longer series.
3.
Employment data from the company survey continue to be unreliable, but the
timeliness of unemployment and labor force data has been improved as the labor force survey
is now conducted on a quarterly basis (compared to annual surveys in the past). Wage data
suffer from the volatility of wage arrears payments.
External Sector Statistics
4.
The compilation and coverage of balance of payments statistics have improved in
recent years. Following the 2004 data ROSC mission and the STA mission in late 2006 most
recommendations were implemented. One important weakness in the BOP statistics relates to
private transfers. The weaknesses have stemmed from the assumption that most of the
foreign currency exchanged into denars in the foreign exchange bureaus reflects private
transfers by migrants. The 2006 STA mission utilized a 2002 private survey of migrants to
estimate private transfers and allocated them to the current and capital accounts. The
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) is currently completing a more
comprehensive follow-up survey, which will form the basis of new adjustments (the mission
recommended that such surveys be conducted every five years going forward, to ensure that
the main assumptions remained valid).
Government Finance Statistics
5.
The consolidated central government data are affected by unreliable source data on
extra-budgetary funds, hospital arrears, and special revenue accounts, including foreign

3
financed projects. In addition, the consolidated general government data are affected by
unreliable source data on local governments. Macedonia does not report government finance
statistics to the Fund for publication in either the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSMY) or the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The October−November 2007
government finance statistics (GFS) pilot study mission to promote the methodology of the
GFSM 2001 focused on bridging the statistics reported to the European Department to the
analytical framework of the GFSM 2001 and producing a financial balance sheet for the
central government. The mission identified serious data gaps in the government accounts.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
6.
Monetary and financial statistics are reported to the Fund on a regular basis, although
in the past they have been subject to concerns regarding inconsistencies, accuracy and
reliability. To address these issues, STA provided technical assistance in April 2005 based on
the findings of the 2004 data ROSC. The mission recommendations include: (i) improved
institutional coverage of monetary statistics through the inclusion of savings houses in the
reporting of other depository corporations; (ii) the collection of more disaggregated data in
both the NBRM and commercial banks’ balance sheets to improve the classification of
accounts by economic sector; (iii) improved data consistency through reconciliation of loan
data among various sectors; (iv) the publication of improved interest rate data in IFS; and (v)
the establishment of a well-defined policy on data revisions in line with best international
practice. The NBRM has since begun to implement these improvements. The regular
publication of lending and deposit interest rates of various maturities and currency-type has
been an important step forward. In early 2008, the NBRM began reporting monetary data to
the Fund using the Standardized Report Forms.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update was completed on February 28, 2006 with respect to the current StandBy Arrangement. The previous assessment was completed in April 2003. The
update found that the NBRM had taken steps to strengthen its safeguards
framework and recommendations from the earlier assessment had been
implemented. Notwithstanding this progress, the report made recommendations in
the reporting and audit areas, including: (i) review by the NBRM internal audit
function of processes for compiling monetary data reported to the Fund under the
program; and (ii) completion of annual external audits on a timely basis as
prescribed by the central bank law. The NBRM has started to conduct internal audit
reviews on the processes for compiling monetary data reported to the Fund.

VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:
The currency of the FYR Macedonia is the denar. The FYR Macedonia maintains a
managed floating exchange rate system with a de facto peg to the Euro.
Households can transact only through commercial banks or through foreign
exchange bureaus that act as agents of banks; enterprises can transact through the
banking system. The reserve requirement on all foreign currency deposits is set at
10 percent.

1

This schedule presents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations and
repayment obligations. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations (within predetermined
limits) upon request by the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong enough to meet the
expectations without undue hardship or risk.

7
At end-September 2008, the official exchange rate was 42.63 denars per U.S. dollar
and 61.17 denars per euro. The FYR Macedonia has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from June 19, 1998.
The FYR Macedonia had maintained an exchange restriction subject to the Fund’s
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) arising from restrictions imposed on the
transferability of proceeds from current international transactions contained in
former frozen foreign currency saving deposits. Retention of this restriction was
approved by the Board on December 21, 2006 until December 31, 2007,but it has
now been lifted.

Annex III—FYR Macedonia: World Bank Relations1
A. Partnership in FYR Macedonia’s Development Strategy
1.
The country has made considerable progress since independence, amid a highly
unfavorable regional outlook during most of the 1990’s and a domestic conflict in 2001. The
Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the 2001 insurgency, brought a reasonable
measure of stability to the country, despite continuing political tensions. The strategic
priorities of the Government have included EU and NATO accession, implementation of the
Ohrid Agreement and promoting growth and reducing unemployment and poverty. FYR
Macedonia’s progress is reflected perhaps most prominently in its candidacy for membership
in the European Union.
2.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained since the mid-1990s. Fiscal discipline
and the peg to the Euro helped maintain inflation at low levels for a decade. Government
spending as a proportion of GDP has increased in the last two years, albeit from relatively
low levels compared to the region. This, together with intensified structural reforms in recent
years, has resulted in growth rates of around 4 percent since 2004. Stronger growth has been
constrained by structural impediments and continuation of reforms is crucial if the country is
to attract the investment needed to underpin more rapid growth and job creation.
3.
The modest growth has been insufficient to trigger a more substantial reduction in the
unemployment rate. In the second quarter of 2007, the unemployment rate was 35 percent,
compared to 36.1 percent in the same period of 2006. At the same time, absolute poverty
continues to affect around 20 percent of the population.
B. World Bank Supported Reform
4.
Since FYR Macedonia joined the World Bank in 1993, 44 loans have been approved
with a total value of approximately US$840 million, out of which around 44 percent on
concessional IDA terms. FYR Macedonia graduated fully from IDA in 2003 reflecting
improved economic performance and credit-worthiness. In June 2007 the authorities pre-paid
slightly less than half of the disbursed IBRD portfolio.
5.
The World Bank’s current program of assistance to FYR Macedonia is outlined in a
Country Partnership Strategy discussed by the Board on March 27, 2007. Reflecting
Government priorities, the CPS aims to accelerate FYR Macedonia’s perspective to join the
European Union by focusing on two pillars: (i) fostering job-creating economic growth, and
increasing living standards for all, and (ii) improving public sector delivery and good
governance. The CPS will employ a selected mix of investment and policy lending (up to a
1

Prepared by World Bank staff.

10
total high case lending scenario of US$280 million over 4 years), along with a robust
program of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) work to support the CPS goals.
6.
Over the last five years, World Bank support gradually shifted from support to the
governance reforms agenda (Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit approved in
2002, and Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan II approved in 2004) towards reforms
to improve the investment climate and promote growth and employment. Bank support for
Government reform efforts is centered on a series of Programmatic Development Policy
Loans (PDPLs), the first of which was approved by the Board in October 2005, shortly after
IMF Board approval of the current Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The second PDPL was
approved by the Board on March 27, 2007 and the third and final PDPL is planned for the
first half of 2008. The PDPLs support Government efforts to undertake judicial reform, labor
market reform, financial sector reform, and business regulatory reform. Efforts to further
strengthen public sector governance include an emphasis on further reform to improve
transparency and efficiency in health sector spending, building the capacity of the civil
service to permit more effective strategic prioritization, and support for the decentralization
program being conducted under the umbrella of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
8.
The Development policy lending is supported by a series of specific investments to
build capacity to implement priority reforms. On the governance and public administration
side, a Health Sector Management Improvement project provides technical assistance and
investment support to the broader health sector reform program; a Social Protection project
supports reform in pension and social assistance reforms; and an Education project assists
Government efforts to improve access and introduce stronger performance and equity
measures in primary and secondary education financing. On the investment climate side, a
Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening (BERIS) project approved in
June 2005 concentrates on building capacity to improve business entry, operations, and exit;
as well as enhancing the competitiveness of the enterprise sector; and a Real Estate Cadastre
and Registration project approved in early 2005 strengthens land markets and the use of real
property as collateral for business investment by providing more secure title. A Legal and
Judicial Reform project approved in mid May 2006 supports critical reforms in this area.
Adjustment and investment lending has also been backed up by a comprehensive program of
analytical work.
9.
The Bank is also providing support to other sectors, including railways (Railways
Reform project), energy sector (Energy Community in Southeast Europe project and
Sustainable Energy GEF), agriculture (Agriculture Strengthening and Accession project) and
trade facilitation (Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe 2).

11

C. IMF–World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
9.
World Bank and IMF engagement in FYR Macedonia in recent years has been
marked by a spirit of collaboration and close cooperation between the two institutions at all
levels, as well as with the Government. Synergies between the Bank and IMF programs
during the implementation of reforms reflect a strong degree of consensus between both
institutions and the Government in regard to reform priorities. This close coordination has
ensured that the SBA and the Bank program are mutually reinforcing.
10.
Judicial reform is central to improving the business environment in FYR Macedonia
and firmly establishing protection of creditor, contract and property rights. IMF SBA
benchmarks to analyze and budget for the fiscal effects of judicial reform, enact amendments
to the Bankruptcy Law, and amend the Law on Misdemeanors to allow administrative bodies
to impose sanctions without prior court involvement complemented Bank supported reform
efforts. Under the PDPL and the Legal and Judicial Reform project, the Bank is focusing on:
reducing backlog and delays in court proceedings; improving the enforcement of court
judgments; improving the regulatory and implementation framework for bankruptcy cases;
and increasing the speed, transparency and fairness of administrative decisions.
11.
Support for labor market reform also requires close coordination. A very rigid
legislative framework governing labor relations as well as a high tax wedge contributed to a
stagnant formal labor market, exceptionally high unemployment rate and a large informal
sector. The Bank took the lead in supporting the new Law on Labor Relations adopted in July
2005 which eliminated the most burdensome features of the old law while the IMF has
provided support in reducing the tax wedge and streamlining procedures.
12.
Judicial and labor market reforms are being complemented by a range of other
measures to strengthen the framework for business activity. The enactment and
implementation of a new Business Registration Law and associated regulations has
significantly reduced the costs and time of business entry. This has led to a 50 percent
increase in new business registration in 2006. The Government is also focusing on reforms to
reduce the burden of unnecessary regulations on businesses. This reform will streamline
business licensing, permits and inspections. These continuing reforms are supported by the
Bank’s PDPL program as well as the BERIS project. Further actions to implement corporate
governance and accounting and auditing reports on standards and codes (ROSCs) have been
undertaken, including amendments to the Company Law and Securities Law, and the passage
of a new Audit Law. The Bank and IMF have cooperated closely in supporting the capacity
of the National Bank (NBRM) to supervise and regulate the banking sector, and to strengthen
compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements.
13.
Reform of health sector financing is a key element of both the Bank and IMF
programs. Health sector spending makes up 15 percent of Government expenditure and has

12
historically been an area with significant fiduciary risks associated with pharmaceutical
procurement and less than fully transparent operation of the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) and
Health Care Institutions (HCIs). Prior actions and performance criteria in the SBA have
reinforced the Bank’s programs, which support efforts to further prioritize spending, improve
cost-effectiveness, and strengthen mechanisms for pharmaceutical procurement.
15.
Bank support for civil service reform, including strengthening institutional
arrangements for strategic prioritization, complement IMF efforts to improve fiscal and
budget management. Extending the principles underpinning civil service reform to the
majority of Government employees will further strengthen meritocratic principles and the
professionalism of the public sector. This would need to occur within the framework of the
Ohrid Framework Agreement, and the associated provisions for the representation of
minorities.
16.
Substantial progress has been made in adopting the framework for decentralization,
most recently with the graduation of more than half of the municipalities to the second phase
as well as adoption of formulas for distribution of earmarked and block grants. While not
directly involved in the design, the World Bank’s and IMF’s involvement ensured a fiscally
sustainable progress in decentralization but further coordination will be required.
17.
Most recently, the Bank and the Fund have cooperated closely on the energy sector
dialogue. The Bank is assisting the counterparts in designing a plan that would ensure stable
and affordable energy supply in the future, and the IMF SBA has supported this.
D. Summary
17.
FYR Macedonia has made considerable progress in macroeconomic management and
improving the transparency and operations of the public sector. Although continuing
governance and macroeconomic challenges remain, there is broad consensus that a strong
focus on structural reform must be sustained to overcome key impediments to growth and
employment. This is reflected in both the IMF and Bank programs. The strong similarities
between aspects of the IMF SBA and the Bank’s proposed adjustment and investment
lending program have considerable potential to generate synergies and complementarities.
This, however, requires continuing strong collaboration between the Macedonian
Government, the Bank and the IMF.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
On December 1, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.1
Background
Growth has picked up, led by stronger domestic demand and increasing investment. In
2007 improved terms of trade and remittances boosted incomes and domestic demand.
This raised growth to 5 percent. Though these favorable shocks have reversed, in the
first half of 2008 growth increased to 6 percent (led by construction, wholesale and retail
trade) while industrial production growth reached double digits. Strong investment
growth, in part reflecting higher foreign direct investment (FDI), and the high
unemployment rate, which is still around 35 percent, suggest few capacity constraints
and considerable scope for continuing this favorable supply response. But compared to
the region, past economic growth has been tepid, and there is plenty of room for catch
up.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the December 1, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the
staff report.

2

Inflation has risen despite the exchange rate anchor, mainly because of external shocks.
From 2002 to 2006 inflation averaged less than 1 percent, sometimes with periods of
deflation. Inflation jumped to around 10 percent in early 2008, similar to other countries
in the region, largely because of oil and food price increases. Higher nominal wage
increases prevented a fall in real incomes.
Through 2007 the sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves resulted in monetary
policy easing. From 2005 to 2007, the central bank’s gross reserves increased by €400
million (almost 7 percent of GDP). Though offset partially by sales of central bank bills,
the central bank’s purchases of foreign exchange increased the supply of denars. This
pushed central bank bill rates below 5 percent and commercial bank lending rates to
less than 10 percent. With competition intensifying, credit growth increased to almost 40
percent, stimulating domestic demand and imports, and also potentially increasing risks
in the banking system. To contain these risks, in 2008 the central bank started to tighten
monetary policy. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) has gradually
increased central bank bill rates to 7 percent, raised capital requirements for overdrafts
and credit card loans, and introduced controls on household credit growth.
In 2006 and 2007 the central government budget was broadly in balance, but fiscal
policy is turning increasingly expansionary. Tax revenue increased despite substantial
tax cuts, owing to improved tax administration, domestic demand growth (which boosts
VAT), and a near-doubling of corporate income tax revenues. Fiscal policy plans for the
remainder of 2008 and the medium-term are expansionary. For 2008, the fiscal deficit
target of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2008 represents an expansion of 2.1 percent of GDP
compared to 2007. The government intends to raise the fiscal deficit in the coming
years.
The current account deficit has widened sharply, and has become the main risk to
continued growth and macroeconomic stability. Both the size of the current account
deficit—around 14 percent of GDP projected for this year—and the speed of its
deterioration are of concern. This deterioration has three main components: a rising
trade deficit, falling private transfers, and lower net factor income due to a large telecom
dividend payment. Indicators of external vulnerability, such as international reserve
cover of imports, or of short-term foreign debt, have also weakened.
Recent international financial turmoil poses additional uncertainties. There has been
little direct impact, since Macedonian banks do not seem exposed to subprime lending
overseas and rely mainly on domestic deposits rather than international credit lines to
fund lending. However, the indirect impact is likely to grow. A slowdown in the world
economy could worsen the current account deficit through reduced export demand,
falling export prices, and weaker remittances, and could also threaten growth.

3

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed FYR Macedonia’s strong economic growth, supported by
improvements in the business climate and a surge in foreign direct investment. Progress
has also been made in improving living standards and reducing unemployment. At the
same time, Directors expressed concern about increasing macroeconomic and external
vulnerabilities. The current account deficit has widened dramatically, as a result of
worsening terms of trade and rapid increases in pensions and public sector wages,
public investment, and household credit. While the direct impact of the global financial
crisis on FYR Macedonia’s financial sector has been limited so far, the indirect impact is
growing. Export demand has started to fall, and lower foreign direct investment, portfolio
investment, and remittances could create additional balance of payments pressures.
Against this background, Directors emphasized the need for fiscal discipline. They noted
the role automatic stabilizers could play in reducing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. This
could be facilitated by saving this year’s revenue over-performance and limiting
discretionary spending. Directors encouraged the authorities to reconsider plans for
further increases in the fiscal deficit in 2009 and beyond. Reversing the planned fiscal
expansion would help reduce external vulnerabilities, lessen the risk of a “sudden stop”
in external financing in the event of an unanticipated shock, and reduce the burden on
monetary policy. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to stand ready to
adjust the fiscal stance should macroeconomic indicators deteriorate markedly.
Directors welcomed the recent increases in interest rates and measures to curb credit
growth and slow down the deterioration of the current account deficit. They considered
that, despite the constraints of the exchange rate peg, the central bank still has room for
maneuver, and they welcomed, in this regard, the authorities’ commitment to take
further action as necessary. Directors encouraged the authorities to replace credit
controls by an increase in reserve requirements or capital requirements on riskier loans.
They stressed that the priority of monetary policy should remain to protect the exchange
rate.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg has provided a useful nominal anchor and
remains appropriate for FYR Macedonia’s small, open economy. They highlighted the
importance of disciplined macroeconomic policies and their timely adjustment in order to
preserve external stability. They cautioned that pre-announcing expansionary fiscal
deficit targets over the medium term could constrain the flexibility of fiscal policy in
safeguarding the exchange rate peg. Directors emphasized the need for the authorities
to remain vigilant on external borrowing, given the currently high level of external debt
and the low reserve coverage.
Directors commended the authorities for significant progress in improving banking
supervision. They noted that implementation of the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) update recommendations would further strengthen financial sector

4

supervision and address gaps in nonbank supervision. Noting that residents’ unhedged
foreign exchange borrowing remains a significant vulnerability, Directors called for the
development of contingency plans in case of spillovers from the international financial
crisis on Macedonia’s financial sector. They looked forward to the prompt passage of
new legislation strengthening the central bank’s power in dealing with troubled banks
and enhancing its independence.
Directors welcomed the government’s efforts to improve the business climate, attract
foreign direct investment, and stimulate employment. They considered it essential to
reinvigorate privatization plans, address the budgetary and trade deficit problems
caused by artificially low electricity prices, and strengthen the social safety net to protect
the poorest consumers. Directors also encouraged continued fiscal reforms aimed at
improving public expenditure management and strengthening tax administration.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Mihai Tanasescu, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 1, 2008
On behalf of the authorities we thank staff for their report, analysis and recommendations.
They appreciate the Fund’s advice and the presentation of the topics covered in the Selected
Issues report. In general, the authorities considered the staff appraisal helpful and the
consultations with the Fund productive. Some nuances in views remain, especially related to
the fiscal stance, but the authorities consider that the consultations again provided a good
opportunity to focus on the economic aspects aimed at strengthening macroeconomic
stability and intensifying structural reforms.
In 2008, the reelected government took office for a new four-year term that is expected to see
Macedonia becoming a full member of NATO, and starting EU negotiations. The ongoing
discussion with the EU act as an important anchor for macroeconomic stability. In such
environment, the key objective of the authorities is to speed up progress in structural reforms,
supporting key growth sectors of the economy and restructuring lagging ones.
Economic performance and outlook
Macedonia’s economic performance remains strong. The country experienced more than five
years of uninterrupted real output growth. Growth increased to 5.9 percent in 2007 and is
expected to reach 6 percent in 2008, with industrial production growing at double digits. In
2007, improved terms of trade and increased remittances boosted incomes and domestic
demand. However, the current account deficit widened to 14 percent of GDP this year, and
the trade deficit is projected to rise from 21 percent of GDP in 2007 to 28 percent of GDP in
2008. Foreign direct investment rose 40 percent (y-o-y) in August, and now covers
74 percent of the current account gap, as compared to 68 percent before. Inflation has risen in
the third quarter to 8.4 percent (y-o-y), but decelerated in October 2008 to 7.1 percent
(y-o-y), with core inflation low at 2.3 percent in October 2008.
The recent international financial turmoil, and a shift to a more expansionary fiscal policy
increased external vulnerabilities, and posed a more serious concern, both in terms of
keeping sufficient international reserves under the fixed exchange rate, and of maintaining
external debt sustainability. The authorities recognize the potential risks associated with
Macedonia’s external imbalances, especially in light of the dimming global growth outlook
and persistent strains in commodity and financial markets. At the same time, the authorities
are looking to implement some fiscal stimulus in 2009 and to move ahead with improving the
infrastructure and to create a positive impact on the output of the private sector in the long
run.

2

Fiscal policy
The authorities have successfully pursued fiscal consolidation over the past several years. In
2007, the general budget ran a small surplus of about 0.6 percent of GDP, well above the
1 percent deficit target. In the first three quarters of 2008, the central government ran a
surplus of almost 3 percent of GDP. The fiscal consolidation was due to a strong revenue
over performance and expenditures savings. The fiscal consolidation was possible because
the main elements in the authorities’ economic reform agenda are simplifying the tax system,
improving its efficiency and reducing the tax burden. However, recently the government
approved a budget rectification and raised the central government deficit for 2008 to
1.5 percent of GDP.
The government pledged to increase spending on public wages, pensions, agriculture and
education and, with regard to the security reform, to cut social security contributions from
32 percent to 22 percent over three years. In these circumstances, the government intends to
increase the deficit to 2.8 percent in 2009 and 3 percent in 2011. A deficit of this magnitude
does not alter Macedonia’s sound fundamentals, including the low level of public debt.
Moreover, the security reform also includes introduction of the gross wage concept, integral
collection of contributions by the Public Revenue Office, and broadening the tax base, which
will strengthen the fiscal consolidation at longer term. At the same time, the authorities have
taken measures to control the budgetary expenditures, both at the central and local levels.
Against this background, the authorities are fully committed to improve the fiscal stance if
macroeconomic indicators will deteriorate in accordance with the recent financial turmoil,
and ensure that fiscal expansion will not exacerbate Macedonia’s medium-term external
vulnerabilities. They agreed with staff’s recommendations in adjusting the fiscal policy, if
needed.
Consistent with their commitment to fiscal discipline, the tax administration reform has
intensified arrears collection and improved tax collection from both large and small
taxpayers. At the same time, the customs administration reform and the implementation of
the fiscal decentralization will strengthen the fiscal stance and will increase budget revenues.
Monetary policy and financial sector
The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) continues to support the
economic program by maintaining a de facto pegged exchange rate regime backed by an
adequate level of international reserves. However, the deceleration of world growth and
severe deterioration in the terms of trade related to the turmoil in international financial
markets negatively affected the current account and portfolio investments, thus limiting the
increase in international reserves. However, it is expected that the reserve coverage at the end
of the year will remain around 3 months of import, as in 2009 import demand might be lower
than expected. The inflation rate started to accelerate as of August 2007 and reached
8.4 percent in the third quarter of 2008. The largest part was explained by supply side factors
such as a pick-up in food and energy prices. As commodity prices started to decrease, the

3

inflation rate in October 2008 decelerated to 7.1 percent, with core inflation remaining low at
2.3 percent (y-o-y). Inflation expectations are currently stable, but the risks from wage
increases are present and stress the need for strong vigilance from the NBRM. During 2008,
the NBRM gradually raised its interest rate to 7 percent, as well as its capital adequacy
requirements for overdraft and credit card loans, introduced measures aimed at discouraging
the excessive credit growth of households, and broadened the base for reserve requirement,
while still committing to further increasing interest rates, if needed. With increasing external
vulnerabilities, the NBRM is committed to take further measures to slow credit growth and to
continue to bring down the inflation rate.
The banking system remains healthy, and the recent international financial turmoil did not
affect the banks directly. Its indirect impact, on the other hand, could lower economic growth
and worsen the trade deficit or weaken remittances. Given the importance of financial sector
stability, the authorities will work on strengthening the central bank’s role in the legal and
regulatory framework, and will continue to improve supervision on the non-bank financial
sector.
Structural reforms
Macedonia has made significant progress on the structural reform side, attracting greenfield
foreign direct investment, privatizing and restructuring the railway system, liberalizing the
telecommunications, and improving the business climate by establishing the “one-stop-shop”
and reducing the time required to register a business.
The recent measures approved by the government to reduce minimum social contributions,
together with lower taxes on labor will stimulate employment and will encourage lower paid
workers to enter the formal economy. The authorities will continue to improve public
expenditures management, to help raise public investment to new EU member state levels,
spending public funds more efficiently by integrating them into the annual budget process.
Strengthening the tax administration allowed the government to improve tax collection and
make more information available to taxpayers. Furthermore, the authorities will continue to
harmonize the basis for social security contributions with the personal income tax, which will
ease the computation burden and simplify the tax administration, and has the potential to
raise additional revenues.
The authorities are committed to accelerate the electricity sector reform, by gradually
eliminating the existing distortions by improving the companies’ capacity to cover their
costs. In this respect, the authorities will respect the independence of the energy regulatory
commission in setting prices. At the same time, after ending electricity subsidies for
large-users, the authorities are committed to continue to gradually increase the electricity
prices for the domestic retail sector, and to take supplementary measures to protect the
poorest electricity consumers.
Finally, we would like to express the authorities’ commitment to continue to work with the
international financial institutions in pursuing reforms that will help attract foreign direct
investment.
