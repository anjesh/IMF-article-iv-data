STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
April 22, 2013

SEVENTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT AND
REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Seychelles is a middle income island economy which is recovering strongly
from a 2008 debt crisis and is transitioning to market-based economic policies. Like
other microstates, it potentially faces a middle income trap, having achieved high living
standards but with limited opportunities to attain high-income status, held back in part
by geographical and population constraints.
Focus: Macroeconomic stabilization has been successful and the authorities have
made significant strides toward improving financial discipline at the central
government level. Discussions focused on: (i) firmly cementing macrostability through
ensuring fiscal sustainability and strengthening the monetary framework; and
(ii) policies to support growth and employment to raise inclusiveness.
Program performance: The program is on track. The authorities met all endDecember quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks.
Outlook and risks: Macroeconomic performance has been broadly favorable and the
authorities are on track to achieve their objective of bringing public debt down to
50 percent of GDP by 2018. The outlook is benign, but the economy will remain highly
vulnerable to global developments and domestic shocks. While risks are broadly
balanced, external downside risks are centered on a protracted period of slow
European growth and rising commodity prices, while parastatals pose potential risks to
fiscal sustainability.
Recommendations: Policies should aim to raise reserve buffers, improve the oversight
and financial performance of parastatals, and strengthen the monetary policy
framework. Structural measures should focus on raising inclusiveness through fostering
private sector-led growth and capacity building.
Data: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Priority areas include
completing compilation of quarterly GDP statistics, producing consolidated public
sector accounts, strengthening external sector statistics, and compiling the
international investment position.

Discussions were held in Victoria February 20–March 5, 2013. The staff
team comprised Ms. Baker (head), Mr. Roy, Mr. Culiuc (all AFR) and
Ms. Mwase (SPR). Ms. Luu (OED) joined the mission for the policy
discussions. The mission overlapped in the field with an MCM
technical assistance mission studying steps to strengthen the
monetary framework headed by Mr. Kovanen (MCM-CO). The mission
met with Minister of Finance Laporte, CBS governor Abel, other senior
officials, members of parliament, and representatives of the private
sector and civil society.
The three-year Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) approved December 22, 2009 (SDR 19.8 million, 182 percent of quota) was extended for one year on December 17, 2012 and
access augmented by SDR 6.6 million, 60.6 percent of quota.
SDR 3.3 million will be available upon completion of this review. The
CBS is currently undergoing an update safeguards assessment.

past Fund advice. Moreover, they
are implementing a significant structural reform agenda (Annex 1) supported by extensive
technical assistance from donors, including from the Fund (Informational Annex).
2.
In the span of a few years, Seychelles has made remarkable strides in creating room
for private-sector led investment, transcending a model characterized by state intervention
as the primary source for employment and growth. There are currently 20 companies with
state participation. In 2009, the civil service was downsized and in 2011–12 administered prices of
goods provided by parastatals began to be adjusted toward cost recovery levels. To temper the
impact of economic transformation, the ample social protection system was further strengthened,
while increasing the use of means testing (Annex 2). Despite these measures, some working poor
have struggled under economic reform, supplementing income through welfare.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
Macroeconomic performance has been broadly favorable (Figure 1) and the outlook is benign, but
the island economy will remain highly vulnerable to global developments and domestic shocks.
3.
Growth is holding up. The tourism industry successfully weathered weakness in
traditional European arrivals (France, Italy, Great Britain), registering high growth rates in nontraditional markets (Germany, Russia, the Middle East, China). Despite the elimination of non-stop
flights to Europe—part of the 2012 Air Seychelles restructuring—traditional markets rebounded in
the first ten weeks of 2013 with arrivals up 19 percent over the same period of 2012. The telecom
sector is seeing a boost from the deployment of the new fiber-optic cable. At the same time,
activity in the construction sector has moderated following a 2006–11 surge in FDI.
4.
Inflation is abating following a spike in mid-2012 and the foreign exchange market
is buoyant. Rising food and fuel prices and an unhinging of exchange rate expectations from
mid-2011 to mid-2012 led to an inflation-depreciation spiral (Country Report No. 13/24, Box 1).

Seychelles is a microstate (population 88,000). The overall area is 455 km , but virtually the entire population and
2
all tourism activities are concentrated on three main islands—mostly mountainous—totaling 203 km (of which
2
2
over 30 km comprise a national park). This is comparable to the size of Washington, D.C. (177 km ).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

Monetary tightening was successful in bringing inflation below 6 percent by end-2012, with only a
modest tick up in January/February 2013 following VAT rollout. Recent strong tourism receipts
and lower imports of investment-related goods have pushed the exchange rate to levels last seen
in 2010, further supporting disinflation.
5.
The external position has improved modestly. Preliminary data for 2012 point to a
slight reduction in the current account deficit to around 22 percent of GDP. A rapid increase in
imports of consumer goods was partly offset by lower FDI-related imports and fewer services,
associated with the downsizing of Air Seychelles. The current account deficit was fully financed by
FDI and external borrowing, leading to a modest rise in reserves—reserve coverage ticked up to
2.6 months of imports, slightly above the level suggested by the reserve adequacy metric for
small states with floating exchange rates (Box 2). However, given Seychelles‘ high vulnerability to
shocks and data weaknesses regarding private sector external debt obligations, additional reserve
coverage may be warranted to ensure adequate policy buffers. The debt restructuring which
began in 2009 is nearly complete, with only one loan agreement awaiting signature. Yet, while
domestic debt continued a downward path, external debt ticked up as the government assumed
liabilities of Air Seychelles (about 2 percent of GDP in 2012).
6.
Despite the intra-year nominal exchange rate volatility, the real effective exchange
rate is estimated to be broadly in line with

7.
The financial system appears sound. The banking sector is well-capitalized, profitable
and liquid (Table 5), although non-performing loans ticked at end-2011 and have remained stable
at the somewhat higher level. Stress tests (Annex 4) indicate that the system is resilient to
exchange rate risk, but less so to credit risk and interest-rate risk from maturity mismatches.
8.
The outlook is benign. Prospects are favorable, but barring a major natural resource
discovery,2 growth will likely remain moderate and stable, supported by traditional sectors like
tourism services and fishing as well as the telecoms/IT sector (fiber-optic cable). The resumption
of a large FDI project in 2013 is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on GDP due to the
high import content of construction (materials and labor). Over the medium term, growth is
projected to average 3½ percent and inflation to come down to 3 percent, with some intra-period
volatility as administered prices are liberalized. At current projected global commodity prices, the
large current account deficit should decline over time because of improving terms of trade and
the moderation of FDI flows, but will remain in double digits.

9.
However, the small open island economy will remain highly vulnerable to global
developments, notably in Europe and commodity prices (Box 3), while homegrown vulnerabilities
pose risks to fiscal sustainability. A protracted period of slow European growth would require
farther-reaching efforts at tourism market diversification which could dilute Seychelles‘ high-end
tourism brand and lower export receipts. A failure to strengthen oversight and financial
performance of parastatals could result in additional fiscal costs, which amounted to over 5 percent of GDP in 2012. Future oil and mineral exploration are upside risks to the longer term.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
10.

The program is on track.



All end-December 2012 and continuous quantitative PCs were met, most by a comfortable
margin. The primary fiscal surplus exceeded the target by 0.3 percent of GDP. Strong business
tax collection and receipts from unanticipated out-of-court settlements more than offset
weakness in taxes and excises on imports, with further contributions from lower current
spending, including delayed hiring. Monetary policy was loosened as expected, and the
December 2012 reserve money target was met by a comfortable margin. NIR over performed
because of a stronger than anticipated balance of payments and windfall revenues; the
authorities are requesting modification of the end-June 2013 NIR performance criterion to
adjust it upward by the full amount of the end-December overperformance, as well as the
end-September and end-December 2013 NIR indicative targets.

around 5 percent of GDP per year over the medium term. Such a target leaves sufficient space for
needed investment expenditure,4 while supporting declining inflation and foreign exchange
market stability. The structural reform agenda (Annex 1) aims to strengthen financial discipline of
the broader public sector and improve PFM. Key reform areas extending beyond the program
period include adoption of program-based budgeting as a means to better align resource
allocation with policy priorities, and strengthening the financial performance and oversight of
public enterprises.

REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
Macroeconomic stabilization was successful and the authorities have made significant strides
toward improving financial discipline at the central government level. Discussions focused on:
(i) firmly cementing macrostability through ensuring fiscal sustainability and improving the
monetary framework; and (ii) policies to support growth and employment to raise inclusiveness.

A. Cementing Macroeconomic Stability
Ensuring fiscal sustainability
12.
Fiscal performance has improved markedly since the crisis of 2008, and the goal
now is to ensure fiscal sustainability. As mentioned, the government is targeting a primary
fiscal surplus of around 5 percent of GDP per year over the medium term in order to reach its
statutory goal of reducing public debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2018. However, recent events have
shown parastatals are a key risk to sustainability. The cost of restructuring Air Seychelles
amounted to about 6 percent of GDP in 2011–12, and the financial position of SEYPEC (the
domestic fuel distribution company) is burdened by heavy losses on its oil tanker business and
indirect subsidies in domestic fuel distribution.5 Following tariff adjustments in 2012, the Public
Utility Company (PUC) was able to post a small operating surplus but cannot cover its sizable
capital budget and has been slow at addressing management weaknesses. Apart from parastatals,
more can also be done to improve expenditure efficiency at the central government level.
13.
Staff’s advice centered around the need to improve financial performance of the
broader public sector while continuing to strengthen PFM, and stressed the importance of
strong implementation of recent measures. There was broad agreement that the adoption of
the utility price indexation mechanism (March 2013) and continuing to raise the prices of fuel and
utilities until they reach cost recovery levels would strengthen financial performance, while better
monitoring and oversight of parastatals would limit the possibility of incurring large losses which
would need to be borne by the central government. Moreover, the new Utility Tariff Rebalancing

The authorities have a Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP) and the African Development Bank is planning to
conduct an infrastructure needs study in 2013. Under the baseline, public investment declines as a share of GDP as
investment by parastatals is increasingly funded by operational income.
5

After receiving $15 million in government resources in 2012, Air Seychelles posted a $1 million profit in 2012;
with the airline in the black, a planned $10 million capital injection scheduled for 2013 has been delayed. SEYPEC
is making losses of about $1 million per month on its tanker business; indirect subsidies on domestic fuel are
estimated at 0.7 percent of GDP.

Plan should help reduce cross-subsidization between residential and commercial consumers, and
improve resource allocation. Staff welcomed recent steps to improve monitoring, including
establishment of the Public Enterprising Monitoring Commission (PEMC) but cautioned against
the proliferation of oversight mechanisms and entities.6 On PFM, staff noted that while important
measures have recently been adopted—the PFM Act, new chart of accounts, a move toward
program-based budgeting—their effectiveness lies in rigorous implementation.
14.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s recommendations, but noted that
comprehensive reform takes time. Efforts are underway in parallel to strengthen the capacity of
PEMC staff to produce consolidated (i.e., central government plus public enterprises) public sector
fiscal reports and to improve parastatals‘ compliance with reporting requirements. Work is also
advancing toward publication of financial instructions and accounting manuals which will
operationalize many provisions of the PFM Act. Central government data are being compiled
using the new chart of accounts, even as further refinements to the chart are being made, and
work is advancing toward the piloting of program performance based budgeting for the
ministries of education and natural resources in 2014. Looking ahead, the new Public Sector
Investment Program (PSIP) will eventually feed into a medium-term budget framework. The
authorities appreciated the strong TA support they had received from donors, and reiterated their
commitment to seeing the reforms through, despite some staffing constraints.

Strengthening the monetary framework
15.
Within the current monetary framework, the reserve money target poses significant
challenges to anchoring inflation expectations (Annex 5). Staff noted that the repayment of
domestic debt, a preference for foreign financing7 and shallow domestic financial markets have
resulted in significant structural rupee liquidity in the banking system. High sterilization costs have
deterred the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) from issuing monetary instruments in order to avoid
losses,8 leading to occasional massive build ups of excess liquidity (21 percent of the money base
at end February), which undermine the monetary anchor and retards the monetary transmission
mechanism. The CBS noted that rather than lend, domestic banks prefer to wait until the end of
the quarter when they know the CBS must issue risk-free instruments to mop up liquidity to meet
the reserve money target. As a result, credit to the private sector grew by only 0.9 percent in 2012
and interest rates have become very volatile. Moreover, without a clear anchor, market
participants continue to look to the exchange rate to guide their views on future inflation.
16.
A further increase in international reserves would provide a stronger buffer against
shocks. Import coverage of reserves continues to hover just below three months (the standard
benchmark), despite a steady increase in official reserves since end-2008, and official debt service
6

The Société Seychellois d‘Investissement (SSI) is a state-owned company originally created to manage the
government‘s minority share in the Indian Ocean Tuna joint venture. In January 2013, it took over the
management of the government‘s stake in 10 strategic parastatals. SSI operates in parallel to PEMC.
7

In addition to the higher cost of domestic funds over concessional financing, the use of external financing for
projects reduces near-term pressure on the balance of payments and reserves due to the high import content.
8

Sterilization costs related to excess liquidity are estimated at 0.7–1.4 percent of GDP, implying potential central
bank losses and the need to go to parliament to request recapitalization.

SEYCHELLES

is set to rise following the debt restructuring. This, together with balance of payments
vulnerabilities and exposure to external shocks, provides a strong case for strengthening buffers,
including by increasing reserve coverage (Box 2). Staff and CBS agreed that reserves build-up is
best pursued through opportunistic purchases of forex in periods when central bank interaction is
not likely to have an impact on the exchange rate.
17.
The authorities are beginning to take steps to strengthen the monetary framework
ahead of a move to a flexible form of inflation targeting. In line with recommendations of the
recent MCM technical assistance mission, as a first step within the reserve money framework, the
authorities will coordinate closely with the Ministry of Finance to durably tie up a portion of the
liquidity overhang, including by exploring the feasibility of issuing longer dated T-bonds.9 This will
open space to establish a money market interest rate, supported by short-term CBS instruments.
Better forecasting tools will strengthen liquidity control and the role of the policy interest rate,
allowing the CBS to develop a forward-looking inflation forecasting model. A more efficient
monetary framework will also contribute to easing access to and lowering costs of bank credit to
the private sector.
18.
It was agreed that the changes in train alone may not be sufficient to generate
higher growth in credit to the economy. Staff acknowledged that other factors are also
contributing to low access to credit (see paragraph 22), but pointed out that the current reserve
money framework is exacerbating the problem by providing disincentives to lending.

B. Growth, Employment and Inclusion
Like other microstates, Seychelles potentially faces a middle income trap as geographical and
population constraints limit opportunities for growth and domestic income generation. Growth will
likely be driven by traditional labor-intensive sectors, supported by a continued inflow of foreign
labor, and improvements in the business climate. A key aspect of raising inclusiveness will be
capacity development of domestic labor and ensuring that the social welfare system does not deter
labor market participation.

Growth drivers and private sector participation
19.
Tourism has been the main driver of growth, but there is a tension with the number
of tourists the islands can absorb. Despite the challenging global environment, tourist arrivals
have grown strongly, with diversification toward non-traditional markets more than offsetting
stalling European arrivals. Indeed, an analysis of global tourism indicates that Seychelles has
outperformed nearly all small islands after controlling for standard gravity model variables (Annex
6). However, high arrivals growth rates may prove unsustainable in the long term if the country
wants to maintain its image as a luxury getaway with a pristine environment, and the industry
remains vulnerable to prolonged downturns in its main European markets.

Such issuance could take place only after June in order to incorporate the findings of a TA mission on debt
management scheduled for May.

There was broad agreement that tourism services would remain a key driver of
growth, with upside potential for financial services. While land for construction of new hotels
on the three main islands is reaching its limit, development of smaller, more remote islands holds
potential for increasing the number of hotel beds. In addition, tourism-related services—which
are limited relative to peers—is a dependable area for growth, through product diversification
and increased sector linkages with local small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In other areas,
improved connectivity via the underwater cable has renewed interest in financial services. The
stock market was established in late 2012, and is currently in discussions with potential listers,10
while the off-shore sector is developing steadily. However, scarcity of supporting local
professional services (lawyers, but also accountants, auditors) may limit growth. It will also be
important to advance transparency of legal persons and arrangements in line with international
standards on AML/CFT and tax cooperation to ensure integrity of the off-shore sector.
21.
The authorities aim to support broader-based growth through creating an
environment conducive to private sector participation in the economy. They noted that
reform efforts are paying off—Seychelles was ranked 74th in the 2013 Doing Business
Indicators—and further reform steps have been

22.
While recognizing the progress to date, discussions focused on bottlenecks in
infrastructure and the cost of and access to credit.


Infrastructure. Gaps are significant in water and electricity distribution, and the road network
on the main island is overburdened. Staff welcomed passage of the PSIP comprising
investment needs identified by ministries, and suggested that this be complemented by the
Infrastructure Plan being developed with the assistance of the African Development Bank
(AfDB) planned for mid-2013. It will be important that the Infrastructure Plan be
comprehensive in nature; identify priorities; and ensure development is financed in a viable
way, supported by strong PFM. Together these documents form a key input to moving
towards a medium-term fiscal framework.12



Credit. There was broad agreement that bottlenecks in the area of credit were a challenge.
The banking system shares characteristics of both LICs and other small states (Annex 7),
namely high interest rates and interest rate spreads; lack of economies of scale; maturity
mismatch stemming from a lack of medium- and long-term bank funding; low capacity of
firms, especially SMEs, to develop a business plan; and given the short-term nature of lending,
few bankable projects. The authorities noted they are working on a dual approach, increasing
onlending to the Development Bank of Seychelles13 while collaborating with the AfDB and the
World Bank on financial sector issues such as housing finance development. The new law
regulating financial leasing activities will broaden the availability of credit to small businesses.
The transition towards forward-looking risk-based supervision should help reduce the cost of
credit, while the recent establishment of the credit information bureau works toward raising
access.

Labor and inclusiveness: capacity building for higher value added jobs
23.
Tourism and other growth sectors in Seychelles are labor intensive; full employment
of domestic labor implies that growth will need to be supported by foreign labor. Unlike
most African MICs, job offerings outpace job seekers in every labor category. Unemployment is
low (3–5 percent) and structural in nature, reflecting a skills mismatch (Annex 8). As the economy
has grown, local labor supply has remained broadly unchanged, while foreign labor has increased
from around one-tenth to a quarter of the labor force (one-third of private sector employment),
mostly in high-growth sectors. Concerns with the rapid increase in expatriate labor prompted
changes in the regulations regarding issuance of work permits. Staff underscored the importance
of regulatory certainty regarding the ability of businesses to hire expatriate workers to fill jobs
which they are unable to fill locally, and encouraged open dialogue between stakeholders.

12

IMF technical assistance in developing a medium-term fiscal framework is slated to begin in FY14.

13

DBS was established in 1977 to finance development projects, with a focus on SMEs. Onlending in 2013–14 is
projected to amount to $10.2 million, financed by loans from the European Investment Bank and India.

Staff welcomed the authorities’ focus on capacity building to reduce skills mismatch
in higher value-added jobs. Expatriate labor is concentrated in professional services, managerial
positions and productive sectors (tourism, construction). While recognizing the long-term nature
of the solution, the authorities pointed to recent progress, such as the opening of the University
of Seychelles in 2009, the transfer of management of the Seychelles Tourism Academy to the
Seychelles Tourism Board, and the continued use of government sponsored training programs.14
Work is also beginning to develop a medium-term strategy for education (financed by EU budget
support) and a National Human Resources Development Strategy for 2015 (supported by the
AfDB). They are currently targeting middle management positions, with a goal of reaching 50
percent of positions held by Seychellois (currently 20 percent). In the meantime, social protection
was strengthened in 2009 to mitigate the impact of economic transformation on the vulnerable.
25.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue efforts in train, including an overhaul
of the Employment Act, while ensuring that social protection supports labor market
participation. The authorities are reviewing the Employment Act with the assistance of the ILO,
with a view to increasing labor market flexibility and clarifying key legal terms (i.e., ―equal pay‖,
―harassment‖, ―non-discrimination‖). However, views of the public and private sectors on the
impact of social protection on labor participation varied. Staff inquired about the results of
previous studies15 that had concluded that regulations regarding the hiring of retirees, relatively
high pension replacement rates and ample social welfare were a disincentive to labor force
participation and/or raised the reservation wage. Most respondents noted that labor issues were
complicated, and while there may be scope to align incentives, the already high participation rate
means that such regulatory changes may not yield sizeable benefits. That said, the government
has taken steps to encourage welfare recipients to return to work, is increasing use of means
testing for home health care providers and is strengthening data management and tracking
through linking ministry/agency databases to cross check income and benefit information.

Seychelles has two government-supported training programs, the Skills Acquisition Program and the Skills
Development Program. See Annex 8.

26.
The economy has recovered strongly from a debt and currency crisis in 2008, and
the high-level commitment to reform demonstrated by authorities has supported
macroeconomic stability. The outlook is benign, with moderate growth driven by traditional
sectors such as tourism and fishing. Improvement in the business climate may boost private
sector participation in economic activity, but like other microstates Seychelles potentially faces a
middle income trap.
27.
Given the unsettled global environment and Seychelles’ high vulnerability, the
authorities should continue to build buffers. External risks are broadly balanced but remain
elevated, while parastatals pose potential risks to fiscal sustainability. The authorities‘ intention to
sustain a primary surplus over the medium term is appropriate, with the large revenue base
supporting achievement of their 2018 debt objective while providing space for needed
investment expenditure. Debt restructuring is nearly complete, and caution should be exercised
when contracting new debt, including for onlending purposes. Foreign exchange reserves have
increased and are slightly above the levels implied by reserve adequacy metrics for small states,
but efforts should be made to increase reserve coverage when foreign exchange market
conditions permit.
28.
The floating exchange rate has facilitated macroeconomic adjustment. The
Seychellois rupee is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals, and tourism remains
competitive among peers. Exchange market intervention should aim at smoothing market
disruptions, with foreign exchange purchases aimed at reserve accumulation clearly
communicated to the market.
29.
The authorities have made continuous progress under the EFF-supported program,
and the program is on track. All end-December quantitative performance criteria and structural
benchmarks were met.
30.
The priority now is to cement macroeconomic stability through ensuring fiscal
sustainability and improving the monetary framework. Staff welcomes progress made
towards improving financial discipline at the central government level, and the strengthening of
the efficiency of the tax system through the introduction of the VAT on January 1, 2013. Going
forward, improving financial performance of the broader public sector is key to ensuring fiscal
sustainability. The establishment of the Public Enterprise Monitoring Commission and efforts to
produce consolidated fiscal accounts are welcome, but must be accompanied by strict compliance
by parastatals with reporting requirements. The effectiveness of the PFM Act will depend on
rigorous implementation of recently adopted measures. On monetary policy, durably removing
excess liquidity is the first step toward strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism and
will require a transparent and credible mechanism to cover the fiscal cost of sterilization. At the
same time, steps should be taken to improve liquidity forecasting and develop a forward-looking
inflation forecasting model.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

SEYCHELLES

31.
The government is implementing an appropriately broad structural reform agenda
that will be key to facilitating a deepening of markets more capable of sustaining growth.
Ongoing efforts to modernize the Companies Act and insolvency framework will complement
measures already taken to simplify business registration. Like many microstates, bottlenecks are
also present in infrastructure and access to credit. Passage of the public sector investment plan is
welcome, and should be prioritized and financed in a viable way. It is important to bring the tariffs
and prices of select parastatals (in particular the Public Utility Corporation) to full cost recovery in
a useful timeframe, which will free up central government resources for other priority investments.
32.
Reducing the cost of, and increasing access to, credit will be important for private
sector development. While a substantial increase in the provision of longer-term credit would
require capital market development beyond the current model narrowly centered on bank
intermediation, improved guidance of market expectations through a stronger monetary policy
framework will facilitate the banking system‘s capacity to mobilize and allocate financial
resources.
33.
Key aspects of raising inclusiveness are capacity development and ensuring that the
social welfare system supports labor market participation. With the economy at full
employment, foreign labor will continue to play an important role in supporting growth, and
regulatory certainty regarding the employment of expatriates is necessary to promote private
investment. Development of a medium-term strategy for education and a National Human
Resources Development Strategy should help identify avenues for reducing skills mismatch,
allowing domestic labor to access higher value-added jobs. Increased reliance on means–tested
social programs should also contribute to higher domestic labor force participation.
34.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Seychelles participates in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and is working toward participation in the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Priority areas include completing compilation of quarterly
GDP statistics, producing consolidated public sector accounts, strengthening external sector
statistics by improving its coverage, and compiling the international investment position.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Seychelles be held in
accordance with the decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles adopted on September 28,
2010, as amended. Staff recommends completion of the seventh review under the Extended
Arrangement and the associated purchase in an amount equivalent to SDR 3.30 million. Staff also
recommends approval of the authorities‘ request for modification of the end-June 2013
performance criterion on net international reserves.

Box 1. The 2008 Crisis and Macroeconomic Stabilization
Economic policy during 1977–2004 was socialist in orientation, characterized by multiple controls (over
prices, trade and foreign exchange) and a prominent role for parastatals. Limited economic liberalization in
the 1990s reduced the state's role in some sectors—notably telecommunications and tourism—although
debt-funded development spending continued at a high level.
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies were unsustainable and led to a debt crisis. By 2007, the
overall fiscal deficit had reached 9.8 percent of GDP; total public debt stood at 146 percent of GDP; and.
gross official reserves were depleted to $9.8 million, or 0.1 month of imports. External arrears of $160 million
were accumulated and in July and October 2008 the government of Seychelles failed to make payments on
private foreign debt—S&P downgraded Seychelles to ‗selective default‘.
The debt crisis culminated in a balance of payments and currency crisis. Several step adjustments in the
value of the rupee against the dollar in 2006–07, exchange restrictions and credit rationing had not
stemmed the balance of payment crisis, compounded by the 2008 food and fuel price shocks. The parallel
market premium over the official USD-pegged rate reached 55 percent.
An economic reform program was launched in November 2008 supported by a Stand-by
Arrangement. The authorities removed exchange restrictions, floated the currency, liberalized interest rates,
introduced a reserve money targeting framework, and increased reserve requirements. The rupee/dollar
exchange rate more than doubled, temporarily overshooting the parallel rate, leading 12-month inflation to
peak at 63 percent in December 2008. The exchange rate appreciated over the subsequent two quarters,
bringing down prices (negative 12-month inflation throughout 2010) and short-term money market interest
rates.
Macroeconomic stabilization was supported by strong and sustained fiscal adjustment. The heavily
frontloaded fiscal tightening (primary surpluses of 14.3 and 8.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
respectively) was achieved through deep cuts in public sector employment, only modest increases in
nominal wages, and the removal of many product subsidies. Retrenched public sector workers were
absorbed by the private sector, albeit at lower real wages. An expanded and more targeted social safety net
was implemented to mitigate the social impact of the reforms.
Tax reforms and improvements in revenue administration and expenditure management buttressed
the credibility of the fiscal adjustment. The tax base was broadened by increasing the coverage of GST
and rolling back tax exemptions that had long compensated foreign investors for the overvalued currency.
The GST rate was then increased in steps and replaced by the VAT in 2013. The Ministry of Finance has built
capacity internally to strengthen budget processes. Key achievements include the conduct of mid-year
formal expenditure reviews, the adoption of new procurement and transparent tendering processes, and the
establishment of a macroeconomic and revenue forecasting unit (prior to 2008 the budget did not report
revenue numbers, nor a measure of the fiscal balance).
The turnaround in economic policies facilitated debt reduction. In early 2009 Paris Club creditors
provided a 45 percent debt write-off in nominal terms, very exceptional for a middle-income country.
Despite a fragmented private creditor base, Seychelles‘ debt exchange was successful (50 percent haircut).
Thereafter, the authorities adopted an overarching macroeconomic policy objective of reducing public debt
to 50 percent of GDP by 2018. The debt restructuring process started in 2009 is nearly complete, with one
agreement awaiting signature. While public debt is on trend to meet the objective, debt dynamics
demonstrate an elevated sensitivity to shocks representative of small island economies.

Box 2. Policy Buffers—Reserve Adequacy and the Debt Ceiling
This box assesses two key policy buffers in Seychelles, namely reserve adequacy and the debt ceiling. While
international reserves provide a direct defense against shocks, an appropriate debt ceiling aims to provide room
for policy maneuver in the event of shocks. Reserve coverage and the authorities‘ 2018 debt objective appear
adequate, but there is a case for building further buffers given Seychelles‘ high vulnerability to shocks.
Reserve Adequacy. While panel estimates suggest broadly appropriate coverage, Seychelles reserves
1
could be further increased to ensure adequate policy buffers. The risk-weighted reserve metric for flexible
currency regimes comprises 40 percent of short-term debt on
Reserves against risk-weighted metric
remaining maturity basis, 10 percent exports of goods and
3.1

services and 30 percent of broad money. Reserves have
3.0
increased steadily from 0.7 months of prospective imports in
Reserves from metric
2.9
2008 during the debt crisis to 2.6 months in 2012, and are
2.8
projected to remain modestly above the metric over the

medium term. However, given Seychelles‘ high vulnerability
2.6
2.5
and data weaknesses regarding private sector external debt

ensure adequate policy buffers.

The Authorities’ Debt Ceiling. Staff analysis indicates that
the authorities’ debt target is in line with the results of standard models of debt intolerance, but still
2
somewhat above peers—a further reduction may be warranted over the long-term. The approaches
3
include (i) a cross country comparison of debt ratios; (ii) an examination of debt intolerance, (iii) the maximum
debt level consistent with intertemporal solvency under various assumptions for the primary balance, real
4
growth and interest rate following IMF (2003); and (iv) sovereign ratings.

Primary Surplus

(percent of GDP)

While individual approaches are inconclusive, taken together they suggest that a reasonable and feasible
public debt ceiling for Seychelles over the longer-term could be in the order of 35–50 percent. The first
three approaches support the current target. Cross country comparison of small states with floating exchange
rate regimes suggests that the average public debt was 52 percent in 1995-2011. Public debt thresholds of debt
intolerance for Seychelles range from 30-75 percent. Staff sensitivity analysis reveals that 49 percent of GDP can
be sustained under reasonable assumptions about Seychelles‘ long-run primary balance and discount factor.
However, in comparison to other countries
Benchmark public debt-to-GDP ratio: sensitivity to primary surplus and

APPENDIX I. SUPPLEMENTAL LETTER OF INTENT
April 19, 2013
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Dear Managing Director Lagarde:
We are writing to request completion of the seventh and penultimate review under our Extended
Arrangement, and the availability for purchase of the tenth tranche of SDR 3.30 million (30.3 percent
of quota).
We met all end-December quantitative performance criteria under the program, and economic
performance during 2012 was highly satisfactory, with most key indicators exceeding expectations.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have been slightly higher than projection at 2.9 percent (projection
was 2.7 percent). We also exceeded our end-of-year targets with regard to the primary fiscal surplus
and net international reserves. Early indicators of economic activity in 2013 are highly encouraging,
with the tourism sector – our mainstay – performing strongly, as indicated by a 19 percent growth in
visitor arrivals for the first ten weeks of the year compared to the same period last year. This puts us
in a good position to exceed the projected real growth target of 3.3 percent for 2013.
We remain strongly committed to maintain fiscal discipline that is vital for attaining long-term debt
sustainability. Nevertheless we are cognizant of some downside risks due, among other things, to
the tropical cyclone that affected Seychelles in late January, as well as revised bases for tax
collections following introduction of the VAT and a number of other taxes. As a result of the heavy
rains, Government established a special Fund for donations from the international community.
However, the fundraising is not expected to cover the total costs for damage and losses (estimated
at $8 mil-lion by the World Bank), and it is anticipated that a certain level of expenditure will need to
be incurred by the Budget. Moreover, the tax performance for the last two months of 2012 was less
favorable than forecast at the time of preparing the 2013 budget, and consequently the base for the
2013 projections was revised downwards. Combined with a strong rupee this could negatively
impact revenues. We are nevertheless committed to achieving a primary surplus in excess of
5 percent of GDP for the year.
We also remain strongly committed to our structural reform agenda. One of the key reforms under
the program supported by the Extended Fund Facility—introduction of a Value Added Tax—was
implemented on January 1, 2013. Besides a few teething problems the transition has been
satisfactory. In terms of Public Finance Management, the reforms are on track and the Ministry of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

Finance is on schedule for the introduction of new accounting manuals and procedures towards the
middle of this year. In March, the Cabinet approved a policy for indexation of utility tariffs, as well as
a roadmap for the re-balancing of tariffs to ensure the sustainability of the state-owned utility
company. Implementation of this rebalancing exercise will begin on July 1 this year.
We have raised our net international reserves target because of the good performance of the export
sector underpinned by strong inflows from tourism, and request modification of the end-June 2013
performance criterion. The Central Bank will accumulate reserves by opportunistically buying
foreign currency such that the Bank‘s presence in the market does not influence the exchange rate
level. Our target remains for gross official reserves to reach at least three months import cover by
end-2013.
We will continue to implement monetary policy under the reserve money targeting framework.
However, we intend to broaden our range of indicators for macroeconomic conditions in the short
term so as to improve the transmission mechanism and make the monetary policy framework more
flexible.
In line with the commitments made in the memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)
of November last year, we are confident of maintaining our course to achieve the objectives of the
program. Nonetheless, we stand ready to take any further measures that may prove necessary to
meet our objectives. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in
advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP and this letter, in accordance with the
Fund‘s policies on such consultations.
The eighth and final review under the EFF Arrangement based on performance criteria for end-June
2013 is expected to be completed on or after September 30, 2013.
In line with our commitment to transparency, we request that the IMF publish this letter, the
attached technical memorandum of understanding (TMU), and the staff report for the seventh
review and Article IV consultation. We will simultaneously publish these documents in Seychelles.

Sincerely Yours,

Attachment 3: Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.

This technical memorandum of understanding presents the definitions of variables included in

the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set out in the supplemental letter of intent
(LOI), the key assumptions, and the reporting requirements of the Government and the Central Bank of
Seychelles (CBS) needed to adequately monitor economic and financial developments. The quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets, and the benchmarks for 2013 are listed in Tables 1 and 2
attached to the LOI, respectively.

I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net International Reserves of the CBS (Floor)
Definition
2.

Net international reserves (NIR) of the CBS are defined for program monitoring purposes as

reserve assets of the CBS, minus reserve liabilities of the CBS (including liabilities to the IMF). Reserve
assets of the CBS are claims on nonresidents that are readily available (i.e., liquid and marketable assets,
free of any pledges or encumberments and excluding project balances and blocked or escrow accounts,
and bank reserves in foreign currency maintained for the purpose of meeting the reserve requirements),
controlled by the CBS, and held for the purpose of intervening in foreign exchange markets. They include
holdings of SDRs, holdings of foreign exchange, demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks
abroad, fixed-term deposits abroad that can be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of
investment-grade securities. Reserve liabilities of the CBS comprise liabilities to nonresidents contracted
by the CBS, any net off-balance-sheet position of the CBS (futures, forwards, swaps, or options) with
either residents or nonresidents, including those to the IMF.

Calculation method
3.

For program monitoring purposes, reserves assets and liabilities at each test date must be

converted into U.S. dollars using the end of period exchange rates assumed in the program.

Monitoring and reporting
4.

At each program test date, the quarterly net international reserves data submitted by the CBS to

the IMF will be audited by the CBS‘ internal audit division in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing, to ensure conformity with the program definition and calculation methods. Reports will be
submitted to the IMF no later than two months after each test date.

Adjusters
5.

The floor on the CBS‘s NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by which the

external non-project loans and non-project cash grants exceeds (falls short of) the amounts assumed in
the program (LOI Table 1). The floors will also be adjusted upwards (downwards) by the amount that
external debt service payments fall short (exceed) the amounts assumed in the program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

SEYCHELLES

B. Reserve Money (Ceiling)
Definition
6.

Reserve money is equivalent to currency issued and deposits held by financial institutions at the

central bank (bank reserves), including those denominated in foreign currencies. Evaluation of
performance of reserve money with respect to the program ceiling will be done at the program
accounting exchange rate.

Monitoring and reporting
7.

For each program test date, the quarterly reserve money data submitted by the CBS to the IMF

will be audited by the CBS‘ internal audit division in accordance with International Standards on Auditing,
to ensure conformity with the program definition. Reports will be submitted to the IMF no later than two
months after each test date.

A. Primary Balance of the Consolidated Government (Cumulative Floor)
8.

The consolidated government primary balance from above the line on a commitment basis is

defined as total consolidated government and social security fund revenues (excluding privatization and
long-term lease income receipts) less all noninterest (primary) expenditures of the government and social
security fund.

B. Public External Debt (Ceiling)
9.

The ceiling applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of new external liabilities by the public

sector (including the central government, the CBS, and all public agencies and parastatals for operations
that are not directly linked to commercial activities). The ceiling does not apply to the use of Fund
resources, operations related to external debt restructuring; normal import related credits; purchases of
treasury securities by nonresidents; or borrowing by parastatals in the conduct of normal commercial
operations. The non-zero ceilings on the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt are to allow for
normal public project finance and program support from multilateral institutions exclusively. Debt shall
be valued in U.S. dollars at program exchange rates. A zero sub-ceiling on short-term external debt
applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external debt by the public sector, with an
original maturity of up to and including one year.
10.

For the purposes of this performance criterion, the definition of debt is set out in Point 9 of the

―Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements,‖ attached to
Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), as amended. Debt is understood to mean a current, non
contingent liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form
of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments
in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future points in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. The ceiling on contracting
official and officially guaranteed external debt includes all form of debt, including:

32 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
TIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

a. loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
b. suppliers credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided;
and,
c.

leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the leasor retains title to the property. The debt is
the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made
during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation,
repair, or maintenance of the property.

d. Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on
an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g. payment on delivery) will
not give rise to debt.

C. External Arrears of the Public Sector
11.

The nonaccumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous performance criterion

under the program. External payments arrears for program monitoring purposes are defined as the
amount of external debt service due and not paid within the contractually agreed period, subject to any
applicable grace period, including contractual and late interest. Arrears resulting from the nonpayment of
debt service for which a clearance framework has been agreed or a rescheduling agreement is sought are
excluded from this definition.

D. Domestic Arrears of Government
12.

The nonaccumulation of budget expenditure arrears will be a performance criterion under the

program and will be measured on net basis from the beginning of a calendar year. Budget expenditure
arrears are defined as the sum of (1) any invoice that has been received by a spending agency from a
supplier of goods, services, and capital goods delivered and verified, and for which payment has not been
made within the contractually agreed period, or in the absence of a grace period, within 30 days; (2)
unpaid wages, pensions, or transfers, pending for longer than 30 days to domestic or foreign residents,
irrespective of the currency denomination of the debt; and (3) debt service payment on domestic debt of
the government or guaranteed by the government that has not been made within the contractually
agreed period.

Annex 2. Social Protection and Assistance
Seychelles has in place a comprehensive social safety net aimed at providing support to vulnerable
groups, protecting people‘s incomes in their old age, ensuring a minimum standard of basic needs
can be met, and helping specific groups meet specific costs (such as pensioners and students
meeting the costs of transportation). The right to social protection is enshrined in the 1993
constitution, which also establishes the State‘s responsibility to ―undertake and maintain a system of
social security‖ and that all Seychellois have the right to ―adequate and decent shelter‖. In 2007,
social protection programs were further strengthened in order to mitigate the impact of economic
restructuring. A strong social safety net is desirable given the country‘s high vulnerability to external
shocks.
The social protection system comprises (Table A2.1): entitlement programs; discretionary cash and
in-kind social assistance; and a cash transfer system to keep households above the ―poverty line‖.1 It
also includes (i) a government built housing scheme in which houses are rented to ―low-income‖
households (households with monthly income less than SR10,000 ($770) per month); (ii) a subsidized
mortgage scheme which extends credit to ―almost creditworthy‖ households (households with
monthly income between SR10,000 and SR15,000); (iii) human capital development programs, such
as the Skills Acquisition Program (for youth) and Skills Development Program; (iv) administered
prices for 14 ―basic‖ goods purchased through the Seychelles Trading Company; (v) subsidized LPG
for residential use and electricity (both are in the process of moving to cost recovery); (vi) subsidized
bus fares; and (vii) social programs provided by charitable organizations, including with public funds.
Education is free and compulsory to 16 years of age, and there is universal free basic health care.
The benefits under the social protection system are quite generous and contribute to a high quality
of life (rank 46 on the 2013 Human Development Index), but may negatively impact labor supply
choices. For example, replacement rates (i.e., the amount received as a pension as a share of income
received while working) under combined social security (SSF) and pension fund (SPF) for the average
wage earner are 74 percent (somewhat above other middle income countries) while replacement
rates for those earning half of the average exceed 100 percent, providing a disincentive to remain
employed after age 60. The authorities have taken measures to get people off social assistance and
back to work, through increased use of means testing and making registration with an employment
agency a condition for receiving welfare. The generous benefits may also be negatively affecting
other areas of the economy, including private sector participation in the housing and mortgage
market (subsidies reach into the 70th percentile of the income distribution). The authorities are
currently reviewing the housing subsidy and are seeking to implement policies to strengthen
financial sector development.

Seychelles does not have a national poverty line. The 2011 Living Conditions Survey conducted by the UNDP
estimates the poverty line at about $3 per day per adult (SR 13,554 per year). The poverty rate is estimated at
17 percent of the population, with the incidence of poverty rising with household size. Poverty is higher in
households led by unemployed heads, females and those with little education.

As of January 2013 there are approximately 14,000 people (16 percent of the population) receiving
benefits under the SSF, about half of which are retirees earning an old age pension. Of the over
2,300 families receiving means-tested welfare payments, most are working poor with children, while
unemployed households with no income comprise about 10 percent of welfare families.
Given their comprehensive nature, the total
cost of social programs including the
investment budget for housing construction
and infrastructure exceeds 7½ percent of
GDP. However, the cost of the social
assistance program is more or less in line with
comparator countries.

The small population of Seychelles allows
much better data management and tracking
than is often the case. According to the World Bank Public Expenditure Review Selected Issues
(2011), every citizen is issued a unique personal identification number at birth, all child births are
registered, and death registries are up to date. Moreover, the IT system for the Agency for Social
Protection is currently being upgraded to link databases of various ministries and agencies to cross
check income and benefit information.

Annex 3. External Stability and Competitiveness
A range of CGER-based methodologies indicates that the Seychellois rupee is broadly in line with
fundamentals. A comparative analysis of external vulnerabilities, export performance and non-price
indicators also suggest that Seychelles has remained competitive relative to peers.

A. Quantitative Analysis of External Stability
Quantitative analysis, drawing on the IMF’s CGER
methodology, suggests that the real effective
exchange rate is in line with equilibrium, albeit with
sizable variation across methodologies.1

throughout most of the period, and has remained
within the confidence interval since 2006. Like most island economies, Seychelles has maintained
a large current account deficit (average 16 percent of GDP 2001-12). 2 Since these large deficits have
been largely driven by FDI-financed imports and some large one-off transfers, an underlying current
account is estimated that strips out temporary surges in FDI and transfers. The estimated exchange
rate is in equilibrium with a measured misalignment (overvaluation) of less than 6 percent in 2012–
13 and a slight undervaluation over the medium term.

The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) results indicate that equilibrium exchange rate
has remained fairly constant since 2009, resulting in a widening misalignment as the REER
depreciated. The estimated undervaluation is around 20 percent for both 2012 and 2013, although
results still fall within the confidence interval. However, the methodology suffers from certain
shortcomings. On the technical level, the ERER methodology relies on homogeneity assumptions
across countries that are very diverse, and there are structural breaks in the series, such as
Seychelles‘ move from a fixed to a floating exchange rate regime in late 2008. Moreover, the
microstate experiences significant nominal exchange rate volatility and is subject to external shocks
which quickly pass-through to inflation.

Export performance has been strong despite the challenging global environment, and
prospects are supportive.


Goods and services export receipts grew by about 7½ percent per year (average) since 2005.
Strong performance in tourism earnings and oil re-exports, averaging about 10 and 9 percent,
respectively drive these findings. Export performance is expected to remain strong driven by
tourism and tuna exports.



Tourism has remained particularly robust (see annex 6), with Seychelles outperforming
competitor markets despite the elimination of direct flights from Europe in early 2012 and it‘s
branding as a high-end destination.4 This reflects successful diversification toward nontraditional arrivals (Russia, the Gulf States, China) when traditional markets (France, Italy, Britain)
faltered. There has also been some diversification of the tourism product, including through the
land reclamation and development of villas, leading to an increase in the number of tourism
units.



Looking ahead, recent investments could expand export capacity. FDI and construction in the
tourism sector (villas, some new hotels) may contribute to rising tourism revenues; the
construction of cold storage facilities in train will support increased capacity and product

diversification by the tuna processing company (10 percent of GDP); and the recently-installed
fiber optic cable could support growth in the financial services sector.
Structural competitiveness indicators are also improving. Seychelles climbed to 74th (of 185) in
the 2013 World Bank‘ Doing Business ranking, and given structural measures underway is poised to
climb further. In 2013, Seychelles took over the top spot among Sub-Saharan African countries in
the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index and is ranked 38 (of 140) overall (Mauritius 58;
Barbados 27). It also ranks favorably in Global Competitiveness and the Corruption Perception
Index. However, greater effort could be made to improve other dimensions of competitiveness.
Areas cited by the 2012/13 Global Competitiveness Report include access to finance, poor work
ethic in national labor force and inadequate supply of infrastructure, while the Doing Business report
notes challenges in starting a business, as well as access to credit and electricity.

Annex 4. Seychelles—Results of the Banking Sector Stress
Tests
The banking sector is well-capitalized, liquid and profitable. A recent uptick in nonperforming loans
does not present systemic risk. Results of the stress tests show that the system is resilient to exchange
rate risk, but less so to credit risk and interest-rate risk from maturity mismatches.
Background: Seychelles‘ domestically operating banking system consists of six banks comprising
total non-consolidated assets of about 104 percent of GDP. Four banks are foreign-owned and
together account for 67 percent of banking system assets; two have a government-majority equity
stake. The two largest banks account for 70 percent of the assets of the banking system. Banks‘
private-sector lending focuses on tourism, consumer credit to households, mortgage loans, real
estate, transportation, and construction.

Seychelles‘ banks have recovered well from the 2008 financial crisis, and their profitability and
financial soundness indicators have largely improved in recent years. Since end-2011, the ratio of
nonperforming loans to gross loans has hovered above 8 percent, as a consequence of two
distressed loans. These claims are held by one institution, are fully collateralized, and no further
provisioning is required.
Stress tests: The stress tests were conducted in February 2013 by the Central Bank of Seychelles‘
Financial Services Supervision Division using reported bank data from December 2012.1 Three main
risks were examined: foreign-exchange risk from exchange rate shocks; credit risk from a decrease in
loan quality and from loan concentration through failure of the banks‘ largest borrowers; and

1

In late 2010, the CBS conducted a stress test exercise in collaboration with the staff of the IMF Monetary and Capital
Markets Department (Country Report No. 11/5, Appendix IV). Based on September 2010 data, the banking sector was
found to be adequately capitalized, liquid and profitable. Notwithstanding a mismatch in asset/liability maturity, the
banking system was deemed to be ―reasonably resilient to risks‖.

interest rate risk operating through maturity mismatches of assets and liabilities.2 A summary of the
results is contained in table A3.1.
1

Exchange rate shock. Given its high degree of openness, Seychelles is vulnerable to exchange rate
movements. Two types of shocks were examined: a foreign-exchange depreciation resulting from an
unexpected external shock and a sharp appreciation of the Seychellois rupee.


The depreciation scenario proved uninteresting given that banks hold long net open positions in
foreign currency.3
2



Two appreciation scenarios were then applied: (a) the maximum realized historical annual
appreciation, and (b) an exchange rate shock of 2.58 standard deviations, equivalent to a 99.5
percent confidence interval of the data distribution and implying an appreciation of the rupee
against the U.S. dollar by 20.3 percent. Under no circumstances—including the most extreme
shocks—did a single institution fall below the statutory capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 12 percent.

Credit risk. Three credit risk scenarios were run; all credit-default scenarios included provisioning
requirements and their impact on capital and profit indicators. The first scenario covered an overall
downward classification of pass loans into various lower-quality grades (special mention;
substandard; doubtful; and loss), calibrated according to historical data. This scenario also assumed
a 100-percent haircut on collateral values. Two additional scenarios focused on concentration risk
and assumed that the largest or the five largest borrowers of each bank would default. Under these
scenarios, a few of the six banks would sink below the statutory minimum capital-to-risk weightedassets ratio, but it would take the most extreme shock of five defaulting large borrowers to turn capital
ratios negative. Exposure to concentration risk is not unexpected for a small economy, but it
underscores the importance of monitoring the financial health of large borrowers.

2

As Seychelles‘ banking system is characterized by excess liquidity, initial tests for liquidity risk did not yield any
interesting results and were not pursued further.
3

The indirect impact on loan portfolios operating through the balance sheet positions of borrowers could not be
investigated for lack of data on net foreign-currency exposure from households and companies. Banks report that
their internal risk-management guidelines prohibit lending to customers without foreign-exchange denominated
income. But to the extent that such risks do exist, they would be captured by the credit-risk scenario.

Interest-rate risk. Interest-rate risk was tested by a maturity gap model which measures the
differential effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of bank assets and liabilities arising from
maturity mismatches. An interest shock of ten percentage points was applied on top of the actual
interest rate of 10.6 percent. The results showed that the system is somewhat vulnerable to maturity
mismatches, with two banks falling below the statutory minimum CAR.
Combined shock. Finally, a cumulative shock scenario was applied to combine the impacts of the
99.5 percent confidence-interval exchange-rate shock, the historically-calibrated credit-default
shock, the failure of the largest borrower, and the interest rate shock. A shock of this depth and
intensity would turn capital ratios of three banks negative. Perhaps more surprisingly, even under this
extreme scenario two banks would remain (significantly) above the statutory minimum CAR.

Annex 5. Monetary Framework and Challenges
Since the adoption of a floating exchange rate in 2008, the Central Bank of Seychelles has anchored its
monetary policy framework with a nominal target on reserve money (monetary base). But while
monetary policy has successfully supported macroeconomic stabilization, reserve money targeting has
come along with volatile interest and inflation rates.1
The link between monetary aggregates and inflation is weak, and monetary aggregates have
displayed considerable volatility. Reserve money targeting proved successful in establishing
monetary discipline and bringing down inflation during the 2008 episode of high inflation. But the
correlation between reserve money growth rates and inflation has been weak, particularly in the
current low inflation environment, limiting the usefulness of reserve money as an indicator of future
inflation or as a tool for achieving the inflation target. This is in part due to the large import share in
the consumption basket and the robust pass-through from the U.S. dollar exchange rate to inflation
with a relatively short lag. Moreover, the system has been characterized by rising structural excess
liquidity, driven by an increase of the central bank‘s net foreign assets (NFA),2 and the pass-through
from short-term policy interest rates to the banking system‘s overall rate structure is weak. As a
result, interest rates, reserve money, and bank liquidity became more volatile during 2012.3

Regardless of the ultimate choice of the nominal anchor, to make the monetary policy
framework more effective it is first necessary to establish a functioning interest-rate channel.
This will require addressing the problem of structural excess liquidity through more durable
sterilization (i.e., longer-term instruments), even if the cost ultimately needs to be borne by the
central government budget. The removal of the liquidity overhang will help foster the interbank
market and establish a short-term interest rate that can be targeted by the CBS to manage the
supply of liquidity in the system.
Establishing an interest rate channel should be done under the current reserve money
framework, while working toward an eventual shift toward a flexible form of inflation
targeting. Key measures over the near- to medium term include:


Liquidity forecasts. Enhance the CBS‘ capacity for liquidity forecasting along more
extended time horizons.



Policy rate. Establish a reference interest rate for a preferred policy instrument and decrease
the number of auctions with commercial banks to achieve more market depth and to
encourage interbank market operations.



Liquidity control. Use the reference policy rate to target the level of bank reserves,
consistent with the reserve-money target. As the interbank market develops, use central
bank lending and deposit facilities to span an interest corridor for the money market rate.



Foreign-exchange interventions. Given the relatively weaker policy transmission through
the interest-rate channel, occasional direct interventions in the foreign-exchange markets
can be a complementary tool for monetary policy. The CBS should communicate clearly that
such interventions do not target a level of the exchange rate, rather are subordinated to
monetary policy objectives.



Inflation as medium-term nominal anchor. Clarify the operational meaning of the CBS‘
legal mandate for domestic price stability and formalize the inflation anchor that will replace
reserve money. Decide on the most appropriate definition and measure of the CBS‘ target
inflation rate, including the eventual use of an appropriate core index. Establish a target
range for inflation to allow for flexibility against unforeseen shocks.



Monetary policy decisions. Elevate the role of the CBS Board in monetary policy decisions.
In the transition period, continue to target reserve money, but at a later stage, relegate
reserve money to the role of an indicator for the monetary stance. Establish routines for
regular communication of economic developments, their implications for inflation
projections, and resulting monetary policy decisions to the general public.



Monetary analysis and inflation forecast. Develop a set of high-frequency financial and
real sector indicators for inflation factors. Investigate and determine the various transmission
channels (exchange rate, interest rate, and credit) and corresponding time lags of monetary
policy actions. Enrich the inflation forecast by including the impact of monetary policy
variables and use the emergence of gaps between inflation forecast values and target values
as input for monetary policy decisions.

Annex 6. Tourism Competitiveness

At around 30 percent of GDP, tourism is Seychelles’ major export industry, as well as a potential
channel through which external shocks affect the domestic economy. Seychelles has performed well,
attracting nearly four times more tourists than predicted by a gravity-type model of tourism flows.1
Seychelles has fared better than other small island tourist destinations. The country has been
steadily rebuilding its share in global tourist arrivals over the last decade (figure A6.1, left chart),
while most other small islands have seen flat (Oceania) or declining (Caribbean) shares. Seychelles‘
tourism industry has handled exceptionally well the years since the 2008 global crisis. Seychelles‘
tourist arrivals grew over 30 percent, while islands in the Caribbean have seen negative or negligible
growth over the same period (figure A6.1, right chart). This success can be directly linked to
Seychelles‘ ability to quickly diversify away from traditional European markets and its relative
proximity to emerging sources of luxury destination tourists.

Gravity model results show that Seychelles is highly competitive compared to other islands.
While comparing rates of growth and changes in global shares gives a useful indication of the
country‘s tourism performance over time, comparing the level of tourism arrivals is complicated by
the fact that tourism flows to each destination are subject to multiple objective factors, known in the
traditional international trade literature as trade frictions. Some of these cannot be influenced by
policies (at least not in a useful time frame), such as common borders, distances to main markets,
bilateral cultural and historical ties. Accounting for and eliminating these effects allows construction
of a ranking of countries‘ tourism competitiveness.2 Seychelles is doing much better than most other

Based on A. Culiuc ―The Determinants of Global Tourism Flows‖, IMF Working Paper (forthcoming). The study is
based on the application of the gravity model to a panel dataset containing the universe of bilateral tourism flows for
1999-2009, covering over 180 countries (underlying data from UNWTO).

The computed competitiveness index is the value of the country dummy in a fixed effects regression with bilateral
arrivals as explanatory variable and regressors including: GDPs of both countries, their population, areas, distances,
price levels, geographical characteristics, common culture and history (language, colonial relationship).

small islands with the sole exception of the Maldives (figure A6.2). Specifically, the country is
receiving around 3.7 times more tourists than the model predicts for the average small island with

The results of the tourism gravity model also shed light on Seychelles’ competitiveness on
different markets. The left chart in figure A6.3 plots the residuals (actual minus predicted values)
for Seychelles‘ largest origin markets from a gravity model regression with fixed origin and
destination effects. It shows that—after controlling for tourism trade frictions – Seychelles has been
doing unusually well in select European markets. Interestingly, although France is Seychelles‘ largest
market, the number of French tourists is precisely in line with the model‘s predictions. At the same
time, the large measured underperformance in China and India helps explain the rapid growth
registered on those markets since 2009 onwards (figure A6.3 right chart)—in other words, Seychelles
was catching up to its potential level. However, growth was not limited to previously
underperforming markets, as tourist arrivals from markets on which Seychelles already
overperformed in 2009 grew by 40 to 70 percent in the three years since then (Austria, Czech
Republic, Germany, Russia).

The tourism industry represents an important channel through which Seychelles is exposed to
the risks emanating from Europe. To quantify the impact of the potential slowdown, one requires
estimates of the elasticity of tourism arrival to GDP in tourist-originating countries. Using first
differences regression, staff estimates the global elasticity of tourist-arrivals at around 1.3; it is
however significantly lower (0.9) for small islands. Seychelles is therefore likely to see tourism
demand from key European markets drop nearly one-for-one should their economies contract.
Results also show that tourists are price sensitive; in response to a 1 percent appreciation in the
bilateral real exchange rate arrivals and average nights-stay drop 0.11 and 0.27 percent respectively
for a combined effect of 0.36 on total nights stayed. As recent experience shows, the negative
impact of a short-term reduction in European arrivals could be offset by market diversification.
However, if the shock were to prove protracted, maintaining high arrivals may only be possible
through re-branding, involving steep discounting and lower tourist spending, which may prove
detrimental in the long term to Seychelles‘ high-end reputation.

Annex 7. Cost and Availability of Bank Credit
The financial system in Seychelles shares many characteristics with other small states, which
limits its ability to support economic growth. Some of these characteristics are a direct
consequence of the limited market size, such as diseconomies of scale that hamper the supply of a
broader range of financial services or shallow financial markets with few players. To some extent,
these factors explain why small states are characterized by low availability of credit and high real
lending rates relative to other low- and middle-income countries.1 Among small-island economies,
Seychelles‘ real lending interest rate is comparable to peers, although the availability of credit for
the private sector—measured as bank lending to the private sector in terms of GDP—is somewhat
low.2

Comparing across countries, real lending rates are positively correlated with the spread between
lending and deposit interest rates. Loan-deposit spreads reflect inefficiencies and costs of financial
intermediation, such as limited competition in the banking sector, shallow financial markets, excess
liquidity, weak banking supervision, and the level of nonperforming loans. There is also a
pronounced negative correlation between the average level of inflation and bank credit to the
private sector, both in small island economies and other low- and middle-income countries.

access to finance are not available for Seychelles.

To improve access to and lower the cost of credit, policies in Seychelles should continue to
counteract and mitigate some of the natural disadvantages that come with a small financial sector.
For example, incentives and regulations should be geared toward fostering bank competition. There
is also scope to continue to improve business conditions such as creditors‘ legal rights and to move
bank supervision toward a forward-looking risk-based system. Taking steps to eliminate excess
liquidity will lower the costs of financial intermediation, while a strengthened monetary framework
that delivers on low and stable inflation is paramount to induce financial deepening and to promote
access to credit.

Annex 8. Labor Market
The labor market in Seychelles is a dual market comprised of Seychellois and expatriate workers. It is
characterized by high labor force participation by Seychellois (nearly 75 percent), predominantly in
the formal sector. The private sector is the largest employer (tourism services, construction, tuna
processing and light manufacturing) followed by government and parastatals. The government sets
the minimum hourly wage (SR 21 ($1.62) in 2012). Key social partners in the labor market include the
Seychelles Federation of Workers Union and the Association of Seychelles Employers. Unionization is
relatively low (around 15 percent), and collective bargaining rare. In first half of 2012, the average
monthly wage was SR 8,625 ($616).

While unemployment statistics are weak, household surveys do not indicate a large unemployment
problem. Survey-based data point to 2010 unemployment of 5.8 percent (2010 Census, versus
5.5 percent in the 2005 Labor Force Survey). Official estimates, which are based solely on registered
job seekers on the three main islands, have historically been lower.1 Measured youth unemployment
is low, however the 2010 Census indicates that over 40 percent of all self-declared job seekers are
aged 15–24. The typical job seeker is thought to be young, female, with primary and secondary
education, although this may partly reflect the predominance of single mothers and the requirement
to register with an employment agency in order to receive welfare and social benefits.
Jobs on offer exceed the number of people looking for a job in all job categories, indicating that
domestic unemployment is mostly structural. A key factor is labor skill mismatch. Employment
agencies report that job seekers lack qualifications, skills and experience—this is particularly the case
for managerial and technical openings. The government has two programs aimed at placing
participants in positions to receive on-the-job training and experience: the Skills Acquisition
Program (SAP), targeted at 15–20 year olds who have dropped out of secondary school, and a Skills
Development Program (SDP), targeted at post-secondary students who have dropped out of tertiary
education or older job-career changers. Under both programs participants receive a monthly
allowance (paid by government for the SDP and 60/40 government-employer for the SAP).
Strengthening secondary education, especially in math and science, and transferring vocational
training to the private sector may further serve to narrow the skills mismatch.
1

Official statistics became highly unreliable following the 2009 transfer of the job placement service to the private
sector, mostly as a result of job seekers registering with multiple agencies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

SEYCHELLES

Other possible factors driving unemployment are the high reservation wage, and distaste for shift
and factory work. Employers and employment agencies report that the ample social security system
may provide a disincentive to enter the workforce and/or raise the reservation wage beyond the
wage on offer. This is thought to be true for youth, who often prefer to rely on family networks for
support than take available ―undesirable‖ jobs (construction, fish processing, hotel shift work) and in
some cases are unemployable due to substance abuse. In 2010, some 14 percent of youth aged 15–
24 was neither in education nor in employment (2010 census). The labor ministry has also identified
a phenomenon of ―wait to work‖ in which labor identifies their preferred job and waits for it to
become available rather than take a job presently on offer.
Data suggest that employment of Seychellois has remained stable during the recent growth
episode. Between 2003 and 2011 (last year for which detailed labor data are available), the share of
expatriates in total employment has increased from 6 percent to 26 percent (figure A8.2, left panel).
This has been traced to a shortage of qualified local labor, especially in the construction sector (e.g.,
masons). Moreover, foreign labor growth is more strongly correlated with GDP growth than
domestic employment growth (figure A8.2, right panel), suggesting that the private sector prefers to
accommodate changes in demand by varying the number of expatriate workers.

ticket, and provides food and housing (or a supplement to cover these costs). Even when these
additional costs are excluded from the comparison, base wages are reportedly often higher than for
Seychellois workers in the same job category (no data available). Despite these higher costs,
employers often prefer expatriate employees who are reportedly willing to work longer hours and
may demand fewer benefits under the law.
Starting in 2013, approval of work permits has shifted from Immigration to the Ministry of Labor,
with heightened vigilance over contracts and working/living conditions of non-Seychellois labor.
The change in regulatory environment has led to uncertainty regarding the validity of the quota
system and the ability of the tourism sector to hire needed foreign labor.

Box A8.1. Seychelles—Labor Market Legislation and Benefits
The main acts regulating employment and industrial relations are:



Employment Act 1995, as amended in 1999, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010;



Conditions of Employment Regulations 1991, as lastly amended in 2006; and



Industrial Relations Act.

The Ministry of Education, Employment and Human Resources (MEEHR) is responsible for labor issues
through its Employment Department.
In August 2010, a tripartite Committee was formed to review the Employment Act with technical
assistance from the ILO. In its Memorandum of Technical Comments on the Draft Amendments to the
Employment Act of the Republic of Seychelles (February 2011), the ILO noted that the available version of
the Employment Act currently in force contains some, but not all amendments adopted in previous years.
Therefore, it is difficult for workers and employers to know their rights and obligations and hence comply
with labor legislation.
Under the Employment Act, the same benefits and conditions apply regardless of contract type (i.e.,
continuous, fixed-term, part-time or casual):



Benefits (Section 43): annual leave, maternity leave, sick leave, leave for the purpose of fulfilling or in
connection with any civic duties, unpaid leave and maternity leave benefits.



The Conditions of Employment Regulations (S.I. 34 of 1991) provide additional benefits, namely
compassionate leave and education leave.



Seychellois employees on continuous employment and fixed term contracts are entitled to 21 days
paid annual leave (pro-rated if less than a year and for part-time employment).



A casual worker who has worked for the same employer for 5 consecutive days is entitled to half of
his day‘s pay in lieu of leave.



Regarding compassionate leave (e.g., loss of a relative), leave in excess of 4 days in a period of 12
months may either be unpaid or, at the discretion of the employer, may be deducted from the
worker‘s entitlement to annual leave.



A worker shall also be allowed reasonable time off work, with or without pay at the discretion of the
employer, to attend to matters which cannot normally be attended to except during the worker‘s
working hours.

The Employment Act (Section 51) also sets out the procedures and costs related to redundancy.
Employers must seek approval of MEEHR and go through a negotiation procedure. For workers under
continuous employment contracts, severance pay is calculated at five-sixth of one day‘s wage for each
completed month of service (pro-rated for part-time workers); the rate is double in the case of fixed-term
contracts. Workers being made redundant shall be given one-half day leave per week during the notice
period to enable them to secure employment. In the case that a worker does not agree to a change in
the conditions of employment it is possible to fire the worker—the same severance payment applies. No
severance is paid if the worker is fired outright.
The same terms and conditions of employment under the Employment Act apply to expatriate workers.
Expatriate workers may also participate in the grievance (mediation) procedure and/or bring their case
before the Employment Tribunal. However, anecdotal evidence suggests low compliance with labor laws
regarding expatriates (who work longer hours and will not raise grievances), perhaps due to more limited
understanding by workers of their rights under the law.

Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the
Stand-By Arrangement for Seychelles. The assessment completed in 2008 found high risks in all
areas of the CBS‘s safeguards framework, and several measures were included in the program. An
update assessment in relation to the Extended Fund Facility, which was completed in July 2010,
found that the authorities have implemented most of the measures recommended by the 2008
assessment. In particular, governance oversight at the CBS is now exercised by the Board and
management committees, and transparency improved through application of International
Financial Reporting Standards and the publication of financial statements that have been audited in
accordance with international standards. The 2011 amendments to the CBS Act have strengthened
the legal framework and the independence of the central bank. CBS governance has also been
improved through continuous strengthening of the internal audit and control mechanisms. Given
the recent augmentation of access under the EFF-supported program (approved December 17,
2012), the CBS is currently undergoing an update safeguards assessment.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The exchange market was liberalized in November 2008, which resulted in the elimination of all
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions that are
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4. The exchange rate regime is
floating. On February 28, 2013 US$ 1 = SR 12.547 (mid rate).
Article IV Consultations:
Seychelles is currently under a 24 month consultation cycle.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of December 31, 2012)
The African Development Bank Group commenced operations with the Republic of Seychelles in
1978 and has since approved 27 operations comprising 16 projects, seven studies, three lines of
credit and one emergency assistance operation. There were no approvals between February 2000
and November 2006 when the country was under sanctions, except for an emergency assistance
grant worth US$500,000 to deal with the Tsunami disaster in January 2005. Cumulative approvals as
of December 2012 amounted to UA 94.51 million (about US$145 million).
An Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was approved by the Board on April 22, 2009. The ISN covered the
period 2009 and 2010 and focused on a single pillar, namely supporting the Government‘s reform
program to achieve sustainable growth. One of the successful operations implemented during the
ISN was an unprecedented policy-based partial guarantee operation for US$10 million approved on
December 12, 2009, in support of an exchange bond offered to external commercial creditors in the
context of the public debt restructuring effort. The guarantee was instrumental in generating a high
participation in the debt exchange offer. A Completion Report of the ISN undertaken in October
2010 noted that the Bank Group had maintained strategic responsiveness and flexibility, thereby
ensuring success of its assistance.
Taking into account its performance, the lessons learnt and the Government strategy, the Bank
prepared a full five year country strategy, which was approved by the Board in April 2011. The
current Country Strategy Paper (CSP) covers the period 2011–15 and focuses on one pillar of
support, ―Strengthening Private Sector Development and Competitiveness‖, which is divided into
three complementary sub-pillars; infrastructure development, enabling financing and regulatory
environment, and human capacity development.
The lending program during this period includes an ICT project, the Seychelles East Africa
Submarine cable amounting to US$12 million, a water and sanitation project amounting to €8 million, a mariculture development project, a line of credit, and an institutional support project. The
Submarine cable project, which was financed in collaboration with the European Investment Bank
(EIB), has since been successfully implemented with the project being completed in August 2012.
In addition to the lending program, a non-lending program worth €2.9 million to be financed by
the various Bank-managed Trust Funds and Technical Assistance Funds was proposed to be
implemented during the CSP. The proposed non-lending programs are in the areas of Human
Development, Regional Integration, Statistical Capacity Building, Infrastructure and Private Sector
Development.
The Bank and the Government of Seychelles will undertake a mid-term review (MTR) of the CSP in
2013. The MTR will review progress made towards attaining the objectives of the CSP, assess
whether the CSP pillar is still aligned with the government strategy and identify new developments
in the country that might need to be incorporated in the remaining period of the CSP
implementation.

SEYCHELLES

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but it is broadly adequate for surveillance. The country
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2006 and in
government finance statistics modules of the Anglophone Africa project funded by the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID). Good progress has been achieved in improving
statistical capacity, but sustained technical assistance and additional resources will be required for
statistical development over the medium term in order to improve the quality of economic statistics.
Seychelles is invited to a DFID-sponsored SDDS Workshop in Gaborone, Botswana during May 6–8,
2013, which focuses on selected Anglophone African countries that currently participate in the
GDDS, but could be expected to either graduate to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS),
or make significant progress toward this goal, within a three-year period.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts data are prepared on a calendar-year basis with 2006 serving as the base year for
constant price measures. In November 2012, the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) published new
provisional national accounts estimates for 2011. There are considerable delays in compiling and
disseminating volume measures of GDP estimates. The NSB is developing quarterly national
accounts data for the period 2006-12; the estimates suffer from data source weaknesses, and so will
continue to be produced, but not disseminated for at least the remainder of 2013. Once the annual
estimates for GDP for 2012 are compiled (in the fourth quarter of 2013), annual and quarterly
estimates will be reconciled for 2012; at this time experimental quarterly estimates may be
published. Tourism statistics are compiled on a weekly and monthly basis. Production indicators are
compiled quarterly, and both are reported to the IMF in a timely manner. Data on average earnings
and employment by sector are collected on a quarterly basis by the NSB, but there are no data on
unit labor costs. A new consumer price index (CPI) was introduced from October 2007. It utilizes
expenditure weights derived from the household budget survey of 2006- 2007. The base period is
July 2007.
Government Finance Statistics
Seychelles reports to STA the cash flow statements and financial balance sheet data based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001). Main recommendations of the 2011 GFS
mission were: (i) establish a GFS task force among Treasury, Financial Planning and Control Division
(FPC), Debt Management staff, and other relevant agencies to discuss and resolve technical and
methodological issues; (ii) establish a strategic plan that specifies how to address weaknesses in
terms of: (1) augmenting the cash recording of transactions in the execution of the budget with
relevant accrual-based measures; (2) improving data on other economic flows for financial assets
and liabilities; and, (3) addressing the lack of stock data on government holdings of nonfinancial
assets, beginning with fixed assets and non-produced assets (lands).

SEYCHELLES
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary and financial sector data are reported regularly to STA for publication in the IFS. The
analytical framework underlying the compilation of monetary statistics is generally sound. An
integrated monetary database has been developed and is fully operational using the standardized
report forms (SRF) for reporting monetary data to the Fund. The SRF-based monetary data have
been published in the IFS Supplement since its March 2007 issue.
External Sector Statistics
The authorities have made substantial progress in adopting the methodology of the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual. Annual balance of payments data are reported to the Statistics and
African Departments nine months after the reference period, but provisional estimates are provided
to missions earlier. Quarterly BOP data have been compiled since 2009, and are now publicly
available. Merchandise trade data are reported on a quarterly basis. Considerable progress has been
made in collecting and updating data on public sector external debt and debt-service and external
payments arrears. Remaining priority areas include improving the coverage of external sector
statistics and compiling international investment position.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 13/52
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 15, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Seychelles
On May 8, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Seychelles.1 32
Background
In the few years since the 2008 debt crisis, Seychelles has made remarkable strides, quickly
restoring macroeconomic stability and creating room for private-sector activity. Macroeconomic
developments in the tourism-based island economy have been favorable, despite the challenging
global environment. Notably, growth held up as the tourism industry successfully attracted arrivals
from non-traditional markets as European arrivals slumped, while a surge in foreign direct
investment (FDI) supported construction in recent years. For the most part, inflation remained
contained, and the external position improved markedly following liberalization of the exchange rate
in 2008 and debt restructuring started in 2009.
In 2012, despite robust tourist arrivals, growth moderated to 2.9 percent as large investment
projects were completed. Inflation spiked in July 2012 to 8.9 percent fueled by global as well as
domestic developments, but has since abated as a result of successful monetary tightening. The
external position continued to improve, albeit modestly. In particular, the current account deficit
declined slightly, but remained high at around 22 percent of GDP, but was fully financed by FDI and
external borrowing, leading to a modest rise in reserves. Debt restructuring is nearly complete, with
only one loan agreement awaiting signature.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 73

SEYCHELLES

Fiscal policy in 2012 continued to support debt sustainability. The primary surplus is projected to
have risen to 6.2 percent of GDP in part due to sizable windfall revenues which were partly saved.
Buoyant revenue and grants paved the way for needed capital expenditure. Notwithstanding, public
debt increased by over 3 percentage points of GDP due mostly to currency depreciation and the
government assuming liabilities of Air Seychelles.
Monetary policy was tightened sharply in 2012 in response to rising inflation and an unhinging of the
exchange rate, and has since been relaxed. Starting in late-2011, rising global food and fuel prices
coupled with adjustments in administered prices pushed prices higher. This was reinforced by
current account pressures resulting from lower exports of transportation services in the wake of the
restructuring of Air Seychelles. The looming inflation-depreciation spiral was broken in mid-2012 by
two small foreign exchange market interventions by the Central Bank of Seychelles and a tightening
of monetary policy. By end-2012, inflation had fallen to 5.8 percent and the exchange rate had
strengthened beyond its end-2011 level.
Broad-based structural reform over the past five years has worked to improve financial performance
of the public sector and increase private sector participation in economic activity. Statistical capacity
continues to be strengthened. Seychelles subscribes to the IMF’s General Data Dissemination
Standard (GDDS) and is making progress at compiling higher frequency economic data which will
support strengthened macroeconomic oversight and analysis.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their strong policy implementation. Macroeconomic
stability has been restored and growth has remained resilient. While the outlook is favorable, the
economy is vulnerable to an uncertain global environment and domestic risks. Directors called for
continued commitment to sound policies and structural reforms to preserve macroeconomic and
financial stability, build policy buffers, and foster strong and inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the steps to improve financial discipline at the central government level
and the recent introduction of the VAT. They agreed that strengthening the oversight and financial
position of parastatals, including through adequate price mechanisms, and further progress in public
financial management will be key to ensuring fiscal sustainability. For the medium term, Directors
supported the authorities’ fiscal policy stance which aims at targeting a primary fiscal surplus and
reducing public debt to 50 percent of GDP. They welcomed that the debt restructuring is nearly
complete and encouraged the authorities to exercise caution when contracting new external debt.

74 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
TIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES
Directors called for continued efforts to improve the monetary framework in order to stabilize
inflation expectations and policy interest rates. Absorbing excess liquidity over time will be important
to strengthen the monetary anchor and monetary transmission mechanism. Directors considered
that a further increase in international reserves, as market conditions permit, would provide a
stronger buffer against shocks. Directors noted that the financial system is sound and welcomed the
steps being taken to improve the functioning of the credit market.
Directors commended the efforts towards improving the business and investment climate,
which is key to avoid a potential middle-income trap and to support broad-based growth. They
encouraged the authorities to foster private sector-led growth by addressing infrastructure gaps,
engendering lower cost and improved access to credit, correcting data weaknesses, and moving
ahead with plans for greater workforce education and capacity building.

IMF Executive Board Completes the Seventh Review Under the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) for Seychelles and Approves US$5.0 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
seventh review of Seychelles‘ economic performance under a program supported by
the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).1 Completion of the review permits the immediate
disbursement of SDR 3.3 million (about US$5.0 million), bringing total disbursements
under the four-year arrangement to SDR 23.1 million (about US$34.9 million). At the
same meeting, the Executive Board also concluded the 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Seychelles, details of which will be published in due course in a Public Information
Notice
The Executive Board approved a three-year EFF arrangement for Seychelles in
December 2009 in an amount equivalent to SDR 19.8 million (then about US$31.1 million—see Press Release No. 09/472). The arrangement was extended by one year in
December 2012 to support the country‘s economic reform program, with an
augmentation of access of SDR 6.6 million (about US$10.0 million)—equivalent to
60.6 percent of Seychelles‘ quota.
Following the Executive Board‘s discussion of Seychelles, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
―The authorities‘ strong commitment to macroeconomic stability has helped the
economy overcome the 2008 balance of payments and debt crisis, and return to a path
of continued growth, low inflation, fiscal surpluses, and declining debt. While the
outlook is benign, the economy remains vulnerable to an uncertain global environment.
Going forward, policies and structural reforms should aim at preserving macroeconomic
and financial stability, raising policy buffers, and fostering stronger and inclusive
growth.

Assistance under the EFF can be provided to help countries facing serious medium-term balance of payments
problems because of structural weaknesses that require time to address. Assistance under the EFF features longer
program engagement—to help countries implement medium-term structural reforms—and a longer repayment
period. (See http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/eff.htm). Details on Seychelles‘ current arrangement are

―The authorities have made important strides toward improving financial discipline at
the central government level. To ensure fiscal sustainability, it will be critical to
strengthen the oversight and financial position of parastatals and to make further
progress in public financial management. For the medium term, the government is
rightly targeting a primary fiscal surplus of around 5 percent of GDP in order to reach
the goal of reducing public debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2018. The debt restructuring
is largely completed, and caution should be exercised when contracting new external
debt.
―On monetary policy, durably removing excess liquidity is the needed first step toward
strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism, and will require a transparent
and credible mechanism to cover the fiscal cost of sterilization. A further increase in the
reserve coverage would provide a stronger buffer against shocks.
―Structural reforms should aim to deepen markets and to foster inclusive and broadbased growth. Recent improvements in the business climate are welcome. Stronger
efforts towards broadening access to credit, enhancing infrastructure, addressing data
weaknesses, and reducing skills mismatches in the labor market would further facilitate
private sector development.‖

Statement by Mr. Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for Seychelles
and Ms. NghiLuu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 8, 2013
Our Seychellois authorities’ unwavering commitment to the economic reform agenda has
yielded impressive results. Past reform efforts continue to bear fruit and have helped position the
economy towards a strong and sustainable growth path. Seychelles, however, remains highly
vulnerable to external shocks, due to its reliance on tourism and imports, which are inherent
features of its economy. To ensure that macroeconomic stability is maintained, the government
is determined to build adequate buffers to mitigate downside risks, address structural
impediments to growth and to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies in accordance with
program targets.
Economic Development and Outlook
Despite challenging economic conditions last year, the Seychellois economy remained resilient,
achieving real GDP growth of 2.9 percent in 2012. A tightening in monetary policy to cope with
high inflation, coupled with a slowdown in tourism from traditional European markets led to a
moderation in growth.
There are promising signs that economic activity has picked up in the first few months of 2013,
underpinned by a fall in inflation and a strong recovery in tourism. Seychelles has managed to
successfully diversify and expand into new tourist markets. The tropical cyclone which hit
Seychelles in January is expected to have a small adverse effect on GDP, with reconstruction
activity offsetting some of the impact. While the budget is expected to incur some of the
recovery cost, we believe the objective of achieving a primary surplus of 5 percent of GDP can
still be met this year.
Prospects for Seychelles over the near and medium term are favorable, as the economy has
responded well to the economic reform program. The Seychellois economy is expected to gain
momentum over the next two years as inflationary pressure abates and benefits of recent reforms
begin to materialize. Real GDP growth is forecast to grow around 3.3 percent in 2013 and 3.9
percent in 2014. Investment is expected to peak over this period, and unemployment and
inflation are expected to remain low.
The current account deficit is expected to narrow as FDI moderates from the strong flows
experienced in recent years and international reserves are forecast to remain above the riskweighted reserve metric over the medium term, but slightly below three months of import
coverage. The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) will remain attune to favorable conditions for
reserve accumulation, to meet the government’s objective of rebuilding buffers.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities’ strong commitment to achieving fiscal surplus is an important source of
stability for the economy. The good fiscal performance has also added credibility to the task of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

bringing public debt down to 50 percent of GDP by 2018, which remains well on track. The
government’s objective is to run primary surplus of around 5 percent of GDP per year over the
medium term.
Our government is maintaining tight control over spending, including through the establishment
of the Public Enterprise Monitoring Commission (PEMC). The PEMC will assist in
strengthening the oversight of parastatals and will lead to greater compliance with reporting
requirements. Our authorities share staff’s assessment that improving the financial performance
of parastatals will be important for fiscal sustainability.
Efforts to strengthen public financial management are being complemented by broader public
sector reforms. Most notably, the preparation of the financial instructions and accounting
manuals related to the Public Financial Management Act and the compilation of data under the
new Chart of Accounts. The central government’s decision to adopt program-based budgeting
will strengthen PFM practices, and this initiative will be developed with technical assistance
support from donors.
Monetary Policy
Inflation remained elevated in 2012, but has been on a downward trend over the past 8 months
as a result of central bank intervention, rupee appreciation, and a moderation in food and
commodity prices. The introduction of the VAT in January 2013 led to a temporary pick-up in
inflation, which was offset by an appreciation of the rupee, which is currently at its highest level
in more than three years.
Seychelles has been susceptible to bouts of liquidity overhang, with excess liquidity emerging
again as a key challenge for the central bank at the start of 2013. To absorb the excess liquidity,
our government is considering the possibility of issuing longer term instruments. While the
adoption of reserve money target as a nominal anchor for monetary policy has played a useful
stabilizing role in the period following the floating of the exchange rate in 2008, its
effectiveness as a guide for inflation expectations is currently being reviewed.
The CBS recognizes the limitations with the current framework for monetary policy and that a
more flexible regime is needed to achieve the central bank objective of domestic price stability.
Strengthening the monetary framework and improving the monetary transmission mechanism
will give the CBS more control over liquidity management and more flexibility in implementing
monetary policy. Our authorities appreciate the technical assistance provided by MCM in
February to strengthen the monetary policy framework and to begin work on establishing an
alternative operational target. The central bank concurs with staff’s recommendation that
establishing a reference interest rate is an important first step. Authorities also took strong note
of staff’s advice that regular public communication of economic conditions and monetary policy
decisions is crucial to establishing central bank credibility, transparency, and to anchor inflation
expectations.

Steps are also being taken to improve the functioning of the credit market and the banking
sector. The CBS is monitoring credit and price developments closely, and continues to make
good use of technical assistance from the IMF. Open and frank dialogue between the Ministry of
Finance and the CBS on financial reform is continuing regularly. At the same time, our
authorities will continue to work with commercial banks to strengthen the financial sector and to
create a competitive business environment to foster growth in small and medium enterprises.
The recent establishment of the stock exchange should also support the development of the
private sector.
Structural Reform
The Seychellois economy has achieved impressive results from extensive reforms pursued over
the past few years, but the structural reform process is not yet complete. Maintaining the
momentum on reform is important to the Seychellois Government and will help consolidate the
recovery from the 2008 crisis. Ensuring continuity and discipline in policy making are key
ingredients for the longer term success of the economy.
The government has been proactive in progressing key reforms while cognizant of the
constraints faced by small, open and remote economies. As highlighted in the staff report, the
unique features of microstates can make it difficult to develop significant depth and competition
in the financial sector. Nonetheless, Seychelles scored well in the 2013 Doing Business
indicators and investor confidence in Seychelles remains strong, as evident by the ongoing
strong inflow of FDI.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda is focused on: strengthening PFM, improving the
financial discipline of the public sector and public enterprises, transitioning towards a more
flexible monetary policy framework, and completing the implementation of utility tariffs
rebalancing over seven years. Lifting institutional capacity and strengthening policy
implementation capabilities will enhance the timely delivery of these reforms.
Reforming the labor market to reduce skill mismatch and to lower structural unemployment will
also need to be addressed. As a middle-income microstate with full employment, an ongoing
inflow of foreign workers will be needed to sustain economic growth. The integration of foreign
workers into the labor force will be balanced against the need to develop the skills base of the
Seychellois work force.
The Seychellois economy is in the midst of a period of extensive reform that has broad
implications for the wider population. Comprehensive reforms are being pursued along many
fronts, and authorities are aware that the social safety net for the most vulnerable must be
protected to compensate for the social impact of reforms. Our authorities recognize that
adjustments to the welfare system are required to keep pace with the broader changes in the
economy. To this end, means testing will be increasingly used to determine eligibility for social
welfare.

Extended Arrangement under EFF
Program performance throughout the life of the EFF has been exemplary. Our Seychellois
authorities comfortably met all end-December quantitative performance criteria and structural
benchmarks. As staff notes, authorities have a proven record of implementing past staff advice
and a strong performance record under the EFF. The overperformance in the end-December
2012 Net International Reserves (NIR) target has prompted our authorities to request for
modification of the end-June 2013 performance criterion, and the end-September and endDecember 2013 indicative targets for NIR.
As noted in previous Buff statements on the review of the EFF, a key factor in the success of the
program has been the high level of ownership by the authorities. Adherence to the targets set
under the program has helped support macroeconomic stability and instilled discipline on policy
formation, which coupled with intensive technical assistance, ensured that ‘best practices’ were
being developed and implemented. With the program due to expire at the end of the year, the
Seychellois authorities are keen to maintain their strong collaboration with the Fund and look
forward to discussions on possible successor arrangements over the course of the year.
Finally, our Seychellois authorities would like to express their gratitude to Management, the TA
mission teams, the IMF mission chief and her team for their continued hard work and dedication
in helping to shape Seychelles’ economic reform agenda.
