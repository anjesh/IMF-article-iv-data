INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GUYANA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Guyana
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Dhaneshwar Ghura
January 5, 2011
 Context. President Jagdeo is in his final term in office, and general elections are due in 2011.
Guyana has become a magnet for environmental issues, given its large forestry reserves. In this
context, its prospects hinge in part on a Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) for structural
transformation. The macroeconomic outlook is generally positive. On the downside, risks include
global uncertainty, weak public enterprises especially the sugar company, delays in grant
disbursements, and a widening external current account deficit. The authorities will need to pay
careful attention to balancing infrastructural needs with fiscal and debt sustainability.

 Focus of the consultation. Discussions focused on a strategy for maintaining fiscal and debt
sustainability over the medium term. Staff encouraged the authorities to lock in the gains from
recent debt relief and fiscal consolidation, and recommended maintaining a strong fiscal stance
and addressing public enterprise weaknesses. Staff welcomed the LCDS as an overall framework
for transformation and cautioned against the contingent fiscal liabilities associated with the large
Amaila Falls project. While welcoming ongoing regulatory reforms, staff urged sustained
vigilance in monitoring financial sector risks, given the ongoing housing boom. Discussions also
covered policies to enhance economic flexibility and resilience to shocks, while reducing poverty.
The authorities broadly agreed with these recommendations.
 Exchange rate system. Guyana’s de jure exchange rate regime is floating and the Fund has
classified the de facto regime as a stabilized arrangement. There have been no changes in the
exchange system and the related legal framework since the last Article IV Consultation.
 Mission. The team, comprising Therese Turner-Jones (Head), Garth P. Nicholls, Daniel
Rodríguez-Delgado (all WHD), and Carlos Janada (FIN), visited Guyana during November 8–18,
2010. Leslie-Ann Des Vignes, (OED, Senior Advisor) and Calvin Djiofack (World Bank) also
participated in the discussions. The team met with President Jagdeo, Prime Minister Hinds,
Minister of Finance Ashni Singh, Central Bank Governor Lawrence Williams, representatives of
the private sector, labor, and the donor community, and members of the political opposition.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Despite external and domestic shocks, in 2010 the Guyanese economy
demonstrated resilience and registered a fifth consecutive year of robust growth.

Real output is estimated to have grown by around 3½ percent in 2010. This
performance, which is below that envisaged in the 2010 budget (4½ percent) and higher than
the outturn in 2009, reflected strength in the gold and services sectors. The sugar sector
continued to be hampered by labor shortages and factory problems. Inflation is estimated to
have picked up to 4.4 percent at year-end, from 3.7 percent in 2009, due to hikes in food
prices.

Albeit fully financed, the external current account deficit has widened. Despite
higher exports (bauxite, gold) and rising remittances, the current account deficit is estimated
to have widened from 8.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 11.4 percent in 2010, driven by lower
sugar prices and higher fuel costs (Box 1).1 In the capital account, private inflows moderated,
but steady public external financing helped keep gross reserves at the equivalent of about five
months of imports at end-2010.

deficit could reach 5.2 percent of GDP.
The authorities are exploring financing options, including the use of existing PetroCaribe
savings.2

1

Although Guyana no longer benefits from preferential prices in the European market, transitional
arrangements are in place until September 2015.

2

This is a contingency plan, in the event that the grants are not be disbursed by end-December 2010, as
envisaged by the authorities. At end-September 2010, the accumulated PetroCaribe savings amounted to about
5 percent of GDP. These funds (US$108 million) are held abroad.

4
Box 1. The Impact of Higher Oil Prices in Guyana
The Guyanese economy is particularly exposed to oil price movements, as it relies exclusively on
imports for its oil consumption. In 2010, oil-related imports represented some 16 percent of GDP
and were a main driver in the widening of the external current account deficit. Part of these imports
(4 percent of GDP) is required for electricity generation by the public electricity company Guyana
Power & Light (GPL), which uses antiquated, energy intensive processes.
Changes in oil prices have a significant impact on the fiscal accounts. First, as GPL relies on fuel
imports to generate electricity, a 10 percent increase in oil prices is associated with deterioration in its
operational balance of about 0.4 percentage points of GDP (assuming that electricity prices are left
unchanged). Second, tax revenue is affected through the ad-valorem excise tax on fuel sales. In recent
years, the government has lowered the tax to counteract the effect of oil price increases.1 Under the
assumption that changes in the excise tax absorb half of any given increase, a 10 percent rise in world
oil prices boosts tax revenue by 0.6 percentage points of GDP.
The external current account balance is vulnerable to oil price shocks. Oil price shocks are
mostly reflected in the fuel import bill, with a minor effect also on non factor services. A 10 percent
increase in oil prices widens the current account deficit by 1¼ percentage points of GDP. This
deterioration is almost fully transmitted to the overall balance, notwithstanding the access to
PetroCaribe financing, as the authorities have been saving most of these resources abroad.
__________________________
1

This measure is temporary. A central role of the Low Carbon Development Strategy is to enable a structural
transformation, thus lowering exposure to oil prices. Further, as oil prices are projected to stabilize over the medium term
and Guyana’s dependence on oil would lessen as it switches to hydroelectricity, this type of price mechanism would play a
lesser role. Staff will review this mechanism with the authorities in future discussions.

bill rates have fallen below
inflation, which has been relatively subdued. The currency has remained broadly stable
against the U.S. dollar, in the context of a steady increase in reserves. Most financial system
indicators improved markedly through end-September 2010, including the NPL ratio which
has declined to 6 percent of total loans.

5
2.

During 2010, reform efforts continued in the fiscal and financial sectors.


Fiscal Sector. Reforms at the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) have continued,
including streamlining the new functional organization, further improvements in the
integrated tax information system (TRIPS), profiling of tax payers and implementation of onsite inspections in the country’s ports of entry, and more intensive training to personnel.

Financial Sector. To support development of the credit market and improve lending
conditions, the authorities passed the Credit Bureau Act, and guidelines for its operations are
being prepared. In addition, legislation was passed in parliament bringing the mortgage
institution New Building Society (NBS) under the supervision of the Bank of Guyana.
3.

Other reforms in 2010 were in support of long term growth.


Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). The authorities shepherded the signing
of a LCDS trusteeship agreement between Norway and the World Bank on the administration
of a US$250 million payment pledged to Guyana by Norway, paving the way for the annual
disbursements to commence. A Multi-Stakeholder Steering Committee has been formed to
oversee the selection of investment projects (Attachment I).

Sugar Sector. Modernization plans continue with the reorientation of cane fields to
better accommodate mechanization. Meanwhile, work also continued on the sugar packing
plant, which is part of the overall strategy to improve revenue, and is expected to come on
stream in early 2011.

Infrastructure. During 2010 the authorities started a project to improve the
distribution and transmission of electricity throughout Guyana. The Guyana Power and Light
Company (GPL) is also installing additional generation capacity to replace worn out
equipment and correct for longstanding underinvestment in generation capacity. In the area
of information technology, a fiber-optic cable project linking Guyana and Brazil is being
installed, which would facilitate the introduction of e-government. In the housing sector,
additional external resources have been secured for the expansion of low income housing.
Finally, work has commenced on the access road to the AFHP site, while enhancement work
is soon to start on the road from Georgetown and the international airport.

Poverty reduction. The authorities are currently preparing an outline of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for discussion with the Cabinet Committee on Finance by
July 2011. They are assessing the costs of achieving the MDGs with technical donor support.

6
Box 2. Key Policy Recommendations of the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Staff’s advice centered on the need to:







Preserve the prudent policy framework to further entrench fiscal and debt sustainability;
Maintain a cautious monetary policy stance to contain inflation;
Carefully monitor asset quality and enhance prudential measures;
Continue with the ongoing structural reforms to modernize the sugar sector and diversify
Guyana’s productive base, which are critical to sustaining long-term growth and alleviating
poverty;
Enhance data quality and dissemination and subscribe to the GDDS.

Authorities’ views. While there was broad agreement on the need to preserve a prudent policy
framework to further entrench fiscal and debt sustainability, the fiscal consolidation achieved in
2009 allowed for a somewhat more gradual pace for fiscal tightening in 2010–11. In their view,
this would help accommodate priority infrastructure spending, and support growth.

II. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
The baseline macroeconomic outlook remains positive for 2011, an election year,
and the medium term. Guyana is on the cusp of major changes, led by the government’s Low
Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) and private sector investments in gold, oil, and gas
sectors as well as the large PPP associated with the construction of hydroelectric plant AFHP
(Attachment II). These investments should sustain growth levels above the long-run trend of
3 percent, to around 5 percent over the medium term. While fully financed, the external current
account deficit would narrow somewhat in 2011—largely on account of receipts from the
GRIF3—before widening in subsequent years as the AFHP is being constructed.

5.
Risks remain, but are more balanced over the longer term. On the upside, Guyana
stands to gain from the global carbon credit market on account of its large rainforests, and the
implementation of the LCDS. While gold and sugar prices are at historical highs, Guyana
will also benefit over time from lower electricity prices. Downside risks include those linked
to a potential overheating in the economy, volatile commodity prices, fiscal pressures from
weak public enterprises (GUYSUCO, GPL, and the National Insurance Scheme), and some
aid volatility. Finally, the sustained large current account deficit may also become a source of
risk.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Discussions took place against the backdrop of favorable economic performance
and prospects, while the authorities confront complex decisions requiring careful
preparation. Thus, the focus was on establishing:

A Policy Framework to Contain Fiscal Risks and Protect Debt Sustainability.
While the LCDS is viewed as a platform for transforming the economy, it is a long term
process. Immediate needs include minimizing the fiscal impact from underperforming public
enterprises, volatile aid commitments, and rising oil prices. Focusing on a strategy for
maintaining fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium term is critical, as well as
considering how Guyana can best cope with the impact of its incipient oil and gas
exploitation.4

A Framework to Anchor Prices and Protect Financial Stability. Keeping inflation
relatively low and maintaining vigilance over the financial system remain important features
of macroeconomic policy to guarantee stability.

An Agenda for Supporting Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction. Enhancing
the performance of public enterprises, minimizing exposure to risks in the context of
upcoming PPPs, measures to lock in gains from natural resource development and expanding
economic opportunities from the LCDS are all key to sustaining long-term growth and
reducing poverty. The impact of the Amaila Falls project will need to be carefully monitored,
during the construction (end-2011–14) as well as at the operational stages (2015 onward) to
ensure that the economic benefits materialize as expected, especially on energy costs and
GPL’s balance sheet.

4

Several companies, including CGX and Repsol, are moving ahead with exploration. Some private estimates
place potential oil reserves at 15.2 billion barrels, consistent with production of 50 million barrels a year.

8
A. Policy Framework to Contain Fiscal Risks and Protect Debt Sustainability
Fiscal Policies
7.
The authorities view fiscal
consolidation as a priority in 2011 and
over the medium term to protect debt
sustainability. Despite some easing in
2010, the 2011 budget and medium term
plans envisage a tightening of the fiscal
stance. The path would lower the NFPS
deficit to around 3.5 percent of GDP in
2011–12, and gradually converge to a
deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030. This
stance would ensure consistency with a
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio, while
leaving room for some flexibility as needed.

8.
Staff agreed that maintaining a strong fiscal stance was critical, given lingering
underperformance in public enterprises and unstable grant inflows. Acknowledging
slippage from the budget target in 2010, the authorities were committed to protecting debt
sustainability and resuming consolidation along the lines agreed at the time of the last
Article IV consultation, although at a slightly slower pace. They pointed to continued
improvements in public financial management—especially revenue administration—as well
as efforts to bolster the financial position of the National Insurance System (NIS) as key to
attaining their fiscal targets (Attachment III). They also agreed that achieving these
objectives may require restraining the pace of spending growth. The authorities noted that the
timing of grant disbursements had complicated budget planning, adding a degree of
uncertainty to budget execution. Meanwhile, they viewed their accumulated PetroCaribe
savings as a buffer to smooth out grant shortfalls.5 In view of Guyana’s risk of moderate debt
distress, staff cautioned that contingency plans be in place in the event that weaknesses in
public enterprises, or shortfalls in aid commitments jeopardize attainment of the 2011 deficit
target of 3.5 percent of GDP.6
9.
Staff cautioned that a mismatch between pension benefits and contributions
threaten the sustainability of the Social Security Scheme (NIS). Projections show that,
after 2011, NIS will shift from small surpluses to growing deficits, largely as a result of
rising benefit payments. The finances of NIS remain plagued by contribution arrears and
evasion by both workers and employers. An additional challenge is the large investment of
5
6

See footnote 2.

This assessment, which is unchanged from that in the 2009 Article IV Consultation, is linked to the stress tests
on debt service (see Guyana—Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis).

9
18.6 percent of total assets, or 1.3 percent of GDP that the NIS has in the CLICO
conglomerate,7 for which the government has extended a guarantee. The authorities have
established a reform committee to provide guidelines on the way forward. Although, many of
these recommendations have not been implemented, the NIS has begun to intensify
monitoring in a few areas, to ensure that beneficiaries meet qualifying conditions, and by
establishing compliance certificates for businesses. More actions would, however, be
required to restore its medium term financial viability.
10.
The operating surplus of public enterprises is projected to rise from 0.6 percent
of GDP in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2011, supported by an expected surge in sugar
production.

GUYSUCO. The authorities estimate that GUYSUCO’s sugar production will rise by
about one third in 2011, to 300,000 tons. Staff noted that, despite the major capital injection
in this company, this outturn would require significant improvements in labor productivity
and the resolution of existing technical problems at the Skeldon plant.8 The authorities
expressed confidence that existing issues would be resolved in the near future, as they were
actively engaged with all parties in boosting output, to get the full benefits of significantly
higher world sugar prices.

GPL. Prospects are expected to improve significantly over the medium term, once the
AFHP becomes operational (in the near term, it could have a moderate negative impact on
GPL’s accounts). Under this project, AHFP will have the capacity to generate electricity
output far in excess of present demand, which should enable a significant reduction in the
electrical tariff rates charged by GPL (Attachment II). In turn, its electricity sales would rise
sharply, as self-generators would be attracted to the lower rates charged by GPL. Staff
cautioned that, while a strong increase in the customer base might be feasible, weak
administrative capacity, still-limited solvent demand, and limited delivery infrastructure
could prevent GPL from reaching the full benefits of the project.9 As a result, its profitability
could be lower than expected, adversely affecting the overall fiscal balance.

7

CLICO (Guyana) is under judicial management and the government expects to realize proceeds from the sale
of fixed assets which will be used to compensate NIS and other investors.
8

Additional lands under cultivation, mechanization, boiler replacement and shift in harvesting cane from 2010
to 2011 should boost production.
9

Additional risks include GPL’s inability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the guaranteed payments and
the new plant’s electricity output falling short of expectations. GPL’s projections provide some assurances
against the former. In the latter case, if the private partner was unable to deliver enough energy (for reasons
other than hydrological factors) GPL will need to resort to its oil-dependent energy plants to cover the gap; in
this case, the contractor will reimburse GPL for these operational costs.

10

Government’s guarantee to NIS. The NIS is unlikely to be fully covered by the
CLICO payout strategy, mostly financed by the Caribbean Petroleum Fund of
US$15 million, with the remainder expected from judicial action and asset recovery. Without
full recovery of these investments and near term reforms to restore financial viability at the
NIS, government’s guarantee would be called as the CLICO investments mature,10
potentially increasing public debt by up to1.3 percent of GDP.
11.
While Guyana’s level of debt distress remains moderate, staff emphasized the
need to keep the debt trajectory on a downward path. The authorities considered that
their current strategy of using medium term debt sustainability as a fiscal anchor continues to
be appropriate. Public debt ratios are projected to decrease moderately to around 60 percent
of GDP over the medium term, and further to around 53 percent by 2030.11 The external debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that risks to external stability remain moderate. The
PV of external public debt is expected to remain just under the DSA benchmark of 40 percent
of GDP, while all other sustainability indicators are well below their respective thresholds.
Over the medium term, FDI would cover some 80 percent of the current account deficit and
projected PSIP inflows, protecting the foreign reserve coverage at about 5 months of imports.
External debt service would remain comfortable at the equivalent of 4–5 percent of exports
and 6–9 percent of government revenue, respectively. Downside risks include lower-than
envisaged grants and FDI inflows in the aftermath of the global crisis.12 Staff also
emphasized the need for Guyana to keep seeking access to high concessional terms to protect
debt sustainability.

10

The CLICO investment is due to mature in a few years.

11

Net public debt excludes PetroCaribe disbursements that are saved in an escrow account. In the baseline
scenario, these deposits are assumed to rise hand-in-hand with larger PetroCaribe disbursements, as world fuel
prices increase over the medium term—following past practice by the Guyanese authorities.

12

The authorities adjust expenditures to match available grants. This is done in two stages, initially during
budget preparation, an assessment is made of potential grants during the year. Then during the year, expenditure
plans are adjusted based on the realization of grants.

B. A Framework to Anchor Prices and Protect Financial Stability
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
12.
The monetary stance remains supportive of macroeconomic stability. Staff noted
that while inflation is currently low, the authorities should stand ready to prevent any build
up of inflationary pressures. The authorities planned to continue conducting monetary policy
through open market operations (OMO) and stressed their willingness to tighten monetary
policy, should price pressures develop. Staff cautioned that success in this strategy would,
however, also be dependent on the degree of exchange rate flexibility, as this would
determine the ability of the BOG to use foreign exchange sales to reduce liquidity in support
of OMO, and further noted that the managed float also removed the exchange rate
appreciation channel for containing inflationary pressures.
13.
Staff stressed that while financial sector risks appear contained, the need for
continued financial sector vigilance remains. Data through end-September 2010 suggest
that most financial system indicators, including NPL and provisioning ratios, have improved
considerably since last year. These improvements mostly reflect improved economic
conditions as well as enhanced risk management on the part of banks. Further, the authorities
have successfully implemented most of their planned financial sector reforms
(Attachment IV). In recent years, however, a construction boom has developed, facilitated in
part by the authorities’ adoption, since 2009, of the second phase of their mortgage program,
based on tax and reserve requirement exemptions.13 Staff cautioned that there was a need to
monitor such credit growth closely, to avoid developing excessive exposures in households’
13

The Government’s low income housing initiative was originally launched in 1992 as part of a land divestiture
process funded by the IDB. The second phase of the program, also funded by the IDB began in 2009. Under this
phase, in addition to tax and reserve requirement exemptions on mortgages to low-income earners, each bank’s
limit was raised from G$3 million to G$8 million, not only the New Building Society’s.

12
balance sheets. However, the authorities were of the view that, given high liquidity in the
system, the housing deficit, and the unmet demand for housing in the society, the demand for
private sector credit needed to be accommodated.
14.
Staff welcomed legislative improvements in the regulation of the non-bank
financial sector. The recent passage of legislation to bring the mortgage institution NBS
under direct central bank supervision is notable, and staff was encouraged by the authorities’
efforts to do the same for credit unions. In addition, work on developing a credit bureau is in
advanced stages which would go a long way in reducing intermediation costs for borrowers.
Staff welcomed the dissemination of financial sector indicators, which now appear on the
Bank’s website.
15.
Staff reiterated its view that greater exchange rate flexibility would provide a
useful buffer against external shocks when warranted. While in the recent period
exchange rate stability has been supported by adequate inflows of foreign exchange, large
swings in commodity prices, especially oil, can pose external risks. In this regard, greater
exchange rate flexibility could, by limiting Bank of Guyana interventions in the foreign
exchange market to smoothing episodes of excessive volatility, provide a useful policy tool
to help preserve macroeconomic stability. The authorities, however, maintained that their
exchange rate arrangement has served them well in the past and noted their preference for
exchange rate stability. They also noted that they have resisted systematic interventions in the
foreign exchange market to influence the exchange rate path. In real effective terms,
Guyana’s currency is assessed to be moderately above its equilibrium level, while broadly
consistent with external stability (Box 3).
C. Agenda for Supporting Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction
16.
Staff emphasized that, while the process of modernization of the sugar sector
remains critical to growth, it has been protracted in recent years.14 Sugar production
continues to play a key role in Guyana, as a major contributor to both foreign exchange
earnings and employment. Despite large investments at GUYSUCO’s Skeldon plant and

14

The sugar sector difficulties are longstanding. Following a period of nationalization from 1971 to 1990,
GUYSUCO was placed under a management contract with a multinational sugar company, Booker Tate.
However, costs have remained high relative to other international producers, and the industry suffered falling
output and significant financial losses from 2005–09. In March 2009, the Booker Tate management contract
was discontinued and the government appointed a board to restructure the industry and increase its
competitiveness. A key component of the plan involved increasing cane production, including through
outsourcing to private farmers. Meanwhile, the factory at Skeldon has remained only partly functional. The
industry is characterized by: (a) an influential, unionized labor force employed in field operations; and (b) a
legacy of social responsibilities, as it provides key social services (health and education) and jobs to many
communities. In light of these factors, restructuring the industry involves changes in the way of life for a
sizeable proportion of rural Guyana and, as a result, the process has been slow and difficult.

13
Box 3. Guyana: Exchange Rate Assessment
During 2010 Guyana’s currency depreciated in real terms, interrupting an appreciation trend. After
having registered an appreciation of around
120
210
Exchange Rates
15 percent during 2004–09, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) fell by 3.7 percent
205
115
during the first ten months of 2010. These
G$/US$ (right)
movements largely reflected developments
200
110
in the value of the U.S. dollar (which the
Guyanese dollar follows closely) against the
195
Euro and other major currencies.1
105

CGER-type of analysis suggests that the
Guyanese currency is moderately above
its equilibrium level. Staff used the
external sustainability (ES) and
macroeconomic balance (MB) approaches
to assess external stability in Guyana.2 The
ES approach suggests that the REER is
9.5 percent above the level that would
stabilize the net foreign asset (NFA)
position at its 2010 level, while the MB
approach suggests that the REER is
11.5 percent above the level necessary to
bring the projected external current
account balance (9 percent of GDP) down
to its norm level (5.3 percent of GDP) over
the medium term.

This assessment reflects somewhat
0
higher deviations from equilibrium than
in the 2009 Article IV consultation. The differences are mostly driven by a wider current account
deficit over the medium term, in line with imports of capital goods associated with large infrastructure
projects. Beyond the medium term, both the fuel import savings due to the AFHP and some export
strengthening would allow a gradual narrowing of the deficit.

Guyana’s exchange rate regime is a stabilized arrangement, according to the most recent Fund classification.
The equilibrium real exchange rate could not be estimated due to the lack of data on productivity indicators.

attempts at further mechanizing production and expanding acreage, sugar output has
continued to disappoint. Multiple factors explain this performance, ranging from
malfunctioning equipment, adverse weather conditions, labor shortages, and management
problems. Although the authorities are seeking to rectify these problems promptly, labor
shortages, mainly from competing opportunities in construction and other agriculture are

14
hampering production.15 In that context, staff suggested ramping up mechanization plans
while continuing to engage workers toward resolving the ongoing issues.
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed that pro-environmental policies could support
growth and reduce vulnerabilities. Pressing ahead with the LCDS, aimed at transforming
the economy while preserving the environment, is now well entrenched in public policy. The
LCDS seeks to ensure a steady carbon-credit flow over the long-term in exchange for forest
preservation. Under the strategy, the authorities aim to channel resources obtained from
global partners—initially Norway—to target specific economic areas. Successful
implementation of the LCDS will re-position the Guyanese economy to better compete on a
global scale and unleash opportunities for reducing poverty. The agreement with Norway
will provide up to US$250 million in payments for forest services over five years, with the
IDB as the main implementing partner, paving the way for disbursements to begin early
2011.16 As such, these resources would be governed by the relatively strong PFM
framework17 currently operational in Guyana. Given that Guyana is the first country in the
world to develop such a partnership on the environment, it stands to benefit from global
attention but also will be subject to international scrutiny as the strategy is being
implemented.
18.
Staff urged the authorities to put appropriate measures in place to safeguard
against fiscal risks as individual projects move ahead, in particular Amaila Falls.

Private sector interest in Guyana’s gold, other mining, oil, and gas sectors is
encouraging, with some projects likely to come on stream over the near to medium term. In
the interim, Guyana will prepare a plan on how best to manage its natural resources, with a
view to coping with potential Dutch disease and other overheating pressures. Staff suggested
that this plan include standard protocols for taxation as well as consideration of the creation
of a stabilization fund.18

•

With respect to the Amaila Falls project, expected to start in late 2011, staff
welcomed the high level of transparency and public disclosure of the project to date,
including reflecting any firm or contingent liabilities from PPPs in debt statistics, as they
relate to best practices of transparency in fiscal accounting of PPPs. Staff cautioned that
15

The World Bank is Trustee for the funds, the GRIF.

17

Guyana’s CPIA cluster averaged 3.1 or in the middle range for PFM for last four years. However their
existing PEFA action identified over half of needed actions already completed. Notable among which for this
purpose is action on government’s procurement systems (use of manuals and guidelines) which are being
enhanced with the use of management IT systems and being developed in conjunction with a development
partner.

18

Trinidad and Tobago’s Heritage Fund was highlighted as an example as well as Norway’s.

15
while energy costs could be significantly reduced once the project becomes operational in
2015, details of the PPP should be carefully assessed to safeguard against sovereign risks in
such a large project (30 percent of GDP). Staff reiterated earlier advice on the use of
international best practices in projects of this nature to which the authorities fully agreed (see
Attachment II).
19.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to press ahead with the preparation of the
revised PRSP. This will include an MDG costing exercise prepared with technical assistance
from donors. Staff also noted the authorities’ plan to put in place adequate monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms to support its implementation, along with defining a tentative
calendar for its release. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue its dialogue with all
stakeholders (labor, civil society, and political parties) as this exercise is crucial for building
national consensus on Guyana’s economic agenda.
D. Measures to Improve Official Data
20.
The quality of statistics is improving, but data provision needs further
strengthening. In early 2010, the authorities released rebased GDP and revised CPI data,
prepared with CARTAC assistance. Coverage of other key macroeconomic variables
needs improvement in terms of quality, periodicity, and timeliness of release.
Acknowledging recent improvements, staff urged the authorities to increase the frequency
and timeliness of data provision. Staff welcomed the authorities’ consent to subscribe to the
IMF’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), reinforcing Guyana’s commitment to
improved transparency and data dissemination.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Guyana’s future looks brighter, despite the many challenges. With a fifth
consecutive year of economic growth, Guyana is beginning to lock in gains from recent years
of fiscal consolidation. Prudent and sustained macroeconomic policies have developed
resilience in the face of external and domestic shocks. There are growing indications that the
private sector is building up major plans for the exploitation of Guyana’s sizeable natural
resources, while the public sector is proceeding with large investments in infrastructure,
including in the electrical sector. Over the medium term, the LCDS should help Guyana
compete better on the global stage and unleash opportunities for lowering poverty.
22.
The authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability is
welcome, given the risks to the outlook. Staff is encouraged by the authorities’
determination in maintaining a prudent fiscal stance to protect debt sustainability over the

16
medium term. Given the uncertainties associated with grants, the authorities would be well
advised to consider building flexible budget plans including contingency measures to
respond to any shortfall in disbursements. Staff reaffirmed the need for Guyana to keep
seeking access to high concessional terms to protect debt sustainability.
23.
Improved fiscal performance will require greater efficiency in the public
enterprise sector. The public company GUYSUCO continues to underperform on output
targets and its financial position remains weak. So far, the expected returns from major
capital injections in this company and efforts to revamp the sugar industry have not
materialized. Given the significantly improved world market conditions for sugar, there is a
need to promptly resolve outstanding technical issues at the production site and to improve
labor relations in a sustainable manner.
24.
With the development of the large Amaila Falls project, fiscal risks associated
with the public-private-partnership need to be monitored carefully. Construction of the
new hydropower plant is due to begin next year, with the financial arrangements close to
final stage of preparation. Given the importance and size of this project, staff urged the
authorities to monitor carefully the associated fiscal risks. Staff welcomed the level of
transparency and public disclosure of the project to date, including reflecting any firm or
contingent liabilities from PPPs in debt statistics, and encouraged the authorities to continue
in this vein. Guyana’s PPPs will require close attention to international best practices.
Moreover, should the projected surge in solvent demand fail to materialize, there is a risk that
GPL’s finances could be adversely affected.
25.
Monetary policy should remain supportive of macroeconomic stability,
especially in light of higher commodity prices expected in the near term. Staff commends
the authorities’ ability to keep inflation relatively low, and welcome their readiness to
address any inflationary pressures. Guyana’s exchange rate arrangement has served the
country well, though staff noted that moving toward more flexibility would provide a buffer
against shocks.
26.
Vigilance remains important for effective supervision of the financial system.
Staff also welcomes improvement in financial sector indicators, including the decline in NPL
ratios, higher provisioning, and lower ratios of borrower concentration and related-party
credit operations. The forthcoming law establishing a credit bureau, along with revised
legislation bringing the mortgage bank under the supervision of the central bank should also
help enhance efficiency in the financial sector. At the same time, the program that extends
tax exemptions and reserve requirements on mortgage loans at participating banks should be
monitored closely, to avoid developing excessive exposures in households’ balance sheets.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts at implementing planned financial sector reforms.
27.
The authorities’ intention to finalize the PRSP is welcome. Staff encouraged a
continued dialogue with all stakeholders to ensure broad participation and engagement at a

17
national level to achieve consensus on Guyana’s economic agenda. Staff welcomes ongoing
work with donor support to cost the achievement of the MDGs, acknowledging the
complexity of this exercise.
28.
Improvements in data quality achieved in 2010 should be accompanied by a
further strengthening in data availability. Staff commends the authorities for the very
significant progress entailed in the finalization of the rebased GDP and CPI series. Staff also
welcomes the authorities’ decision to subscribe to the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) which extends Guyana’s commitment to transparency and data dissemination.
29.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ATTACHMENT I. GUYANA: THE LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (LCDS)
The Guyanese economy is on the cusp of major changes, led in part by the government’s
LCDS. In exchange for performance-based annual payments for forest services, Guyana will
lower carbon emissions and enhance forest preservation in four phases between 2009 and
2020. The LCDS is projected to help raise the GDP growth, government revenue,
employment, and foreign exchange earnings of Guyana.
1.
After a period of successful stabilization, Guyana is now focused on achieving
rapid economic transformation. Traditionally, economic activity has been driven by
agriculture and mining, with a heavy dependence on imported fuels to generate energy,
thereby exposing the economy to oil price volatility. Further sustained economic
transformation is being constrained by insufficient investments in infrastructure, limited
human capital and inadequate social services, which are barriers to private sector investment.
Under the current development model, Guyana can secure the requisite development
resources by fully exploiting its vast forest reserves and associated mineral deposits, but at a
high environmental cost.1 This model is, however, no longer viewed as a sustainable or a
preferred transformation option in the context of the global dialogue on climate change and
Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism.
2.
The LCDS provides a sustainable mechanism for Guyana to leverage its vast
forest reserves to fund economic transformation. Under the LCDS, Guyana will receive
annual performance based payments for reducing carbon emissions by preserving its forest.
The current proposal envisages implementing the LCDS over four phases from 2009 to 2020
(Table 1). Over that period of time, payments, mainly funded initially by the international
public sector, would be made annually up to the phase when these payments would be market
based and be matching or exceeding the Estimated Value to the Nation (EVN)
(US$580 million annually) of the forest reserve.
3.
Consistent with the LCDS, the Governments of Norway and Guyana have
pioneered a model of trading in environmental services at the global level. Under the
terms of a memorandum of understanding (MOU between Guyana and Norway, 2009),
Norway has pledged up to US$250 million, over five years, as payments for forest services.
To facilitate payments, a trust fund—Guyana REDD-Plus Investment Fund (GRIF)—
administered by the World Bank has been established and will receive and disburse these and
other funds to projects identified under the LCDS through the IDB. The annual expected
disbursement from the GRIF, starting in 2010, is US$50 million. Annual payments will be
made after Guyana’s forest preservation performance is independently assessed and verified
against agreed benchmarks.
1

The Economic Value to the Nation (EVN) of the forest estate is estimated to be the equivalent of an annual
annuity payment of US$580 million, (LCDS).

32
4.
A verification mechanism has been agreed between Norway and Guyana for the
use of funds. The mechanism has several aspects, but all guided by a Multi-Stake Holder
Steering Committee (MSHSC) comprising representatives of Guyana and Norway, which
will choose projects for funding and monitor disbursements. Under this mechanism the
World Bank would act as trustee for the funds, and will disburse funds for approved projects
once directed by the MSHSC. The disbursements and project implementation would be
managed by the IDB and other identified partner entities. The approval and disbursement of
funds would be in line with Guyana’s national legal framework, and fiduciary and
operational policies of the GRIF. The partner entities would also be responsible for ensuring
certain safeguards—including fiduciary, social, economic and environment are in place,
while the Ministry of Finance of Guyana will be responsible for the execution of the GRIF’s
operations. As such, these resources would be governed by the relatively strong PFM
framework currently operational in Guyana. In addition to these, the Guyana/Norway
agreement provides for the creation of a monitoring, reporting and evaluating system
(MRVS),2 which will assess Guyana’s performance relative to the environmental
benchmarks. These arrangements are governed by the applicable domestic laws and
procedures in Guyana.
5.
The LCDS has five economic pillars: (i) low carbon economic infrastructure—
renewable energy—hydro power, solar, biogas—access to non-forested land and
underutilized land, improved bandwidth; (ii) developing high potential low-carbon sector—
fruits and vegetables, aquaculture, and ecotourism; (iii) reforming the existing forest
dependent sectors to ensure forest sustainability; (iv) enhancing human capital; and
(v) improving the environment for doing business. Of these, the low carbon infrastructure
projects—hydropower, fiber optic cable/technology park, drainage, irrigation, and road
construction—are pivotal to the overall success of the LCDS. Low carbon infrastructure
projects are estimated to cost approximately US$1 billion.
6.
In line with the pillars of the LCDS, the initial payments from Norway will be
used to fund the following seven activities: (i) government equity in the Amaila Falls
Hydro Electricity Company; (ii) Amerindian Development Fund; (iii) accelerating
Amerindian land titling, demarcation and extension processes; (iv) expansion of fiber optic
digital infrastructure; (v) micro-finance for small and medium enterprises and vulnerable
groups’ low carbon development; (vi) initial work to establish an international centre for biodiversity research and low carbon development; (vii) development of a monitoring, reporting
and verification system for the LCDS.
2

Apart from the MRVS and the GRIF, Guyana is developing three additional (new or enhanced) institutions to
manage various aspects of the LCDS. First, an office of climate change, which will coordinate engagement with
multilateral processes and negotiations, including the UNFCC. Second, a low carbon strategy project
management office to steer key projects as part of the LCDS. And third, a strengthened environmental
protection agency to ensure that local social and environmental safeguards meet international standards.

33
7.
The impact of the LCDS on growth and economic activity would be twofold.
First the direct impact of the payments for forest services from Norway, if fully invested in
transforming the economy, should add approximately 0.4 percent additional GDP growth a
year. The more significant and long lasting impact would be the dynamic effects of these
investments, aimed at transforming the economy.

with a projected initial investment of US$215 million, are expected to boost exports by
approximately US$950 million; increase government revenue by US$190 million; create an
additional 32,000 jobs and raise GDP by approximately US$40 million.

ATTACHMENT II. GUYANA: THE AMAILA FALLS HYDRO POWER PLANT (AFHP)
The authorities are pressing ahead with the construction of the AFHP which would lower
energy costs and improve energy reliability as it replaces outdated fuel-based technology
with modern hydro-based technology as the main source of electricity generation.
1.
Electricity generation in Guyana has been based on outdated technology, using
imported high cost fuels. As a result, electricity supply has been unreliable and at a high
cost (32 U.S. cents per Kilowatt hour), causing several private sector entities to install their
own generation capacity. The dependence of electricity generation on imported fuels, of
approximately US$90 million a year, has also exposed the economy to the vagaries of
international price movements. Guyana Power and Light (GPL) also suffers from an aging
distribution network, and weak revenue administration.
2.
The AFHP is a key component of the government’s Low Carbon Development
Strategy (LCDS). Energy generation would switch from being based on fossil-fuels to
nearly 100 percent clean, renewable sources. Development gains would include eliminating a
key barrier to FDI and lower electricity costs. A reduction of 20–40 percent per Kilowatt
hour is expected for the tariffs of residential, commercial, and industrial consumers as GPL
switches out of oil based to hydro-power based electricity generation. The Government of
Guyana would earmark US$40–60 million of the LCDS-related payments to increase its
equity in the project. The AFHP is estimated to cost approximately US$650 million,
equivalent to 30 percent of GDP. Construction is scheduled to commence in the third quarter
of 2011 and be completed in 40 months. Upon completion in 2014, the AFHP would cover
all the electricity needs of Guyana—approximately 154 megawatts.
3.
The AFHP would be constructed as a Private Sector-Public Sector Partnership
(PPP). A local company—the Amaila Falls Hydro Inc. (AFHI) company—has been
established, with shareholdings by Sithe Global (the Sponsor) and GPL. This company would
build, and then operate the AFHP for 20 years, after which it would revert to the government.
Based on information currently available (the financial arrangement is still under
negotiation), the AFHI would contract debt of approximately US$500 million (70 percent of
total project cost). The remainder would come from equity injections by the sponsor and the
government, who would contribute by way of the access road to the project site. The project
sponsor has been guaranteed a 20 percent rate of return which, according to the IDB, is
comparable to similar projects in other low income countries.
4.
The central component of the PPP is a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA)
between GPL and the sponsor. The project is structured as a 20-year “take or pay” PPA
through which GPL will purchase 100 percent of the generation capacity for an annual
payment of approximately US$100 million that will help achieve the guaranteed 20 percent
return on the sponsor’s equity. This arrangement will be collateralized by GPL’s receivables.

36
Further, the design of the PPP would allow the government to increase its equity share and,
by extension, reduce its obligation to the sponsor.
5.
The AFHP is expected to have a transformational impact on the Guyanese
economy, but also poses large fiscal risks, should it fail to deliver the promised benefits.
Among the likely benefits and potential costs would be the following:

result in a 20 to 25 reduction in fuel

displacement that AFHP can provide,
Baseline
Without the AFHP
as GPL would need to maintain backup
generation capacity, which increases with the size of its market, as private self generators
purchase cheaper electricity from GPL and stop self generating.


Fiscal Accounts: The impact on public finances during the construction stage of the
AFHP should be minimal since the government will not participate in the construction

37
process. Moreover, the private contractor will assume any cost overruns. In the event,
however, that the government assumes the full obligations of the project, public debt to GDP
ratio would rise by 30 percentage points.1

In the baseline scenario, where electricity tariffs are unchanged; GPL’s overall
balance is projected to show a surplus of about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015, the year
AFHP would start operating.

In the alternative scenario, with a tariff reduction of 20 percent offset by an
increase in electricity consumption, GPL’s overall balance (surplus) falls marginally,
to 0.4 percent of GDP. Revenues would remain unchanged (unitary elasticity), and
GPL’s first payment to the private operator would be a bit higher than the cost of
materials and supplies (largely oil imports) in the baseline scenario.2 The following
table shows the impact on GPL’s overall balance assuming different elasticities. In
sum, in the alternative scenario, GPL’s overall balance is likely to be between 0.0 and
0.4 percent of GDP.3

1

In this case, the private contractor forsakes its obligations and its debt is assumed by the government; a
fraction of the $100 million annual payment made previously to the private contractor will now be used to
service the debt.
2

GPL’s annual payment to the private contractor (initially over $100 million but declining overtime) is financed
with the collections GPL makes on domestic consumers (about $150 million). Since the amount of electricity
provided by the private contractor will exceed demand, it will allow GPL to increase its revenue stream over
time despite lower tariffs.
3

Note that a 10 percent increase in oil prices in the baseline scenario could reduce GPL overall balance to
0.2 percent of GDP and bringing about a hike of electricity tariffs for domestic consumers and a negative
impact on the current account.


Over the long term, as GPL payments to the private contractor decline,
demand for electricity rises, the impact on the fiscal accounts is positive; GPL overall
balance in 2015–30 is about 1 percent of GDP in the alternative scenario compared
with 0.5 percent in the baseline scenario.

An additional benefit of the project is the potential for additional revenues to
the government from the sale of carbon credits from the AFHP of approximately
US$10 million annually.

39
ATTACHMENT III. GUYANA: SUSTAINABILITY OF THE NATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME
The mismatch between pension benefits and contributions, and weak reserve management
threatens the sustainability of the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). A recent actuarial
report has recommended a set of urgent parametric reforms to restore financial viability and
reduce fiscal contingencies.
1.
The NIS is a defined-benefit pension arrangement. It was established in 1960, with
membership open to private and public sector workers, and levies contributions that are low
relative to benefits (Table 1). The NIS pension system covers only 31½ percent of the
employed population. Apart from the NIS, there is a non-contributory, defined benefit,
pension scheme for permanent public servants, paid from the government’s budget.
2.
The finances of the NIS are unsustainable under current parameters (Table 2).1
Projections show that after 2011 the NIS will shift from small surpluses to growing deficits,
under the following trends and developments:

The ageing of the participating population, as the number of contributors per
pensioner would fall from 8 in 2006 to 2 by the year 2056;

A relatively high minimum pension, given the low wage environment (the minimum
pension is equivalent to approximately 50 percent of the minimum wage in the public sector,
or 34 percent of average insurable earnings);

Large and growing contribution arrears—GUY$300 million in 2010. Delays in the
court system have also denied resources to the NIS (there are currently 90 outstanding court
cases worth GUY$189 million and approximately 189 writs worth GUY$66.4 million);


Growing NIS contribution evasion by workers, employers, and the self employed;


A shortfall of 7.1 percent in the contribution rate required to fund benefits up to 2056.
The actual contribution rate, 13 percent, is too low relative to the required contribution rate
(20 percent) that would be required to meet the cost of the benefits package up to 2056;


The size and growth of informal sector activities;



A relatively low retirement age (60 years);

1

The Seventh Actuarial Review of NIS, done for 2006 and issued in 2008, estimates an actuarial deficit of
130 percent of GDP.

40

Generous growth of annual pensions benefits, driven by the minimum pension
adjustment factor, which is not linked to contributions; High administrative costs (equivalent
to about 15 percent of contribution income, or 0.4 percent of GDP).
3.
A new development, not covered by the actuarial report, is the impact of the
CLICO debacle. The NIS has an investment of the approximately 18.6 percent of its total
assets, or 1.3 percent of GDP, in the CLICO conglomerate (currently under judicial
management), for which it has been given a guarantee by the government.
4.
In 2008, the 7th Actuarial Review made a number of reform recommendations to
restore financial balance and relevance to the NIS.

Maintaining the defined benefit structure, but adjusting key parameters—such as
gradually raising the retirement age to 65 years, bringing it in line with current life
expectancy (66 ½ years); and raising the contribution rate;

Adopting a specific funding objective over the long-term, such as a reserve that is one
or two times annual expenditures, and adjusting contribution rates to achieve it;

Balancing any increases in old-age pensions benefits with adjustments in other
aspects of the provisions that will create savings;

Removing all gender differences from survivors benefit provisions and allowing
children of deceased insured to easily qualify for pensions;


Improving administrative efficiency and effectiveness;


Investing assets of the NIS according to the prudential investment framework and the
selected funding objectives;

Publishing the report of the 7th actuarial review and the reform committee and the
annual financial statements.
5.
The authorities have taken some actions. First, in 2006, an NIS Reform Committee
was established to provide guidelines on the way forward. Although its recommendations
have not been implemented, the NIS has introduced some changes, including: (a) gender
equality in the payment of benefits; (b) improved monitoring to ensure that beneficiaries
meet the qualifying conditions; and (c) computerization of NIS’ records and processes. To
fully restore financial balance to the NIS, other important actions, such as raising the
retirement age, otherwise restraining the growth of benefits expenditure and increasing the
contribution rates over time would have to be taken.

ATTACHMENT IV. GUYANA: FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY AND REFORMS—PROGRESS
SINCE THE FSAP
The authorities are pressing ahead with financial sector reforms, broadening the perimeter
of financial regulation and the supervisory authority of the central bank. Prudential sector
indicators have improved, but there is a need for continued vigilance.
1.
The authorities’ financial reform strategy has focused on two key elements:
(i) strengthening the regulatory framework; and (ii) expanding the supervisory perimeter of
the central bank to cover non-bank financial institutions. These reforms, along with robust
economic activity, have led to an improvement in financial stability indicators.1
2.
Progress on implementing the reform plans has been commendable. Of the
26 planned reforms, 12 have already been fully implemented—5 of 13 under the short-term
reform plans, 7 of 13 under the long-term reform plans. Of the remaining 8 reform plans,
substantial progress has been made on most of the requirements (Table 1).
3.
Specific attention has been given to strengthening the banking sector and
widening the regulatory perimeter. The authorities have issued new guidelines on risk
management (including on related-party credit), which are being supplemented with
strengthened banking supervision and a tightening in regulations on related-party credit and
large exposures. In 2010, legislation was passed to bring the supervision of the mortgage
bank (NBS) under the central bank. The authorities have also signaled their intentions to
strengthen the regulatory framework for the insurance and credit union sectors and to place
them under the jurisdiction of the Bank of Guyana.
4.
Efforts are also being made to improve credit market conditions. As part of
Caricom wide program to support the development of the credit market and improve lending
conditions, the authorities passed the credit bureau act. Guidelines for their operations are
being worked out.
5.
As a result of the ongoing reforms and vigilance, financial sector risks appear
contained. In the banking sector, the nonperforming loan ratio fell to 6.0 percent in
September 2010, from 8.3 percent at end-2009. Banks remain liquid and provisioning levels
have improved, albeit from a relatively low base. Although loan concentration and relatedparty lending to total loans remain a concern, these have declined marginally in 2010, to
about 29.8 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively from 35.5 percent and 4.5 percent
1

The financial sector in Guyana comprises six commercial banks and a host of non-bank financial institutions.
Three commercial banks are foreign owned, but all non-banks are locally owned. The non-bank financial
institutions (NBFI) include depository and non-depository licensed and unlicensed financial institutions. The
following institutions comprise the NBFI: The New Building Society, Trust Companies, Finance Companies,
Asset management Companies, Pension Schemes, and Domestic Insurance companies.

43
respectively at end-2009.2 Meanwhile, payouts to policy holders of CLICO-Guyana are
underway, in line with the authorities’ plans to minimize the fiscal costs.
6.
The authorities should quickly conclude the implementation of the outstanding
reforms. Notwithstanding the improvement in banking sector ratios, a sudden downward
shift in the business outlook is possible, if commodity prices were to fall suddenly, under
performance in the sugar sector were to become entrenched, or fiscal risks associated with
the AFHP emerge. Against this background, continued actions to fully and speedily
implement all of the reforms, should help Guyana put the financial system in a stronger
position to support sustainable growth.

Bank of Guyana has recently changed the methodology for measuring loan concentration, from “top
20 borrowers to total loans” to “top 20 borrowers to total exposure”. Using this measure, loan concentration
declined to 23.4 percent in September 2010 from 26 percent in December 2009.

time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

IX. Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
X. Previous Decisions and Article IV Consultation Cycle:

4
a. On December 18, 2003, the Executive Board determined that Guyana had reached the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (IMF Country Report No. 04/123).
b. On February 27, 2009, the Executive Board concluded the 2008 Article IV consultation.
c. On March 17, 2010, the Executive Board concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation
(IMF Country Report No. 10/292). Guyana is on a 12-month cycle for Article IV
consultations.
XI. Safeguard Assessments
An updated safeguards assessment of the Bank of Guyana (BoG), related to the then
expected PRGF arrangement, was completed in May 2007. The assessment found that the
BoG has taken steps to improve its safeguards since the previous assessment in 2003. In
particular, compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the
annual financial statements have improved, although certain disclosures still do not meet
requirements, and a new internal audit charter and associated practices have been adopted.
The assessment recommended involvement of an audit firm with experience in International
Standards on Auditing and IFRS in future BoG external audits to address professional
capacity constraints in Guyana, and reconstitution of the Board of Directors to address
governance shortcomings. The latter action was completed in May 2007.
XII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII––Section 2, 3, and 4—and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
international transactions, with the only exception of certain exchange restrictions for the
preservation of national and international security. Guyana’s de jure exchange rate regime is
floating. Guyana’s de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a stabilized arrangement.
The BoG conducts transactions on the basis of the weighted average quotations of the three
largest dealers in the exchange market. The currency of Guyana is the Guyana dollar. The
exchange rate was G$204 per U.S. dollar on October 31, 2010.
XIII. ROSC, FSAP, EPA Participation
a. A fiscal ROSC was undertaken in July 2002.
b. A WB/IMF FSAP took place in November 2005 and concluded in September 2006.
c. Ex-Post Assessment findings were discussed with the authorities in June 2006 and
concluded on October 23, 2006.

APPENDIX II. GUYANA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of October 25, 2010)
The Guyana portfolio of IDA-financed projects is comprised of two projects totaling
US$15.5 million; Improving Teacher Education (US$4.2 million) and Water Sector
Consolidation (US$11.3 million). In addition, a Trust Fund portfolio totaling US$16 million
includes: (i) the Education for All/Fast Track Initiative (EFA–FTI) program supported by the
FTI Catalytic Fund (US$12.2 million); (ii) the Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant for
the Conservancy Adaptation Project (US$3.8 million). One Grant (Recipient-Executed) is in
the pipeline—Guyana - FCPF Readiness Preparation Grant (seed grant US$200K, to be
followed later by a US$3 million preparation grant).
The most recent CAS (2009-2012), discussed by the Board of Executive directors on
May 26, 2008, included two new lending projects: (i) the Community non-Timber Forest
Uses Project (US$5 million); and (ii) Improving Teacher Education (US$4.2 million)—
already effective. It also included three analytical activities: On-demand economic
monitoring and just-in-time analysis; Agriculture Risk Insurance, and Safety Nets.
World Bank Support to the Climate Change Agenda
Adaptation
The Bank supports the adaptation to climate change through two projects: first, the GEF
financed “Mainstreaming Adaptability to Climate Change” (US$5million) for CARICOM
member states that has served as a platform to promote mainstreaming of climate change
considerations and strengthen climate modeling capacity; second, the Conservancy
Adaptation Project (US$3.5million), which began operating in January 2008, to help reduce
the vulnerability to catastrophic flooding from a rise in sea level.
Mitigation
The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) aims to reduce emissions through the
conservation and sustainable management of existing carbon sinks in return for financial
transfers.1 Guyana was one of the first countries to submit a Readiness Preparation Proposal
to the FCPF in June 2009. A seed grant is being processed for the Readiness Preparation
Proposal, and another grant will be available for its implementation.
More generally, the Country Assistance Strategy identified four areas of support to Guyana’s
forests: (i) The FCPF; (ii) An IDA non-timber community forest project; (iii) A JSDF grant
to support community-based enterprises in the hinterland; and (iv) A possible GEF grant.
However, the Government recently indicated that it intends to finance the community

7
forestry project through the newly-established Guyana REDD+ Investment Fund (of which
the Bank is the Trustee), and to re-focus the IDA envelope on tertiary education with a focus
on environment and climate change.
The Bank also supports Guyana’s climate mitigation efforts through the Skeldon Bagasse
Cogeneration Project: This project is not operational at this time because the Emission
Reductions (ER) have not yet begun. ER will start when a power-purchasing agreement is
signed with the Guyana Power and Light for export of bagasse-generated power to the grid.

APPENDIX III. GUYANA: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 30, 2010)
The IDB is Guyana’s major source of multilateral concessional financing with projects
spanning most sectors. Since 1977, the Bank has approved loans amounting to
US$1225.9 million. Outstanding debt stands at US$268.9 million (excluding undisbursed
HIPC debt relief, but after MDRI) while the undisbursed portfolio totals US$195.1 million.
The IDB cancelled US$356.5 million (principal) of Guyana’s outstanding debt effective
January 2007. A further US$35 million was cancelled from some loans in execution, which
were undisbursed. Lending to Guyana continues to be concessional (but with a lower grant
element than before), consisting of a 50–50 blend of resources from the IDB’s Fund for
Special Operations and Ordinary Capital. The annual envelope of allocations is
US$41.5 million for 2011 and 2012 each.
The Board of Directors approved the IDB Country Strategy with Guyana 2008–2012 in
January 2009. According to the new Strategy, the IDB and the GoG will make strategic
interventions, while maximizing future financial allocations that increase the productivity of
human inputs for all, promote entrepreneurship, strengthen the private sector, buffer the
negative impacts of the economic transformation on the marginalized sectors of society, and
create opportunities for key infrastructure improvements in partnership with the national and
international private sector. The baseline scenario in the strategy envisages total lending of
US$113 million according to the following pillars: (i) strategic infrastructure investment,
(ii) enhanced competitiveness, and (iii) social development for growth. By the end of 2010,
US$104.2 million were approved within the framework of the new Country Strategy.
The large existing IDB portfolio, aligned with the above pillars and future allocations, is a
principal foundation of this new strategy. Consequently, future initiatives will augment the
positive, IDB-financed work already underway in Guyana. The IDB has moved actively
toward the use of country systems while ensuring a timely and efficient delivery of the
important stock of projects in execution. Current activities focus on improving financial
management and institutional capacity of line ministries to execute projects directly in
addition to strengthening the Office of the Auditor General. Country capacity will dictate the
pace of this transition in addition to the measures needed to improve the execution and
disbursement of the portfolio and the achievement of the development objectives, both at the
strategic and project level.
In 2010, the IDB approved four projects totaling US$36.5 million: East Bank Demerara Four
Lane (US$20 million), Georgetown Sanitation Improvement Program (US$9.5 million),
Georgetown Solid Waste Management Program-Supplementary Financing (US$2 million),
and the Financial Sector Reform III (US$5 million). The 2011 NSG pipeline (totaling
US$41.5 million) consists of three operations: EBD Four Lane Extension South of Diamond
Grove (US$24.5 million), Intermediate Cities Water Supply Rehabilitation Program
(US$12 million), and Strategic Electricity Loss Reduction Program (US$5 million).

APPENDIX IV. GUYANA: RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 15, 2010)
The CDB continued to engage Guyana in extensive policy dialogue, capital project financing,
and technical assistance that are designed to promote sustainable social and economic
development and to reduce poverty. The stock of total loans and grants approved amounted
to $231.2 million, which is 7.8 percent of total CDB’s approvals for member countries on
October 15, 2010. Of this amount, 89.3 percent consisted of loans and 10.7 percent of grants.
The total outstanding loans were $130.3 million and the undisbursed balance was
$14.9 million on October 15, 2010.
The CDB financed $73.8 million for economic and social infrastructure projects,
$68.4 million for productive sector projects, and $96.3 million for multi-sector projects.
Under the economic infrastructure sector, the transportation and communication subsector
was allocated about $36.2 million, or 49 percent of the total economic infrastructure project
funding. The manufacturing sector, as well as agriculture, forestry and fishing as a group,
also accounted for a large share of project funding. Manufacturing-related-projects were
allocated $45.9 million or 67.1 percent of total productive sector projects, and agriculturerelated-project activity was allocated 32.7 percent. Currently, there are approximately
30 projects being implemented under the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) program. Projects
include improvements in schools for poor rural communities, roads, drains, bridges,
footpaths, water supply, markets and skills training.
The performance of CDB-financed projects under implementation in Guyana remained above
the overall average. The table below provides project details of the undisbursed balances as
at October 15, 2010.

APPENDIX V. GUYANA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 29, 2010)
Data provided to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although timeliness,
reliability, and coverage of selected data can be improved. Selected data are only available
during missions and by telephone/email contacts by the staff. Monetary statistics, exchange
rates, interest rates, and financial prudential indicators are available with a lag from the
website of the Bank of Guyana (BOG). While specific areas of statistics have received
technical assistance, including from the Fund, some limitations remain in the compiling and
disseminating selected data in certain sectors. Comprehensive macroeconomic statistics and
fiscal data are presented in the Mid Year Report on the annual budget which has been in
place since 2007. Guyana has agreed to subscribe to the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS).
Real sector
Considerable work has been completed to strengthen the national accounts. Building on
significant structural changes in the economy since the launch of market-oriented reforms,
GDP has been rebased with 2006 prices, reflecting more than sixty percent increase
compared to the old GDP, based on 1988 prices. Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Center (CARTAC) missions visited Georgetown in 2003, 2006, and 2007 and have since
provided technical assistance on national accounts, which helped facilitate this exercise for
the production side. Further work could entail reassessing the rebased GDP on the
expenditure side. To this end, the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) could complete its register of
enterprises and secure higher response rates for business surveys. Since January 2010, the
BOS has adopted a new household income and expenditure survey (HIES) and launched a
new CPI series, reflecting more items in the basket and revised weights. The CPI index
reflects movements in prices in the Georgetown area.
Fiscal sector
A government finance statistics (GFS) mission, which visited Georgetown in May 2005,
assisted the authorities in determining the sources of the discrepancy between the fiscal data
and monetary and financial data. The mission recommended improvements in the
compilation of GFS (such as expanding the coverage of central government operations to
include important statutory bodies with their own revenue and accounts) and improving data
on the details of domestic financing. The authorities have made progress in implementing
these recommendations, including the compilation of quarterly data for the National
Insurance Scheme (NIS), and five non-financial public enterprises. Progress on the medium
term objective of adopting the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 2001) is proceeding.

12
Monetary and financial sectors
Monetary and financial statistics missions visited Georgetown in 2002, 2003, and 2005. The
BOG has made significant progress in improving the quality of monetary statistics, especially
as regards the institutional coverage. The monetary statistics currently include the BOG,
other depositary corporations (commercial banks, the New Building Society, and trust
companies), and other financial corporations (finance companies, life insurance companies,
non-life insurance companies, pension funds, and asset management companies). The BOG’s
monetary statistics provide data for publication in the IFS Supplement, based on standardized
report forms. The BOG publishes financial prudential indicators in its quarterly report and on
its website on a regular basis.
External sector
In 2003, a mission from CARTAC noted several weaknesses in the compilation of balance of
payments statistics, including that external debt arrears were not recorded in line with the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, and important financial account
transactions were not identified. It recommended that the BOG continue the development of
the new reporting form for direct investment, revise the methodology for recording arrears,
and seek new data sources for improving the coverage of services. At present, estimates for
other services are derived from surveys and an annual survey of major enterprises is used to
collect data on inward direct investment. The BOS maintains its own in-house capacity for
processing customs data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GUYANA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Marcelo Giugale (World Bank)
January 5, 2011
An updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) yields results in line with those reported in the
2009 Article IV.1 Guyana’s risk of debt distress remains moderate. Risks of debt distress
could arise from both shocks to the growth rate and departure from the agreed fiscal
consolidation path. The authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms–including the modernization of the sugar sector- to entrench long-term
growth would help reduce these risks over time. Compared to last year’s assessment,
projected debt ratios are somewhat lower as a stronger growth path is envisioned over the
medium term.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Debt relief and fiscal consolidation efforts have helped reduce Guyana’s external
debt burden significantly in recent years. Public sector debt declined from 93.1 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 60½ percent in 2009. In 2006–07, the Fund, the World Bank, and the IDB
provided debt relief amounting to US$611 million under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI). In November 2006, Japan finalized its bilateral debt cancellation
agreement and wrote off its claims as part of the 2004 Paris Club agreement.2 Further, the
non-financial public sector (NFPS) deficit declined steadily from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2005
to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2009.
2.
Since 2007, total gross public debt has remained broadly stable. Total gross
public debt stood at 60 percent of GDP in 2007—rising to 61.2 percent of GDP in 2010.
1

See Guyana—Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation—Debt Sustainability Analysis (IMF Country
Report No. 10/292).
2

Debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative was granted by all multilaterals but
one, Paris Club bilateral creditors, and four non-Paris Club creditors (China, India, Venezuela, and Cuba). Debt
owed to Brazil and North Korea was paid off without relief. The other creditors have yet to provide their share
of debt relief.

2
External debt has increased by new net disbursements from bilateral and multilateral sources,
while domestic debt has significantly decreased from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2007, to
13.9 percent in 2010.
3.
Guyana’s external debt burden thresholds correspond to the ones associated
with a medium policy performance. The CPIA (Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment) of Guyana has remained stable at 3.4 during the last three years. A rating
between 3.25 and 3.75 corresponds to medium performance. Thus, the relevant thresholds for
Guyana are: (i) PV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; (ii) PV of debt-to-revenue of
250 percent; (iii) PV of debt-to-GDP of 40 percent; and (iv) debt service-to-exports and
revenue ratios of 20 and 30 percent, respectively.
II. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
A. Background
4.
Despite external and domestic shocks in 2010, the Guyanese economy
demonstrated resilience and registered a fifth consecutive year of growth. Real GDP is
projected to grow by 3.4 percent this year compared with 3.3 percent in 2009, as output of
gold and services expanded. End-year inflation is projected to pick up to 4.4 percent, from
3.7 percent in 2009, reflecting higher food prices. The external current account deficit would
widen to 11.3 percent of GDP from 8.7 percent last year, as the value of sugar exports
declined while fuel costs were higher. At the same time, official inflows have allowed for a
modest increase in gross reserves, to around 5 months of imports.
5.
The fiscal outturn for 2010 represents a temporary deviation from the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation path. The NFPS deficit (after grants) is expected to rise
from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2010 (higher than the 3.2 percent
of GDP agreed on the 2009 Article IV consultation), as buoyant central government revenues
only partly offset the underperformance of public enterprises. Public debt would remain
broadly stable at 61 percent of GDP.
B. Baseline Scenario: Projections and Assumptions
6.
The medium-term outlook remains positive (Table 1). The implementation of the
Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS), and the Amaila Falls Hydropower Plant
(AFHP) in particular, would underpin annual growth rates of about 5 percent over the
medium term (2011–2015). This path represents a 1 percentage point upward revision from
the 2009 Article IV Consultation. The construction of the AFHP would add cumulatively
6 percentage points to growth during 2012–2014, while the public investment projects to be
financed with the LCDS inflows (US$250 million during 2011–2015), will add
approximately 0.4 percentage points per year over the medium term. Over the long-term
(2016–2030), growth rates will converge to some 3 percent per year.

3
7.
Although fully financed, the external current account will temporarily widen
over the medium term. Capital goods imports associated with the AFHP will cause the
current account to widen to some 14½ percent of GDP over the medium term. FDI and
official inflows will protect the reserve position at about 5 months of imports. As imports
stabilize—partially driven by the fuel import savings associated with the AFHP—and exports
recover somewhat in line with improved diversification and private sector investments in
gold, oil, and gas sectors, the external current account deficit will slowly improve, reaching
6½ percent of GDP by 2030.
8.
Continued fiscal efforts would underpin a steady reduction in debt ratios.
Supported by a stable inflow of grants and improvements in the performance of public
enterprises, the proposed fiscal path includes a gradual narrowing of the overall fiscal deficit.
In 2011, the baseline scenario envisions a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP, and a long-term
deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP. Gross public debt ratios will decrease moderately to
60.8 percent of GDP over the medium term and will converge to 53 percent in the long term.
Domestic debt, while decreasing somewhat over the medium term, would stabilize at some
12 percent of GDP afterwards.
9.
Resilient foreign capital inflows are projected to fully finance the current
account deficit. FDI inflows will peak at some 15 percent of GDP in 2012 and gradually
decline to an average of 7 percent of GDP in the long term. Net official borrowing will hover
around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, partly driven by the upfront borrowing
projected in the PSIP; however, as the PetroCaribe financing is assumed to be discontinued
by 2014, it will converge to some 2.5 percent of GDP in the long term. Similarly, net official
transfers (including budget support grants) are assumed to decrease from its medium-term
average of 2.2 percent of GDP to some 1 percent of GDP after 2015.3
III. ASSESSMENT OF THE BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS EXTERNAL DEBT4
10.
The analysis of Guyana’s gross external debt sustainability suggests that the
country faces a moderate risk of debt distress. All indicators are well below their threshold
values with the exception of PV of gross external debt-to-GDP ratio, which reaches
38.8 percent in 2013, just 1.2 percentage points below the threshold value. The
aforementioned upfront borrowing envisioned within the PSIP drives this result. The
moderate rating is also supported by a gradual decline in gross external borrowing over the
long-term, in line with the envisaged path for fiscal tightening (Table 2, Figure 1).
3

Given the relatively high grant element of PetroCaribe disbursements, as they are discontinued in 2014, the
grant element of following years’ financing decreases somewhat (assumption consistent with the DSA
completed in the 2009 Article IV Consultation).
4

Gross debt includes the total value of disbursements by Venezuela’s PetroCaribe as debt, although the
authorities have saved most of these disbursements in an escrow account.

4
11.
The sensitivity analysis shows that Guyana’s sustainability indicators are highly
vulnerable to some of the standard shocks (Table 3, Figure 1). The PV for the external
debt-to-GDP indicator breaches the threshold in all standard tests, and it is particularly
vulnerable to a combined shock of real GDP, export value growth, inflation (U.S. dollar GDP
deflator), and net non-debt generating flows at one half standard deviation of their historical
average (B5). It reaches almost 84 percent in 2012 (i.e., equivalent to 200 percent of the
threshold). The PV of external debt-to-revenue breaches its threshold under two of eight
tests; while the PV of debt-to-exports breaches its 150 percent limit under one test. For the
last two indicators, the most severe shock remains the same combined shock whose results
are mostly driven by lower-than-expected FDI flows. In respect of liquidity indicators, debtservice-to-exports and revenue remain well below their corresponding thresholds under all
standard tests.
12.
Albeit a low probability event, a “high investment, low growth” scenario
highlights the risks from lower than anticipated returns from the AFHP and other
investment projects. A scenario in which the growth benefits of both the AFHP and the
LCDS-related investments are absent (2011–2015 growth rate average of 3.4 instead of the
baseline 5 percent) includes a minor and temporary breach of the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
threshold (Figure 1). This indicator will reach 40.9 percent by 2014 and return to levels
below the 40 percent threshold by 2019. All the other indicators, however, would remain
under their respective thresholds.
IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS PUBLIC DEBT
13.
The analysis of the dynamics of Guyana’s total gross public debt does not alter
the overall debt sustainability assessment (Table 4). The projected fiscal consolidation
path is consistent with debt sustainability. The PV of public-debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes at
around its 2010 level (i.e., 48 percent) over the projection period. Debt service will hover
around 8–13 percent of revenue over the projection period, indicating that the government
would have the ability to meet its debt service payments comfortably.
14.
Total public debt vulnerabilities to standard shocks highlight the importance of
adhering to sound policies (Table 5, Figure 2). The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio in the
test with GDP growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2011–12—
resulting in growth rates of -1.3—(B1) will steadily increase and would reach 110 percent by
2030. Further, under the same shock, debt service would reach 35 percent of revenue by
2030, potentially posing debt repayment risks. The high sensitivity to deviations in the
growth path is further illustrated by the scenario A3 where growth is assumed to be
permanently lower by some 0.7 percentage points over the projection period (averaging 4.2
and 2.5 over the 2011–2015 and 2016–2030 respectively). Under this scenario, the PV of
public debt-to-GDP ratio will also steadily increase reaching 87 percent by 2030 while debt
service would reach 26 percent of revenue. In addition, if contingent liabilities or other debtcreating flows were to increase by 10 percentage points of GDP in 2011, the PV of the public

5
debt-to-GDP ratio will expand to 57 percent over the medium term and moderately decline
thereafter (B5).
V. CONCLUSION
15.
Guyana remains at a moderate risk of debt distress, albeit with somewhat lower
debt ratios than last year’s assessment. This assessment is unchanged from the 2009
Article IV Consultation. Debt indicators are below their respective thresholds over the
projection period in the baseline scenario. The PV of external debt-to-GDP remains however
close to its threshold, which requires close attention to its evolution. The sensitivity analysis
of both the external and public-sector debt illustrates the great vulnerability of Guyana’s debt
dynamics to shocks, in particular to FDI flows and GDP growth. Going forward, Guyana is
on the cusp of a structural transformation, led by the government’s Low Carbon Development
Strategy (LCDS) -which includes enhancing human capital, improving business environment
and developing high potential low-carbon sector-; private sector investments in gold, oil, and
gas sectors as well as the large PPP associated with the construction of hydroelectric plant.
16.
The authorities view the envisioned fiscal consolidation for 2011 and over the
medium term as a priority to protect debt sustainability. Further, they considered that
their current strategy of using medium term debt sustainability as a fiscal anchor continues to
be appropriate.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 4, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Guyana
On February 16, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Guyana.32
Background
Despite external and domestic shocks, the Guyanese economy demonstrated resilience and
registered a fifth consecutive year of robust growth in 2010. Real Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) expanded by around 3.4 percent, slightly more than in 2009, supported by expansion in
the gold and services sectors, which helped offset lower output in the sugar sector. End-year
inflation rose to 4.4 percent, from 3.7 percent in 2009, reflecting higher food prices. Although the
external current account deficit is estimated to have widened to 11.4 percent of GDP, a steady
inflow of public external financing and foreign direct investment were sufficient to finance the
deficit and strengthen foreign reserves to the equivalent of 5 months of imports.
In 2010, the overall fiscal balance is estimated to have weakened by close to 1 percentage point
of GDP, to 4.3 percent of GDP, due to weak performance in public enterprises, not fully offset
by a decline in investment and despite strong central government revenues. Public debt was
broadly unchanged, at 61 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, bank prudential indicators have
remained stable, with banks generally liquid and well capitalized. In September 2010, the
authorities started making payouts to Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO) policy holders,
in line with their plans to minimize fiscal costs.
32

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
During 2010, structural reforms focused on improving the policy framework and supporting long
term growth. In the area of fiscal policy, efforts to improve the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA)
continued. Its new functional organization was consolidated, improving further the integrated tax
information system (TRIPS), the profiling of taxpayers, and on-site inspections at the country’s
ports of entry. In support of long-term growth, the authorities continued their modernization
plans in the sugar industry with the reorientation of cane fields to accommodate mechanization.
In the financial sector, the authorities passed the Credit Bureau Act, and widened the regulatory
perimeter by bringing the New Building Society under the jurisdiction of the Bank of Guyana. On
the infrastructure front, major refurbishment and upgrading of the electricity transmission and
distribution network, along with the access road to the Amaila Falls hydro power plant project
site, have commenced. In the area of statistics, the authorities have signed on to the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Guyana’s outlook remains positive for 2011, an election year, and through the medium term.
Road projects, construction of a large hydropower plant at Amaila Falls (AFHP), and
implementation of the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) should sustain growth levels
above the long-run trend of 3 percent, at around 5 percent over the medium term before
tapering off in 2015 as one-off projects are completed. Downside risks include those linked to
fiscal pressures arising from lagging productivity in Guyana Sugar Corporation (GUYSUCO),
the need to strengthen the finances of the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), and a possible fall
off in aid commitments.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for macroeconomic policies that have supported resilience
in the face of external and domestic shocks. They noted that the development of forestry-based
environmental services, private sector plans for the exploitation of Guyana’s natural resources,
and large infrastructure investments are supporting Guyana’s medium-term growth prospects.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal prudence and
recommended contingency measures to mitigate risks from volatile grant disbursements. In this
regard, a few Directors called on the donor community to fulfill their development assistance
commitments. Directors noted that further strengthening the fiscal position calls for far-reaching
reforms in the National Insurance System and key public enterprises. Directors also encouraged
the authorities to monitor carefully the fiscal risks associated with the construction of a large
hydro power plant, advising the adoption of international best practices for public-private
partnerships.
Directors considered that monetary management has been key to macroeconomic stability.
They noted that there may be scope for early tightening, if increases in commodity prices were
to threaten the authorities’ inflation objective. Directors agreed that Guyana’s exchange rate
regime has served the country well. Going forward, some Directors supported a gradual
approach toward greater exchange rate flexibility, while others considered the current policy to
be appropriate.
Noting that financial sector indicators had improved, Directors stressed the need for continued
close prudential oversight. They welcomed the laws establishing the licensing and supervisory
framework for credit bureau operations and bringing the mortgage bank under the supervision
of the central bank.

3
Directors endorsed the authorities’ Low Carbon Development Strategy, which seeks to boost
competitiveness and private investment. Its successful implementation, with international
support, will lift Guyana’s long-term growth prospects and reduce poverty. Considering the
authorities’ intention to finalize soon their poverty reduction strategy, Directors encouraged a
continued dialogue with all stakeholders to maintain consensus on the development agenda.
Directors noted the improvements in data quality achieved in 2010 and welcomed the
authorities’ decision to subscribe to the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Guyana,
Asgar Ally, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director and
Nicole Leslie-Ann Des Vignes, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
1.

Our Guyanese authorities thank staff for the discussions and policy advice during
the 2010 Article IV mission.

2.

Guyana’s economy remained resilient in 2010 despite the difficult global and
regional economic circumstances. Prudent management of the economy continued
to yield dividends and improvements in the lives of the Guyanese people. Yet, the
authorities are not complacent, they are aware that there are still vulnerabilities to
be overcome. The Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) is geared towards
alleviating some of the remaining challenges.

Recent Economic Developments
3.

The economy registered a fifth consecutive year of robust growth in 2010 as it
expanded by 3.6 percent. The non-sugar sector grew by 4.3 percent reflecting a
more diversified and resilient economy. Production of nontraditional crops
increased significantly in response to the ‘Grow More Food Campaign.’ Thanks
to favorable world market prices and investments in the gold sector, gold
production and exports reached their highest levels, surpassing the achievements
of 2009. Rice production also realized a new record. In addition, strong growth
occurred in the construction, financial and insurance services and the distribution
sectors.

4.

In spite of the higher exports of rice, gold and bauxite and increased remittances,
the current account of the balance of payments widened due to lower sugar output
and prices and higher fuel import costs. Notwithstanding this, the deficit was fully
financed and net international reserves rose, peaking at US$780 million,
equivalent to five months of imports.

2
5.

The authorities continued to implement a prudent fiscal policy geared at ensuring
debt sustainability. In light of the ongoing fiscal reforms and significant
improvement to the operations of the Guyana Revenue Authorities, central
government revenues improved as tax collections increased across most
categories in 2010. Together with a reduction in expenditure, this resulted in a
central government deficit of 3 percent of GDP, below the budgeted target of 3.3
percent. Nevertheless, the nonfinancial public sector’s overall fiscal deficit
widened to 4.3 percent of GDP due to the shortfall in sugar production, the
increased investment expenditure of the electricity generating company and lower
grant disbursements.

6.

The public sector gross debt averaged 60.8 percent of GDP over the last four
years, increasing slightly in 2010 but remaining within the debt sustainability
thresholds. More importantly, the debt service to revenue ratio remained relatively
low. Our authorities are committed to safeguarding debt sustainability and are
actively seeking development support and assistance from partners. Moreover,
they are steadfastly pursuing loans on the most favorable concessional terms and
also continue to negotiate with bilateral non-Paris Club creditors for debt
reduction.

7.

Effective use has been made of the assistance provided by the multilateral
institutions and donor countries and Guyana is grateful for the support it has
received in the past. However, our authorities wish to indicate that some providers
of development assistance have become unreliable resulting in unpredictable
inflows in recent times. We encourage greater commitment from development
partners. Guyana’s government looks forward to the continuation of international
assistance to complement its efforts in accelerating structural transformation and
sustained economic expansion.

8.

Monetary policy focused on maintaining price and exchange rate stability while
encouraging the expansion of credit to the private sector. The monetary policy
stance was moderately expansionary to meet the needs of the private sector.
Interest rates trended downwards during 2010, with the 91 day treasury bill rate

3
declining by 40 basis points, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing to businesses.
As private sector credit expansion gains momentum it is expected that there will
be a reduction in the high levels of liquidity in the financial system. Inflation was
contained to modest levels in 2010 at 4.5 percent. The exchange rate which is
determined by market forces remained stable and consistent with macroeconomic
fundamentals during the year. Our authorities note the suggestion by staff for
more exchange rate flexibility, but reiterate the firm view that the current
exchange rate arrangement and the exchange rate stability that has been achieved
have served the country well.
9.

On the financial front, the system remained liquid with improvements to capital,
profitability, provisioning and non-performing loans ratios. The non-performing
loan ratio continued its declining trend to reach 6 percent in 2010 compared with
17.8 percent in 2004. The authorities continued to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework. Quarterly stress testing has been introduced and on site
investigations were also conducted. A number of legislative measures aimed at
strengthening the financial sector and achieving greater compliance with
recommended international best practices were enacted in 2010.These are
adequately highlighted in the staff report.

10.

Moreover, the authorities have made significant progress in resolution of the
CLICO debacle in Guyana. The authorities in Guyana are the first in the region to
commence payouts to CLICO policy holders in their jurisdiction. The government
provided an injection of GUY$3.6 billion to fund the immediate payouts subject
to a maximum of $30 million per policy holder. To date 4,567 policy holders have
been given cheques totaling $3.1 billion. The resolution process is ongoing as
actions are being taken to secure the remainder of the company’s assets.

Outlook
11.

The medium-term outlook for Guyana is positive given the authorities
development agenda premised on the LCDS, the Amalia Falls Hydroelectric

4
Power plant (AFHP) Project, oil and gas exploration and increased production and
productivity of Guyana Sugar Corporation (Guysuco). Building on the favorable
performance of the economy over the last five years the authorities are preserving
and improving the gains of prudent macroeconomic management. According to
staff, real GDP growth is expected to reach 4.8 percent in 2011 and to average 5.7
percent over 2012 to 2014.
12.

Our authorities remain committed to fiscal prudence, even in this election year.
Although, the authorities’ 2011 budget is focused on fiscal consolidation it also
entails measures geared at promoting growth and poverty reduction. Specific
measures were included to benefit the vulnerable members of society and the
rapidly growing private sector. Public assistance was increased by 12 percent and
old age pensions by 14 percent. The Personal Income Tax threshold was increased
by 14 percent to allow workers a greater take home pay. The Corporate Tax on
Profits was reduced by 5 percentage points to allow the private sector to retain
more of their profits for investment activities.

13.

The National Insurance Scheme (NIS) is a defined benefit pension arrangement
which covers about a third of the working population. As noted in the staff report,
a recent actuarial review has recommended parametric reforms to improve its
viability. Our authorities are currently examining options for corrective action to
improve the viability of the NIS.

14.

Guyana began receiving payments for forest climate services in 2010, and these
inflows will be directed towards the transformation of the economy along a low
carbon development path. The first set of projects to commence under the LCDS
in 2011 includes the provision of equity financing for the Amalia Falls
Hydropower Project, support to the demarcation of Amerindian lands, rural
electrification, financing for Small and Microenterprise Development, and support
to the Amerindian Development Fund to finance indigenous community projects.
The authorities will continue to advance their model of Avoided Deforestation

5
and to build partnerships regionally and internationally as they seek to expand the
financial support for the LCDS.
15.

The authorities continue to make progress on the Amalia Hydropower Falls
Project (AFHP), which is being developed as a public-private partnership using a
twenty year Build Own Operate Transfer Model. The contract for the construction
of the access road was awarded last year. The AFHP is sized at 154 Mw with the
financing of this project at US$650 million coming from equity contributed by
Sithe Global, equity from Government under the LCDS and debt financing. The
project construction will start in late 2011, while the commercial operations will
commence by 2015. The AFHP is a major transformative project for Guyana
since it will allow for a quantum shift from being a country heavily dependent on
fossil fuels for electric power to one meeting its entire national requirements
through clean renewable sources by 2015.

16.

In parallel, the authorities are engaged in promoting the exploration of oil and gas
resources. Private estimates indicate potential oil reserves at 15.2 billion barrels
and output of 50 million barrels annually. Several companies are already involved
in drilling operations.

17.

The authorities are taking steps to improve the operations at Guysuco allowing it
to recover its production and productivity levels and restore its financial
performance. Sugar production has been reduced over the last two years due to a
reduction in labor supply to the industry, mechanical problems in the factories,
including the newly built Skeldon factory, and irregular weather patterns.
Transformation of the industry has already begun and efforts to advance the
process will continue in 2011. Greater reliance will be placed on the expansion of
acreage through higher participation by private cane farmers to increase cane
availability, as well as the introduction of mechanical harvesters, cane loaders and
haulage units. Repairs are being undertaken to correct for mechanical defects and
the Skeldon factory is expected to function at full capacity by the beginning of the
second crop this year.

18.

In respect of the other sectors, additional investments are being made to expand
production and benefit from world demand and more favorable prices, especially
for rice, bauxite, gold and non-traditional exports. To sustain economic expansion
substantial investments are being made in human and physical infrastructure. To
improve the business environment, by reducing the cost and time of doing
business, the authorities will advance the implementation of the Single Window
Automated Processing System. Much emphasis is placed on enhancing security
and justice and overall improvements in governance and the strengthening of
democratic and cultural institutions.

19.

The reduction of poverty is a major priority. Programs and policies to increase
low income housing, medical facilities, access to electricity and water supplies are
already taking place at a rapid pace. The authorities are moving ahead with the
revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and with a Millennium Development
Goal costing exercise prepared with technical assistance from donors. The
authorities plan to put in place for adequate monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms to support its implementation. Dialogue is continuing to take place
with all stakeholders to maintain strong national consensus.
