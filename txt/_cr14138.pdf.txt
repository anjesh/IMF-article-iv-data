STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 5, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Kiribati’s key economic challenges are to reduce large structural fiscal imbalances and
increase growth and employment opportunities, while facing obstacles posed by
remoteness, lack of scale, vulnerabilities to external shocks and climate change.
The significant fiscal consolidation envisaged by the authorities will help stabilize
Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund (the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund, or RERF) in real
per capita terms. This stabilization effort would also require that fishing license fees
remain close to recent exceptionally high levels, with windfall incomes relative to the
conservative budgeted baseline saved. In the event of weaker fishing license fee
revenues, a more ambitious adjustment in the non-fishing budget would be needed.
The small private sector share in the economy due to remoteness and weaknesses in
business climate constrains growth and puts strain on public finances. Continuing the
fiscal and structural reform program is essential. Climate change brings additional risks
and fiscal costs.
Main Recommendations:


Continue fiscal reforms designed to deliver fiscal consolidation and improved public
financial management. Seek to maintain fishing license fees above the current
conservative budget baseline, with windfalls saved to strengthen RERF balances. If
fishing license fee windfalls cannot be sustained, explore other options to further
strengthen fiscal balances.



Continue reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).



Facilitate growth through improving the business climate and infrastructure,
including through streamlining government services.

BACKGROUND
1.
Smallness, remoteness and climate change risks combine to impede growth and fiscal
sustainability in Kiribati (Figure 1). Given its narrow production and export base, Kiribati continues
to heavily rely on fishing license fees revenues, official transfers and workers’ remittances to finance
its structural trade deficit. There has been some pick-up in private sector activity with the
commencement of key donor funded projects, even though the public sector still dominates the
economy. Climate change risks provide further challenges for the country’s already limited
infrastructure and administrative resources.
2.
Fiscal outcomes have been dominated by volatile fishing license revenues, which have
been unusually high in the last two years (Figure 2). Government cleared its expensive commercial
debt in 2012, which have helped with containing previously large spending outlays. Problematic
SOEs and overruns on copra subsidy payments have continued to be a drag on the budget. On the
revenue side, non-compliance dented government’s tax revenue collections, even as high fishing
license fees allowed the government to bolster the value of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund
(RERF)1 in 2013. The high financing demands placed on the country’s sovereign wealth fund (SWF)
via large and excessive current fiscal deficits over the years have significantly reduced the RERF real
per capita value which is now significantly below its 2000 level.
3.
Government’s reform program to address the country’s fiscal and structural challenges
continues, with the support of the donor community. Key reforms to public financial
management, tax systems, SOEs and the private sector are ongoing, in line with IMF advice.
Significant progress has been made in SOE reform and work is underway to implement the recentlyapproved fisheries policy, and improve cash and debt management. Based on this reform progress,
the World Bank has provided budget support for 2014 and further donor budget support is
envisaged based on the continued progress of the reform agenda. The reforms are consistent with
the IMF advice provided during the previous Article IV consultations and staff visits.2
4.
The IMF has been actively involved in all relevant aspects of the government-led reform
program in coordination with the World Bank, AsDB, AusAid and other development partners.
The Fund has provided macroeconomic, fiscal, and debt sustainability assessments and projections.
1

The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) is a sovereign wealth fund established in 1956 and capitalized using
phosphate mining proceeds before phosphate deposits were exhausted in 1979. It is one of the main sources of fiscal
income and budget financing for Kiribati.
2

Staff conducted Article IV consultation and a staff visit in 2013. Both missions were conducted jointly with the World
Bank and AsDB teams. The main recommendations of the consultation and the staff visit included: conducting a
medium-term fiscal adjustment to ensure fiscal sustainability and to preserve the value of the RERF; continuing the
structural reform agenda, including reform of the SOEs; executing authorities plan to strengthen the tax revenue,
including through the introduction of the value added tax (VAT); streamlining inefficient subsidies; carrying on
measures to promote private sector development through improving the business climate and infrastructure, and
facilitating the development of the marine sector. The authorities advanced on most fronts as discussed in this staff
report. Some areas, such as reforms of copra subsidies and public utilities remain to be addressed fully.

OUTLOOK
5.
In 2013, the economy experienced its third year of consecutive economic growth on
account of donor projects and increased private sector activity. Construction activities related to
the sea-port and private sector projects drove last year’s growth outcome. Consumer and business
confidence has improved with the commencement of the road project in 2014 and the anticipated
positive spillover to the retail, wholesale and service-related sectors. Increased spending related to
the donor projects is expected to raise inflation to about 2.5 percent in 2014, after a subdued 2013
outturn of 0.8 percent, due to moderate commodity prices.
6.
Kiribati’s external position, while in deficit, continues to be sustained by a steady flow of
official capital transfers and recently also by high fishing license fees. While the trade balance
deteriorated slightly as a result of increased import demand associated with the donor infrastructure
projects in 2013, positive balances in the income and transfers categories kept the current account
deficit similar to 2012 levels. Moderate commodity prices also helped contain spending on imports.
Notably, higher-than-expected fishing license revenues allowed the government to shore up the
value of the RERF and favorable yields for Australian assets ensured steady income flows on Kiribati’s
SWF.

Recent and planned key improvements to infrastructure should strengthen the growth
momentum into the medium term. Apart from creating jobs, the growth dividend to ongoing
infrastructure projects includes improving the climate for increased investment and business
activities.
8.
Risks to the near–term outlook are balanced (see risk assessment matrix). While the positive
impact of domestic public works may be larger than presently envisaged, a further softening in the
external environment and volatile commodity prices present downside risks to growth. In addition,

volatile fishing licenses represent a real risk to stability of fiscal revenues. In the long term, the
country’s vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters presents risks to growth prospects.
Box 1. Kiribati: Seamen Employment and Remittances
Seafaring provides an important source of employment and remittances for Kiribati, which both
having exhibited clear downward trends in recent years. While remaining sizable, employment fell
sharply during the global financial crisis. As of

Kiribati seamen are trained in the Kiribati Marine
Training Center, which is considered one of the best
vocational training institutes in the region.
Nevertheless, seamen from Kiribati have become less
competitive compared with those from the South and
South-east Asian countries because of higher transport
costs and longer visa processing times. Addressing these
obstacles would help maintain the seamen profession as
an important source of employment, training, and
national income.

POLICIES TO ACHIEVE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND
PROMOTE LONG-TERM GROWTH
Key policy challenges are to reduce structural fiscal imbalances and increase growth opportunities, in
particular for private sector growth. These challenges are interconnected because private sector growth
is vital for reducing the fiscal burden. Improving the business climate and implementation of remaining
SOE reforms are vital. Enhancing access to finance for viable business projects, while maintaining
adequate financial risk management is also important.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

A. Fiscal Policy
Main policy challenges in the fiscal area include the implementation of the planned reforms to improve
fiscal outcomes and fiscal frameworks. Ensuring the sustainability of the RERF needs to remain among
the main objectives.
9.
The government continued to make improvements into its public financial
management framework. It has strengthened the process for debt and guarantees approval and
substantially reduced the exposure to SOE guarantees. For 2014, the government incorporated into
the budget the subsidies called community service obligations (CSOs) in the amount of 1.7 percent
of GDP to account more transparently for SOE-related budget costs. Next year, with the planned
national elections, spending restraint will become even more important.
10.
The VAT has been introduced on April 1 as planned. The initial implementation phase is
expected to involve some challenges. The required documentation for submitting VAT returns may
yield additional revenue benefits through strengthening compliance. In this regard, the authorities
are encouraged to continue to make the relevant technological investment and training to allow for
an easing into this transitionary phase.
11.
Fiscal adjustment should continue with the excess revenues from fishing license fees
saved in the medium-term while maintaining essential expenditures and investments in
infrastructure, health, and education at sufficient levels. The report considers two main scenarios
given the uncertainty and volatility of fishing licenses (see Box 2 for details).
12.
Following the framework of the 2013 Article IV report the baseline (or lower fishing
license fees) scenario assumes a conservative path for fishing license fees, which would return to
the levels of about 22 percent of GDP for 2014. This scenario also corresponds with the authorities’
budget assumptions and incorporates their current commitment to reforms, with estimated fiscal
consolidation of more than 10 percent of GDP by 2019 and additional adjustment in the longer term.
Despite significant consolidation effort, the RERF per capita balance continues to decline.
Stabilization of the RERF in this case would require a challenging further fiscal adjustment. The
stabilization of the RERF per capita value around 2023 would require narrowing the current fiscal
balance to about 3½ percent of GDP. In addition stronger fiscal adjustment would lead to lower GDP
growth compared to the baseline scenario.
13.
The higher fishing license fees scenario assumes that these fees will remain high at
close to 2012–13 levels. This outcome, if it materializes, would largely eliminate the need for
additional fiscal consolidation to stabilize the RERF above the level assumed in the baseline.
However, it would be important to save these windfall license fees to strengthen RERF balances,
rather than to finance additional spending. Stronger RERF balances would sustain a higher long-term
current fiscal deficit of about 4½ percent of GDP in the longer run.
14.
Further improving budgeting mechanisms around generation and use of sustainable
fishing license fees are important. License fees have been volatile and are currently difficult to
project with confidence. To strengthen budget planning and cash management, improvements in the

6

KIRIBATI

timely exchange of information about the performance of the various components of fishing license
revenues between key ministries and the Ministry of Finance would be important.
15.
Restructuring the copra subsidy scheme and improving operational efficiency at the
Public Utilities Board (PUB) remain outstanding issues to reduce fiscal costs. The government
plans to make further steps towards enhancing revenue collections by introducing more modern
meter equipment and improving operations of the PUB with the assistance of the World Bank.

Despite the significant narrowing of the current fiscal deficit by
more than 10 percent of GDP, the RERF per capita value does not stabilize and declines by more than 40 percent
by 2030 compared to the projected 2014 level.

The high fishing license fees and stabilizing RERF per
capita value scenario, assumes higher fishing license fees
revenues and also some fiscal measures to stabilize RERF per
capita values by 2023–24, at about A$4,500 in constant terms.
Owing to the high fishing license revenue, the required fiscal
consolidation scale to stabilize the RERF balance is smaller than
the baseline scenario, with the current fiscal deficit narrowing
to 4.2 percent of GDP in the long run.

The baseline stabilizing RERF per capita value scenario
incorporates additional fiscal measures to stabilize the RERF per
capita values by 2023–24 at about A$3,900 in constant terms.
Under this scenario, the current fiscal deficit has to narrow
significantly to about 3.8 percent of GDP on average in 2023–30.
Such stabilization will be difficult to achieve. It requires
narrowing the current fiscal deficit by more than 8 percent of
GDP in the long run.



16.
The government’s financing plans include mainly project and budget support grant
financing in the near term. Over the medium-term the government is also expected to access the
concessional financing on IDA like terms (for details see Box 1 of the DSA Annex). The policy of
avoiding non-concessional debt financing of the recurrent budget should continue.

Box 3. Linkages Between the Government Sector and Growth and Fiscal Multipliers in Kiribati
Due to small size and diseconomies of scale in Kiribati, the government sector plays a significant role for
growth and employment prospects. In 2013, total government current spending accounted close to 60 percent of
GDP, and government sector for more than 28 percent of GDP. Government employees represented 21.5 percent of
total employment and 42 percent of formal employment. Therefore, evaluating the impact of fiscal policies on
growth and the overall economy is critical for the design of macroeconomic policies.
This box briefly presents a practical framework that incorporates the two-way linkages between government
spending and real GDP growth and allows estimating the impact
of fiscal policy on the economy, including through evaluating
1
fiscal multipliers. In this framework, GDP on the production side is
conceptually divided into government GDP and private GDP. The
government GDP mainly consists of wages of public employees; the
private sector follows an augmented Cobb-Douglas production
function. The impact of government sector on GDP is evaluated
through the influence of government taxation and spending which
critically depends on consumption, saving and investment decisions by the government, domestic residents, and
foreigners, and on their shares of spending on domestic versus imported goods. The parameters are calibrated, with
estimation procedures taking into data limitations.
We simulated different scenarios, including nominal wage shock and public expenditure shock scenarios.
Then we calculated the corresponding fiscal multipliers under each scenario. The fiscal multipliers are defined as the
ratio of a change in GDP output (∆Y) to a discretionary change in government spending (∆G). Here GDP is in real
terms, so the multiplier means the effect of a $1 increase in spending on the real GDP level. Regarding the time
frame, we focus on the impact multipliers, which are defined as ∆Y(t)/∆G(t), where t denotes the year fiscal
multipliers are examined.
The simulation results show that different spending shocks have different multipliers. As the shares of
imported goods and services in household consumption and
Impact Multipliers in Kiribati
government expenditure are high in Kiribati, the stimulus effects of
0.6
expansionary fiscal policy on domestic GDP are limited, and fiscal
0.4
multipliers are relatively lower compared with economies with more
0.2
developed domestic industries. Under a positive nominal public wage
0.0
shock, the impact multiplier is 0.44, while the multiplier under a positive
2
-0.2
public expenditure is 0.47 , which implies that expansionary fiscal
-0.4
policy’s stimulus effect on GDP growth is limited in Kiribati.
Combining the above calculated fiscal multipliers with budgeted current -0.6
and development expenditure data, this framework also allows us to
better project GDP growths, which is 3.0 in 2014 and 2.7 in 2015, as shown in the SEI table.

For more details, please see the book chapter: “Growth and Fiscal Multipliers in Small States – the Case of Pacific Island
Countries”, forthcoming.

It is worth noting that development expenditure’s impact multiplier is even lower (our estimate is 0.05–0.1, as most development
expenditures are spent on imported goods and services in Kiribati). However, if development expenditure can increase
productivity, the long-term fiscal multiplier would be higher.

Box 4. Regional Arrangement for Fishing License Fees
Fishing license fees are a major source of revenue for several microstates in the Pacific (in particular Kiribati,
Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu). Since 2011, fishing license revenue has increased significantly, at
an average rate above 30 percent during 2011–13. A large share of this increment is attributed to the
implementation of minimum fishing license fees under the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA).
The PNA is a regional agreement among member countries’ to coordinate the management of marine
resources. The Agreement was initially established in 1982 among eight Pacific island countries1, although
it took several years until it reached its current form. This agreement sought to strengthen the bargaining
power of license-issuing countries and regional control to address illegal fishing.

In 2007, PNA members introduced a new mechanism, the vessel day scheme (VDS), to increase the PICs’
bargaining power and ensure sustainability of its marine resources. Instead of only setting a limit on the
number of vessels in the region as was done previously, the new scheme also limited the total number of
fishing days (limits both number of days and number vessels). Under the VDS, Nauru Agreement members
jointly consented to allocate a fixed number of transferable fishing days for their combined Exclusive
Economic Zones (EEZs), apportioned to members according to the individual sizes of their EEZs and
historical catch. The fishing companies pay a flat fee per vessel per day with adjustment for the size of the
vessel. 2
The PNA members further strengthened the VDS in 2011 by introducing a minimum fee for fishing per
vessel day. The minimum fee was set at US$5,000 effective in 2012 and raised to US$6,000 effective

B. State-owned Enterprises Reforms
17.
Staff supports the extensive SOE reforms undertaken by the government with the
assistance of the AsDB. The closures of underperforming SOE have significantly reduced fiscal risks,
including through the reduction of outstanding government guarantees. Government plans for the
near term include privatizing certain enterprises and effectively implementing key provisions of the
new SOE Act, particularly in the areas of SOEs’ strategies formulation and financial reporting.
Measures towards commercialization of SOEs and improving the operational efficiency of some
others are all steps in the right direction. Nevertheless, realistic expectations need to be made about
the commercial viability of those public enterprises that fulfill social mandates, including the shipping
company that services the outer and dispersed smaller islands. Adequately complying with the
government’s debt and guarantee policy as well as enhancing the oversight and accountability
according to the recently introduced SOE Act should contain these fiscal risks.
Authorities’ Views
18.
The government is committed to the SOE reform agenda. The authorities indicated that
visible success in SOE reforms has increased the community’s buy-in for other public sector
reorganization policies pursued by the government.
19.
The authorities acknowledge that even with privatization of some public enterprises,
structural factors impede private sector activities. Lack of management expertise and the
unavoidable cost disadvantages of geography and diseconomies of scale mean that government will
continue to tolerate some loss-making by key public enterprises.

C. Increasing Private Sector Growth Opportunities
20.
The private sector in Kiribati remains small, limited by its market size, poor
connectivity and high transport costs. Since the combined cost impact of smallness and distance
effectively undermine competitiveness, private sector activities that have grown in Kiribati are
concentrated around imports distribution/retailing; meeting the demands for the public sector and
associated projects; fishery related activities, and niche tourism.
21.
Proceeds from access to Kiribati’s fishing waters and seamen remittances continue to
be a large part of the country’s national income. Despite the positively high fishing license fee
receipts in the recent past, the value of fish caught in Kiribati waters far exceeds fishing license fees
and total Kiribati GDP. Kiribati must continue to encourage investment in onshore marine processing
of its fish resources in order to fully realize its fisheries industry’s potential. Recently, Kiribati seamen
employment has been flat, as technological improvements to ships and high transport costs have cut
into the demand for seafarers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

Staff Views
22.
Reducing high unemployment should be among priorities. According to the 2010
Census, the unemployment rate exceeds 30 percent. Given the ample challenge of creating jobs and
raising economic growth, facilitating the mobility of Kiribati workers under existing arrangements can
be further strengthened. Temporary migration programs for low-skill labor are quite attractive for
PIC workers who are skilled at agriculture and fisheries and lack the professional qualifications to
permanently migrate. The government has rightly encouraged training in technical areas for which
there is external demand at its various education institutes.
23.
Exploiting opportunities and addressing constraints within existing areas of advantage
are vital. Ongoing infrastructure projects and the consequent demand and inflow of foreign workers
have been met by growth in the retail and accommodation sectors, apart from greater awareness for
Kiribati’s niche-tourism potential. With the completion of these projects, improvements to public
service delivery should also encourage confidence and increased private sector activity. On
constraints, seamen recruitment and fishing industry stakeholders have raised the issue of high
airfares and air freight charges as an unnecessary additional cost to doing business.
24.
With its vast marine resources, developing fisheries further appears to be most
promising. Kiribati’s marine resources are quite significant that rents can be gained in spite of the
inherent high cost structures. Government’s planned development of Christmas Island, with a
particular focus on fisheries, should raise job opportunities and help promote increased private
sector activities. Even so, government is encouraged to continue to carefully analyze offers for joint
ventures in developing its marine resources and promptly address concerns about the difficulties
local fishermen face in accessing formal funding, if locals are to meaningfully participate in this key
industry.
25.
Calling for modification, including increasing quotas, to existing regional seasonal
worker schemes may be beneficial. The assistance of regional governments is being sought to
increase opportunities to work abroad, including increasing country quotas through seasonal worker
schemes. Going forward, the authorities are encouraged to find avenues for directing graduates from
its local educational institutions to some modified system of the seasonal worker scheme offered by
both Australia and New Zealand in order to increase job opportunities and sustain growth and
macroeconomic stability into the medium term.
26.
Ongoing infrastructure projects should support private business growth, outside of
improving the business climate. Improvements to strategic infrastructure such as the port and
roads, and planned airport works should partly improve ease of doing business and cost
competitiveness. In addition, government is advised to scale back red tape associated with the need
for multiple business permits from town councils and various government agencies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KIRIBATI

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities acknowledged the benefits of supporting the private sector and viable
industries. The government noted that with the exit of SOEs from certain wholesaling/retailing roles,
the private sector promptly took over those functions, indicative of the willingness to do business.
Improvements to telecommunications should also encourage other private sector entrants.
28.
Government continues to support labor migration. Workers’ remittances have been a
dependable source of foreign exchange and income for Kiribati. However, the authorities are aware
of other regional governments’ concerns for making jobs available first to their citizens given the
uncertain global economic environment.

D. Financial Sector
Background
29.
Formal financial sector lending remains limited. The country’s weak property rights and
investor protection regimes preclude credit expansion. Between the country’s only commercial bank
and the Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK), accessing credit is relatively expensive. In addition, high
spreads have kept lending profitable. Since government cleared much of its commercial borrowing in
2012, household credit has risen to largely take up that slack. Credit expansion to the agriculture,
forestry and fisheries and construction sectors have been brisk, in particular after reducing public
sector bank borrowing since 2010.
30.
The Kiribati Provident Fund’s (KPF) small loans scheme (SLS) continues to grow.
Increased demand for credit has seen the SLS expand to around A$11 million.3 While the KPF’s
overseas investment income performed resiliently last year, the Fund must be watchful of
Kiribati: Outstanding Banking Loans, 2007－13
nonperforming loans.
2007

Staff’s Views
31.
Further improving the accessibility of
land may create new opportunities for viable
credit. Given its small size, lending
opportunities for financial industry players are
quite thin. Hence, developing Kiribati’s land
market, by strengthening dispute resolution
mechanisms and improving its land registry
should assist with banks’ collateral recovery.

Capacity constraints mean that operational and lending standards and risk
management strategies must be tightened. In the absence of a financial system regulator, the
country’s nonbank financial institutions often have relatively high NPLs and low-asset quality,
contributing to financial risks. For the KPF in particular, returning to a positive funding position is

important for its long term sustainability as a pension fund as most retirees take lump-sum
withdrawals. The KPF also must monitor vigilantly its financing of physical assets acquisition by SOEs,
given the past poor financial track record of SOEs.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff views. Since the country’s economic base will
hardly support additional market players, the authorities recognize that addressing current
impediments to increased financial intermediation and strengthening lending practices and
investment strategies will help ensure financial system stability.

for Kiribati given the data limitations. In addition, given
its narrow production base, the real exchange rate plays a limited role in BOP performance, which is
driven more by exogenous factors affecting fishing license fees and donor flows.
36.
The use of the Australian dollar as the official currency remains appropriate. It has
provided a strong nominal anchor, given Kiribati’s close linkages with Australia and in light of its
limited capacity to conduct its own monetary policy. The reforms aimed at boosting private sector
growth discussed above will be crucial to improving and maintaining competitiveness. The current
account deficit in relation to GDP is largely driven over the medium term by fiscal policy. Consistent
with this, the projected fiscal consolidation in the coming years will also be important to help narrow
the trade deficit.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Kiribati has made significant strides since starting the government-led reform program
supported by the donor community. Key policy challenges include the steady implementation of
planned fiscal and structural reforms with the aim of eventually stabilizing the RERF per capita
balance and improving growth prospects, and facilitating the development of the private sector
through improving infrastructure and enhancing business climate conditions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

KIRIBATI

38.
Fiscal adjustment should aim at stabilizing the RERF in real per capita terms over the
medium term. This will require determined implementation of the currently planned fiscal
consolidation efforts, while ensuring adequate investment in the priority areas of infrastructure,
health and education. The authorities should seek to boost fishing license fees above the current
conservative baseline, with additional receipts saved to replenish the RERF. In the event that fishing
license fees cannot be sustained at recent high levels, the authorities should explore options for
further strengthening other aspects of budget performance to ensure longer-term fiscal
sustainability.
39.
The government made impressive progress with SOE reforms. These reforms should
continue, including through the implementation of the SOE Act and planned privatization and
reforms in the telecommunication and infrastructure sectors. The problems with underperforming
SOEs, in particular the PUB, need to be addressed. Government intentions to tackle the inefficient
copra subsidy system and reform related enterprises are welcome.
40.
We commend the authorities on introducing the VAT this year. The challenge now is to
ensure robust implementation. Ensuring adequate compliance for other major taxes is also very
important, and the authorities need to maintain resources in this area.
41.
The private sector is critical for lifting growth prospects for Kiribati and reducing high
unemployment. We welcome plans to develop fisheries infrastructure on Christmas Island with the
assistance of the EU. High transport costs, including airfares, present a big hurdle for doing business
in Kiribati and the efforts to address these with the help of the regional and donor communities are
welcomed. Expanding opportunities to work abroad, including for qualified graduates, would help
increase employment and build human capital.
42.
Improving access to credit for viable private sector projects while ensuring robust risk
management is important. Introducing modern banking technologies such as payment through
mobile phones would help improve financial inclusion through facilitating access to financial
accounts and transactions, including paying utility tariffs. At the same time appropriate risk
management procedures need to be maintained. Also, the pension fund needs to return to a positive
net funding position.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultations continue to take place on a
12-month cycle in light of ongoing structural challenges and vulnerabilities and government
reforms that require close involvement of the IMF.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)
1

(As of 22 April, 2014)
During the current funding cycle (May 2011 to May 2014), PFTAC assistance to Kiribati has included
28 advisory missions. Kiribati also sent 11 officials to regional seminars and workshops.

Tax Administration and Policy
Kiribati implemented VAT on April 1st 2014 with support From PFTAC and Australian Department of
Foreign Affairs (DFAT). Appropriate steps were taken in the lead up to implementation with a strong
focus on community outreach and this has ensured that there is a good relationship between the tax
administration and business. Notwithstanding this work, it is likely that there will be some initial
implementation issues but it is likely that these issues will be resolved within the first quarter of
operation. The authorities intend to maintain a high level of community outreach in the first quarter
of VAT operation to foster greater understanding and promote compliance.
The Taxation Division implemented its new IT system, the Revenue Management System (RMS), in
December 2013. The system is used widely throughout the Pacific and is reliable and robust. Key
Business Users attended intensive user acceptance testing in New Zealand and there is now a
reasonable understanding of the operating system. However, effective implementation of the system
will be a significant risk to the authorities and special care should be taken to ensure that data
integrity is a high priority.
DFAT continues to support Kiribati with funding for a tax adviser and a new adviser will commence a
two year assignment in May 2014. The authorities have signaled that the adviser will be required to
oversee the new VAT and IT systems and also take a lead role in developing and implementing a
presumptive tax for small micro business and income tax self assessment. PFTAC will provide
ongoing support to the authorities and the adviser.

Public Financial Management (PFM)
An August 2011 mission to Kiribati assisted the Ministry of Finance in prioritizing its PFM reform
activities (RBM 1.2), and provided a framework for the current joint AusAid/AsDB long-term TA. Prior
to the inception of that TA, two PFTAC/IMF missions worked with the Ministry of Finance officials to
modify their chart-of-accounts (RBM 1.4) to capture more information on donor-funded projects, to

Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial
management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

improve the integration of planning and budgeting (RBM 1.5), and to provide options for better cash
and debt management (RBMs 1.3 & 1.6) . In addition, PFTAC’s PFM Advisors participated in the
August 2012 AsDB/AusAid Technical Assistance inception mission, and a concurrent donor forum.
During 2013 several missions were conducted with multiple focuses including training budget
analysts (RBM 1.5) in the National Economic Planning Office (NEPO), supporting the Team Leader of
the joint Australia/ADB Treasury Reform TA (RBM 1.4), and assisting the authorities to develop an
improved debt/cash management policy (RBMs 1.3 & 1.6) with support from IMF’s APD and MCM
Divisions. PFTAC PFM Advisors have also participated in interview/CV review teams for both
Australian and EU-funded TA.
PFTAC is ready to provide additional technical support on budget preparation, cash/debt
management, and other aspects of budget execution. Officials from Kiribati have regularly
participated in PFTAC’s regional PFM events, including the November 2011 MTB workshop, the July
2012 PEFA Workshop, the Strategic Development Program Workshops (with Australia DOFD), and
the PIFMA Heads meetings.

Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In August 2003, the PFTAC advisor and an IMF legal expert visited Kiribati to conduct consultations
with industry and government officials on a Financial Institutions Bill that had been drafted in July
2002. Responses to comments raised by the authorities, together with appropriately amended draft
legislation, were forwarded to the authorities in December 2003 for action.
To date there has been no further progress on the draft Financial Institutions Bill or the previously
drafted Anti-money Laundering Legislation. The PFTAC advisor makes periodic contact with the
Ministry of Finance regarding the status of the draft legislation.

Economic and Financial Statistics
GDDS metadata was first published on the IMF website in April 2004 and subsequently updated in
March 2013, following assistance by PFTAC. The BOP compiler benefited from training provided in
regional courses in 2005 and 2010. PFTAC provided TA on balance of payments in 2008, 2010 and
2012, improving compilation methods and use of source data, as well as providing training, and
helping with the transition to BPM6. Starting from 2012, TA on BOP has been provided by the IMF
JSA project on external sector statistics.
PFTAC has provided regular TA on national accounts since 2008, assisting the authorities in making
significant improvements in methodology and use of source data. Beginning in 2012, PFTAC has
increased its TA with the development of an expenditure measure of GDP and with the preparation
of statistical procedures for the incorporation of upcoming VAT data. However, progress has been
slow due to resource and capacity constraints. The NA compiler benefited from regional courses in
2009, 2012 and 2013. PFTAC also sponsored a one-month attachment for the BOP compiler with
Statistics New Zealand in May 2009.

Macroeconomic Analysis
Two missions in 2011 provided assistance in building capacity related to basic forecasting
techniques, using the medium-term fiscal framework developed as part of ADB assistance, and
assessing sustainable levels of drawdowns from Kiribati’s Reserve Equalization Reserve Fund.
A regional financial programming workshop held jointly in 2012 by PFTAC and the Singapore
Regional Training Institute provided training in financial programming techniques to two economists
of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
A. World Bank-IMF Collaboration
(As of April 15 2014)
The Fund and the Bank teams maintain close cooperation in various areas and consult frequently.
During the current cycle, the Bank staff has joined the IMF missions, including IMF staff visits and the
2014 Article IV mission. The IMF staff and the World Bank staff maintained continuing close dialogue
on economic developments and all aspects of the government reform program.
During the current cycle, the teams have produced a Joint DSA. The IMF team provided analysis and
advice on the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework, including fiscal and RERF sustainability.
The IMF and World Bank have also been engaged in provision of technical assistance and advice in
public financial management and debt management and policy. The Fund also provided technical
assistance on pension fund and insurance company management, and on statistical issues, including
Government Finance Statistics and Balance of Payments. The Bank has been engaged in various
infrastructure projects, including road rehabilitation, airport improvement, solar energy, and
adaptation to climate change. Bank staff provided technical assistance on government expenditures,
reforms of copra subsidy and import levy fund, liberalization of telecommunication sector,
management of RERF assets, and social protection issues. During this cycle the Bank has continued
to work closely with the government on the comprehensive program of priority economic reforms,
and supported coordination of donor TA around the reform agenda. Reforms identified through this
process are now being supported under joint donor budget support, coordinated by the World Bank,
with the first tranche disbursed in January 2014.
The IMF and World Bank teams will continue close cooperation going forward, in particular in the
context of the government reform program. As agreed earlier, the Fund will continue to lead on
macro issues, in particular overall macroeconomic framework, including in the medium-and-longer
term, and the Bank on macro-critical structural reform issues.1 The Fund and the Bank staff will also
continue to cooperate with regard to follow up TA, including on the RERF management and public
financial and debt management.

B. Relations with the World Bank Group2
Kiribati became a member of the World Bank Group in 1986.
On March 1, 2011, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors discussed the first Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Kiribati, which had previously been covered by a Pacific Islands
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

Regional Engagement Framework. The CAS is structured around the themes of: (i) addressing the
existential threat posed by climate change; and, (ii) mitigating the effects of geographic isolation.
The CAS anticipates a significantly expanded program of advisory and financial support for Kiribati.
Consistent with Kiribati’s limited repayment capacity highlighted in the DSA, it is anticipated that IDA
financing will be provided on 100-percent grant terms. IDA grants and trust fund investments of as
much as US$50 million are anticipated over the four year CAS period from FY2011 to FY2014. Such
a program of investments is intended to build a foundation for the World Bank to play a more
substantive role, in close collaboration with the IMF and other donor partners, in a coordinated
economic policy dialogue with the Government of Kiribati.
Key components of proposed World Bank Group engagement include:
 Climate change adaptation and building resilience against shocks is at the core of Bank
engagement in Kiribati. The Bank, with trust fund financing, has been supporting climate change
mitigation since 2003 through the Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP), with activities including seawall
construction, mangrove planting, and water conservation and supply. Beyond climate change
adaptation, the Bank is committed to accelerating efforts to address wider issues of vulnerability in
Kiribati, including accessing trust fund resources to improve renewable energy generation to reduce
reliance on volatile imported diesel, and to support the transport of food to remote outer islands.
 Mitigating the effects of geographic isolation. Given Kiribati’s remoteness, the Bank anticipates
scaling up support for climate friendly infrastructure investments. A South Tarawa road improvement
investment of US$24m in IDA and TF financing— undertaken jointly with the AsDB—was approved
by the Board on March 1, 2011, with the Kiribati CAS. The Bank has also mobilized significant grant
resources with New Zealand and other partners, to help bring Kiribati airports–a vital link with the
outside world–up to international safety standards.
 Supporting economic reform and regional integration. An expanded program of investments has
provided a foundation for a more substantive engagement by the Bank Group in a coordinated
economic policy dialogue in Kiribati. The World Bank has supported Government in developing the
Economic Reform Plan and disbursed US$5.2 million of budget support in March, 2014 in support of
policy reforms included in this plan. The second operation in the programmatic series of two
operations is currently being prepared in close consultation with Government and other donors. The
Bank Group is supporting government efforts to open the telecoms market to new private
investments. As well as the direct benefits, telecoms reform has elsewhere in the Pacific proven to be
especially successful in building public support and momentum for reform more broadly. The Bank
and IFC will cooperate closely in supporting other potential SOE transactions, following the
successful introduction of private participation in the management of the Otintaai hotel. As well as
domestic reform, the Bank Group continues to support efforts by Kiribati and other Pacific Island
countries to gain benefits from greater regional integration, including participation in temporary
labor migration schemes established by New Zealand and Australia and anticipated analytical and
investment support to help countries improve management and returns from pelagic and deep-sea
fishery resources.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

1

The Asian Development Bank has approved eight project loans to Kiribati amounting to
US$34.7 million, all from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources since Kiribati joined the AsDB in
1974. In addition, TA amounting to US$18.4 million has been provided for 40 projects. The latest
AsDB loan to Kiribati, for South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector project, was approved in
October 2011. The AsDB most recently approved an US$0.8 million TA grant for enhancing economic
competitiveness through SOE reform in October 2013.
In line with the broad objective of the Kiribati Development Plan, 2012–15, which focused on
enhancing economic growth for sustainable development, ADB’s program aims to reduce poverty
and promote economic opportunity by improving public financial management and delivering
sustainable infrastructure services. As many of the infrastructure services are provided by stateowned enterprises, improving corporate governance arrangements and the commercial focus of
these enterprises is a key objective of ADB’s support to the government’s structural reform program.
Technical assistance provided through the Economic Management and Public Sector Reform
program helped strengthen state owned enterprise governance. ADB’s support has also helped
Kiribati move toward a number of Millennium Development Goals. In October 2011, ADB approved a
loan for the South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project, which aims to improve sanitation
and hygiene practices in South Tarawa and increase access to sanitation from 64 percent to 80
percent by 2019. The Road Rehabilitation Project, approved in December 2010, will rehabilitate
32.5 kilometers of main roads and about 8 kilometers of feeder roads. Cofinanced by the
Government of Australia, the World Bank and the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility, the project
will improve socioeconomic conditions for the people of South Tarawa.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
(As of April 1, 2014)
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Balance of Payments
data are the most affected area.
National Accounts: With PTFAC assistance GDP estimates have improved. Two TA missions took place in 2013 to
improve national account data and produce revised estimates through 2012. However, further capacity building
would be needed to continue to improve the quality of GDP estimates. So far, estimates are limited to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) at current and constant 06 prices, using the production approach. Work is ongoing on the
expenditure-based GDP estimates.
Price statistics: The monthly retail price index (1996=100) is produced with a short lag (about a month), based on
a survey in South Tarawa (a national index is not available). There are no producer, wholesale, or trade price indices.
Government finance statistics: A Government Finance Statistics mission took place in October 2013 to set up the
reporting framework for GFS for the budgetary central government and to expand coverage towards other sectors.
In addition, the mission aimed to review sources for financial transactions and a financial balance sheet. While a
complete review of government units, statutory extra budgetary units, and state-owned enterprises (SOE) was
completed, a gap still remains regarding donor-financed project funds.
Monetary statistics: The balance sheets of all the financial institutions (Bank of Kiribati, Development Bank of
Kiribati, Kiribati Provident Fund, and Kiribati Insurance Corporation) are available with lags, but the consolidated
balance sheet of the financial sector is not available. Data on interest rates are reported with a long lag.
Balance of payments: The quality of the data is improving, there is extensive work ahead. STA conducted two
missions since early 2013. The mission revised the BOP estimates up to 2012 and the implementation of IIP under
BPM6. As in the case of GDP data, it has been suggested the need for further statistical capacity building. There still
remain some shortcomings in non-trade external statistics collection.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Peter Allum,
(IMF) and Jeffrey Lewis and
Sudhir Shetty, (IDA)

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank.

Kiribati continues to be at high risk of debt distress according to this update of the debt sustainability
analysis (DSA)2. Although unusually high fishing license fees improved the fiscal position recently,
containing the risk of debt distress will require prudent financing by continuing to secure grants to
support the country’s large development needs, and implementing fiscal and structural reform agenda
that would ensure fiscal sustainability and raise long-term growth. In particular,, it is important to
pursue fiscal consolidation by continuing to contain and improve quality of expenditures, as well as
through revenue enhancing measures.

Background
Kiribati is one of the most remote Pacific microstate consisting of quite dispersed 31 islands.
The export and production bases are narrow and limited to copra, seaweed and fishing. The revenue
base is very volatile, with fishing license fees making up about 60 percent of government revenues
during 2003–13. Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund—the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF)—is
a major source of financing and a cushion against risks. Climate change and pressures on
infrastructure raise additional challenges. The country relies heavily on foreign aid to finance its
large development needs.

1

The DSA has been produced in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). This DSA is based on the
common standard LIC DSA framework. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Kiribati is rated
as a weak performer, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators on the external public debt for countries in
this category: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the PV of debt-to exports
ratio; 200 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio; 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio; and
18 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.
2

The results of the current debt sustainability analysis remain in line with the 2013 DSA. The DSA analysis shows that
as a result the expected debt build-up the sizable and protracted breach of DSA thresholds is likely in 2020s. The
main changes in assumptions are an increase in the discount rate (from 3 to 5 percent) according to the new DSA
guidance, inclusion of the scenario with higher fishing license revenues; higher realized fishing license fees in 2013,
and higher projected disbursements from donors to support the ongoing reform program and address large
infrastructure needs. Despite increase in the nominal debt, the NPV of debt remains at the levels similar to 2013 DSA.

KIRIBATI

Although fiscal accounts improved in the last two years mainly due to unusually high fishing
license fees revenue, such fees remain volatile and Kiribati continues to face the challenge of
reducing structural fiscal imbalances. Large overall fiscal deficits over the last decade (about
13 percent of GDP on average) have resulted in substantial drawdowns of the RERF—the main
source of deficit financing.3 The RERF assets dropped to 380 percent of GDP in 2013 from
565 percent of GDP in 2000.
As of end-2013, public domestic debt accounted for 4⅔ percent of GDP, while gross public
external debt is estimated at about 8⅓ percent of GDP. Domestic debt includes the publicly
guaranteed debt of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of end-2013, all external public debt
consisted of concessional loans.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook points to moderate growth. The economy is
estimated to have grown by about 2.9 percent in 2013. Donor-financed road and airport projects are
expected to continue supporting growth and construction activities over the medium term. Kiribati
continues to be vulnerable to external shocks from volatile fishing license revenues, and from
financial exposure of its sovereign wealth fund and pension fund.

The Baseline Scenario
The baseline scenario incorporates government reform plans and assumes projections for
fishing license fees based on historical averages. The assumptions of this DSA are: (The
macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are presented in Box 1.) These
projections imply that the fiscal deficit would exceed 25 percent of GDP in 2014 and gradually
decline to about 14 by 2030, reflecting government commitment to reforms. It is assumed that the
deficit will be partially financed by US$6–12 million of external loans each year in the medium term
and about US$15 million each year in the longer term to finance large infrastructure and other
development needs, as well as to address the adverse impact of climate change. The remaining
financing gap is met through drawdowns of the RERF, without additional domestic borrowing.
Annual drawdown from the RERF is projected to be 12¾ percent of GDP on average in the medium
term and about 12 percent of GDP on average during 2020–34. As a result, the RERF real per capita
balance will continue to decline.
External Debt Sustainability Analysis
The external DSA indicates Kiribati is at high risk of debt distress, in line with the conclusion
of the previous DSA from the 2013 Article IV consultation. The present value (PV) of external
debt increases significantly due to loan disbursements. There is a sizable and protracted breach of
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio threshold and of the PV of the debt to GDP ratio around 2026. (The
exports and revenues related to exports decline as a ratio to GDP because the economy growth
outpaces the growth of fishing licenses, which comprise the main share of exports.) The PV of

KIRIBATI

external debt-to-GDP ratio will increase from 5⅓ percent of GDP in 2013 to 30 percent of GDP
in 2026, and reach over 100 percent of exports starting from 2026.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario


GDP growth and population. The economy is expected to grow at about 2½ percent in the medium

term (until 2019), supported by donor-financed projects. Over the longer term (until 2034 and thereafter)
the growth will moderate to 1.9 percent. Population growth is expected to moderate somewhat from
2.2 percent in 2011 to 1.8 percent in the long run.



Fishing license fees revenue are projected conservatively at around A$42 million in 2014 and to

remain constant in real terms.1.



With the completion of major grant-financed infrastructure projects, aid flows in the form of grants

are expected to decline gradually from 44 percent of GDP in 2014 to around 22 percent of GDP in 2019 and
to about 20 percent in the longer term, assuming that the government’s implementation of reforms
encourages continuing support from the main donors (AusAID, New Zealand AID, Japan, and Taiwan
Province of China).2 Access to the IDA-type grant financing is expected to be about US$25 million per year
during 2014–15 to finance both budget support and large infrastructure projects, including road
rehabilitation, airport improvement, and others.



New external loan disbursements are assumed to average about 5 percent of GDP over the medium

and long terms. Government is expected to access multilateral financing with IDA-like terms at the level of
about US$8 million by 2017, increasing gradually to US$10 million annually by 2020. In addition other
bilateral concessional loans are expected to provide financing for US$2–5 million a year. These loans and
other investments will be needed to support large development needs in infrastructure, health and
education, as well as to adapt to the adverse impact of climate change.3



FDI flows experienced a substantial increase in 2013 because of the additional investments in the

fishing joint venture. Thereafter they will continue at a positive level of about ½ percent of GDP per year
reflecting additional investment in fishing and marine sectors as a result of the reforms.



The overall fiscal deficit will be reduced gradually to around 17 percent of GDP by 2019 and to

14 percent of GDP in the long run, reflecting the government’s commitment to reforms. The RERF
drawdowns would be reduced correspondingly. Nevertheless, the RERF per capita value in real terms would
not stabilize and would decline substantially by 2034 compared to the 2011 level. (The nominal rate of the
annual return on RERF is assumed to be 5⅓ percent in the long term.)



The current account deficit will narrow in the medium term, reflecting a decrease in the fiscal deficit.

The trade deficit follows a similar trend.

1

The average of fishing license fees over 2000–10 was $41.6 million.

2

The RERF is invested in the mix of equities and bonds. The long run average historical return on RERF over

2003–13 was 5.2 percent.
3

The long-run amount of grants is assumed somewhat lower than in the 2013 DSA, reflecting larger front loading

of infrastructure projects based latest information.

Stress tests indicate that the country’s debt path is vulnerable to shocks to financing terms
and to exports. The PV of debt to export ratio and the PV of debt to GDP ratio thresholds are
breached under the extreme stress test scenario, including a scenario which assumes the interest
rate on new borrowing is 200 basis points higher than in the baseline.4
Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt analysis paints a similar picture. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public
debt is projected to increase to above 30 percent of GDP by 2026, driven mainly by external
borrowings. Public debt sustainability is vulnerable to shocks as well. Under the most extreme stress
test scenario—real GDP growth being one standard deviation, temporarily lower in the next two
years—the PV of debt reaches about 55 percent of GDP by 2024 and 77 percent of GDP by 2034,
breaching the threshold of 40 percent in 2020.

High Fishing License Fees and RERF Stabilization Scenario
The high fishing license fee scenario considers a situation where the high level of fishing
license fees observed in 2012–13 will continue in the future, and additional measures to
contain expenditure in the longer run. Under this scenario it would be possible to stabilize the
real per capita value of the RERF at about A$4500 in 2034 and the debt distress level is still at high
risk.
This scenario assumes that fishing license fees will be A$60 million in 2014 and growing at
2½ percent afterwards. Current government expenditure follows similar path to the baseline
scenario, declining to 51 percent of GDP by 2023 and 45½ percent by 2030. The rest of the
assumptions are identical to the baseline scenario. In the medium term, fishing license fees will be
around 30 percent of GDP compared to 20 percent of GDP in the baseline scenario. In the long run
this revenue will be about 25 percent of GDP compared with the 17 percent of GDP under the
baseline scenario. The likelihood of having high fishing license fees revenues depends on the
continuity of the current fishing license scheme implemented by PNA and the catch volume, which is
dependent on the migratory patterns of fish stocks.
Nevertheless, in the high fishing license fee scenario, the PV of total public debt is projected
to increase to around 35 percent of GDP over the long term as loan disbursements will still be
needed to support large infrastructure needs, Therefore under this scenario Kiribati will continue to
be at high risk of debt distress. The low response of the PV debt-to-GDP ratio is explained in part by
the fact that fishery companies that purchase the fishing license have limited integration in the
domestic economy. While the PV of external debt-to-GDP also presents similar levels as in the
baseline scenario, the external debt-to-exports improves and stays far below the threshold5.

4

As a measure of sustainability, fishing license fees are included in the export ratio.

5

Fishing license fees are included in the denominator of the ratio as they contribute to generate inflows that can be
used to pay debt service.

Conclusions
Kiribati continues to be at high risk of debt distress. To narrow fiscal imbalances and stabilize the
real per capita RERF value in the context of pressing capital investment needs, it is imperative for the
authorities to pursue fiscal consolidation through revenue measures and improving the quality of
expenditure. Structural reforms to improve the business climate and promoting private sector
growth are also critical to reduce the fiscal burden.
The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. They indicated the commitment to
preserving the value of the RERF through the fiscal and structural reform programs supported by the
donor community. The government has recently introduced value added and excise taxes and is
keen to improve tax administration. They are also committed to controlling expenditure by
reforming SOEs and rationalizing the administrative costs and public wages.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing; changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
The large residual is explained by changes in the RERF and capital grants not included in current transfers. These capital grants account around 30 percent of GDP, see BOP table.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati
On May 16, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kiribati.1
Kiribati sustained its growth for three consecutive years and grew close to 3 percent in 2013,
supported by donor projects and private sector activity. Inflation remained subdued, underpinned
by moderate commodity prices, but it is projected to pick up to 2.5 percent in 2014 on account of
increased expenditures related to major donor-funded infrastructure projects.
The current account balance deteriorated slightly in line with the trade balance and higher project
imports, while benefiting from exceptionally high fishing license revenue. The overall external
balance thus recorded a substantial surplus equivalent to nearly 22 percent of GDP and reflected
in the replenishment of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF).
The high fishing license revenues in 2013 also resulted in an overall budget surplus of 10 percent
of GDP despite a substantial increase of capital expenditure. Tax revenue continued to lag,
however, as underperforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and tax compliance issues
contained government’s tax collections. The value added tax was introduced on April 1, 2014, as
planned.
The Government continues to implement its reform program with the support of development
partners. Key reforms to public financial management, tax systems, SOEs and the private sector
are ongoing, in line with the IMF advice. Significant progress has been made in SOE reform. In
addition work is underway to implement the recently-approved fisheries policy and improve cash
and debt management. Based on this reform progress, the World Bank has provided budget
support for 2014 and further donor budget support is envisaged based on the continued progress
of the reform agenda.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Although the formal financial sector lending remains limited, household and private business
credit has risen briskly, as reliance of public sector on commercial borrowing was reduced. Nonperforming loan ratios in the Development Bank of Kiribati remained relatively high.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended recent progress in sustaining growth and the authorities’
concerted efforts to increase fiscal revenues, replenish the sovereign wealth fund, and reform
state-owned enterprises in the context of the reform program supported by the international
community. Directors observed that Kiribati faces significant challenges stemming from scale
diseconomies, remoteness, undiversified product and export bases, and vulnerability to
exogenous—including climatic—shocks. They recommended continuing fiscal consolidation
efforts and a deepening of structural reforms aimed at strengthening resilience and improving the
prospects for sustainable, job-rich growth through private sector development and enhanced
external competitiveness.
Directors considered the stabilization of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) in real
per capita terms an appropriate fiscal anchor. While welcoming the recent introduction of new
value added and excise tax systems, they noted that a further strengthening of budget
performance would be needed should fishing license fees fall below recent high levels, and that
any additional fishing license receipts above the current conservative baseline should be saved to
replenish the RERF. They also noted that enhancing tax administration would improve revenue
prospects.
Looking ahead, Directors recommended strengthening public financial management in order to
help rebuild fiscal buffers, including through better operational efficiency of the copra subsidy
scheme and the Public Utilities Board. While welcoming recent state-owned enterprise (SOE)
reforms, Directors advised the continued curtailment of fiscal risks through the privatization or
commercialization of SOEs, where feasible, recognizing that some SOEs fulfilling key social
mandates would continue to require government involvement. They also encouraged the
adoption of centralized debt management guidelines, and continued avoidance of nonconcessional borrowing.
Directors recommended bolstering financial stability through stricter adherence to operational
and lending standards and risk management practices. They encouraged the authorities to reduce
non-performing loans and improve the financial positions of the development bank and the
Kiribati Provident Fund.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors supported lifting Kiribati’s growth prospects and reducing high unemployment through
improved global integration and the creation of an enabling environment for private sector
investment. The business climate and competitiveness could be strengthened through the
streamlining of business approval and registration processes, better public service delivery, and
enhanced access to finance through improved property rights and investor protections. Directors
also recommended the creation of additional opportunities for seasonal employment abroad
through strengthened regional cooperation and appropriate education and skills training. They
encouraged the development of the marine sector, including onshore marine processing, and
welcomed planned fisheries’ infrastructure development on Christmas Island.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to continue improving the quality and timeliness of the
country’s economic and financial statistics.

Statement by Jong-WonYoon, Executive Director for Kiribati
and Mr. Wonjin Choi, Advisor to Executive Director
May 16, 2014
We would like to thank staff for the 2014 report and the close collaboration with the
authorities. We welcome the past assistance of the IMF and the rigorous monitoring of
the economy in Kiribati that has been associated with their visits. We thank the IMF and
donors they are working with for their forthright views and opinions and analysis of the
economic situation. We also welcome staff’s proposal to maintain the 12 month
Article IV consultations cycle for Kiribati.
Economic Context
Kiribati consists of 33 small islands in the mid-Pacific Ocean, mainly coral atolls with a
distance of 4,500km between the eastern and western economic zones comparable with
the distance between the east and west coast of Australia and the United States.
56 percent of the population of approximately 110,000 are located on the islands of South
Tarawa and Betio with high patterns of migration from outer islands. The remaining
44 percent of the population are spread across 22 other inhabitable islands. High
transaction costs between the outer islands and South Tarawa due to isolation and poor
infrastructure affects the development of the productive sectors on the outer islands.
Most of South Tarawa is less than three meters above sea level which means that the
country is highly vulnerable to climate change. Latest meteorological reports suggest the
tropical Pacific Ocean has warmed steadily in recent months, with large warm anomalies
in the ocean sub-surface and increasingly warm sea surface temperatures. These trends
suggest that there is a 70 percent likelihood that an El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
event will occur in July this year. The implications for Kiribati are that it will be
subjected to abnormally higher levels of rainfall with potential flooding.
Economic Outlook
Economic growth has strengthened and will likely remain strong due to major
infrastructure projects commencing over the next few years. A roads rehabilitation
project, the airport terminal renovation and a water and sanitation rehabilitation project
are several major donor funded projects to get underway over the next few years. The
actual lasting impact on the domestic economy may remain modest as all materials,
specialist machinery, and most of the construction staff will need to be sourced from
abroad. GDP growth will strengthen to around 3.0 percent and inflation will become
positive rising to 2.5 percent in 2014 with the introduction of the VAT in April 2014.
Fishing revenues strengthened in 2012 and 2013, but are expected to remain volatile as
the number of day licenses sold depends on migratory tuna stocks, which remain
sensitive to climatic conditions and changes in water temperature. The complete abolition

2
of commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands Protected area at the end of 2014 will
provide some protection to fish stocks which are threatened by higher catches but will
also lead to a decline in fishing revenue in 2015.
Fiscal Policy
Company tax revenues fell in 2012 alongside an increase in noncompliance. However, a
small increase in company taxes of 4.6 percent occurred in 2013. Fisheries revenue rose
to a record 89.8 million AUD and as a result, the current fiscal balance is forecast to
reach 19.4 percent of GDP in 2013. The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF),
Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund, has significant financial assets amounting to around
370 percent of GDP in 2013. These funds were accumulated from phosphate mining at
the time of independence in 1979. Current projections suggest the RERF will undergo a
gradual depletion without policy change over the next couple of decades. Thus, Kiribati’s
overriding fiscal goal remains to protect the value of the RERF. The staff projections
suggest that the withdrawals from the RERF should be limited to less than 12 million
AUD annually to stabilize the RERF over a period of 8-9 years. Our authorities remain
committed to prudent macroeconomic policies, but achieving this target will be difficult.
The introduction of the VAT and excise taxes will put Kiribati on a more equal footing
with the tax structures of other Pacific nations and ensures that Kiribati complies with the
provisions of the trade agreement PACER Plus which promotes free trade in the Pacific
region. The introduction of the VAT along with excise tax and the abolition of customs
duty will see overall taxation levels declining in 2014 (mainly due to lags in the
collection of VAT) but in 2015 taxation revenue is expected to significantly rise. The
World Bank has provided budget support of 5.8 million AUD in 2014 and the Asian
Development Bank has offered 3 million USD in budget support to ease adjustment.
Other donors have also displayed some interest in the provision of budget support in 2014
and 2015.
Ongoing support remains contingent on future policy action. Donor partners, including
the IMF, have agreed on a policy reform matrix that identified key reforms. These
reforms have been carefully prioritized to reflect the capacity constraints on the Kiribati
Government and were supported through the provision of extensive technical assistance
from a range of sources. The programmatic series of Kiribati Economic Reform
Operations supports three key elements, including increasing revenues; improving the
management of public assets and liabilities; and expanding private sector opportunities.
Tax reform that includes steps to improve compliance has been an integral part of the
reform. Financial reforms, SOE reform, and improved guidance around management of
the RERF have also occurred. Subsidy reforms are under consideration to the copra
purchasing scheme. This subsidy provides an important safety net for subsistence
populations on the outer islands but remains expensive with 7 percent of total expenditure
being outlaid in 2013. However, the Government of Kiribati believes that income

3
generating schemes such as the copra price subsidy go a long way towards stemming the
drift of population from the outer islands to South Tarawa where population pressures are
intense. The World Bank has provided assistance to improve the efficiency of the copra
price subsidy through recommendations such as the merger of the two main organisations
involved. Technical assistance has been provided on centralized debt management
guidelines to establish policy criteria around any additional borrowing which the
government has agreed to. Departments and SOEs now face new limitations on their
ability to independently incur debt or invoke government guarantees through a
requirement for formal Cabinet approval.
State Owned Enterprise Reform
Kiribati’s SOEs were originally set up to provide commercial services so as to meet
public policy objectives. However, governance, sustainability and accountability have
been long standing issues in the management of SOEs in Kiribati. Several SOEs have
been privatized, with plans for more in the future, opening the potential for increased
private sector engagement. The import trading company was sold and the first PPP has
been developed between the Government and the owners of the former state owned hotel,
the Otintaai Hotel. The Government is examining other asset sales and in 2013 approved
a Bill opening the telecommunications industry to competition. The Government has
sought expressions of interest in operating the national telecommunications company. For
other SOEs with a social mandate, the concentration will be on providing effective
subsidies and ensuring their commercial viability. Shipping is one area that the
Government has focused its attention on, with a view to encouraging private sector
involvement. Our authorities are working with the ADB on a comprehensive review of
the SOEs, aimed at improving financial transparency through improved management or
sale. An SOE Bill was passed in May 2013 establishing a strengthened legal framework
covering independence, governance, financial reporting, and the management of SOEs.
The emphasis has been on improving the commercial performance of the SOEs. Arrears
on inter-SOE debt and debt to Government Ministries as well as loans to the commercial
bank have been catalogued and are being cleared, including those between the Public
Utilities Board and Kiribati Oil. The Ministry of Finance has also increased its
supervision and oversight to carefully monitor debt management.
Private Sector Growth
Growth in the private sector will be important to reduce the social cost of fiscal
adjustment, given high unemployment and relatively low annual income. The rapid
population growth in South Tarawa has created a growing private sector, although most
businesses remain small, informal, and largely family run. Improved urban planning,
given rising population density and clarity around lack of formal land title, could
encourage investment. Kiribati authorities have finalised a National Private Sector
Development Strategy to progress private sector initiatives.

The authorities have worked for many years to encourage local participation in the
fishing industry – the nation’s primary economic resource. A range of joint ventures and,
employment agreements have been trialled in an attempt to overcome a chronic lack of
capital. The Government completed a National Fishing Policy in 2013 to strengthen the
sustainable management of fisheries resources and maximize license revenue income.
Kiribati has received international direct investment in a new fish processing plant, which
offers a promising opportunity for Kiribati to earn more from its fishery resource. The
factory will provide employment and exposure to international management practice. The
authorities are in negotiations with Fiji to open the air route to competition. Lack of a
second airline to Kiribati from Fiji inhibits the growth of important fishing exports due to
the limited capacity of the airline.
Labor Mobility and Foreign Policy
With official unemployment rates of over 30 percent, Kiribati sees global integration as
its primary avenue towards economic development. The Government has placed a large
emphasis on providing the population with the education and skills necessary to
capitalize on employment opportunities abroad with a greater emphasis on technical
qualifications that are internationally recognised. For instance, the Marine Training
Centre in Kiribati is an internationally recognised institution which has provided
qualifications for I-Kiribati seafarers to be sent abroad for nearly fifty years. The local
technical institute is also supporting this trend to align training schemes with Australian
educational standards. This should allow local tradesmen to migrate to meet skill
shortages in Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand and Australia also attract seasonal
workers from Kiribati, which adds to remittance flows. The Government is attempting to
improve basic skills such as financial literacy to boost the numbers of seasonal workers
abroad.
Growth to a large extent in Kiribati depends on the fortunes of the fishing industry which
accounted for 70 percent of revenue in 2013. The ENSO event expected in July will also
mean better conditions for fishing as fish stocks normally rise with ENSO in Kiribati.
However, the fishing industry is highly volatile and therefore highly unpredictable with
fiscal revenues from fishing in Kiribati fluctuating from 29 million AUD in 2011 to
90 million AUD in 2014. World events such as the Global Financial Crisis also add to the
challenges with a sudden downturn for employment of seafarers and commensurate
effects on remittances one end result. The world price of rice, a staple commodity, also
affects the inflation rate. Exchange rate variations also have an impact on revenue. The
Australian dollar is the currency in Kiribati and revenue from fishing contracts, normally
written in US dollars, will fluctuate with movements in the Australian dollar. Kiribati is
one of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) which implements measures to
maintain sustainable tuna fisheries and minimise the impact on bycatch species. Regional
agreements such as these assist in the management and the revenue streams for the
industry.
