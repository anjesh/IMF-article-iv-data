TOGO
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 20, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. After several postponements, the July legislative elections—which were,
peacefully conducted—gave an absolute majority to the incumbent party. The new
government has thus a strong mandate to implement growth-promoting policies and
meet the public’s expectations of improved living standards. Growth is accelerating,
fuelled by private foreign and public infrastructure investments.
Article IV discussions. Fiscal deficits have increased in recent years, constraining the
room for fiscal maneuver and raising sustainability concerns. Although growth has
picked up over the past few years, it has not been inclusive. The main medium-term
challenge is to move to higher, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The government has
an important role to play in raising the growth potential by providing critical
infrastructure, improving the business environment, and deepening the financial sector.
Key staff recommendations. These include:


Resetting fiscal policy to ensure fiscal sustainability. Reverse the fiscal
deterioration and implement fiscal adjustment to increase the primary balance
progressively in order to lower the debt burden.



Enhancing revenue and public financial management. Enhance revenue
collection, leveraging the proposed new revenue authority. Improve treasury
operations and debt management. Address the country’s social and development
needs by reducing the cost of running the government and improving the
targeting and efficiency of public expenditure.



Addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. Take prompt corrective action to
address emerging weaknesses which could undermine financial sector stability.



Addressing growth bottlenecks and focus on inequality. Ensure that growth is
broad-based and sustainable, and its dividends are widely shared.

Exchange restrictions and regime. Togo, a member of the WAEMU, accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement as
of June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s
exchange regime is a conventional peg to the euro.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, THE OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
The ruling party recently won legislative elections, which gives the authorities a strong
mandate to pursue growth-oriented policies. The long-delayed legislative elections held in July
2013 were peaceful, and the ruling party secured two-thirds of the seats. In a sign of policy
continuity, the prime minister and most of the cabinet were reappointed. The electoral victory gives
the authorities the mandate to pursue policies that, in the view of the public, would enhance
economic growth and make it more inclusive. Thus, the authorities’ main policy challenges are to
maintain fiscal sustainability, step up investment while maintaining debt sustainability, and meet the
public’s strong expectations of sharing the fruits from higher economic growth.
2.
Macroeconomic performance has improved from fifteen years of crisis (Figure 1 and
Text Table 1). Real economic growth accelerated from almost 4½ in 2010-11 to 5.9 percent in 2012,
reflecting dynamism in agriculture, mining, construction, and public works. The recent pace of
economic growth reflects in part a recovery from the protracted political, social and economic crisis
from the early 1990s through mid-2000s. Togo’s GDP per capita declined by about 17 percent
during 1997-2002, and the recovery that started in earnest in 2009 has not yet fully made up for the
lost ground. Poverty remains high, at about 60 percent of the population, and growth has not been
inclusive, as income distribution worsened during 2006-11.1 Inflation eased to an average
2.6 percent in 2012, on account of rising staple food production and declining import prices
following a pick-up in 2011 due to adjustments in energy prices. The current account deficit
widened in 2011-12 to 11.8 percent of GDP, primarily as a result of higher imports of fuels and
goods for public and private investment.

Most of the staff advice in the context of the 2011 Article IV consultation remains
relevant today (Box 1). Wide ranging structural reforms and fiscal conservatism were implemented
up until the HIPC completion point in December 2010. Revenue and public financial management
(PFM) reforms have slowed and debt management has weakened since then. The financial sector
strategy was approved but its implementation remains limited. Only two out of four banks have
been privatized and actions are needed to tackle vulnerabilities in other banks. Reforms in the
mining, telecommunications, and energy sectors have progressed slowly under resistance from
vested interests. More recently, the Ministry of Economy and Finance approved a public financial
management (PFM) reform plan and its implementation has started to bear fruits.
Box 1. Main Recommendations from the 2011 Article IV Consultations
Staff emphasized the following areas as key to maintain macroeconomic stability, sustain growth,
and reduce poverty in the medium term:
 Adopt and implement the financial sector development strategy and speed up bank
privatization.
 Strengthen public financial management.
 Improve debt management capacity and adopt a financing strategy relying on highly
concessional loans and grants.
 Reform the phosphate, telecommunication and energy sectors, where state-owned enterprises
dominate. The World Bank plays a key support role in this area.1
 Improve the business environment and boost investment in physical and human capital.
____________________
1

Since mid-2011, authorities took some steps to reform these sectors. In mining, Togo became a full member of
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the authorities are now trying to identify a consortium that
could develop the new deposits of carbonated phosphates. In the telecom sector, a new Telecommunication Act
was approved, opening the sector to more competition. In the electricity sector, a new Managing Director of the
state-owned distribution company was selected following a competitive process in December 2011.

4.
Economic growth is expected to soften to around 5½ in 2013. Even though growth has
been supported by the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction sectors, economic activity was
somewhat affected by irregular rains in mid-2013, lackluster transit trade (in part due to resumption
of normal activity in other regional ports), and political uncertainties earlier in the year (Figure 2).
The current account deficit would improve slightly to 10.6 percent of GDP, because of lower global
import prices.
5.
In the medium term, growth is expected to rebound to about 6 percent a year (Figure
3), under the impulse of regional growth and trade, more public and private investments in
infrastructure, FDI in mining, and the impact of earlier reform in cash crop markets. The primary
domestic fiscal balance would become positive to anchor reductions in the debt burden, and the
overall fiscal balance would gradually be reduced to limit new debt accumulation. However, mainly
reflecting imports of investments and intermediate goods, the current account deficit is projected to
remain high, only narrowing to 9.2 percent of GDP by 2016.

While the main risks to the outlook are domestic, the Togolese economy is still
vulnerable to a significant growth slowdown in its trading partners (Appendix I). Local and
presidential elections in 2014 and 2015, respectively, could generate policy slippages; entrenched
interests may resist reforms; and limited capacity may slow policy implementation. Without prompt
corrective action to address emerging weaknesses in the financial sector, macroeconomic stability
could be undermined. Continued policy inaction in the energy sector could negatively affect growth
and the budget, while ill-conceived public-private partnerships could entail fiscal liabilities. Given its
openness, the economy is vulnerable to shocks in export demand due to growth slowdown among
its trading partners.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Discussions focused on policies required to restore fiscal discipline and move to a
stronger, more sustainable and inclusive growth. There was agreement to reinvigorate in
structural reforms that stalled after the HIPC completion point. Against this background, the
discussions were organized around three main themes: (i) restoring fiscal policies to a more
sustainable path; (ii) moving to stronger, more sustainable, and inclusive growth; and
(iii) strengthening the financial sector and external stability. There was broad agreement between
the authorities and staff on the issues facing Togo and the policies to address them, though views
sometimes diverged on the pace and feasibility of needed actions. To assist them meet these
challenges, the authorities requested Fund support in implementing their economic reform
program.2

A. Restoring Fiscal Policy to a More Sustainable Path
Fiscal policy deteriorated since end-2010….
8.
Fiscal deficits and public debt levels have increased in 2011 and 2012. The overall fiscal
deficit more than doubled to 7.2 percent of GDP during 2012 largely on account of the adoption of
an expansionary budget in the context of planned elections. At the same time, financing from
privatization and budget support fell well short of budget plans and, as fuel subsidies rose to
2.1 percent of GDP, unpaid bills accumulated at end-2012. Meanwhile, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
increased and is estimated at around 45 percent of GDP at end-2012, including on account of
government recognition of old domestic liabilities of bankrupt public enterprises and arrears to
pension funds.
9.
The 2013 approved budget was also expansionary and subject to risks that eventually
materialized. Unrealistically high capital spending, allocations for legislative and municipal elections
and higher wages contributed to an overall balance deficit of almost 11 percent of GDP in the
2

A staff-level agreement was reached in early September 2013. However, presentation of the authorities’ request to
the IMF Executive Board has been delayed to allow them to complete agreed prior actions.

adopted budget. In addition, financing was predicated on unrealistically high privatization proceeds.
Budget execution pressures built up immediately, as bank privatization did not yield the projected
revenue, fuel subsidies over the first quarter absorbed almost the entire allocation for the year, and
the anticipated external financing did not materialize. Meanwhile, additional outlays were required
to fully finance election operations which saw cash flow pressures increase further by mid-2013.
...but the authorities’ now intend to follow a strong adjustment path
10.
In the face of these challenges, the authorities adopted a revised 2013 budget and
subsequently took further action to keep the fiscal deficit under control. The revised budget,
adopted in consultation with Fund staff, is more realistic as it provides for lower capital
expenditures, better aligned with execution capacity, higher allocations for fuel subsidies, and more
realistic privatization revenue estimates.3 Staff advised the authorities that, since neighboring
countries are adopting pricing policies yielding higher fuel prices and enforcement efforts have been
strengthened, smuggling to Togo is now reduced which results in higher official imports and
subsidy outlays. To curb the heavy subsidy bill, staff proposed a phased increased in fuel prices—
except for kerosene, which is mostly consumed by the poor—by 5 percent in September 2013, and
in January 2014, with accompanying targeted measures to protect the most vulnerable.4 The
authorities are instead inclined to adopt temporary exemptions on income tax for transporters and
on imports of selected essential foodstuff. They also plan to expand the school-feeding program.
These measures will be finalized during consultations with domestic stakeholders.
11.
Staff proposed that fiscal policies should aim at reducing debt distress vulnerabilities
and be anchored by an improvement of the domestic primary fiscal balance. A return to
positive territory would allow the authorities to generate the fiscal space to meet their infrastructure
needs and implement their social policies, while reducing the debt burden. At the same time, the
overall fiscal deficit should be carefully monitored, and overall debt policies guided by close
adherence to a strengthened medium-term debt strategy (¶20) and a regular update of the debt
sustainability analysis.
12.
The authorities agreed with the approach proposed by staff to define their fiscal
stance. Their current policies thus target a return to positive primary domestic fiscal balances and
the reduction of the overall fiscal deficit in 2014 and the medium term. Their fiscal objective is to
enhance fiscal sustainability by reducing the overall deficit to around 5¼ percent of GDP in 2014
and below 4 percent by 2016, while returning to a balanced primary domestic balance in 2014 and
to a positive primary domestic balance slightly below 2 percent by 2016. To signal their commitment
3

The authorities report tax revenue inclusive of tax exemptions. Staff’s presentation of Togo’s fiscal accounts
excludes such tax exemptions from revenue. To enhance transparency, the recorded tax exemptions are reported as a
memorandum item.
4

A phased increase would give time to assess smugglers’ reaction to a higher price differential with Nigeria and
Ghana, sources of smuggled fuel. Volumes consumed on the official domestic markets tend to decline the higher the
price differentials.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

to fiscal prudence, the authorities chose to frontload fiscal adjustment, as the deficit reduction in
2013 accounts for one-third of the projected adjustment during 2013-16.
13.
The projected fiscal adjustment is predicated on the implemention of the authorities’
policy objectives. The reduction in current spending reflects the objectives to cut back on oil
subsidies during 2013-2015—as discussed above—and to limit the nominal growth of the wage bill
to somewhat below the nominal growth of GDP in the medium-term. On the revenue side, the
ongoing reforms in revenue administration are expected to usher a continuation of improvements in
revenue collection (see below). However, the deficit levels for 2014 and beyond could still raise
financing challenges. The possible adoption of a Fund-supported program could help catalyze
development partners’ budget support, which, together with recourse to the regional financial
market, would help close projected financing gaps. Staff emphasized that reconciling fiscal
sustainability with developmental and social objectives will require significant improvements in
public expenditure planning and efficiency, and continued efforts to enhance revenue collection.
14.
While noting the considerable pressures they are facing from unions on wage
increases, the authorities reiterated their intention to resist the pressure, except for those
portions that can be accommodated within the current medium-term spending envelope.
Once again at the beginning of the school year, the unions demanded wage, benefits, and
employment increases. Staff emphasized the importance of moving away from ad-hoc yearly
negotiations and instead adopting a comprehensive strategy of public sector employment and
remuneration that is consistent with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework and sector
strategies, particularly for education and health. Staff cautioned the authorities that, if wage
demands were to be accommodated beyond the current allocations in the framework, the
appropriate first-best policy adjustment would be to lower other budget expenditures.
15.
The authorities concur with the staff that the progressive elimination of fuel subsidies
would be a key driver of any fiscal adjustment. However, they are concerned that the current
political and social situation is too tense for drastic changes. Staff pointed to the example of Ghana
which has recently eliminated fuel subsidies by increasing prices and reestablishing an automatic
adjustment mechanism that aligns future changes with the fluctuation of world oil prices and
exchange rates. The Togolese authorities now expect to be in position to reduce fuel subsidies by
about 1 percent of GDP in 2014, after they have reached an agreement with unions on pay
packages. While staff agreed that fuel subsidies can be eliminated only gradually, it underscored the
importance of strategically disseminating information to the public on their fiscal cost and
regressive impact, as well as the opportunity cost in terms of foregone social and infrastructure
spending.
16.
There was some divergence of views regarding the pace of scaling up investment
spending. The authorities’ concern is that the 1990s crisis has left a legacy of underinvestment in
infrastructure that is holding back potential growth. They argued that the protracted and deep
nature of the crisis has left them with a wider infrastructure gap than other countries in the region,
and that only by significantly scaling up investment can they accelerate economic growth and
development. Staff emphasized that prioritizing and effectively executing capital expenditures
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

TOGO

through enhanced planning and project implementation capacity is more important than increasing
allocations for project spending. Therefore, it was prudent to create more fiscal space and
progressively increase capital spending in line with improvements in the authorities’ capacity to plan
and execute projects. Staff noted that the practice of issuing guarantees on the scheduled
amortization of bank pre-financing of government contractors for infrastructure projects has
reduced transparency and effectively tied down large portions of allocations for investment
spending in future years, thus curtailing room to prioritize in future budgets.
17.
The authorities intend to raise tax revenue further. In the short term, gains in revenue
collections can be sustained by increased reliance on risk-based assessment of imports and tighter
monitoring of entitlements to exemptions. The authorities’ plan to sustain their revenue effort in the
medium term hinges on the successful launch of the revenue authority (Office Togolais des
Recettes—OTR). Once established, the OTR should deliver efficiency gains by hiring new and more
qualified personnel, shedding excess staff, and exploiting synergies among domestic- and importrelated tax functions under a common strategic direction. Staff noted that pushing ahead with ongoing and programmed reforms in the tax and customs administrations remains important,
notwithstanding the on-going creation of the OTR.
18.
Better public financial management (PFM) should improve government efficiency and
transparency. Implementation of the authorities’ medium-term expenditure framework will require
careful alignment of policies with reform priorities. Staff noted that the execution of the authorities’
PFM reform plan is experiencing some delays related to both limited capacity and resistance from
some administrative units. The authorities also noted that, in the low capacity environment of a
fragile country, it is often difficult to reach consensus of reform priorities and align all government
units to effectively implement them. Staff and the authorities discussed a number of measures to
reinvigorate the PFM agenda. These include: (i) first steps towards establishing a single treasury
account; (ii) a more effective cash projection and management system at the treasury; and (ii) better
prioritization, execution and monitoring of investment projects.
19.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Togo remains at moderate risk of
debt distress (Supplement II). There has been considerable debt accumulation over the past two
years as the fiscal situation deteriorated. The increase in external debt has been mainly driven by
new loans from multilaterals and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. In light of the projected increase
in public investments, Togo’s external public debt is expected to increase in the near future,
accumulating to around 22 percent of GDP by 2016. Under baseline assumptions, which are more
favorable than historical trends, overall debt indicators are projected to remain below the relevant
thresholds in the 20-year period. Nonetheless, there is need to closely monitor the trajectory of
public debt, with increased focus on debt contracted from domestic sources, given the country’s low
debt management capacity.
20.
Strengthened debt management and policies are essential to ensure debt
sustainability and reduce vulnerabilities. The authorities and staff discussed options to raise the
functional profile and capacity of the Public Debt Directorate, including its human and physical
resources. The authorities currently compile an annual debt strategy, but this should be
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

strengthened to establish a medium-term strategy that is aligned with the budget process and the
medium-term expenditure framework. Staff pointed out that under present circumstances, there
were risks of losing control over debt management and new debt, unless the present deficiencies
are addressed in a forceful manner. The authorities shared the view that debt management was in
need of substantial improvements and asked for additional technical assistance.
21.
In the staff’s view, Togo should continue to borrow on concessional terms until its
debt management capacity has considerably improved, and closely monitor domestic debt
dynamics. The DSA shows that Togo remains at moderate risk of debt distress, combined with low
institutional capacity. At around 45 percent of GDP, its total public debt at end-2012 is above the
average level for relevant comparator groups in Sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., fragile states that benefitted
from HIPC (39.1 percent of GDP) and low-income countries (34.4 percent of GDP). The authorities
emphasized that concessional financing is not available in amounts sufficient to meet their urgent
development needs. Thus, they are exploring with potential lenders and development partners the
possibility of contracting financing packages with a fully concessional grant element of 35 percent
or higher that are also consistent with the currently projected DSA.

B. Moving to Stronger, More Sustainable, and Inclusive Growth
Growth has not been inclusive…
22.
Poverty reduction requires sustained high growth but also implementation of specific
policies to share its benefits more broadly.

(Appendix III and Text Figure 1). Poverty has a
strong geographical connotation, being highest in

rural areas and the further one goes from the
economically more vibrant coastal areas. In fact, poverty in rural areas increased during this period,
while internal migration contributed to about a third of the total reduction in poverty. These
findings suggest that policies to reduce poverty should focus on measures to enhance productivity
in rural areas and market access, and targeted cash transfers. Also, given the importance of internal
migration as a potential escape route from poverty, urban planning could take a more prominent
role in the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy. Policies should focus on improving urban and
peri-urban transportation, and the expansion of primary education and health services.

…and faces significant bottlenecks
23.
Growth is hampered by a number of major obstacles. Chief among these are
infrastructure gaps (especially energy and roads), high telecommunication costs; and—more
generally—a weak business environment. While investing in roads has been a budget priority since
2010, reforms to improve energy supply and telecommunication services have hardly gone beyond
early planning stages. Electricity generation costs are high, utilities inefficiently run, and Togo largely
depends on energy imports, exposing it to cut off risks (see below). Survey-based structural
indicators suggest that addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the business climate
remain crucial to unlocking Togo’s growth potential (Appendix IV). Although the financial sector has
deepened in the 2000s, concentration of the banking activity in Lomé prevents a wider reach of the
sector to the Togolese society, especially in rural areas (Appendix II).
24.
The new poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) aims at making growth stronger and
more inclusive. The Strategy to Accelerate Growth and Promote Employment (Stratégie de
Croissance Accélérée et de Promotion de l’Emploi—SCAPE—2013-2017) was adopted by the
government in August 2013. It was finalized after extensive consultations with stakeholders.5 It
builds on experience with the first PRSP (2009-11). Policies and reforms are envisaged around five
strategic pillars: (i) developing sectors with high growth potential; (ii) strengthening economic
infrastructure; (iii) developing human capital, social protection, and employment; (iv) strengthening
governance; and (v) promoting participatory, inclusive, and durable development. The SCAPE
includes plans to strengthen institutions for setting strategic priorities, and monitoring and
evaluating programs.
Decisive action to raise growth will be required on a number of fronts…
25.
So far, the authorities’ efforts have focused on improving road and transport
infrastructure. Given Togo’s location as a regional hub, the authorities view investment in
transportation infrastructure as critical to increase potential growth. A number of large projects are
already advanced in transportation. In addition to large road investments, airport and port capacity
will double by end-2014. The authorities have also recently established the Togo Invest Corporation
(TIC)—a fully-owned state holding company with capital of CFAF 20 billion (0.9 percent of GDP)—to
launch major rail and transportation projects along the North-South axis, mostly via public private
partnerships. Staff cautioned the authorities that this carries the high fiscal risks typically associated
to PPPs, as well as economic risks deriving from typically long gestation periods. In addition, the
project carries administrative risks, as it is unclear how policy and operational responsibilities would
be shared between ministries in charge of infrastructure development and TIC—thus undermining
already limited ministerial capacities. Risks would be reduced if Togo could develop the institutions
and legal framework to manage PPPs before the TIC starts operations. The authorities argued that in

5

The English translation will be circulated to the Executive Board, together with the related joint staff advisory note
(JSAN), as soon as possible.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

the short run risks will likely be limited given that TIC’s main activities in the coming year will be to
conduct technical feasibility studies.
26.
While staff agreed that transportation infrastructure should be a priority, it noted that
economic growth should be supported more broadly, to include reforms in the
telecommunications and energy sectors, and the business environment more generally. The
cost of telecom services is among the highest in the world, and access is still limited and marred by
frequent interruptions. It will be important to accelerate the implementation of the telecom strategy
and to liberalize the sector by allowing more competition.
27.
A comprehensive reform of the power sector to address a major bottleneck to growth
is overdue. Staff emphasized that the electricity sector is facing a structural financial deficit and that
it is already constraining economic growth. Given its limited domestic generation capacity, about
85 percent of Togo’s power is imported. On current investment plans, such shortfalls will only
become larger and are likely to develop into the most important constraint to growth. High input
costs compared to tariffs, operational inefficiencies, over-reliance on imports, and a lack of adequate
strategic planning have led to supply shortfalls. Peak demand is met by expensive fuel oil-based
generation supplied by an independent power producer. The sector is accumulating arrears to
suppliers, mostly to other electricity companies in neighboring countries. This exposes Togo to the
risk that these countries—which are themselves facing shortages—cut exports. At the same time, the
largest payment backlog toward the distribution company is due by public sector entities.6
28.
The authorities concurred with the staff analysis, but pointed out that there is no
short-term solution. While staff understands that this is a complex sector, it also noted that several
measures could be taken in the short-term and still have a positive impact. As a priority, staff argued
that it is important to break the cycle of arrears accumulation. This can be achieved via a public
information campaign aiming at making the public aware of the main financial and supply
constraints in the sector, with emphasis on the need to eliminate payment and service backlogs, and
by a sanctions policy allowing to cut off service to public sector entities. The authorities, fearing
backlash in case essential public services are interrupted, preferred to devise a repayment plan after
arrears are verified. It is thus crucial that the authorities make good on their intention to settle a
portion of government arrears in 2014 and that more realistic budget allocations are made. A
gradual move to cost-recovery level tariffs in the medium term is unavoidable, including to attract
foreign investors, provided other areas are addressed concurrently.
29.
There is significant scope for further improvement in the business climate
(Appendix IV). Despite progress made in a number of areas, e.g., creation of a one-stop shop for
business registration (which considerably reduced the time required to complete this procedure to
24 hours), Togo still ranks poorly in the 2013 Doing Business survey (156th out of 185 countries).
Reform efforts are especially needed in the areas where Togo is still lagging well behind comparator
6

While the collection rate on private sector accounts is above 95 percent, collection on central government
(31 percent) and municipalities (18 percent) is very poor. Overall arrears amount to 1.1 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

countries, such as protecting investors’ rights, enforcing contracts, and accessing financing. The
authorities recently awarded a contract for the operation of a one-stop window for foreign trade.
When fully operational, this is expected to facilitate the flow and transit of goods, and expedite
customs and border controls.
…as well as to make growth more inclusive
30.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ focus on inclusiveness under the new development
strategy. However, staff noted that growth relying on capital-intensive natural resource projects is
unlikely to create a lot of jobs and benefit the rest of the economy. Conversely, growth relying on
higher farm productivity and broader rural job opportunities is likely to generate additional demand
and to lead to faster poverty reduction. Financial sector stability and development and financial
inclusion are also important elements of an inclusive growth strategy (see below).
31.
The authorities are determined to alleviate poverty via economic growth and measures
to foster employment and micro-productive activities. Their strategy to promote inclusive
growth hinges on measures creating opportunities for gainful self-employment, and the gradual
expansion of the pilot school feeding program. Staff noted that given the strong geographical and
sectoral profile of poverty, expanding conditional cash transfers and the school feeding program
would appear good ways to deliver assistance to the poor. School feeding programs, in particular,
have the added advantage of improving forward and backward linkages within the rural economy.
However, the authorities fear that cash-based social programs may be prone to abuse and could
create a culture of dependency.

C. Strengthening the Financial Sector and External Sector Stability
Despite increased financial deepening and overall financial stability…
32.
The financial sector in Togo has experienced considerable financial deepening, and
Togo compares favorably to its WAEMU peers. Since 2007, credit- and deposits-to-GDP ratios
indicate significant improvements, and more than a 100 bank branches have been opened. However,
lack of wide access to credit in spite of this growth remains a challenge (Appendix II). From the
deposit perspective, low level of savings is a major constraint. On the credit supply side, lack of
competition among banks and concentrations around Lomé prevent financial services from reaching
wider public, especially in rural areas. The microfinance sector plays an important role where
traditional banking services do not function efficiently, but the sector is plagued by unregulated
activity.
33.
The microfinance sector has grown very rapidly. Between 2009 and 2012, deposits and
loans increased by 70 percent and 80 percent, respectively, and the number of clients increased
from about 0.7 to 1.2 million. At end-2012, the microfinance’s share of deposits was 16 percent of
the financial system. The microfinance plays a critical role in financial inclusion especially among the
poor and the rural population, covering a large number of households. Togo’s microfinance sector
plays a relatively more important part in the domestic economy than those in neighboring countries,

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

as evidenced by the higher financial deepening indicators and relatively higher proportion of
population covered by the sector.
…actions are needed to tackle vulnerabilities in some banks
34.
The overall situation of the banking system appears stable, but aggregate numbers
hide the weaknesses of individual banks. While NPLs have declined significantly over the past five
years and system-wide capital adequacy levels are strong, substantial differences among banks exist.
Stress-tests conducted recently suggest the system is strong according to traditional metrics of
liquidity and solvency, but they also show that it is imperative to give due weight to risks stemming
from highly concentrated loans and deposits’ short-term bias.
35.
The rehabilitation of the banking sector remains an unfinished business. Three major
state-owned banks (BTCI, UTB and BIA-T) were recapitalized in 2008 through a securitization
process. These institutions received about US$200 million in new government securities in exchange
for non-performing loans which were to be recovered by an asset recovery company called Société
de Recouvrement du Togo (SRT). Strengthening the recovery effort could result in important revenue
for the government but, so far, only limited amounts have been recovered. As time passes, the
recovery rate on the portfolio diminishes, reducing its value as a government asset.7 The bank
privatization process has led to the successful sale of two out of four banks, and an unsuccessful
attempt in early 2013 to privatize BTCI.
There is need to improve the regulatory framework and institutions
36.
There are considerable systemic weaknesses in the bank supervision framework in the
WAEMU region. Banking supervision relies on a dual mandate between the authorities in the
WAEMU and the Ministry of Finance. The WAEMU is responsible for supra-national supervision of
banks and can recommend recapitalization or resolution of weak institutions but the final decision
relies on the national Ministry of Finance.8 This structure can complicate the decision-making
process and promote moral hazard. Furthermore, banking regulation in the WAEMU is relatively lax
when compared to international standards. Non-performing loans are required to be provisioned
only after 180 days whereas international norms prescribe 90 days, and banks in the WAEMU are
allowed to often operate below the minimum capital requirements for extended time before they
are intervened. Delays in policy implementation due to complex regulatory framework, combined
with ex ante relatively loose financial regulation, result in a financial system prone to systemic risks.
While agreeing with the staff views, the authorities noted that these issues should be addressed at a
WAEMU-wide level.

7

As long as the operational costs of the SRT are not larger than the recovered amounts, the recovery of outstanding
loans should not generate liabilities for the government.

37.
Regulation of the microfinance sector needs to be improved. Prevalence of informal
lending and institutional arrangements constrains effective supervision. There is a proliferation of
small financial entities that operate without formal licenses or authorization. The supervisory
infrastructure is ill-equipped to track and enforce licensing, and close illegal units. Currently there
exist over 60 such microfinance entities. There is also need to rein in pyramid-type operations, which
undermine financial and social sector stability.
38.
The authorities and staff concurred that over the medium term policies should focus
on enabling the financial sector to perform greater financial intermediation. Policies could
include:


Adopting resolution strategies for problem banks. The authorities and staff agreed on the
importance to take effective and swift corrective action to address the situation of institutions
facing financial difficulties. There was agreement on the fact that the authorities would continue
leading the financial sector towards an environment where the private sector increases
participation through larger stockholding, and by carrying out the process of privatization of
public banks.



Enhancing oversight and supervision of the micro-credit sector. The microfinance supervisor—the
Cellule d’Appui et de Suivi des Institutions Mutualistes et de Coopératives d’Epargne et de Crédit
(CAS-IMEC, a division of the MEF)—is grossly understaffed and needs significant institutional
strengthening. An important first step would be to increase the staffing and enhance training in
modern risk-based financial sector supervision. At the same time, it is important to close all
unlicensed institutions, and take measures to prevent the establishment and development of
pyramid-type structures. In the medium term, there will be need to promote the restructuring
and consolidation of the microfinance sector.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO



Restructuring pension funds to become financially sustainable over the medium-term. Staff
highlighted the importance of adopting one of the proposed options to eliminate the structural
deficit of the public sector pension scheme (CRT) and to settle public sector arrears with both
the CRT and the national social security fund (CNSS). The options for improving the financial
situation of the CRT include: (i) raising the retirement age; (ii) progressively raising the
contribution rate; and (iii) transferring social assistance payments (which have nothing to do with
pensions) to the state budget. This would allow to reduce financial losses and to accommodate
the increasing number of beneficiaries.
Improving external sector stability

39.
An external sector stability assessment suggests that external sector risks are generally
manageable (Appendix IV). Although export growth has accelerated significantly over the past five
years, imports have grown even faster, mainly on account of investment goods for various
infrastructure projects. Togo has had structural current account deficits for nearly two decades. Low
savings relative to large investment needs imply continued deficits over the medium term, although
they are expected to decline as new projects come on-stream. In the longer run, prospects are
generally good for greater export growth given investment in mining-related activities and the large
expansion of the port of Lomé. Inward FDI is expected to increase on account of improvements in
infrastructure and the business climate. Remittances have remained an important contributor to the
balance of payments.
40.
Staff assessment of the real effective exchange rate (REER), using three standard
methods, indicate that it is broadly in line with economic fundamentals. The REER has
somewhat declined over the past three years (Text Figure 2), largely reflecting the depreciation of
the euro, to which the CFA franc is pegged. External reserves (pooled at the regional level) are
ample, covering more than five months of imports. To reduce external vulnerabilities, Togo needs to
implement prudent fiscal and borrowing policies, and increase non-price competitiveness. The
authorities concurred with this assessment
115

and noted that they are working with other

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Growth has picked up over the past few years on the back of reforms initiated under
the previous ECF-supported program. The past five years have seen a reversal of declining per
capita GDP levels that had plagued Togo over the previous 15 years. Growth has generally been
broad-based, with agriculture, cement and clinker manufacturing, construction, and other services
showing good performance, but it has not been inclusive. The medium term growth outlook is
good, and the challenge is to sustain the momentum and make growth more inclusive, taking
advantage of Togo’s unique location in the midst of some of SSA’s biggest and most dynamic subregional economies. Inflation would remain moderate. The authorities need to reinvigorate muchneeded structural reforms that had stalled over the past two years in order to set growth on a
sustainable path.
42.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ renewed determination to address emerging fiscal
problems in 2013 in order to set Togo on a sustainable debt path. Fiscal deficits and debt ratios
have increased in recent years, reducing room for fiscal maneuver and raising sustainability issues.
Restoring fiscal space and keeping low the risk of debt distress require lower deficits. Debt
sustainability considerations call for strengthening of debt management and for further reduction of
the fiscal deficit in the medium term. Greater revenue mobilization is needed to facilitate high
priority spending on infrastructure, health, education, and agriculture. The proposed OTR would
help reinvigorate revenue mobilization. At the same time, operational reforms in revenue
administration should be deepened.
43.
Reducing the fiscal deficit while addressing the country’s social and development
needs will require improving public spending efficiency. Beyond reducing the cost of running
the government and streamlining of government agencies, rationalization of expenditure and more
cost-effective support to the most vulnerable segments of the population will be needed. In this
regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to phase out costly and poorly-targeted fuel price
subsidies and to broaden and improve social safety nets. This will require strong political leadership
to overcome vested interests, a well-orchestrated public information campaign, as well as good
administrative capacity. It remains important to systematically address pressures on the wage bill
and size of the public sector by defining a structural wage and employment reform.
44.
There is need to have a determined effort to improve debt management. Debt
management has weakened considerably since the HIPC completion point at end-2010. At the same
time, debt levels have increased in part due to the government’s recognition of old liabilities.
Consequently, careful monitoring of existing debt and rigorous implementation of a medium-term
debt strategy will be needed to control the accumulation of new debt and bring current debt levels
progressively down. In particular, the authorities should seek only new concessional external loans
until there is a decisive improvement in their debt management capacity. While PPPs have the
potential to unlock much-needed financing for infrastructure, the authorities will need to adopt

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

a robust legal framework and improve their institutional capacity to ensure maximum benefits from
such arrangements while minimizing contingent liabilities for the government.
45.
The main medium-term challenge for Togo is to move to higher, sustainable, and
inclusive growth. To raise potential growth, there is need to address major bottlenecks, especially
in infrastructure. Despite the pickup in growth over the past five years, overall poverty incidence has
declined only slowly. Indeed, there are significant regional differences in poverty levels, with poverty
in several rural regions actually increasing. Growth has not been inclusive, as the poorest 40 percent
of the population has seen its incomes decline between 2006 and 2011. Consequently, creation of
fiscal space to support implementation of policies that raise incomes of the poor, such as rural
feeder roads, mini dams for irrigation, and off-grid energy alternatives will be needed to make
growth more inclusive. At the same time, for the poorest segments of the population, progressively
extending the pilot cash transfer and school feeding programs will begin to reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
46.
While the overall Togolese financial system has developed significantly over the past
decade and is sound, a number of individual banks have shown fragility. Financial depth has
increased significantly over the past decade and Togo compares favorably to its WAEMU peers. The
microfinance sector has greater reach in Togo than in other WAEMU countries. Actions will be
needed to enhance weak banks, such as requiring banks to accumulate capital, where needed,
through dividend suspensions or new capital injections. There is also need to significantly enhance
the supervision, monitoring and control of the microfinance sector, which is plagued by structural
weaknesses and unregulated activity.
47.
The economy will remain exposed to substantial risks, mainly on the domestic side.
The main domestic risks are delays in reforming the energy sector and difficulties modernizing state
functions and reforming state owned enterprises, which would affect growth and fiscal sustainability.
External vulnerabilities are generally manageable as Togo’s export destinations are relatively
diversified. That said, concerted efforts to increase non-price competitiveness will help propel Togo
into a major transport and logistics hub on the West African coast.
48.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12–
month cycle.

Memorandum Item:
Tax exemptions recorded by DGI and DGD as revenue3
1

Includes the BCEAO credit for domestic arrears clearance.

2

Identifies residual for past years (i.e. 2012) and financing gap for current and future years (i.e. 2013 onward). In keeping with practice under the previous ECF-supported program,
unidentified financing from 2014 on is calculated without assuming any external budget support (i.e. exceptional financing).
3

24

DGD started collecting data on tax exemptions on imports in 2013. The amount of these exemptions in 2013 is estimated at CFAF 28 bill (1.3 percent of GDP).

Expected

economy

Nature of Impact

Short Term (1 year)
Togo’s economy is relatively open, so a decline in external demand
would reduce potential growth, although domestic factors, especially
public and private investment, have played a significant role in recent
growth performance.
Medium
Generalized poverty in the country constitutes an environment prone to
social unrest, which may generate demonstrations and major economic
disruption, although public order and security are well established.
HiG2gh
Policy slippages may materialize to: (i) accelerate infrastructure
investment too rapidly, in a context of low capacity at all stages of the
investment cycle; (ii) yield to requests to settle all old debts without
adequate checks; and (iii) rapidly increase public sector wages and
employment. Under social and political pressure, the authorities may
delay taking decisive action on PFM and OTR reforms.
High
Some public sector banks have been poorly managed. A lot needs to be
done to improve supervision of microcredit institutions. Both sectors
pose risks for financial sector stability and fiscal costs.
2
Medium- to Long-Term (2 to 4 years)
High
Planning and regulatory inaction and poor operational management of
utilities may lead to widespread power cuts. In the short term, this will
result in budget costs.
Medium
Flooding and drought are a recurring event in Togo, but their impact is
typically short-lived and/or localized.
Togo’s export base is diversified by country and product. Main source of
Low
remittances are Europe and WAEMU. Both channels have proven stable
over recent years.
Togo’s exports are diversified consisting mainly of primary commodities
Medium
to emerging and developing countries, whose price is a function of
global economic conditions. China is mainly a source of imports and
loans for public works. A slowdown in EMs could actually lower import
prices.
Medium
The local elections are not likely to result in slippages. However, the
presidential elections are likely to limit the authorities’ ability to exercise
fiscal discipline, pursue structural reforms, and share the fruits from
growth more equally.

Political and private interests often overlap, and are essential to maintain
the current stability. Reforms diminishing the control exercised by
entrenched groups are likely to meet strong resistance. Delays in reforms
would slow economic growth, increase inequality, and potentially lead to
pressure for political change.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Some of these risks (e.g., weather related emergency) could materialize in the short-term as well.

Appendix II. Financial Sector Profile
The financial sector in Togo experienced considerable deepening over the last decade. However, lack of
broad access to credit in spite of this growth remains a challenge. Lack of competition among banks to
reach new customers and concentration around Lomé (despite increases in the number of branches)
prevent a wider reach, especially in rural areas. The microfinance sector plays an important role where
traditional banking services do not function efficiently, but the sector is plagued by unregulated
activity. At the broader level, while traditional risk metrics such as improving capital adequacy and
NPLs suggest there is aggregate stability, there are individual banks that do not meet prudential
requirements. The overall soundness of the system can thus be threatened by a further deterioration of
these banks unless timely action is taken. Reinforcing this point, a stress test that was conducted
recently suggests that the banking sector is vulnerable to insolvency and illiquidity crises in the face of
shocks that can exploit systemic asset concentrations, underlining the fragility of aggregate stability.

A. Banking System
1.
Indicators of depth and overall financial stability show encouraging signs.1 Indicators of
financial depth have risen steadily, and compare favorably with the WAEMU average (Text Figures 1a
and 1b). The deposit-to-GDP ratio has more than doubled since 2000 to 38 percent, while for
WAEMU, the same ratio stands at 25 percent.

2.
Financial sector indicators (FSIs) suggest the system is well capitalized, although a
couple of banks display substantial weaknesses. The gross NPL ratio appears to be stable near
11 percent, but caution is warranted. The loan composition of the portfolio indicates excessive
concentration in some sectors. Over 70 percent of loans flow to commerce, manufacturing and
transportation, exposing the banking sector to risk of loan concentration in the event of a common
shock to these sectors’ profitability. Furthermore, loans allocated to the five largest enterprises
account for over 70 percent of total capital, underlining exposure to a potentially correlated shock
1

Abiding by Basel I standards prevents use of proper risk-based approaches to evaluate the stability of banks in
Togo. For instance, bank holdings of sovereign debt are given zero risk weighting in calculating prudential ratios.
Similarly, claims on financial institutions are given a risk-weight of 20 percent regardless of actual creditworthiness of
the institution. Thus, these standards may overestimate solvency ratios for banks that actively pursue transactions in
government securities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

among important stakeholders in the system. Indeed, IMF (2013) shows that stress tests at the
WAEMU level indicate that concentration of lending represents one of the main risks in the financial
system.
3.
There are indications of limited competition. The four largest banks account for over
60 percent of total assets, total deposits and total loans in 2012. While measures of industrial
concentration are not always the best indicators for market dominance, lending policies and interest
rates for loans paint a consistent picture, namely inertia to lower rates. The thin network of branches
outside Lomé enhances the lack of competition by rendering transportation cost a non-trivial factor
in the choice of bank. Furthermore, the ratio of non-interest income to total income provides an
indication of the relative importance of bank commissions and fees in generating income. The ratio,
although declining since 2004, was at 41 percent in 2011. A high ratio is a reflection of a business
model characterized by lack of lending opportunities and hence concentrated in other financial
services apart from providing loans.
4.
Bank privatization has fallen short of expectations. Banks in Togo reached nearbankruptcy in mid-2000s mainly due to heavy exposure to NPLs of state-owned enterprises. Three
major state-owned banks (BTCI, UTB and BIA-T) had to be recapitalized through a securitization
process, and one private bank (Ecobank Togo) underwent restructuring. Bad loans were removed
from their balance sheets in return for bonds, which are eligible for BCEAO refinancing. The
authorities decided to recover the bad loans via an asset recovery company.2 In order to improve
governance and compensate for the heavy budgetary impact of recapitalization (CFAF 88.1 billion,
6.2 percent of GDP), the authorities decided to privatize the three state-owned banks in addition to
a fourth one, which did not need financial restructuring in 2008 (BTD). However, only two banks—
BTD and BIA-T—were eventually privatized.

B. Risk Assessment
5.
Stress-testing of the Togolese banking system reveals credit risks. The most important
result of the stress-test is that, in the event of the default of the largest borrower in the system, the
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) falls 70 percent for banks of all sizes. Specifically, the medium and large
banks have the greatest insolvency risk due to a decline in their CARs relative to the baseline
scenario. However, the smallest banks are at greatest risk of a run under simulated liquidity risks.
Similarly, testing the concentration risk of loans to certain sectors (commerce, manufacturing and
transportation) demonstrates that stagnation in each of these sectors would put primarily the
medium and large banks at risk. This is a first order impact, and it should be viewed as a generous
estimate. One would expect effects to pass into the remaining sectors, and feed back to the entire
financial system, including smaller banks.

2

The launch of the Société de Recouvrement du Togo (SRT) has suffered extensive delays. It became operational only
in early 2013, but its operational strategy is not yet approved, and it has recovered a limited volume of assets.

30

C. Microfinance Sector
6.
The microfinance sector has been growing rapidly. Deposits and loans increased by
77 percent and 80 percent respectively, between 2008 and 2012. At end 2012, the level of savings in
the sector stood at CFAF 116 billion, 16 percent of the financial system deposits whereas credit was
at CFAF 103 billion, approximately 14 percent of overall financial sector credit.
7.
The years 2010 and 2011 were characterized by a crisis of confidence among savers.
One major institution, IDH, was put under temporary receivership in July 2010 after being declared
bankrupt. However, its resolution has made limited progress since.3 In this context, the growth of
NPLs in the sector from 3.2 percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2012 is worrisome, and requires
monitoring.
8.
Insufficient technical capacity contributes to the problem of ineffective supervision.
Currently, there are two institutions that supervise the sector, CASIMEC and WAEMU Banking
Commission. Large networks fall under the responsibility of the WAEMU Banking Commission. while
smaller operations are monitored by CASIMEC, an institution within the Ministry of Finance.
However, there are currently significant capacity and technical issues. The supervisory infrastructure
lacks the technical means to develop tracking systems to enforce licensing rules, and make decisions
on dealing with the many small and decentralized entities it should supervise. Indeed, currently
there are sixty-three illicit microfinance entities. A strategy still has to be devised to either
incorporate these institutions into the regulatory system or to close them.

D. Policy Advice
9.
In the short run, financial sector consolidation should be favored over broadening and
deepening. A combination of banks, including new Pan-African banks, aggressively expanding into
Togo’s financial sector, weak supervision, and conditions in microfinance are increasing financial
vulnerability if unaddressed. The offer of banking services for Togo’s small economy—and the
formal sector—appear sufficient, for the time being, in quantity. What is lacking is an offer that
better responds to quality criteria and the development needs of the economy. Thus, the short term
priority in sectoral reform should be to tighten multilateral surveillance through the Banking
Commission and other financial sector supervisors, and harmonize coordination with national
authorities, which license financial sector activity.
10.
At the regional level the bank resolution framework should be revamped through greater
executive powers for the Banking Commission, more effective recapitalization and bankruptcy
proceedings to prevent contagion. Policies should include: (i) strengthening capacity and the means
of microfinance supervision to allow it to execute its mandate and impose decisions; (ii) reducing the
backlog of microfinance licensing, consolidating non-viable entities and closing illegitimate ones,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

TOGO

and impeding the re-emergence of pyramidal schemes; and (iii) developing financial tools to assess
and package risks, and broadening the basis of activity.
11.
Medium-term objectives can then focus on increasing financial depth by enabling an
efficiently functioning banking sector to rise to its full intermediary potential. This implies
expanding financial access to a wider cross section of society while preserving the stability and the
profitability of the banking system. To reach this goal (i) the legal framework should carefully design
guarantees, property rights, and a viable insurance market, which are key elements to ease credit
risk and collateral constraints, and hence would allow banks to lend at longer maturities, decrease
loan rates, and diversify debt instruments to more effectively finance investment; (ii) there should be
greater awareness of financial services, financial education and outreach, especially in rural areas;
(iii) asymmetric information can be reduced by more transparency on potential borrowers through a
functional credit registration system; (iv) existing modern technologies, including mobile phonebased ones, can facilitate payments when supported by appropriate regulatory infrastructure; and
(v) business climate can improve by increasing the enforceability of contracts and ensuring more
effective and consistent regulatory compliance.

Appendix III. Poverty Dynamics and Income Distribution: Recent
Developments and Determinants
A comparison of the official poverty lines from the 2006 and 2011 household budget surveys indicates
that poverty in Togo declined marginally and income distribution worsened. The growth incidence
curve demonstrates that poverty declined because incomes from the fifth wealth decile and higher
increased. Meanwhile, consumption for those in the bottom four wealth deciles declined or stagnated.
Thus, equality indicators worsened and the wealthy got wealthier while the poor got poorer. Poverty
has a strong geographical connotation, with its intensity being highest in rural areas and the farther
north one goes. This pattern reflects the fact that economic growth is largely concentrated around
Lomé. Implications of these findings for poverty reduction policies are discussed.

A. Introduction
1.
The pace of economic growth accelerated during 2006–2011 in Togo, outstripping
demographic growth. Real income per-capita also increased by 6 percent to CFAF 194,000
(US$412) (Text Figure 1). These recent gains only partially compensate for the losses in real incomes
observed since the early 1980s. Following

other regions, only Kara experienced some
poverty decline. The poorest regions in 2006 (Central and Savannas), on the other hand, became
poorer. Savannas, the region farthest away from the coast, remains the poorest in Togo, with about
90 percent of its population living in poverty.
Which income groups benefitted from growth?
4.
In the previous section, we explored poverty in its regional distribution. We can now
approach from a different angle the initial question on who benefitted from growth. Which income
group benefitted from growth? A growth incidence curve (GIC) shows the growth rate of real
household consumption for different points in the distribution of consumption, after sorting the
households according to their standard of living (Chen and Ravallion, 2003).

6.
A different situation emerges for Lomé. Here,
consumption improved fairly equally across all income
levels among residents, as the GIC is consistently above
zero and relatively flat (Text Figure 5). This suggests that

Real income growth over the past five years
has not been inclusive. As can be seen from GIC at the
national level, growth has generally benefited the
wealthy more than the poor (Text Figure 4).3 In fact, the
growth rate of consumption is almost collinear with its
level, i.e., the higher the level of consumption the higher
has been its growth rate. Even more worrisome, the
poorest three deciles actually witnessed declines in
consumption varying between 10 percent and 18
percent, while the wealthiest two deciles recorded
income growth of around 10 percent on average.

the capital city offers more formal and informal opportunities for its resident—across all income
levels—to benefit from economic growth.
7.
In rural areas, the benefits from national economic growth have accrued even less to
the poor. The poorest 65 percent of residents in rural areas actually saw their consumption decline
(Text Figure 6). This suggests that residents of rural areas
are facing obstacles in partaking in the benefits of

circumstances, not surprisingly, inequality—as measured by

The Gini coefficient rose from 0.361 in 2006 to 0.393 in
2011.4 Although at 0.393 the level of inequality is similar to
that of countries in the sub-region, an increase of 3

C. Food Insecurity and Migration

Percent of households that is
food insecure

8.
Food insecurity is pervasive and highly seasonal in rural areas. In the months of June
and July up to 20 percent of households in rural areas face food shortages (Text Figure 7). This drops
to around 5 percent between September and

smoothing their consumption, probably due to limited
or precarious monetary incomes to afford higher prices during off-seasons. These patterns point
towards a potentially important area of policy intervention, that includes improving the functioning
of rural markets, improving possibilities for storage and access to off-farm income earning
opportunities (including cash for work or food for work) to allow households to purchase food
during the lean season.
9.
Rural-urban migration has been a driver of poverty reduction. Higher levels of welfare in
urban areas attract migrants from other areas. To establish how migration contributes to poverty
reduction, changes in poverty incidence between 2006 and 2011 have been decomposed into how
4

the same.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

100

TOGO

much of the total poverty reduction is due to reductions when households stayed within urban or
rural areas, and how much is due to rural-urban migration (a third term establishes the interaction
between the two). Applying this decomposition shows that of the total drop in poverty incidence of
3 percentage points, about one third (1.1 percent) is attributable to internal migration. Migration is
thus an important contributor to poverty reduction.

D. Policy Implications
10.
Rising inequality and poverty patterns suggest different policies for different wealth
groups. Poor households, largely found in rural areas, would benefit from policies that raise
agricultural productivity and lower barriers to participate in markets. With urban food markets set to
continue to grow, opportunities for farmers to sell their surplus staples would increase. Therefore,
more policy attention should be devoted to feeder roads, local transportation, increased agricultural
extension, improved price incentives (e.g., passing on to farmers a greater proportion of
international agricultural commodity prices as has been done for cotton), better storage facilities
and the provision of agricultural inputs in an efficient and cost effective manner (World Bank,
2013a).
11.
Social safety nets targeted towards the poorest would help alleviate the high and
seasonal levels of food insecurity. Cash transfers and school feeding programs, especially if they
are conditional, are typically inexpensive fiscally and quite effective socially (Arze del Granado and
Adenauer, 2011). The strong geographical and seasonal connotation of food insecurity provides an
opportunity to implement geographically targeted and seasonal income support programs. The
current cash transfer and school feeding programs, currently implemented on a pilot basis, have the
potential to provide income relief to the poorest, and create forward and backward linkages within
the rural economy.
12.
Although migration brings the risk of urban gridlock and inefficiency, if managed well,
it could contribute to higher total factor productivity and incomes. Urban planning should thus
take a more prominent role in the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy and emphasize public
urban and peri-urban transportation in a context of an economically vibrant capital region. Also,
policies that build human capital across the nation (universal access to quality education, nutrition
policies, access to health care) that enhance the capacity of (potential) migrants should be
emphasized.
13.
Two characteristics of developments in SSA are relevant to chart poverty-reduction
policies in Togo, given its context of internal migration. First, there is increasing evidence of the
importance of the development of secondary towns for poverty and inequality reduction (World
Bank, 2013a). In this context, market-friendly public policies—fostering availability of banking and
other tertiary services, investing in local roads and transportation networks, education and health
services—are likely to have a more positive and permanent impact than the regional fiscal incentives
(i.e., policies based on tax exemptions and free enterprise zones) preferred by the authorities.
Second, the informal sector is the new normal in SSA and is leading in employment creation. To

Appendix IV. External Sector Stability Assessment and Matrix
This note aims to assess external stability of the Togolese economy. Togo recorded continuous current
account deficit since 2000, financed mainly by official aid flows. The current account deficit increased
in 2011 to 9.1 percent driven by higher food and oil prices. In 2012, there was further deterioration of
the deficit to 11.8 percent on account of higher imports for public and private investments. The current
account deficit is expected to remain in the 9-10 percent range until 2016, and improve afterwards
upon the completion of the ongoing investment projects. The deterioration in the current account
deficit is expected to be financed by a pick-up in inward FDI as well as project loans. The real exchange
rate is broadly in line with economic fundamentals. Improving Togo’s competitiveness rests on
implementing structural measures to improve the business environment. The external position
assessment matrix (Text Table 4) provides a summary of Togo’s external sector stability.

A. Balance Payment Assessment
1.
Over the past decade, Togo recorded persistent current account deficits, which are
expected to remain high over the next four years. During 2000-11, Togo had an average deficit
of about 8.2 percent. This has been mainly financed by official grants and concessional financing,
which has been making Togo susceptible to changes in donor support. In 2011, owing to the surge
in oil and food prices, the deficit increased to 9.1 percent. In 2012, as capital imports grew—notably
due to higher level of public and private investments—the current account deficit increased to
11.8 percent. These include the expansion of the international airport and the port of Lomé, and
construction of a new clinker factory. In light of the ongoing investments, the deficit is expected to
remain at around 10 percent until 2015. Upon completion of these infrastructure investments,
Togo’s production, and thus, export capacity is projected to improve while project-linked capital
imports should decrease.

The widening of the current account deficit has been financed mostly through aid, and
is expected to remain so over the projection period. However, aid decreased in 2012 in the
absence of an IMF-supported program.

Since 2010, Togo’s exports have been around 40 percent of GDP, and are expected to
remain at this level until 2017. However, during 2000-10, the country’s exports fluctuated notably,
averaging around 32 percent of GDP per annum. This can be attributed to the fluctuations in
phosphate and cotton exports. Between 2013 and 2016, the export revenue from these products as
a percentage of GDP is projected to remain stable. From 2017 onwards, the planned public
investments are expected to result in higher export capacity.

Cotton, phosphates, cement and clinker,
cocoa and coffee have been Togo’s main exports,
and still constitute more than 40 percent of total
exports (Text Figure 1). The most notable decrease
was observed for cement and clinker exports. The
ongoing public and private investment projects are
expected to result in higher export capacity of these
goods. However, the country can still benefit from
further diversification of its export portfolio.

6.
Foreign direct investment has been and is expected to remain a stable source of
financing in Togo. While FDI slowed down from an average of 3.8 percent in the first half of the
2000s to around 1.5 percent in the second half, it is expected to increase in accordance with the
ongoing public and private investments over the projection period. Moreover, improvement in
infrastructure is expected to attract higher levels of FDI.
7.
Workers’ remittances have been an increasing source of foreign exchange, and
constituted around 7 percent of GDP in 2012. Since 2000, they have been on an upward trend
and are expected to remain high. When compared with the FDI flows, remittances provided a larger
amount of financing over the past decade.

B. Exchange Rate Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

TOGO

8.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated slightly over the last two years,
mainly reflecting weakness of the euro (to which the CFA franc is pegged), reversing an
upward trend since 2000. The REER appreciation of about 17 percent during 2000-2009 has been
partially offset in the last three years with the REER depreciating by almost 11 percent. While Togo’s
exports have benefited, since 2010 imports have been increasing at a faster pace, leading to a
widening current account deficit. As shown in the exchange rate assessment section below, Togo’s
low level of competitiveness can be attributed to structural issues rather than exchange rate
misalignment.

fundamentals in 2012.
10.
The ERER method indicates a moderate undervaluation of the exchange rate, by about
3.8 percent. This compares to a 4.4 percent overvaluation in 2010, assessed at the time of the last
Article IV consultation.
11.
The MB approach indicates that the REER is slightly overvalued by 0.6 percent. The MB
approach estimates the exchange rate adjustment necessary to close the gap between the
equilibrium current account balance (the “norm”), based on economic fundamentals, and the
underlying current account balance. For Togo, the equilibrium and the underlying current account
deficits are estimated at about 2.8 percent and 3.6 percent of GDP, respectively. These results
indicate that 0.6 percent depreciation in the REER would be needed to close the gap
12.
Application of the ES approach to Togo indicates that the REER is slightly overvalued
by about 0.4 percent, not a significant deviation from the equilibrium. The ES method

compares the actual current account balance with the balance that stabilizes the net foreign assets
(NFA) at a certain benchmark level. The underlying NFA-to-GDP ratio is -41 percent.

C. Non-Price Competitiveness
13.
Survey-based indicators point to low
non-price competitiveness. While Togo is not
included in the World Economic Forum’s
Competitiveness Index, the World Bank’s Doing
Business Report 2013 ranks Togo as the 156th out
of 185 countries. While Togo ranks at the same
level as the average WAEMU country, it still faces
particular challenges in protecting investors’
rights, enforcing contracts, starting a business, and
accessing financing. Supply of infrastructure remains inadequate and procedures for paying taxes
and registering propriety continue to be cumbersome (Panel chart 1).
14.
The quality of governance, which has been historically weak, deteriorated since 2000
according to World Governance Indicators. These rankings are based on government
effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption. Togo ranks below the average for
sub-Saharan Africa (Panel chart 1).
15.
In terms of political stability, Togo ranks lower than both its SSA and LIC peers. This
highlights the need for improving political stability to ensure a more sustainable business
environment (Figure 1).

position

Background: The domestic saving rate is low, while the
investment needs are high and costly. These have been mostly
covered by official aid flows. The deficit has increased notably
in the last two years as a result of both exogenous factors and
high public and private investment.
Assessment: The deficit is expected to remain high until 201617, reflecting the planned large-scale public and private
investment projects to be undertaken. In 2013, a slight
improvement in the deficit is foreseen due to the decrease in
global commodity prices, which initially drove up the deficit in
2011. The financing for these investments are expected to be
provided by official flows, concessional financing from both
traditional and non-Paris Club lenders. In 2012, there was a
notable increase in financing from non-traditional lenders,
while multilateral financing decreased.
Background: Togo is part of the WAEMU. The CFA franc is
pegged to the euro, which depreciated significantly in recent
years.
Assessment: The three CGER methods do not suggest a
significant misalignment. These findings are in line with those
for the WAEMU. The underlying reasons for Togo’s low
competitiveness is more on the non-price and business
environment competitiveness side
Background: Togo reached the HIPC completion point in 2010
and received debt relief. While remittances and FDI constitute a
major portion of external inflows, the overall balance of
payments has been reporting a deficit.
Assessment: In 2012, project loans increased significantly and
are expected to remain elevated. In line with large private
investment projects, FDI is expected to increase over the next
few years. The sustainability of capital account flows depends
on forceful fiscal consolidation and additional bilateral and
multilateral assistance that it could catalyze.
Background: At the WAEMU level, reserves amount to over 5
months of imports, 60 percent of broad money and 100 percent
of short-term debt. Common reserves can be used to finance
the needs of individual WAEMU countries.
Assessment: The level of foreign exchange reserves of the
WAEMU is adequate.
Background: Togo had a major improvement in its external
debt indicators thanks to the 2010 HIPC debt relief it received.
Gross external debt was around 18 percent in 2012. It consists
of mainly of concessional loans from both official and
commercial creditors.
Assessment: Togo’s external debt is expected to increase to
about 22 percent over the next four years. The DSA indicates
moderate debt distress risk.

Overall assessment:
The external position
has been weakening
significantly since
2011, and is expected
to remain so until
2016/17 due to high
amount of public and
private infrastructure
investments.
Concurrently, the
external debt position
is expected to
deteriorate.
Potential policy
responses: Fiscal
consolidation and
prudent borrowing
should help reduce
external
vulnerabilities. The
investment plans are
expected to lead to
higher production
(export) capacity and
lower current account
deficit in the medium
term. Togo is still
facing challenges on
competitiveness,
which signals to a

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Peter Allum (IMF) and
Jeffrey Lewis and Marcelo
Giugale (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association, using the debt
sustainability framework for low-income countries
approved by the Boards of both institutions.

The analysis based on the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability framework for low-income
countries shows that Togo remains at moderate risk of debt distress. After full HIPC assistance,
MDRI and beyond HIPC assistance, Togo’s external and public debt indicators improved
significantly in 2010/11, and remained stable under the previous ECF-supported program. In
2012, Togo contracted significant external debt. While debt indicators are projected to remain
below the policy-relevant indicative thresholds in the 20-year period under the baseline
scenario, Togo remains vulnerable to certain shocks and could breach the policy-relevant
thresholds for the PV of debt-to-GDP, PV of debt-to-exports, PV of debt-to-revenue and debt
service-to-revenue ratios under some alternative scenarios in the outer years.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The last joint DSA for Togo was prepared in November 2010 and updated in August 2011,
and both concluded that Togo was at moderate risk of debt distress. This debt sustainability analysis
(LIC-DSA) for Togo assesses its external and public debt using the forward-looking debt sustainability
framework (DSF) for low-income countries.1 The outcome of this analysis was in line with the previous
DSAs. Togo reached the completion point of the HIPC Initiative in December 2010 and was granted debt
relief from several multilateral and bilateral creditors.

2.
In the LIC-DSA framework, the present
value of Togo’s public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) external debt is US$724 million at end2012. Around 45 percent of this stock of debt is
owed to multilateral creditors and the remainder to
bilateral and commercial creditors of which around
28 percent is owed to non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors (Text Table 1). Non-Paris Club debt has
increased almost by five percentage points of GDP
since 2010. Concurrently, domestic debt decreased
from 30 percent in 2010 to 27 percent of GDP in
2012.

BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
3.

The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for the present DSA are the following:
a.

Real GDP growth is projected to be 5.6 percent in 2013 and average about 5.9 percent over 201418, driven by public and private investments in key sectors including agriculture, mining industry
and infrastructure (especially in transport). The estimated potential growth rate exceeds historical
rates, which were depressed by the dislocations caused by the protracted social, political, and

This DSA has been prepared by Fund staff using the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low
Income Countries (see “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt
Relief”,
(http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEBTDEPT/PolicyPapers/21154573/DMSDR1S3149398v1DSFPape
rforweb.pdf). Togo’s quality of policies and institutions, as measured by the average World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the period 2010–12 (2.95), places it as a “weak
performer”. The corresponding indicative thresholds for the external debt indicators are 30 percent for
the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent of the debt-to-export ratio, 200 percent for NPV of debt-torevenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 18 percent for the debt service-torevenue ratio.

economic crisis that the country experienced up to the mid-2000s.The main downside risks to
growth projections are related to the country’s weak management capacity. These may deter the
implementation of the planned public investments, which would be one of the main drivers of
growth over the medium term. Additionally, while in the short run, public and private investments
in key sectors rely on electricity generated by their own resources, the supply of electricity remains
a binding constraint in the medium and long run,
b.

Public investment is projected to accelerate starting in 2013, reaching 10.4 percent of GDP in 2013
and 10.9 percent in 2014 and retain this upward trend until 2017, slightly slowing down in 2018.
Upon completion of the planned investments, it is expected to stabilize around 9.5 percent. About
35 percent of public investments will be financed domestically while the remaining 65 percent will
be via external financing. Public investment projects are expected to be mostly directed to
infrastructure and will lead GDP growth to increase above its long-term trend for these years.
Togo has weak public investment management capacity as documented by the IMF’s 2013 Public
Investment Management Index (PIMI).2

c.

The projections for key commodity prices (oil, cotton, cocoa, and coffee) through 2018 are based
on WEO projections of August 2013 and are assumed constant in real terms afterwards.

d.

Inflation over the long-term is projected to remain stable at around 2.5 percent, reflecting sound
monetary policy at the regional level.

e.

The current account deficit is expected to remain at levels above 10 percent, after a slight
improvement in 2013 from 11.8 percent in 2012 to about 10.6 percent. The underlying reason for
high projections of the deficit in the first projection years is higher levels of capital imports needed
for the planned public and private investments. From 2016 onwards, the current account balances
are projected to improve and would fluctuate around 7 percent over the long run.

f.

The domestic primary fiscal balance is projected to return to positive territory and remain above
1 percent in the projection period, thereby providing a fiscal anchor to create the fiscal room to
generate reductions in the debt-to-GDP stock and thereby ensuring fiscal sustainability over the
long term.3

g.

The overall balance is expected to improve by 2 percentage points of GDP to a deficit of 3 percent
by 2017 and to gradually decline to around 2 percent, reflecting lower infrastructure investment
needs in the medium to long term.

2

Togo received a rating of 0.92 in the IMF’s Public Investment Management Index on a scale from 0 to
4 Togo’s rating is lower than those of its WAEMU peers (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali and
Senegal).
3

The domestic primary fiscal balance is the authorities’ primary tool for short term fiscal policy, given
interest payments and multi-year infrastructure investment plans.

h.

FDI flows are expected to increase over the medium-term reflecting improvements in the
investment climate and overall governance as the SCAPE program is expected to address these
areas. However, given Togo’s weak track record in governance, these flows, as well as grants, are
subject to significant risks, and this may hinder Togo’s concessional financing. FDI is expected to
increase from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2018, as a result of public and
private investments, better infrastructure and improved investment climate.

i.

Initially, external financing will be mostly on grant terms, with less concessional financing
gradually picking up, leading to a decrease in the grant element of new financing (as shown in
Figure 1). The sources of concessional external financing are expected to consist of Togo’s
traditional multilateral donors, as well as the recently-increased financing from non-Paris Club
creditors (especially China and India). Since the completion of the previous ECF program in 2011,
Togo’s creditor profile changed somewhat. As of end-2012, the loans from non-Paris Club (NPC)
creditors constituted about 28 percent of total debt stock compared to 24 percent at end-2011.
External borrowing by state-owned enterprises totaled 15 percent of total debt stock in 2012.

j.

The DSA is based on the new unified discount rate of five percent.4

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Baseline
4.
Under the baseline scenario, Togo’s external debt indicators remain below their relevant
indicative policy relevant thresholds (Table 1a, Figure 1). The present value (PV) of public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt equals to 20.4 percent of GDP in 2013 and remains below the 30 percent threshold
until the end of the projected period. Furthermore, both the PV of external debt relative to revenues and
exports stay relatively stable and below their respective indicative threshold until 2033. The share of
concessional loans in new financing is projected to decline, which results in the concessionality of new
loans to decrease from nearly 50 percent to around 18 percent over the period 2013 to 2033. The rate of
debt accumulation is projected to stabilize around 1.5 percent per annum in the long run.5,6
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
4
On October 11, 2013, the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank approved the reform of the discount
rates presented in SM/12/271, resulting in a unique, unified 5 percent rate to be applied both to DSAs and to the
calculation of the grant element (Board Decision N. 15462-(13–97)).

5

The residual for endogenous debt dynamics presented in Table 1a is largely due to exceptional
financing, price and exchange rate changes, and debt flow relief. For the period 2013-17, the ECF
financing has also been taken into account, as well as other identified donor financing.

6

The accumulation of nominal external debt as a percentage of GDP throughout the projection period is
largely driven by project loans (remaining around 2.5-3 percent of GDP), which can be attributed to
Togo’s long-term investment needs.

4

5.
Togo’s external debt outlook remains vulnerable to shocks especially toward the end of the
projection period (Table 1b, Figure 1). The policy thresholds for four key ratios are breached under the
most extreme stress tests. First, the PV of external debt to GDP’ indicators deteriorate under the terms
shock scenario in which new loans are obtained on less favorable terms. In this case, the threshold is
breached in 2023. Secondly, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio surpasses the indicative threshold in 2033
under the terms shock scenario. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio breaches the 200 percent threshold in
2029 under the same scenario. Lastly, the PV of debt service-to-revenue ratio surpasses the indicative
thresholds in 2026 under the one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation shock.
6.
In light of the results from the baseline and alternative scenarios as well as the stress tests,
staff concludes that Togo still is at moderate risk of debt distress.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
7.
The inclusion of Togo’s domestic public debt in the analysis emphasizes the vulnerability of
the baseline scenario (Table 2a, Figure 2). Togo’s domestic debt burden reflects years of weak fiscal
management and domestic arrears accumulation, as well as the need to recapitalize ailing banks. Much of
the debt burden stemmed from the government’s recognition of liabilities arising from liquidated lossmaking SOEs. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public debt ratios are projected to decrease over
the projection period. On average, the PV of debt to GDP ratio amounts to around 23 percent over 20132033. For debt ratios to remain at a reasonable level over the long-run, both an improvement in the
macroeconomic outlook and a more cautious debt strategy are critical factors.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
8.
The evolution of the debt indicators would be highly sensitive to growth shocks, which
would increase the debt level and debt service over the long run. Total public debt dynamics are
particularly vulnerable to a growth shock (Table 2b, Figure 2). This highlights the importance of a reform
agenda that improves the business environment to support public and foreign investment for growth.

CONCLUSION
9.
The DSA indicates that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress, though is susceptible to
macroeconomic developments and any changes in its debt management strategy and capacity. The
authorities generally agreed with the assessment while considering staff’s long-term growth projections to
be conservative. Under the baseline scenario, the debt ratios remain below the thresholds for the projected
period, but under alternative scenarios thresholds would be breached in the outer years. These dynamics
highlight the vulnerability of the Togolese economy to certain shocks (in particular less favorable terms on
new financing), and stress the need for a prudent approach to new borrowing. This also pronounces the
importance of improving debt management capacity in Togo to have a realistic and overall assessment of

the risks posed by various sectors including fiscal. While heavy public investment is expected to lead to
sustained growth, Togo’s weak public investment management capacity may impose risks on the
underlying public investment-growth nexus. Additionally, public investments based on a public-private
partnership framework would imply a higher risk of potential fiscal liabilities.
10.
Maintaining a robust external debt outlook will depend on a sustained pick-up of real GDP
growth, and foreign direct investment, as well as prudent debt management and solid fiscal
performance. The inclusion of Togo’s domestic debt in the analysis reinforces the conclusions of the
external DSA and stresses the risks to Togo’s debt prospects. In this context, it is essential that the Togolese
authorities ensure efforts to strengthen public finance management and debt management, restructure the
banking system and promote financial development, reform state-owned enterprises, and improve the
investment climate, hence laying the foundation for accelerating growth prospects.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Arrangement
Togo is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and has no
separate legal tender. The exchange system, common to all WAEMU countries, is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union’s common
currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the
official conversions rate of the French franc to the euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc
to the French franc of CFAF 100= F 1. On April 28, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR
was CFAF 769.68 = SDR 1.0. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on
the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a
separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and is not
based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members.

Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The 2013 assessment of the BCEAO is
substanstially complete. The assessment found that the bank continues to have a strong control
environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform of the WAMU,
enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to oversee the
audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with more timely publication of
the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to IFRS implementation by end-2014.
The assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit process and recommended
that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through selection of a second
experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits.

JOINT WORLD BANK-IMF WORK PROGRAM, 2013-14
The IMF Togo team led by Mr. Mlachila (mission chief) held a discussion with the World Bank Togo
team led by Mr. Hoogeveen (mission chief) on June 20th, 2013, to identify macro-critical structural
reforms and coordinate the two teams’ work for the period August 2013-December 2016.
Continuous collaboration is taking place, including coordination of timing of missions and
conducting joint studies.
The teams agreed that Togo’s main macroeconomic challenges are to raise the level of economic
growth and making it more inclusive. In this regard, there would be need to accelerate structural
reforms, particularly resetting fiscal policy to ensure fiscal sustainability, enhance public financial
management, and strengthen financial sector stability and promote financial development, including
through privatization of government-owned banks. Reforms in other key areas such as energy,
telecommunications, business environment and phosphates are needed to reduce bottlenecks and
raise potential growth. At the same time, measures to render growth more inclusive, such as
targeted transfers, should also be considered a priority. Areas of close collaboration between the
Fund and the Bank include the financial sector, debt policy, and poverty analytics and policies.
Details on division of labor in other areas are presented below.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses in the quality and
timeliness of data hamper staff’s analysis. National accounts and balance of payments statistics are
compiled based on very limited information, with only few surveys and scarce data on primary
agriculture and private sector services. Moreover, government finance statistics are derived from a
weak accounting and reporting system, and monetary data are reported by the BCEAO with a twomonth lag.
2.
The country has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 2001. Metadata on the national statistical system, including plans for improvement
posted to the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board, were last updated in December 2004.
National accounts and consumer price index (CPI)
3.
Like other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) member states, Togo
embarked in late 2002 on implementing the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), using
the ERETES software. The national accounts for the new base year (2000) were completed in 2005,
but in 2006 due to a number of difficulties such as lack of staff, material and financial resources, the
program was suspended and the NA for 2001 was not finalized. Only in March 2009 did the
implementation process resume and the Direction Générale de la Statistique et de la Comptabilité
Nationale (DGSCN) started working on the compilation of data for 2007 (the most recent year for
which enough data was available). Since then, several AFRITAC West and AFRISTAT missions have
assisted in the completion of data collection, in the preparation of source data, in ensuring
consistency across primary data sources, and in preparing preliminary accounts. Estimates of
production in the informal sector were also produced. The efforts related to end-2010 population
census exercise, which required the full attention of staff in the DGSCN, have further delayed the
completion of the 2007 National Accounts. Furthermore, a May 2011 AFRITAC West TA report
pointed to serious anomalies in the provisional 2007 national accounts (concerning value added in
the informal sector, low fixed capital formation, high consumption to GDP ratio, among others),
which were corrected during the mission. Final National Accounts numbers for 2006 and 2007 have
been validated by the Comité PIB. Despite the delays the authorities remain committed to achieving
the objective of finalizing the national accounts referring to the years up to 2010 by 2014, reporting
the previous target of June 2012.
4.
The CPI basket was revised in 2010. The WAEMU commission, supported by AFRISTAT and
the BCEAO, launched a revision of the harmonized CPI basket in the region in 2008. The reform
included expanding CPI surveys, and updating the weights of various sub-components to reflect
consumption habits. The DGSCN is constructing a consumer price index with national coverage. The
collection of the first observations is planned for January 2014, and the index will be published after
January 2015 when the first 12 month variation becomes available.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

External sector statistics
5.
Balance of payments statistics and international investment position data are compiled
based on bank reports, a survey of enterprises, and customs data. Statistics are compiled following
the principles of the 5th balance of payment manual, with a six-month delay and are revised twice a
year. Export figures, net of transit trade, are appropriately reported since the latest STA technical
assistance mission in balance of payments statistics in 2008. The Central bank continues its efforts
for a better covering of informal trade notably with the subregional unit for the reconciliation of
intra-WAMU trade.
Government accounts and public debt data
6.
The Government finance statistics accounting system is undergoing improvements. The new
WAEMU budget nomenclature now permits the economic and ministerial classification of
expenditure, with functional classification under development. The monthly TOFE (Table of Central
Government Financial Operations) is based on a mixture of administrative and accounting data and
is sent to AFR with a two-month lag. The debt database weakened since the HIPC completion point
at end 2010. Government recognition of old domestic arrears and their liabilities has further
complicated the compilation of a reliable and consistent database. Only budgetary central
government data are reported for publication in the Government Finances Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY), government finance high frequency data are not reported for publication in the IFS. In the
context of the 2013 Article IV consultation, with assistance from STA, the authorities established a
bridge table allowing transposition of TOFE data, which is based on the 1986 Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFS86), to the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM01), as well as a
table on Government Financial Operations for 2009-16 based on GFSM01 principles (Appendix V).
Monetary statistics
7.
Monthly data for Togo, along with data for other members of the West African Monetary
Union are regularly disseminated by the Central Bank of the West African Monetary Union (BCEAO)
with a lag of about two months. Data on lending and borrowing rates, charged by domestic banks,
are now compiled and available monthly.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 16, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Togo
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on December 6, 2013
concluded the Article IV consultation with Togo.1
Togo has made significant progress in macroeconomic stability, but challenges remain in
accelerating economic reforms and reducing poverty.
Real economic growth accelerated from almost 4½ in 2010-11 to 5¾ in 2012-13, reflecting
dynamism in agriculture, mining, construction and public works, particularly in
transportation infrastructure. Growth has been accompanied by a widening of the current
account deficit, financed mainly through foreign direct investment. Inflation has been low, on
average slightly below 2½ percent during 2012-13.
Under election-related pressures, fiscal policy deteriorated in 2012 and early 2013, with the
approval of expansionary budgets that led to financing shortfalls. In mid-2013 the authorities
took strong corrective measures, including by adopting a revised budget. These measures
have placed Togo on a path of fiscal consolidation, anchored by an improvement in the
primary domestic fiscal balance that could lead to a gradual reduction of debt.
On the fiscal policy front, challenges remain in achieving greater prioritization of public
investment projects, reducing fuel subsidies, and containing the public wage bill, in order to
create the needed fiscal space for higher social and infrastructure spending. More generally,
there is need to formulate annual budgets in the context of medium-term budget policies and
improve public debt management to ensure continued debt sustainability.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Progress in structural reforms has recently accelerated with a re-energized program of public
financial management reform, and the project to establish a revenue authority by merging tax
and customs administrations. The proposed revenue authority could be leveraged to
modernize revenue administration efficiency and increase revenue by bringing appropriate
structures, operations, and management processes to modern international standards.
Poverty declined during 2006-2011. However, growth has not been inclusive as income
distribution worsened. Poverty in rural areas has actually increased, while it declined, across
all income levels, in the capital area where most economic growth is concentrated. Internal
migration contributed to poverty reduction.
Sustainable growth is hampered by major obstacles. Chief among these are infrastructure
bottlenecks, particularly in the electricity and transport sectors, high telecommunication
costs, and a generally weak business environment.
Togo’s financial sector has deepened and its aggregate financial indicators are sound. Two
state-owned banks have been privatized, new banks are expanding operations, and the
microfinance sector has grown rapidly. The authorities’ objective remains to divest from the
banking sector. However, individual banks face difficult situations and the authorities have
taken initial steps to stem asset deterioration. The supervision framework of the microfinance sector needs to be improved, licensing regulations enforced and pyramid-like
schemes closed.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities’ actions to control the fiscal deficit and to set Togo on a
sustainable debt path. They emphasized the importance of improving debt management and
seeking financing on terms consistent with debt sustainability. To free budget space for social
and infrastructure expenditure, Directors encouraged a progressive reduction in
poorly-targeted fuel subsidies and lower growth of public sector wages. They noted that
improvements in the financing and management of projects will be necessary to support a
scaling-up of public investment. Directors also recommended the swift implementation of
long-planned fiscal reforms, including the establishment of a single treasury account and a
new revenue authority, which should enhance revenue administration and mobilization.
Directors took note of the progress made in promoting financial development. Nonetheless,
they underscored the need to intensify financial sector oversight and resolve problem banks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Specifically, they called for stronger supervision of microfinance institutions and further
restructuring of public banks.
Directors agreed that structural reforms remain critical to improve competitiveness and
reduce poverty. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to address bottlenecks in the
energy sector, reform public enterprises, and make further efforts to improve the business
environment. More effective poverty reduction policies and renewed attention to agricultural
productivity and employment should also remain top policy priorities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to remain in close engagement with the Fund,
including through a possible Fund-supported program and continued technical assistance in
key reform areas.

Statement by Mr. Assimaidou on Togo
Executive Board Meeting
December 6, 2013
On behalf of my Togolese authorities, I would like to thank the Board, Management and staff
for the constant support to their policy efforts, both under or off Fund-supported programs,
throughout the years. This support is most valuable in the current challenging external
environment. They are especially appreciative of the candid discussions and the policy
advice provided by staff during the Article IV consultation discussions.
Following a decade and a half of socio-political crisis and economic stagnation, Togo was
able to improve its macroeconomic performance under Fund-supported program and on the
path towards the HIPC completion point. The implementation of the ECF-supported program
has been generally satisfactory, with the completion of all six reviews. Real GDP growth in
2012 and 2013 averaged more than 5 percent with inflation at about 2 percent. Moreover,
under the ECF-supported program, the authorities realized strong budget execution, with
revenue collection often exceeding targets thanks to actions in broadening the tax base and
administrative reforms, and current expenditures kept within program ceilings.
The authorities have, among other reforms, improved public financial management,
established a treasury cash management committee which needs to be revamped, initiated
steps towards a single treasury account, and completed a financial and organizational audit
and an actuarial study of the civil service’s pension fund. The authorities also started the
establishment of a one-stop window at the Port Autonome de Lomé (PAL), supported the
financial restructuring of problem banks and privatized two of them. More broadly, the
program’s general objectives of macroeconomic stability and growth were achieved despite
significant exogenous shocks (global economic crisis, floods, political and social unrests,
etc.). The growth performance has translated into per capita income rising—albeit
modestly—finally reversing a downward trend during the country’s long crisis of the 1990s
and early 2000s.
The Remaining Medium-term Agenda
The Togolese authorities are well cognizant that much more needs to be done in several
structural areas. The record on this front up to now has been mixed due to technical capacity
constraints and lengthy consultative and legal processes. In the financial sector, although
progress was made as regards financial deepening, the privatization process has fallen short
of plans. In the energy sector, considerable liabilities weigh on the government budget while
actual and potential supply shortages impede potential growth. On infrastructure, there are
still gaps to be bridged to boost potential growth, and more efforts are required in the broader
area of business environment.

2
My authorities are committed to tackle these structural problems over the medium term and
intend to remain closely engaged with the Fund and other partners to this end. As Togo
remains a fragile state, continued policy advice, technical assistance and financial support
will be key to the Togolese authorities’ efforts to succeed in these endeavors while pursuing
revenue-enhancing measures to ensure fiscal sustainability and tackling poverty. The secondgeneration PRSP embodied in the authorities’ Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de
Promotion de l’Emploi (SCAPE), which builds on the first poverty reduction strategy, aims
at making growth stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive. My authorities are in the
process of implementing an adjustment program that meets these objectives while also
ensuring macroeconomic stability.
Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability and Preserving Debt Sustainability
The authorities have expressed their firm commitment to pursue the fiscal reforms and ensure
that fiscal policy remains on a sustainable path. Going forward, the objectives are to increase
significantly revenue mobilization and contain current expenditure so as to finance muchneeded infrastructure and social needs. Fiscal policy targets a return to positive primary
domestic fiscal balance and a reduction of the overall fiscal deficit by 2014. The intended
medium-term (2013-2016) fiscal adjustment will be frontloaded. Already, the revised 2013
budget is better aligned with execution capacity, leans on more realistic revenue projections,
and provides more sensible allocations for fuel subsidies.
Efforts on the revenue side will build on ongoing reforms to rationalize import and other
exemptions through tighter monitoring of those entitlements. The authorities will push
forward programmed reforms in tax and customs administrations with the view to raise
revenue further.
On the expenditure front, the authorities reiterated their intention to resist wage increase
pressures from unions that would bring the budget envelopes beyond the current mediumterm spending framework. On fuel subsidies, the authorities see merit in eliminating these
generalized assistance measures, with the exception of kerosene which is mostly used by the
poor. However, they continue to believe that the removal of those subsidies should be done
in a gradual manner to maintain social stability, as previous attempts to remove the subsidies
have been met by strong social resistance with damages to property. My authorities will
continue the efforts in trimming subsidies which are set to be reduced by an amount
equivalent to 1 percent of GDP as early as 2014 after having secured an agreement with labor
union partners on pay and tax packages notably for transporters.
Public financial management reforms will focus on pursuing efforts towards establishing a
single treasury account, further improving cash and treasury projections and management,
and simplifying the expenditure circuit. My authorities also agree on the need to better

3
prioritize, execute and monitor investment projects which they intend to do with technical
assistance from partners.
Capacity constraints are also acute in the area of debt management. Therefore, measures to
strengthen the technical and operational capacity of the debt management unit (Direction de
la Dette Publique) within the Ministry of Economy and Finance are being envisaged. The
authorities have requested additional technical assistance in this area. Debt sustainability also
requires the contracting of highly concessional financing packages. While noting that
concessional financing is not available in amounts required to meet development needs, my
authorities will do their utmost to seek financing on terms consistent with debt sustainability
as guided by the DSA.
Enhancing the Financial Sector
The authorities appreciate the analysis of staff on the financial sector vulnerabilities, and
agree with the recommendations to address them as well as improve the regulatory and
supervisory frameworks. They remain committed to tackling the management difficulties
faced by some banking and microfinance institutions, along the lines suggested by staff, with
the view to preserve financial stability. My authorities intend to step up the capacity of the
specialized unit within the Ministry of Economy and Finance (CAS-IMEC) to monitor underregulated institutions and close illegal entities in the microfinance sector. They continue to
work closely with the regional Banking Commission within the Western African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to require banks to comply with prudential standards. At the
same time, it is to be noted that only decisions at the WAEMU level can change and simplify
the banking regulatory framework.
There is full agreement between the authorities and staff on the medium-term policies for the
financial sector, which is to support growth through greater financial intermediation. This
requires ensuring that banks, microfinance institutions as well as pension funds become and
remain financially sound.
Toward Stronger and More Inclusive Growth
The authorities have made stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth a priority objective in
their SCAPE (2013-2017) which benefited from a large consultative process, including the
2012 National Economic Forum which involved all domestic stakeholders and developments
partners. The strategy is articulated around five pillars: developing sectors with high growth
potential; economic infrastructure; human capital and employment; governance; and
participatory, inclusive and durable development.
Making growth stronger and sustainable requires addressing the weaknesses of the energy
and other infrastructure sectors. The authorities are aware that financial difficulties faced by

4
national power companies and the rapid increase of demand for electricity could lead to
power shortages, especially as external sources of electricity may face supply constraints,
thereby undermining growth prospects. To address this challenge, the Togolese authorities
intend to implement measures to clear the accumulated arrears to the electricity companies
and to avoid their re-emergence through a diagnostic and action plan. Closing the
infrastructure gaps in this sector as well as in the transportation sector (roads, airport, and
port) is also essential to boosting potential growth.
Strengthening competitiveness and the business environment through governance reforms is
also a cornerstone of the authorities’ medium term growth agenda. The authorities welcome
the findings that Togo’s external sector risks are generally manageable and that the real
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with economic fundamentals. However, they view
seriously the deficiencies in non-price competitiveness and the business climate. They will
strive to improve the business environment and the quality of governance, notably through
contract enforcement, protection of investors’ rights, and access to finance.
The authorities put emphasis on ensuring that economic growth benefits the larger
population. Specific measures to reduce poverty and make growth more inclusive, especially
in rural areas, include constructing small dams and increasing access to water to enhance
productivity; expanding feeder roads to increase market access; and addressing youth
unemployment through targeted support to young entrepreneur projects. They take good note
of the recommendation for—and will reflect on—urban planning as a way to increase
poverty reduction gains brought about by internal migration to the cities.
Conclusion
Important and concrete progress has been achieved in the past five years in the area of
macroeconomic sustainability and also in terms of reversing the decline in per capita GDP.
Real GDP has been growing at a high rate and many critical reforms have been initiated
under the previous ECF-supported program.
Going forward, my Togolese authorities remain committed to pursue the reforms started and
address the bottlenecks that still constrain the development of the economy. My authorities
place a very high importance on measures that will create private sector-led employment and
reduce poverty while ensuring fiscal sustainability. However, Togo remains a fragile state
with significant capacity constraints. Thus, my authorities look forward to the continued
support from the international community, including the Fund, to assist them in their efforts
to implement the needed wide-ranging reforms.
