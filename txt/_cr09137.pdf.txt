EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Three years of broad-based economic recovery brought GDP growth to near 6 percent
in 2005/06, its highest in two decades. There was broad consensus on policies for the
medium term including the importance of continued macroeconomic stability, faster
structural and governance reforms, and major infrastructure improvements, especially to the
road and electricity networks. However, the authorities consider their policy framework
supportive of growth above 6 percent in the medium term.
Fiscal policy should continue to aim at a gradual reduction in domestic public debt over
the medium term while further reorienting spending towards poverty reduction and
development. A gradual increase in aid flows over the medium term would allow higher
spending on these priorities. However, public financial management needs further
strengthening to ensure efficient resource use.
Monetary policy should be tightened to stem emerging inflationary pressures. The
Central Bank of Kenya should strictly target reserve money growth and let repo rates move
more freely. Foreign exchange market intervention should not undermine monetary
objectives.
Financial sector reforms should be accelerated. Priority actions include amending the
Banking Act to align Kenya’s regulatory and legal framework with international practices,
enacting anti-money laundering legislation, privatizing troubled financial institutions, and
developing a financial sector reform strategy.
The recent real appreciation of the Kenyan shilling has so far not undermined export
competitiveness. However, maintaining competitiveness will require better infrastructure
and further structural reforms, including streamlining business licenses, reforming public
enterprises, and liberalizing trade.
Governance reform hinges on rigorous implementation of priority measures. The
Governance Action Plan for 2006/07 sets the right priorities and progress has been made in
implementation. However, decisive actions are still needed to strengthen institutions and
increase transparency and accountability. Slow progress in investigating and prosecuting
prominent corruption cases remains a serious concern.
Despite the need for further progress in governance reforms, the staff recommends
completion of the long delayed second review under the PRGF arrangement, and
supports the authorities’ request for extension of the arrangement, with reduced access,
to November 20, 2007. Kenya’s performance under the PRGF-supported program has been
mixed, but the authorities have maintained largely prudent macroeconomic policies and are
strengthening structural reform.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic growth has accelerated since 2003, reaching 5.9 percent in 2005/06, its
highest rate in two decades. Prudent macroeconomic policies and a favorable external
environment helped lift the economy after more than a decade of slow growth and declines in
per capita income. Article IV discussions (Section II of this report) therefore focused on the
key challenge of sustaining and accelerating growth while maintaining macroeconomic
stability, consistent with the Executive Board advice at the conclusion of the last consultation
(Box 1).
2.
Staff recommends completion of the second review under the PRGF
arrangement. As explained in Section III of this report, the authorities’ program1 aims to
safeguard macroeconomic stability in this election year2 and the momentum of reforms to
maintain growth. Governance measures in the PRGF-supported program draw from the
authorities’ Governance Action Plan for Building a Prosperous Kenya, 2006–07 (GAP),
which was developed in close consultation with stakeholders, including World Bank and
Fund staffs. Implementation of this plan will strengthen governance and safeguard against
the abuse of public resources. However, progress remains slow in investigating and
prosecuting prominent corruption cases.

Box 1. Key 2004 Article IV Policy Recommendations and Implementation
At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended the authorities
for Kenya’s economic rebound, but noted that growth remained too slow to make inroads into poverty.
Directors stressed the importance of broad structural reforms to promote growth and reduce poverty, and
urged the authorities to act decisively to improve governance. They also encouraged the authorities to
strengthen public expenditure management, accelerate public enterprise reform, and improve
competitiveness. Executive Directors urged the authorities to maintain firm control of monetary
aggregates, to address the problem of distressed banks, and to advance bank privatization.
These recommendations have been largely reflected in the authorities’ policy agenda, although
implementation has been uneven. Macroeconomic policies have been generally prudent, resulting in
declining debt ratios, moderating nonfood inflation, and falling interest rates. While public enterprise
reform has advanced, there has been little progress in restructuring and privatizing state-owned banks.
Progress has also been made in improving public financial management (PFM), but much remains to be
done, as with implementing wider governance reforms.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUSTAINING GROWTH AND REDUCING POVERTY
3.
Faster sustained growth is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). Halving poverty by 2015 will require an annual average growth rate of at least
7 percent. Despite important gains in universal primary education and combating HIV/AIDS,
malaria, and other diseases, more rapid progress is needed to achieve other MDGs
(Table 10), especially in primary health care, which has deteriorated since the early 1990s.
The Kenya Vision 2030, launched by the authorities in October 2006, also highlights the need
to raise living standards and targets average annual growth of 10 percent.
4.
Discussions focused on policies to sustain and accelerate recent growth. Key
issues included: the importance of good governance and improved infrastructure for growth;
the appropriate stance of fiscal policy given infrastructure needs and financing constraints;
the conduct of monetary policy given the recent inflationary pressure; the challenge of
maintaining competitiveness in the face of recent capital inflows and a strengthening shilling;
and the need to accelerate financial sector reform. The discussions were facilitated by three
joint SIPs for the three original members of the East African Community (EAC)—Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda. The papers focused on: (i) promoting private sector credit; (ii) further
liberalizing trade; and (iii) harmonizing investment incentives.
A. Growth, Investment, and the Medium-Term Framework
5.
Kenya’s recent growth has
exceeded the average rate in nonoilproducing Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as
well as the initial projections in the
PRGF-supported program. This broadbased growth has been supported by a
generally favorable external environment.
Rising world prices for tea and coffee and
continued strong demand for horticultural
exports have stimulated agricultural
growth; manufacturing has benefited from
strong regional demand and the formation
of the EAC Customs Union; and robust
growth in services has been driven by
strong tourism demand. Increased
remittances and private capital inflows have
contributed to an improvement in the
overall external balance, despite strong
import growth. Although there are signs of

an improved investment climate, private investment has yet to rebound strongly and,
particularly in manufacturing, growth appears to have been largely a result of greater
capacity utilization.
6.
The staff and the authorities agreed that poor infrastructure, if not improved,
will become an increasing impediment to growth. According to the World Bank’s
Investment Climate Surveys, 48 percent
of Kenyan firms cite infrastructure as a
major constraint on business activities.
Kenya’s road network, which handles
80–90 percent of the country’s transport
load, is in poor condition after decades
of underinvestment. Losses from power
failures are estimated at 6–10 percent of
firms’ sales; work is underway to
improve the distribution system and
expand generation capacity, which is
approaching full utilization.

Despite a recent rebound, private sector investment remains too low to sustain
growth. One key to increasing private investment is to reduce the cost of doing business.

is not far below that of China,

Policy discussions took place
around a medium-term macroeconomic
framework with growth averaging
6 percent. This framework would be
underpinned by continued macroeconomic
stability, with inflation declining to
5 percent; accelerated structural reforms;
and significant investment in
infrastructure. As discussed below,
domestic resources could cover only part
of the required increase in public investment, and the framework envisages a gradual increase
in external aid. Failure to secure this assistance would pose a risk to the scenario either by
slowing progress in addressing infrastructure bottlenecks or prompting recourse to excessive
domestic borrowing with potentially adverse consequences for interest rates and debt
sustainability. In the staff’s view, if combined with a loss of the momentum of reform, this
could gradually return growth to the low rates observed for much of the past two decades.

9.
The authorities took a more optimistic view of growth prospects, but in the
interest of fiscal prudence, they have based their medium-term budget planning on
growth of 6 percent. They viewed the economy’s recent performance as indicating that
Kenya has moved to a higher growth path and considered their current reform agenda
supportive of a gradual acceleration in growth from 6 percent to10 percent over the medium
term, in line with the Kenya 2030 vision. While agreeing with the staff that further reforms
and investment were needed to support growth, they felt that these could yield greater
productivity gains than allowed for in the 6 percent growth scenario.

B. Tackling Governance Weaknesses
10.
The authorities and the staff agreed that weak governance has been a key factor
in Kenya’s disappointing economic performance of the past two decades. Weak
governance has been reflected in widespread corruption and inefficient use of public
resources, which undermined competitiveness and investor confidence. A recent assessment
under the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)’s African Peer Review
Mechanism also noted a general public perception that corruption is endemic in Kenya.3
11.
While recognizing major challenges ahead in the fight against corruption, the
authorities stressed that extensive governance reforms have been undertaken since the
government came to power in 2003. These reforms aimed to strengthen the three pillars of
their governance strategy: (i) corruption prevention and education; ; (ii) investigation; and
(iii) restitution. Key steps under the first pillar have included passage of Public Officers
Ethics Act, the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, the Government Financial
Management Act, the Public Audit Office Act, and the Public Procurement and Disposal Act.
A Ministerial Code of Conduct requires the submission of wealth declarations, which are
verified by the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC). The government has abolished
harambees (coerced fund-raising) and ended land grabbing, which were significant sources
of state corruption. The authorities have also advanced public sector and financial
management reforms, including parastatal reforms in preventing abuse of public resources,
and specific anti-corruption measures in sectoral ministries, such as in education and water.
12.
The authorities noted that the establishment of the KACC in 2004 and the
restructuring of the Department of Public Prosecutions have enhanced the capacity to
investigate corruption. In the area of restitution, a far-reaching purge of the judiciary has
removed judges and magistrates implicated in the report of the Integrity and Anti-Corruption
Committee of the Judiciary. The KACC is pursuing asset recoveries. The government has
published the report of the Public Accounts Committee on Anglo-Leasing contracts,4 as well
as the findings of the Goldenberg and Ndungu Commissions, and has initiated action based
on the recommendations in these reports.5 The GAP, which was recently approved by
Cabinet, seeks to address immediate governance priorities through the end of 2007.

Further details of these reforms are provided in the Governance Action Plan for Building a Prosperous Kenya,
2006–07 and the attached MEFP, especially paragraphs 7, 8, 12, and 13.

10

13.
The staff acknowledged these wide-ranging reforms and welcomed the GAP, but
noted that serious weaknesses remain. The governance assessment report that was
prepared by World Bank staff with Fund staff participation in 2006 included empirical
evidence suggesting that a decline in corruption during 2003–04 has subsequently halted, and
that there may even have been a deterioration in operations of the judiciary and in
procurement, although not to the pre-2003 levels. The staff considered that implementation
of the GAP, which also draws on the findings and recommendations of the report, would be
an important step. Significant reforms have been, and are being, taken to strengthen
transparency and institutions and thereby prevent corruption. In this regard, the staff
welcomed, for example, the decision to post details of procurement contracts on the
government website. However, progress in strengthening prosecution and restitution has not
lived up to expectations, undermining public confidence in the authorities’ determination to
root out corruption. In particular, staff expressed serious concern over the slow progress in
prosecuting prominent cases of corruption, in which senior officials had been implicated.
14.
The authorities stressed that it would take time to investigate and try prominent
corruption cases. They argued that slow progress in concluding cases is also linked to an
under-staffed and under-equipped judiciary, a paucity of courtrooms, an insufficient number
of prosecutors, and the application of constitutional stays by defendants. Many of these
weaknesses are being addressed in the context of the GAP.
C. Fiscal Policy for Stability and Growth
15.
The authorities and staff
agreed that fiscal policy should
maintain its broadly expansionary
stance since 2005/06, to allow
increased spending on
infrastructure and poverty
reduction. In 2005/06 droughtrelated spending (0.8 percent of
GDP) and revenue shortfalls due to
problems with the introduction of
new customs software (Simba) led
to a widening of the overall deficit.
However, net domestic borrowing
was contained by cutting non-priority outlays; this also helped increase development
spending and keep non-wage priority spending above 4.5 percent of GDP for a third year in a
row, despite falling external budget support. With Simba problems now resolved and revenue
performance set to improve, development spending is projected to increase further over the

medium term while domestic borrowing declines gradually, in line with the authorities’
medium-term fiscal framework.
16.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework aims at a further gradual
reduction in the domestic debt-to-GDP ratio, which has declined significantly in recent
years thanks to higher growth, stronger fiscal discipline, and lower interest rates. The
staff supported this objective. While Kenya’s debt position leaves some limited room for
additional domestic borrowing, especially if used to finance high-yield public investment, it
would be more prudent to use largely untapped external concessional resources and enhanced
revenue collection, instead of more costly domestic debt, to create fiscal space for priority
spending. The mission stressed that Kenya’s domestic debt remains higher than in the other
EAC countries and the debt stock does not take into account potentially significant but not
well-quantified contingent liabilities, including future pension obligations.6 Moreover, there
are risks to the current favorable debt dynamics from slower growth and higher interest rate.

External debt sustainability does not appear to be an immediate concern
provided Kenya maintains a prudent approach to borrowing. Although Kenya has not
benefited from HIPC/MDRI, a joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
found the risk of external debt distress in Kenya to be low (Appendix I). While the current
account deficit is expected to widen further as Kenya undertakes infrastructure investments,

of contingent liabilities in 24 parastatals (MEFP, Table 3).

12

international reserves are projected to remain at about 3½ months of imports in the medium
term. Stress tests suggest that shocks, particularly below-forecast export growth, would
significantly increase debt ratios. Safeguarding debt sustainability and reducing vulnerability
to external shocks argues for reliance on grants and concessional borrowing. The authorities
agreed that concessional resources would be the best means to finance public investment.
However, building on the S&P sovereign credit rating Kenya received in 2006 (B+), they are
considering the possibility of a sovereign bond issue to establish a benchmark and help
provide market discipline. The proceeds of such an issue would not be used to finance
additional expenditures, and the authorities recognized that, apart from possible savings that
may arise from retiring more costly external debt, the planned retention of bond proceeds in
the CBK could entail a net interest cost. The mission discussed how the DSA and a debt
management strategy could be used to help maintain debt sustainability, and stressed the
importance of appropriately reflecting contingent liabilities from public enterprises in fiscal
accounts.
18.
Kenya’s revenue-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with other SSA countries,
but as the government continues to increase infrastructure and pro-poor spending
sustained efforts will be needed to enhance revenue performance. The authorities
indicated that customs reform is
advancing as the new computerized
system, Simba, becomes fully
operational. The number of large
taxpayers has increased substantially,
and electronic tax registers have been
introduced for medium-size
taxpayers. A presumptive tax regime
has been developed for small-size
taxpayers, although its
implementation has been postponed.
Steps have been taken to improve
governance at the Kenya Revenue
Authority and customs (MEFP, ¶15). The mission encouraged the authorities to scale back
VAT withholding because it contravenes the principle of taxing value-added and puts undue
pressure on the VAT refund system. However, the authorities argued that this temporary
system would improve compliance, although it affects all taxpayers. The mission also
advised against further tax exemptions and extension of VAT zero rating, as introduced in
the 2006/07 budget. However, the authorities contended that the VAT zero rating and
exemption measures were well targeted on poverty and growth and resulting revenue losses
were offset by additional measures.

The authorities recognized the importance of further reforms to improve the
efficiency of government spending. In this connection, they have requested participation in
a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency. There was
agreement that further reform should focus on:
•

Further strengthening public financial management. Despite considerable
progress in recent years (MEFP, ¶17), improvements are needed in budget
preparation, accounting and reporting. Priority should also be given to making the
Public Procurement Oversight Authority fully operational and implementing the
integrated financial management information system (IFMIS), especially given a
planned move to program-based budgeting over the medium term.

•

Implementing the new pay policy and pension reforms. This would require
consolidating allowances, shifting staffing toward poverty areas, eliminating various
pay review bodies, fully implementing the voluntary retirement scheme, and
addressing large contingent liabilities in the public pension system (MEFP, ¶16). The
contributory pension scheme for civil servants should become fully operational.

14
•

Improving governance in managing the Constituency Development Fund (CDF).
CDF expenditures should be more transparent and accountable, and cases of misuse
should be dealt with swiftly.7 CDF-funded infrastructure spending should be
coordinated with budget provisions for current spending.

21.
The mission stressed the importance of using resources efficiently in
infrastructure projects as public investment is scaled up. Overcoming capacity
constraints and improving governance will be important, particularly in the Ministry of
Roads and Public Works, which has not fully used budget allocations. The authorities noted
that complex disbursement and procurement procedures for some external funds had
contributed to delays in execution. The authorities concurred with staff that a legal and
institutional framework for public-private partnership (PPP) is needed to ensure proper
costing and prioritization and to minimize fiscal risks.
D. Financial Sector Policy to Support Stability and Growth
22.
The staff supported the
authorities’ monetary policy
framework which uses reserve
money as an intermediate target for
securing low inflation. While control
of monetary aggregates has improved
since 2004, reserve money growth has
exceeded CBK targets since 2006,
partly because interest rates on repos
have not been sufficiently flexible to
mop up substantial liquidity injected
by the CBK's foreign exchange
operations in 2006. There have been
substantial spikes in overall inflation
since late 2005, and nonfood inflation
has also edged up recently, to above
6 percent in early 2007.

The authorities attributed
the inflation spikes largely to the drought in 2005 and the full pass-through of higher
world oil prices. Staff reiterated the need to examine the current monetary stance, as the

persistently high food inflation may also have a monetary component. The authorities and
staff agreed that it is prudent to tighten monetary conditions somewhat in 2007 to reduce
inflationary pressure. The mission welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to reiterate to the
market the centrality of its reserve money target and, in this connection, urged the authorities
to allow interest rates, including repo rates, to move more freely to achieve reserve money
targets, and to address the remaining weaknesses in the monetary operations framework.8
24.
Kenya’s financial system has
been stable, but significant risks
remain. Aggregate financial soundness
indicators point to a well capitalized,
profitable and liquid banking sector.
Compliance with prudential regulations
has improved markedly since the
introduction of financial penalties for
violations, except for the NBK, which is
under the CBK supervisory
management. However, nonperforming
loans (NPLs) remain high, and a
number of banks are still weak. In
addition, recent legal challenges to the CBK’s supervisory power by Charterhouse Bank have
highlighted the risks to effective supervision posed by problems in the judicial system. The
bank, which was allegedly involved in money laundering and tax evasion, was placed under
statutory management of the CBK in June 2006 and its license was withdrawn in December
(MEFP, ¶22).

Continued efforts are needed to strengthen
the financial system. Staff urged the authorities to
amend the Banking Act to align the legal and regulatory
framework with international practices, to expedite the
passage of anti-money laundering (AML) legislation, to
divest shareholding in state-influenced financial
institutions, including the National Bank of Kenya
(NBK), and to develop a comprehensive financial sector
reform strategy. A key objective of this strategy should
be to improve private sector access to credit by reducing
interest rate spreads. This would require improving the
legal system for property and creditor rights, increasing

provision of credit information on borrowers, and supporting competition in the banking
sector. The mission welcomed improvements in the regulatory regime for microfinance, but
advised against regulating interest rates and bank charges and recommended elimination of
Section 44 of the Banking Act, which provides for controls on bank charges.
E. Ensuring Competitiveness
Exchange rate policy
26.
Kenya has for some time
maintained a de facto managed
float regime for the shilling,
which has appreciated in both
nominal and real effective
terms over the past two years.
Increased tourism receipts,
remittances, and capital inflows
have financed a widening trade
deficit and exerted upward
pressure on the shilling. The
authorities noted that they had at
times intervened in the foreign
exchange market to alleviate appreciation pressures. Foreign exchange purchases by the CBK
had not been fully sterilized, leading to a significant increase in the growth of reserve money
in 2006. The mission advised that intervention be limited to prudent accumulation of reserves
and smoothing short-term fluctuations not related to economic fundamentals.

27.
Staff analysis suggests that the shilling’s appreciation has been broadly in line
with economic fundamentals (Box 2). A trade analysis shows that Kenya gained
competitiveness in merchandise exports over the period 2002–05. This assessment is
consistent with the private sector’s view that although the appreciation may have had some
negative impact on such exports as cut flowers, weak infrastructure, particularly poor roads,
remains the most important constraint on competitiveness. In this regard, the authorities and
the staff agreed that a fiscal tightening would not help competitiveness because it would be
likely at the expense of infrastructure projects, which are important for improving export
performance and also often have a large import component.
28.
Looking forward, the authorities were confident that exports would remain
competitive despite a strong shilling. They believed that ongoing structural reforms would
raise productivity and regional export demand would continue to increase as a result of the

17
formation and the recent enlargement of the EAC customs union.9 The mission cautioned that
prospects for exports needed to take into account the small size of the EAC market and
Kenya’s concentration in commodities, which are subject to secular price declines and price
volatility.

An econometric model was used to study Kenya’s
equilibrium real exchange rate. Using quarterly
data from 1980Q1 to 2006Q3, the results suggest
that movements of Kenya's actual REER have been
broadly in line with the estimated equilibrium
values during the past two years. The shilling’s
strengthening has been largely driven by economic
fundamentals, including higher productivity, rising
exports, and increasing net foreign assets of the
banking system.

Public enterprise reform
29.
The authorities have made
considerable progress in parastatal
reform. Recent advances include the
concessioning of Kenya Railways,
partial privatization of KenGen and
Mumias Sugar Company, and the
introduction of a management contract
for Kenya Power and Lighting
Company and performance contracts
for all public commercial enterprises.
The financial performance of
commercial public enterprises seems
to have improved and their tax
payments have increased more rapidly than those of private enterprises over the past three
years. The authorities envisaged further divestiture in the insurance, energy, and
telecommunications sectors. The mission commended the authorities on these advances, and
encouraged expeditious completion of the study of contingent liabilities of 25 parastatals and
concessioning of the Mombasa container terminal. The mission also encouraged the
authorities to speed up the establishment of the Privatization Commission, and take stock of
the numerous autonomous and semiautonomous government agencies and eliminate those
without clear public and social objectives (MEFP, ¶17).

Trade, investment and regional integration
30.
The mission encouraged the authorities to work with EAC partners to reduce
the Common External Tariff (CET). This should be part of Kenya’s strategy to build a
globally competitive export sector. Staff’s SIP shows that even in the short run, lowering the
top tariffs and bringing “sensitive” products into the CET would benefit all three original
EAC members, especially the urban poor. The authorities agreed that the CET should be
lowered but considered it premature, noting the scheduled review of the CET in 2010. The
mission encouraged the authorities to remove nontariff barriers, such as trade licenses, road
blocks, and checkpoints. The mission also advocated rationalization of regional trade
arrangements (RTAs), which give rise to potentially conflicting commitments and hinder
tariff reduction.10

The mission advocated coordination of investment incentives in the EAC,
possibly through a code of conduct. Drawing on a SIP, it argued that such a code would
help avoid a “race to the bottom” in investment incentives, which would entail revenue losses
to all countries. While recognizing the potential benefits of such a code, the authorities
indicated that there is currently insufficient support in the EAC.
Regulatory regime
32.
The mission supported the authorities’ efforts to reform Kenya’s regulatory
regime to reduce costs of doing business. A number of business licenses have recently been
removed and further streamlining is underway (Box 3). Staff encouraged the authorities to
press for bolder labor market reforms, including greater flexibility of employment, less
frequent adjustments of minimum wages, and a closer link between wage awards and
productivity. The authorities stressed the importance of wage regulation to protect the poor in
the absence of a social safety net.

Box 3. Business Licenses
Kenya ranks in the middle of the World Bank’s
global ease of doing business indicators and sixth
within SSA. Although Kenya ranks among the
best in SSA in “dealing with business licenses,”
the horticultural and tourism sectors provide
examples of excessive requirements. Even after
the removal of nine business licenses in 2006, a
cut flowers business is still required to obtain 60
licenses to operate. A tour operator requires
11 licenses, seven of which are to be displayed
on the vehicle windscreen. Some cut flowers
businesses hire full-time staff to meet their
licensing requirements, adding significantly to
costs.

Kenya has a total of about 1,400 business licenses, many of which were introduced by local governments
to raise revenue. The authorities have eliminated 118 licenses over the past two years. Based on the
recommendations of the Business Regulatory Reform Unit, the 2007/08 Finance Bill will propose
elimination of licenses judged not to serve a useful purpose. The World Bank has taken the lead in
helping the authorities with these efforts.

III. THE PRGF ARRANGEMENT: SUPPORTING GROWTH
33.
Kenya’s three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on November 21, 2003 in
the amount of SDR 175 million (64 percent of quota). At the conclusion of the first review
access was augmented by SDR 50 million to mitigate the effects of world oil price increases
and a drought on the balance of payments. The arrangement has been extended twice to
April 30, 2007.

20
A. Performance under the Arrangement
34.
There have been long delays in completing the second review under the
arrangement. These delays were largely due to governance concerns, including issues
arising from allegations surrounding security-related procurement (Anglo Leasing) contracts.
35.
As indicated in the attached MEFP (Tables 1 and 2), five of the 13 performance
criteria for the second review (2004/05) were not met. The end-March 2005 quantitative
performance criterion (PC) and end-June benchmark on reserve money were missed, as was
the continuous PC on nonaccumulation of external payment arrears. The structural PC on
non-imposition of controls on banks’ fees and charges was not met, but remedial
arrangements have been developed for prompt approval of proposed increases in fees and
charges. The PC on issuance of new guidelines for wage arbitration by the Industrial Court
and the PC on completion of the asset declaration of ministers, permanent secretaries, and
heads of state bodies were not observed.11 The two structural PCs set for the third review
were also not met. As noted above, steps were taken to meet the original objectives of the
continuous PC on non-imposition of controls on banks’ fees and charges. Verification of
asset declarations of ministers and senior officials, the second structural PC, is continuing.
B. Program for 2007
Macroeconomic policies
36.
The key objective of the 2006/07 program is to safeguard macroeconomic
stability and strengthen the foundations for sustained growth. Understandings were
reached on the macroeconomic framework, which targets GDP growth of 6.1 percent in
2006/07 and inflation under 7 percent by end-June.
37.
The overall deficit is expected to widen, but net domestic borrowing would be
contained at 1.7 percent of GDP. Despite higher projected revenues, increased development
spending is expected to result in an overall deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP, to be financed by
proceeds (1.0 percent of GDP) from divestment in the sugar, insurance and electricity sectors
(¶ 29, and MEFP, ¶26) and foreign financing (0.5 percent of GDP), in addition to domestic
borrowing. Domestic debt is expected to increase to 18.5 percent of GDP due to the one-off
costs associated with the restructuring of NBK.
38.
Revenue is expected to rebound to 21.2 percent of GDP, up by 1.3 percentage
points from last year, bringing it in line with the recent trends. In the first half of 2006/07
monthly VAT and import duty collections rose by an average of 33 and 42 percent

11

The new wage guidelines, which were intended to link wage awards more closely to productivity changes,
were eventually issued in November 2005, but they have not been strictly followed. Notably, the minimum
wage increase on May 1, 2006 violated the guidelines.

21
respectively following full implementation of the Simba. However, there were shortfalls in
collections of excise and income taxes and the resulting small shortfall in overall revenue
was offset by slower spending (including on wages), keeping the overall deficit on target.
39.
The main risks to the fiscal outlook are spending overruns from election-related
pressures and a shortfall in financing. Spending pressures, particularly for wage increases,
are building in advance of the general elections. While the program conservatively assumes
no new budget support there may be delays in privatization and the third phase of Paris Club
rescheduling may not cover all amounts expected.12 However, the program does not include
possible receipts from sales of telecom licenses.
40.
The program targets reserve money growth of 14 percent at end-June and
12 percent at end-September to achieve the inflation objective. This will require slower
growth in net foreign assets of the CBK and absorption of any remaining excess liquidity.
Capital inflows are expected to be lower than in 2005/06, but, in the event of higher inflows,
the CBK will let the shilling appreciate and give priority to achieving the inflation target. The
monetary program accommodates adequate credit to the private sector while meeting the
government’s borrowing requirements.
Governance
41.
A key objective of the 2006/07 program is to improve governance by focusing on
a forward-looking agenda to strengthen institutions and enhance transparency and
accountability. The centerpiece of this agenda is the implementation of the GAP, focusing
on measures that can be undertaken without legislative action, yet with significant payoffs in
the short run. The authorities have begun to implement key elements of the GAP, in some
cases earlier than envisaged:
•

All procurement contracts signed during the second and third quarters of 2005/06
have been web posted and the authorities are committed to posting all subsequent
contracts (MEFP ¶13). The Public Procurement and Disposal Act and the public
procurement regulations came into effect on January 1, 2007.

•

The four main modules of the IFMIS are being used in the ministries of Education,
Planning, and Finance.

•

Parliament has approved amendments to the Banking Act, strengthening the
independence of the CBK in bank licensing and supervision.

•

Parliament has passed the Witness Protection Bill.

12

Some debt service already paid may not be refunded.

22
•

The government has published its Freedom of Information Policy Framework.

•

The Attorney General’s Office has hired 14 new state counsels for the AntiCorruption Unit of the Director of Public Prosecution, and the Judiciary has hired
16 new magistrates.

•

The Chief Justice has issued an administrative circular to prevent filing of multiple
suits on the same issue in different courts. The authorities have sought World Bank
support to strengthen the judicial system.

42.
Despite these advances, it remains important to prosecute prominent corruption
cases and complete the legislative agenda for the GAP. The authorities are conducting
audits of the Anglo Leasing contracts, which may provide additional evidence for subsequent
prosecution. The government intends to resubmit to Parliament the Miscellaneous
Amendments Bill, which contains key measures to implement the GAP, including hiring
20 more judges and making wealth declarations of senior public officials available to the
public. Resubmission of the bill would be a PC for the third review.
Structural measures
43.
Public financial management. The program includes several structural PCs and
benchmarks to enhance the efficiency of public resource use and to improve governance.
Performance criteria relate to (i) establishing the Public Procurement Oversight Authority;
and (ii) making the IFMIS operational in four spending ministries (including education and
health) for the 2007/08 budget. The program includes benchmarks on fiscal reporting,
improving transparency in granting exemptions, subjecting all procurements to transparent
and competitive procedures, timely presentation of the Controller and Auditor General’s
Report for FY2005/06 to Parliament, and completing a survey of the contingent liabilities of
24 parastatals.
44.
Financial sector reforms. Measures focus on further strengthening the financial
system to safeguard macroeconomic stability. The authorities will submit to Parliament a
new banking bill establishing a legal and regulatory framework for mandatory supervisory
intervention and prompt corrective actions against inadequately capitalized and failing banks.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing for cabinet consideration a strategy to divest from the
NBK and pending this divestiture, the Bank will remain under the current close supervision
by the CBK. The authorities will undertake a diagnostic audit of the National Social Security
Fund (NSSF) that will provide a basis to address its financial and governance problems.
45.
Private sector development and public enterprise reform. To reduce the cost of
doing business, licenses found by the Business Regulatory Reform Unit not to serve a useful
purpose will be eliminated in the 2007/08 Finance Bill. The program envisages establishment
of the Privatization Commission under the Privatization Act.

23
Program monitoring and financing
46.
The authorities have requested an extension of the arrangement to
November 20, 2007 and, reflecting the significant improvement in Kenya’s external
position, a reduction in access. Extension of the arrangement would allow time to complete
the third review and would help provide a framework for the important period in the run-up
to the elections expected in late 2007. The authorities have requested that access under the
arrangement be reduced by SDR 75 million. The remaining SDR 75 million would be
rephased in two equal disbursements; SDR 37.5 million would be available upon completion
of the second review and SDR 37.5 million upon completion of the third review, which
would be based on end-June test dates for the quantitative performance criteria (MEFP
Table 4). Structural performance criteria and benchmarks have been set for the remainder of
the program, and indicative targets have been set for end-September 2007 and end-December
2007 (MEFP Tables 3 and 4).13
47.
The authorities have taken a conservative approach to external financing
assumptions, and will scale up spending if conditions allow. The program for 2006/07 is
fully financed. The authorities have assumed no new budget support. Should it materialize
the authorities will increase spending in priority areas identified in the IP-ERS. Accordingly,
the program no long monitors the central government wage bill, giving the authorities greater
flexibility in prioritizing their spending. Completion of the second PRGF review is expected
to allow entry into force of the third phase of Kenya’s Paris Club rescheduling agreement,
which covers payments due in 2006, although some amounts already paid in 2006 may not be
refunded. The program does not assume the issuance of an external sovereign bond, but the
TMU includes adjusters so that the proceeds of such a bond remain in the CBK or are used to
retire foreign debt.
48.
The authorities are working to address external arrears. External arrears
continued to accumulate in 2005/06 on a number of the Anglo Leasing-type contracts and,
including interest and penalties, totaled $237 million at end-June 2006. Given the governance
concerns and the fact that these arrears are being disputed by the authorities, the TMU
excludes arrears on these contracts from the zero ceiling under the program. Because of high
interest and penalty rates on many of the contracts, the authorities are considering refinancing
the renegotiated amounts on more favorable commercial terms. After audits have been
completed, the program would allow new nonconcessional external borrowing to settle
arrears and pre-pay future obligations. Kenya also accumulated a small amount of arrears
(slightly less than $7 million) due to billing information not being provided by a non-Paris
Club bilateral creditor, which were cleared in the latter half of 2006.

13

The end-December 2007 indicative targets do not form part of the conditionality for the program under the
PRGF arrangement.

24
IV. OTHER ISSUES
49.
A JSAN covering annual progress reports (APRs) on implementation of the
IP-ERS for 2003/04 and 2004/05 has been prepared by Bank and Fund staffs and
circulated to the respective Boards.14 As outlined in the JSAN, the 2004/05 APR improves
upon the 2003/04 APR, although staffs stressed the need for more timely reports to provide
feedback.
50.
The quality and timeliness of Kenya’s economic and financial data are broadly
adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. However, there is further room to
improve the quality and timeliness of fiscal data as well as balance of payments statistics,
which often show large errors and omissions. The authorities plan to establish an autonomous
National Bureau of Statistics. Kenya is a participant of the GDDS.
51.
The CBK has made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2003
Safeguards Assessment and is committed to implementing all the remaining
recommendations.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
The surge in economic activity since 2003 is a major break from Kenya’s
lackluster growth performance over the past two decades. Growth has been broad-based
and benefited from macroeconomic stability, a favorable external environment, including
strong commodity prices and increased remittance and tourist inflows, as well as from a
recent improvement in the business climate. Sustaining growth will be a major challenge as
the current favorable external conditions may not endure and domestic gains need to be
consolidated through better infrastructure and faster structural reforms, including on
governance.
53.
Macroeconomic stability has underpinned the recent growth and must be
preserved. Important progress has been made in containing domestic debt, bringing down
inflation, rebuilding international reserves, and strengthening supervision of the financial
sector. Staff supports the authorities’ objective of gradually reducing domestic debt over the
medium term. There is limited scope for additional domestic borrowing to finance
infrastructure spending, and untapped external concessional resources should first be
explored. The authorities should weigh carefully the benefit of a benchmark sovereign bond
issue against the terms available and the potentially adverse consequences for aid flows and
debt sustainability. Other nonconcessional external borrowing, except to refinance existing
obligations, should be avoided. Moreover, an appropriate legal and institutional framework
for PPPs should be put in place to minimize fiscal risks. Monetary policy should continue to

25
target reserve money growth. An earlier tightening is desirable to reduce emerging
inflationary pressures.
54.
Further reforms are needed to ensure financial stability and development. Staff
welcome the recent enactment of the Banking Amendment Bill that strengthens the
supervisory power of the CBK. Staff encourages the authorities to expedite the passage of the
AML legislation and the amendments to the Banking Act aimed at aligning the legal and
regulatory framework with best international practices, to divest state shareholding in stateinfluenced financial institutions, and to develop a comprehensive financial sector reform
strategy. A diagnostic audit of the NSSF is urgently needed.
55.
Maintaining external competitiveness will be vital for sustained growth. The
managed float exchange rate regime has served Kenya well, and the recent real appreciation
of the shilling does not appear to have undermined competitiveness. However, there are risks
ahead, including the potential for a reversal in the strong commodity prices and slower
productivity growth if efficiency-enhancing structural reforms are not undertaken or
infrastructure improvements are delayed. Staff encourages the authorities to continue
monitoring competitiveness closely.
56.
Kenya should further reorient public expenditures toward development
priorities, including infrastructure and poverty reduction. Staff supports the authorities’
plans to create fiscal space for priority expenditures by reducing outlays on parastatals and
noncore activities and by containing the public wage bill. This policy should be supported by
continuing efforts to enhance revenue performance, including refraining from granting
further tax exemptions, by strengthening capacity in spending ministries, and by improving
public financial management. Improving the budget process, making the Procurement
Oversight Authority fully operational, and implementing IFMIS in key ministries are among
the priorities. Pressure to increase wages in the run-up to the elections should be resisted.
57.
Sustaining growth will require a vibrant private sector supported by a good
business climate. The recent moves to streamline Kenya’s business licensing system are
welcome, and staff commends the authorities for increased private sector participation in
public enterprises. However, continued efforts are needed, especially in the concessioning of
inefficient port facilities and addressing contingent liabilities in public enterprises. To build a
globally competitive export sector and attract more foreign direct investment, trade reforms
need to continue, focusing on lowering the CET, removing nontariff barriers, and
streamlining existing RTAs.
58.
Governance reforms play a special role in Kenya’s quest for sustained growth.
Staff acknowledges the progress made but urges the authorities to take decisive, concrete
actions on corruption cases and to strengthen institutions and increase transparency and
accountability. Forceful implementation of the GAP will be a litmus test for this strategy.
59.
Despite the need for further progress in governance reforms, staff recommends
completion of the second review under the PRGF arrangement and supports the
authorities’ request for waivers for nonobservance of five PCs. Staff supports the

26
authorities’ request for a reduction and rephasing in access to SDR 75 million, which is
consistent with the improvement in Kenya’s external position since the approval of the PRGF
arrangement.
60.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Kenya be held in
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

Short-term (net) financing and errors and omissions in Kenya tend to be volatile, reflecting in part weaknesses in reporting, e.g.,
of tourism receipts.

Projections are based on current rates of charge, including burden-sharing charges where applicable, for purchases in the General Resources
Account, and on current interest rates for Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and Trust Fund. The current SDR interest rate is assumed
for net use of SDRs.

2

This assumes that the remaining amount of the PRGF arrangement of SDR 75 million will be disbursed in 2 equal installments, with the third
disbursement of SDR 37.5 million taking place at around the time of the Executive Board meeting scheduled for April 2007.

APPENDIX I—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was prepared jointly by Fund and Bank
staffs in accordance with the standardized methodology for low-income countries. It is
based on the framework approved by the Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank
in April 2005.1 The DSA finds the risk of external debt distress to be low.
A. Methodology
2.
The DSA uses non-reconciled debt data, a single discount rate, WEO exchange rate
projections, and current values for denominators in all debt ratios.
3.
Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds. Kenya is classified as a medium performer in terms of the quality of its policies
and institutions as measured by a three-year average of Kenya’s score on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index.2,3
4.
The DSA is based on: updated data provided by the authorities, available data
on private sector borrowing, and estimates by the staffs. While every effort has been
made to obtain accurate data, the end-2005 external debt stock and associated future debt
service as projected in the DSA are likely to be somewhat over-estimated due to the inclusion
of some loans that had been committed but not fully disbursed. This largely explains the
sizeable residual and jump in the public external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005. The DSA will be
updated as revised debt data become available from the authorities.
5.
This DSA consists of two parts—external and fiscal. The external DSA covers
borrowing by the central government (including parastatal borrowing with a government
guarantee) and the central bank, and also includes estimates for private sector borrowing
based on available information. The fiscal DSA aims at assessing the sustainability of total
debt—external and domestic—incurred or guaranteed by the central government.4

http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/tablesCPR.pdf

3

For a medium performer the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are an NPV of debt-toexports ratio of 150 percent, an NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, an NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio of
250 percent, a debt service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent, and a debt service-to-revenue ratio of 30 percent.

4

Public domestic debt includes central government debt. External public debt includes public and publicly
guaranteed central government debt

38
6.
Key assumptions underlying the DSA are consistent with the proposed PRGFsupported program for 2007.
•

Macroeconomic assumptions: Annual real GDP growth of about 6.0 percent through
2012, which is in line with recent outcomes, followed by 5.0 percent from 2013
through 2026; inflation of about 6 percent as measured by a GDP deflator, which falls
to 5 percent for the 2013–26 period; annual export growth in U.S. dollar terms of
about 10 percent such that exports as a share of GDP rise modestly from 15 percent to
16 percent over the forecast period; a primary fiscal deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in
2006, which gradually narrows to a deficit of 0.4 percent by 2010; a non-interest
external current account deficit that rises to about 4½ percent of GDP in 2011 before
falling to an average of 2.6 percent of GDP over the 2012–26 period; a sharp increase
in new borrowing in the early years (from about 1 percent of GDP in 2005 to almost
4 percent of GDP by 2007) followed by lower borrowing as a share of GDP for an
average of 2 percent of GDP over the forecast period; NPV of domestic debt equal to
its face value; and continued restraint on nonconcessional external borrowing (grant
element below 35 percent) apart from sizeable commercial borrowing in 2007 to
refinance existing commercial debt (with little or no net impact) and possibly a small
amount of sovereign bond issuance.

•

No debt relief is assumed following the 2004–06 Paris Club rescheduling. A recently
concluded debt swap agreement with Italy, which could potentially lead to the
cancellation of Euro 43 million in external obligations, will be included in future
DSAs.

•

Continued eligibility for concessional borrowing from IDA is assumed although
achievement of assumed growth rates could imply graduation during the forecast
period.

•

The stress tests do not take into account possible fiscal effort/response to early debt
distress signs.
B. Recent Developments

7.
At end-2005, the face value of public external debt is estimated at $6.8 billion
(36 percent of GDP). Just over 60 percent of this debt is to multilateral creditors
(including 48 percent owed to the World Bank). About one-third of the debt is owed to
bilateral creditors (largely Paris Club), and a small share (4 percent) is owed to
commercial creditors, some of which is in arrears.
8.
Kenya has managed its debt burden relatively well and has regularly met its
obligations to most creditors. Limited external borrowing has left Kenya with more
manageable debt ratios than many of its low-income country peers. Kenya's income level led
it to be considered in the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, but due to a sustainable

39
level of debt, Kenya did not qualify to receive HIPC relief. Apart from disputed commercial
arrears, described in greater detail below, Kenya has regularly serviced its debts.
9.
Kenya has benefited from Paris Club reschedulings. In addition to rescheduling
agreements in 1994 and 2000, in the context of the current PRGF arrangement Kenya
received a rescheduling on Houston terms in 2004 covering US$353 million falling due from
2004 through 2006. Bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors have been finalized for
amounts falling due in 2004 and 2005, but the third phase of the agreement covering 2006
(roughly US$100 million) has not entered into force due to delays in the completion of
Kenya’s second review under the PRGF arrangement. The DSA assumes entry into force of
the third phase of the current Paris Club agreement.
10.
Kenya’s end-2005 external arrears of about $143 million were almost exclusively
to commercial creditors and are under dispute. The arrears stem from non-payment on
commercial credits for security-related contracts, many of which have been found by
Kenya’s Controller and Auditor-General to be fraudulent or deeply flawed (these projects are
often referred to as the “Anglo-Leasing” scandal). The authorities are disputing the validity
of the claims based on the contracts not being fulfilled, have hired an external audit firm to
determine the value of the goods and services provided, and intend to renegotiate the
amounts owed based on the audit results. It is expected that Kenya will accumulate additional
arrears until issues related to these contracts are resolved. Given high interest and penalty
rates on many of the contracts, the authorities are also considering refinancing the
renegotiated amounts on more favorable commercial terms; such a refinancing operation is
assumed in the DSA for 2007 and explains a spike in new commercial borrowing. A very
small amount of non-Paris Club bilateral arrears (less than US$ 6 million at end-2005) began
accumulating in 2003 due to technical billing problems, but these arrears were cleared in
2006.
11.
Kenya’s net domestic debt reached 17.9 percent of GDP at end-June 2006. Since
end-June 2003, domestic debt has gradually declined as a percent of GDP thanks to strong
economic growth, prudent fiscal policies, and lower interest rates, despite a lower than
historical primary surplus.5 About 70 percent of Kenya’s domestic debt is longer-term
borrowing with maturities extending up to 12 years. Despite the relatively low ratio of
reported domestic debt-to-GDP, Kenya’s domestic debt is likely to be underestimated due to
significant unreported contingent liabilities from a large parastatal sector and unfunded future
pension obligations. No reliable estimates exist on the value of these contingent liabilities,
and therefore, they have been omitted from this analysis. Future debt sustainability analysis

Due to lower real interest rates and higher growth compared to historical averages, debt-to-GDP can be
stabilized with a lower primary balance.

40
will seek to incorporate data on contingent liabilities. Fiscal data, which are based on a JulyJune fiscal year, are converted to calendar year data for the purposes of the DSA.6
C. External Debt Sustainability
12.
Under the baseline scenario, Kenya’s external debt indicators show a low risk of
debt distress. Although external debt may be overstated, as discussed above, the debt ratios
are still well below all of the indicative thresholds for a medium performer. The external debt
ratios decline sharply in 2006 and fall further over the forecast period (Table 1). The steep
drop in the 2006 public debt-to-GDP ratio is to a large extent explained by the appreciation
of the Kenyan shilling against the U.S. dollar and continued strong GDP growth. Over the
forecast period, although external borrowing is projected to more than triple in 2007 to
3.8 percent of GDP – a level some other low-income countries regularly borrow – this peak
reflects a backlog of delayed loans and would fall gradually as a share of GDP thereafter. In
addition to reasonably contained borrowing, the improvement in the baseline scenario
reflects favorable real output and export growth projections in comparison to longer-term
historical performance. Growth has accelerated significantly since 2003, and the authorities
are undertaking substantial infrastructure investments (financed partly through an assumed
increase in external assistance) and structural reforms intended to support export and overall
growth. It should be noted that the authorities’ Kenya Vision 2030 targets much faster growth
than assumed in the DSA.
13.
The alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that Kenya’s external debt
situation is generally resilient although shocks would lead to a sharp initial worsening
in debt stock indicators (Table 2). The most extreme stress tests are shown in Figure 1 and
described here. A shock combining lower GDP growth, weaker exports, a lower GDP
deflator, and a fall in non-debt creating flows would push the NPV of debt to almost
32 percent of GDP. Substantially slower exports would push the NPV of debt to about
131 percent of exports. Despite an immediate worsening, the two debt stock measures would
then improve on a trajectory similar to that under the baseline scenario. The debt service-toexports ratio would be most negatively affected under the slower export growth scenario, but
none of the shocks would push the debt service burden particularly high. The NPV of public
external debt-to-revenue ratio and the public external debt service-to-revenue ratio both
remain under the relevant thresholds in all of the alternative and shock scenarios. Perhaps
surprisingly, a “historical” scenario, which uses the recent performance of key economic
variables instead of the baseline assumptions, yields debt ratios that are not much worse, and
at times better, than in the baseline scenario. While growth is much lower under the historical

report.

41
scenario, non-debt creating flows are not significantly different, and the historical current
account deficit is much lower than the deficit in the baseline. The latter factor reduces the
borrowing need, particularly in the 2010–12 period when the current account deficit peaks
under the baseline scenario.

D. Public Debt Sustainability
14.
Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of public debt-to-GDP rises substantially
after the inclusion of Kenya’s domestic debt, even though all debt indicators remain
within comfort levels. The NPV of total public debt-to-GDP, at 38 percent in 2006, remains
below 40 percent under the baseline scenario, and declines gradually to 23 percent by 2026.
Given Kenya’s relatively strong revenue performance, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
declines from about 172 percent of GDP in 2006 to below 100 percent in 2026, remaining
well below 250 percent. Given the large share of longer-term domestic debt, the debt serviceto-revenue ratio, which takes into account debt service on longer-term domestic and external
debt, is 26.3 percent in 2006, and gradually declines throughout the projection period.
15.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that Kenya’s debt indicators are
particularly vulnerable to slower growth, while being broadly resilient under other
alternative assumptions. A two-year growth shock leads to a rapid increase in the NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio to over 40 percent by 2007, and in the debt service-to-revenue ratio to over
30 percent by 2008, indicating some risk of debt distress under this scenario. While the NPV
of debt-to-revenue ratio also rises in the lower growth scenario, it remains below 250 percent
over the entire period. Sustained lower growth would cause ratios to approach but not exceed
the thresholds. Other scenarios indicate limited or no risk of debt distress and show resilience
over the long term to a depreciation shock, a reversion to historical (positive) primary
balances, and a 10 percent shock in other debt creating flows. That said, however, it should
be noted that large unreported contingent liabilities, which for the purposes of this DSA have
been assumed to be zero, could increase the risk of debt distress.

42
E. Public Debt Sustainability Under Higher Nonconcessional Borrowing
16.
An alternative baseline scenario is included to illustrate the impact of higher
commercial borrowing and interest rates on public debt sustainability. While the
authorities’ medium term fiscal framework projects a gradual decline in the domestic debt-toGDP ratio, as assumed under section D of this analysis, this alternative scenario assumes
additional public borrowing on nonconcessional terms of the equivalent of 1 percent of GDP
per year during the first five years of the projection period (2006–10) to help finance
additional public spending on infrastructure. The scenario also assumes that these amounts
are raised domestically and result in an increase in domestic interest rates of 200 basis points
throughout the projection period.7 The analysis is carried out for additional commercial
domestic borrowing, but equally applies to increasing nonconcessional external borrowing.
Alternatively, it illustrates the risk to public debt sustainability when contingent liabilities
result in additional nonconcessional debt. This scenario further assumes that on balance
additional borrowing has no effect on real GDP growth.
17.
The analysis points to considerable risks to public debt sustainability from
higher nonconcessional borrowing if interest rates go up as assumed and there is no
growth impact. With these alternative assumptions for the baseline scenario, the NPV of
public debt-to-GDP very closely approaches 40 percent in the early years of the projection
period and reaches 34 percent by the end of the projection period. The debt service-torevenue ratio exceeds 30 percent under the alternative baseline scenario by 2011. Under
various shocks or less favorable assumptions, the outlook for debt sustainability worsens
significantly. A shock to growth in particular is associated with high levels for all three debt
indicators (Tables 3a and 3b, Figure 3).
18.
The alternative case illustrates that small changes to the current favorable debt
dynamics can adversely affect the otherwise favorable outlook on public debt
sustainability. Hence, a prudent fiscal policy that aims at a gradual reduction in public-debtto-GDP seems appropriate. Preferably largely untapped concessional resources should be
used effectively to meet infrastructure needs and any attempt to exploit the limited scope to
borrow additionally for infrastructure needs should be explicitly linked to projects with
unquestionably high rates of return.

7

During the projection period, the average real interest rate of domestic debt of 7.6 percent would still be
substantially below the historical average of 10.2 percent.

43
F. Conclusions
19.
Reflecting relatively limited reliance on external borrowing and an expected
improvement in macroeconomic performance, Kenya faces a low risk of external debt
distress although a cautious approach is needed to preserve debt sustainability. All
external public debt indicators remain below the relevant country-specific debt burden
thresholds. Standard stress tests reveal an upward trend for the debt indicators but do not
result in a breach of the thresholds during the projection period.
20.
Taking all public debt into account, however, the DSA shows some risk of debt
distress under the case of a shock to GDP growth. Potentially large but unreported
contingent liabilities pose additional risks to the sustainability of public debt.
21.
The sustainability of Kenya’s debt depends on macroeconomic performance and
a prudent borrowing strategy. Achieving or exceeding the ambitious growth and export
figures in the baseline scenario depends on: policies to sustain macroeconomic stability,
substantial investment in infrastructure; and regulatory and governance reforms to improve
the investment climate. Additionally, Kenya’s success in avoiding unsustainable debt to date
reflects good management, but also limited willingness on the part of creditors to provide
financing, at times due to governance concerns. Assuming continued policy improvements,
Kenya may have greater access to external financing. It will be important to avoid excessive
borrowing and to seek the most concessional resources available. Accessing concessional
external finance will also help maintain a prudent fiscal stance, limit an excessive expansion
of domestic borrowing, and preserve fiscal debt sustainability.
22.
The staffs encourage Kenya to use tools such as the joint Fund-Bank DSA
template to develop a prudent borrowing strategy to maintain both external and fiscal
debt sustainability. Such a strategy should consider the total concessionality and interest
costs of Kenya’s borrowing, the return on individual projects and overall growth impact, and
steps that would help guard against volatility, whether due to shocks such as droughts or to
fluctuations in external assistance. Strategies to guard against shocks could include some
further build-up in international reserves, fiscal reserves, and restrained domestic borrowing
to provide a buffer in case of an unforeseen financing need or a shortfall in external flows. A
better understanding of holdings of shilling-denominated debt by non-residents would also
help guide efforts to reduce vulnerabilities.

1/ Covers both public and private sector external debt, including arrears. The end-2005 public external debt stock and associated debt service are likely overstated due to the inclusion of some agreed but undisbursed amounts. Revised data are being
sought.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; project grants which are included as capital transfers in the balance of payments; and valuation adjustments. For projections
also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX II—KENYA: LETTER OF INTENT
April 4, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes
our recent performance under the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement and outlines the policies we plan to implement through the end
of 2007. We remain fully committed to the goal of reducing poverty by establishing a
macroeconomic and institutional framework that is conducive to accelerating growth, as spelt
out in the Investment Program for the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and
Employment Creation.
2.
Progress has been made under the program. Kenya’s economic performance has
continued to improve since the completion of the first review under the PRGF in late 2004.
Growth accelerated to 5.3 percent in 2004/05 and further to 5.9 percent in 2005/06. Overall
inflation fell sharply to 6.8 percent in the 12-months to February, as food price inflation
eased while non-food inflation continued to hover around 6 percent. In the area of
governance and other structural reforms, additional efforts will be required in order to sustain
recent growth and move towards the targets set in the Kenya Vision 2030. Our 2006/07
program focuses on the required additional measures.
3.
Five out of the 13 performance criteria for 2004/05 for the second review were not
met. The end-March 2005 quantitative performance criterion (PC) on the reserve money of
the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was missed, as was the continuous PC on
nonaccumulation of external payments arrears. The structural PCs on non-imposition of
controls on banks’ fees and charges (Section 44 of the Banking Act) and the issuance of new
guidelines for wage arbitration by the Industrial Court were also missed. Finally, the
structural PC on completion of the asset declaration of ministers, permanent secretaries, and
heads of state bodies was not observed. Remedial actions have been taken to address these
slippages. We have developed modalities for implementing Section 44 of the Banking Act
that are broadly consistent with the original program objectives, cleared a small amount of
bilateral external arrears, and taken steps to improve debt management practices. The
Industrial Court eventually issued new guidelines for wage arbitration in November 2005,
and verification of asset declarations of ministers and senior officials is continuing.

54
4.
We request waivers for the nonobservance of the five performance criteria detailed
above. We also request an extension of the PRGF arrangement to November 20, 2007, which
would allow us time to complete the third review under the arrangement after we have
reached understandings with Fund staff on the 2007/08 budget. In view of the substantial
improvements in Kenya’s balance of payments since the approval of the PRGF arrangement,
we request a reduction in access of SDR75 million, with the remaining access of
SDR75 million to be disbursed in two equal installments (SDR37.5 million each) for the
second and third reviews.
5.
The attached MEFP spells out the quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks
as well as the structural performance criteria and benchmarks to be used in monitoring
performance under the program through December 2007. The end-March and end-September
quantitative targets are benchmarks, while end-June targets are performance criteria.
End-December 2007 targets are indicative. Understandings between the Kenyan authorities
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of these quantitative
and structural performance criteria and benchmarks, as well as the related reporting
requirements, are set out in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The
government has taken a number of prior actions for the issuance of the staff report on the
second review of the PRGF arrangement.
6.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate
to achieve the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may
become appropriate for this purpose. Kenya will consult with the Fund on the adoption of
such measures, in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, and in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. Kenya will continue to provide the
Fund, in a timely manner, all the information required to monitor progress in implementing
the policies and achieving the objectives of the PRGF-supported program.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Amos Kimunya
Minister of Finance

APPENDIX II—ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2006/07
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum summarizes our government’s economic and financial policies for
fiscal year 2006/07 (July/June) and the beginning of fiscal year 2007/08, which are supported
by the International Monetary Fund under its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). The broad strategy remains as outlined in our Investment Program for the Economic
Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS) and described in the
government’s previous memorandum of November 2004. The key priorities are to maintain
macroeconomic stability; strengthen economic growth and reduce poverty; and advance
social policies as well as governance and structural reforms that will benefit the entire
population.
2.
The government has recently launched the Kenya Vision 2030 program, which calls
for accelerating annual GDP growth to 10 percent on a sustained basis, with a view to
making Kenya a middle-income country by the year 2030. As a step in this direction, a
medium-term economic strategy that builds on the ERS is being developed for the period
2008-2012, aimed at accelerating growth with macroeconomic stability, further reducing
poverty, improving equity, and strengthening institutions of governance.
3.
This memorandum therefore also reports on progress secured so far and evolving
government priorities, including our strengthened focus on improving governance, since this
is key to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS UNDER THE PROGRAM
4.
Economic growth increased in 2005/06, but a severe drought and external shocks
adversely affected overall inflation. Real GDP expanded by an estimated 5.9 percent in
2005/06 compared with a target of 3.2 percent under the program. This was the highest
growth rate in two decades and represents the third year in a row of an increase in per capita
income. Economic growth continued to benefit from prudent macroeconomic policies as well
as strong regional and global growth, with exports (including tourism and agriculture) and
investment expanding strongly. The impact of the drought on overall economic activity was
limited, as good harvests in the main food producing parts of the country counterbalanced the
effects of the severe drought in other areas. Nevertheless, shortages in some food products
and distribution difficulties resulted in sharply higher food prices, which, coupled with higher
fuel prices that resulted from full pass-through of world prices, led to significantly higher
overall inflation since the end of 2005. The good rains in the final quarter of 2006 have
somewhat eased price pressures, with overall inflation falling sharply to 6.8 percent in the

56

12 months to February after running at double digits in 2006, and nonfood inflation hovering
around 6 percent. On the balance of payments front, even with the large inflows of
remittances, the current account deficit widened on account of higher world oil prices and
strong import demand in line with stronger growth. At the same time, sizable financial
inflows resulted in a significant buildup in foreign exchange reserves and an appreciation of
the Kenyan shilling, largely reflecting increased confidence in Kenya’s economy. With
respect to fiscal policy, its implementation was adversely affected by lower-than-budgeted
donor support. However, cuts in non-priority expenditures helped contain domestic
borrowing at Ksh 28.3 billion (1.8 percent of GDP) while accommodating additional
drought-related spending of Ksh 12.6 billion (0.8 percent of GDP).
5.
Reflecting the progress made in economic management, including prudent
macroeconomic policies as well as broad-based economic growth, the country received a
favorable initial sovereign credit rating of “B+” for foreign currency and “BB-” for
local currency long-term sovereign debt from Standard and Poor’s. Within sub-Saharan
Africa, only mineral-rich countries such as Botswana, South Africa, and Nigeria have a
higher sovereign rating.
6.
With respect to structural reforms, important progress has been made in many
areas but there were some delays in others. We initiated a detailed assessment of the
financial positions of twenty-five parastatals, including the National Social Security Fund
(NSSF), to determine their contingent liabilities. We also introduced performance contracts
for public commercial enterprises, which contributed to an improvement in their financial
performance and a near 80 percent increase in dividends to the Treasury in 2005/06;
substantially advanced reforms in the telecom sector (including the decision to restructure
and prepare Telkom Kenya for privatization and the sale of licenses for a second fixed-line
provider, a third mobile phone provider and for international telecom gateways); successfully
completed divestiture of part of the state’s holdings in Kenya Electricity Generating
Company (KenGen); completed the concession for Kenya Railways; enhanced the regulatory
capacity of the Coffee Board and liberalized coffee marketing; transferred the management
of Kenya Power and Lighting Company to a private company; and began implementation of
the East African Community (EAC) customs union agreement. The recent highly successful
partial divestiture of KenGen has created an impetus for further divestitures and
privatization. Importantly, a new Privatization Act is in place that will guide future
privatization transactions, and the government plans to take further steps (as outlined below)
to advance the privatization agenda. With the exception of IFMIS, virtually all the reforms
envisaged in the program have been met, including important steps in improving the
budgetary process. With respect to the IFMIS, which is fundamental to strengthening public
expenditure management, we have recently made important progress towards making it
operational in the ministries of Education, Health, Planning and Finance. With regard to the
financial sector, the government has now transferred to the Central Bank all powers to

57

supervise banks. However, the restructuring of state-owned banks has not progressed as
originally envisaged.
7.
On the governance front, appreciable progress has been made in strengthening
governance institutions, but more efforts are required in implementation in order to
sustain the recent economic growth momentum. Since 2003, the government has proposed
and Parliament has approved laws that have strengthened the fight against corruption: the
Public Officers Ethics Act (2003); the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (2003); the
Government Financial Management Act (2004); the Public Audit Office Act (2004); the
Public Procurement and Disposal Act (2005); the Privatization Act (2005); and the Statistics
Act (2006). A Ministerial Code of Conduct is now in force, which requires all Ministers and
Assistant Ministers to submit wealth declarations, which are then verified by the Kenya AntiCorruption Commission (KACC). The KACC has reported to the President on this
verification process and is seeking clarification concerning declarations that are still to be
submitted. The Public Procurement and Disposal Regulations, 2006, to operationalize the
Procurement Act, were gazetted on December 29, 2006 and become effective on
January 1, 2007. The government is now in the process of making the Public Procurement
Oversight Authority fully operational. This will help reduce the incidence of corruption
through public procurement and abuses of the type perpetrated in the Anglo-Leasing cases.
We also began streamlining the business licensing regime, with 118 licenses already
eliminated in FY 2005/06 and 2006/07. With a view to strengthening transparency and
accountability, the government published the report of the Public Accounts Committee on
Anglo-Leasing contracts, as well as the findings of the Goldenberg and Ndungu
Commissions, and has initiated action based on the recommendations contained in these
reports. The government has also appointed Special Prosecutors and Civil Litigation Counsel
to bolster the capacity of the State Law Office to implement the recommendations of the
reports, through criminal prosecutions and civil litigation. To address the challenge of
implementation of the governance agenda, the government adopted a detailed Governance
Action Plan for the period November 2006 to December 2007, which was drawn from the
new three-year National Anti-Corruption Plan launched at the end June 2006, and reflected
substantial dialogue with stakeholders inside and outside of government.1
8.
Important progress has been made in investigating corruption cases and
bringing them to trial, but the pace of concluding cases has been slow. By March 6, 2007,
the KACC had forwarded to the Attorney General 254 files and recommended prosecution in

1

For further details, see the Governance Action Plan for Building a Prosperous Kenya, 2006-07, which covers
measures to be taken up to the end of 2007 .

58

185 files, administrative disciplinary action in 11 files and closure for lack of evidence in
58 files. Of these, the Attorney General has refused only three. There are currently a number
of high-profile corruption cases in court, including cases involving three former permanent
secretaries charged with crimes linked to Anglo-Leasing contracts, two former central bank
governors (one linked to the Goldenberg scandal), and one former minister. The remaining
Anglo-Leasing contracts are being investigated by the KACC in tandem with an external
audit of the contracts to assess their fair values. The KACC has indicated that it intends to
complete its investigations of all Anglo-Leasing contracts before making its
recommendations to the Attorney General’s office. To date, a total of 67 cases prosecuted
under the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (ACECA) have been concluded or
dismissed, resulting in 14 convictions and 12 acquittals. Further, the Commission has filed
94 civil cases seeking recovery of public funds amounting to Ksh 121,072,800.15, of which
Ksh 12,585,583 has already been recovered. KACC has also filed 37 suits for recovery of
illegally allocated public land valued at Ksh 909 million; 48 applications for preservation of
assets valued at Ksh 1.19 billion and an application to enjoin the Commission so as to protect
public property and interests in a suit worth Ksh 50 million. The Commission has also
recovered public land measuring 89.5 hectares, valued at Ksh 144 million. The slow progress
in concluding cases is linked to a number of factors, including an under-staffed, and underequipped, judiciary, a paucity of courtrooms, an insufficient number of prosecutors, and the
application of constitutional stays by defendants. Many of these weaknesses are being
addressed in the context of the “Governance Action Plan for Building a Prosperous Kenya,
2006/07”, which was recently approved by Cabinet (a prior action).
9.
Most of the performance targets for the second review under the PRGF
arrangement were met, but we are requesting waivers for nonobservance of five
performance criteria. These targets covered only 2004/05 due to the long delay in
completing the second review. The end-March 2005 quantitative performance criterion (PC)
on reserve money of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was missed, but monetary policy was
subsequently tightened, reducing the deviation from the end-June 2005 benchmark. The
continuous PC on nonaccumulation of external payments arrears also was missed, but the
arrears were quickly cleared and steps have been taken to improve debt management
practices. With regard to structural performance criteria, the continuous criterion on the nonimposition of controls on banks’ fees and charges (Section 44 of the Banking Act) was not
observed, but we have developed remedies which have in practice always resulted in
approval by the Ministry of Finance of proposed increases in bank fees and charges. Also,
the structural PC on completion of the asset declaration of ministers, permanent secretaries,
and heads of state bodies were also not observed, and new guidelines for wage arbitration by
the Industrial Court were not issued by end-March, as programmed, but were issued in
November 2005. The Letter of Intent (LOI) to which this memorandum is attached requests
waivers for the nonobservance of these performance criteria. In addition, two structural
benchmarks for end-March 2005 were missed, notably, (i) the simplifications of customs

59

procedures, which has now been addressed with the introduction of a computerized system
since July 2005; and (ii) a financial review of the NSSF and the study of the contingent
liabilities of 24 parastatals, which are expected to be completed by May 2007 and September
2007, respectively. The two structural PCs that had been set for the third review were also
not met. As noted above, steps were taken to meet the original objectives of the continuous
PC on non-imposition of controls on banks’ fees and charges. As regards the PC for end-June
2005 on the verification of the asset declarations of ministers and senior officials, the
verification process is continuing. In addition the government will resubmit to Parliament
proposed amendments to the Public Officer Ethics Act to enable the public to have access to
declarations of assets required by public officers under this Act, and to empower the KACC
to investigate whether a public officer has contravened the Code of Conduct and Ethics
established under the Act.
III. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
10.
The updated macroeconomic framework envisages growth rates well above
averages observed in the past decade and gradual progress toward achieving the
MDGs. This is based on maintaining macroeconomic stability, accelerating structural
reforms, upgrading essential infrastructure, and continuing efforts to rebuild key institutions,
including those related to governance. As indicated in our detailed Needs Assessment,
achieving the MDGs would also require a major increase in investment and donor support to
achieve and sustain economic growth rates of over 7 percent per annum. However, given
recent experience, our baseline assumptions for donor support are well below these
requirements. In addition, while the government is gearing its policies to accelerate growth
towards the target of 10 percent elaborated in the 2030 vision, the medium term
macroeconomic framework is guided by the need to be prudent, and therefore based on an
average growth rate of 6 percent, which is still well above historically observed rates in
Kenya. If we achieve higher than the projected growth rates, the medium-term macroeconomic framework will be adjusted accordingly.
11.
For 2006/07, we expect continued robust economic growth and a significant
decline in inflation. Indications of favorable weather conditions, strong tourism demand, and
recent robust income growth are expected to sustain GDP growth at about 6.1 percent—and
we see the potential for even faster growth. At the same time, headline inflation should
decline to 7 percent by the end of the fiscal year as the drought-related increases in food
prices are reversed. On the external side, the current account deficit is likely to widen
somewhat as a result of stronger growth and an expected increase in foreign-financed project
imports to help address infrastructure bottlenecks. Nonetheless, as in 2005/06, financial
inflows should allow for a further accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, reaching the
equivalent of 3.3 months of next year’s imports by mid-2007. We recognize that these
projections are subject to considerable risks, notably those related to a return of adverse

60

weather conditions and further oil price increases, and stronger-than-expected repercussions
from the strong Kenyan shilling.
IV. ECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL POLICIES FOR 2006/07
A. Governance
12.
The government is fully committed to implementing its Governance Action Plan
for Building a Prosperous Kenya. As spelled out in the Action Plan, the key governance
policy initiatives will focus on four broad areas: (i) prevention; (ii) investigation;
(iii) restitution; and (iv) improving governance in priority sectors. In implementing these
measures, top priority will be given to administrative and preventive actions, which are
expected to result in measurable improvements in governance and anti-corruption efforts in
the short run.
13.
The government has taken important actions and will table proposals for
legislative reform that will substantially strengthen the governance strategy. We have
already posted on the web all procurement contracts above Ksh 0.5 million awarded in the
second and third quarters of 2005/06 (a prior action) and commit to posting on the web all
subsequent procurement contracts above the Ksh 0.5 million threshold at the end of each
quarter. Parliamentary passage of the proposed reforms would expand the powers of the
KACC to place assets of suspected criminals under receivership pending the conclusion of
the investigation, prohibit the application for constitutional stays of proceedings in corruption
cases, and enable the KACC to take over investigations of corruption commenced by the
Police. The Penal Code would be amended to elevate acts that are misdemeanors under the
Code to felony offences, as they currently provided for under the ACECA, 2003. The
proposed amendments to the Judicature Act will increase the number of High Court judges
from 50 to 70 and the number of appellate judges from 11 to 14, while the proposed
amendments to the Public Officer Ethics Act will make the information contained in the
wealth declarations of public officials accessible to the public. Submission of these proposed
amendments to Parliament would constitute a performance criterion for the completion of the
third review under the PRGF. To help expedite the prosecution of cases, the 2007/08 budget
will provide for the hiring of additional prosecutors and expanding of court facilities. The
Chief Justice has indicated that automated recording of court proceedings will be
implemented to replace the time-consuming process of manual recording of court
proceedings by judges. In addition, the government will strengthen governance through the
fiscal and financial sector reforms noted below.
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
Safeguarding expenditures for core anti-poverty areas and raising spending for
infrastructure programs, while maintaining fiscal soundness, are the key fiscal policy

61

objectives for 2006/07. The near-term objectives are embedded in our medium-term policy
priorities, as described in the Budget Strategy Paper for 2006/07-2008/09 and the recently
launched Budget Outlook Paper 2007/08-2009/10. Accordingly, the budget for 2006/07
accommodates drought-relief spending of Ksh 3 billion and doubles the allocation for
development spending in the Ministry of Roads and Public Works, with improvements in
infrastructure seen to be crucial for enhancing growth. The budget for 2006/07 assumes no
foreign budget support (apart from a partial reimbursement of US$ 20 million by the World
Bank for drought-related expenditures carried out in 2005/06), but in the event that budget
support is received, we intend to spend it on pro-growth and anti-poverty areas, as set out in
the Budget Strategy Paper, which reflects the priorities of the ERS. We assume project
support amounting to 2.5 percent of GDP, which comprises 1.2 percent of GDP in foreign
grants and 1.3 percent of GDP in loans. The budget also includes 1.0 percent of GDP in
privatization receipts. With limited external financing available, the scaling up of core antipoverty and infrastructure programs will thus require a determined effort to rein in nonpriority spending and to ensure strong domestic revenue collection. Achieving our domestic
borrowing target of Ksh 29.5 billion (equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP) should leave
adequate room for private sector credit and help safeguard debt sustainability.
15.
Revenues are expected to rise on account of higher incomes and strengthened tax
administration. The projected increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio is large (exceeding
1 percentage point) but is feasible in light of tax and customs administration measures,
designed to reverse the sharp drop in the revenue ratio observed in 2005/06. Specifically,
steps have been taken to address earlier problems in implementing the SIMBA2005 system
(a customs-processing system introduced in July 2005) which is now fully operational. These
steps will enhance not only customs revenues, but also VAT receipts from imports. Indeed,
the first half of 2006/07 has seen robust growth of customs revenues and VAT receipts.
Governance at customs has been enhanced by introducing electronic queue management and
electronic processing, which eliminates face-to-face and oral communication between
customs officers and clearing agents; installing CCTV cameras; and more generally,
implementing the Kenya Revenue Authority’s Integrity Plan and Code of Conduct for
employees. The number of taxpayers covered by the Large Taxpayer’s Office has been
increased from 243 to 812 and problems with VAT refunds have been largely solved. Further
reforms to enhance tax administration include the introduction of the Electronic Taxpayer
Register (ETR). We introduced a turnover tax for small businesses in the context of the
2006/07 budget. Both measures are expected to contribute in the medium-term to increased
revenue and improved tax compliance.
16.
The government remains firmly committed to the reorientation of public
expenditures in favor of growth and poverty-related outlays. Accordingly, development
expenditures and net lending are budgeted to increase by about 1.7 percentage point of GDP.
Development spending includes increased expenditure on roads and other infrastructure, and

62

urgently needed investment in new electricity generation capacity that is now underway, as
well as spending through the Constituency Development Fund. Aside from an increase in
project-related foreign financing, the room for higher priority spending is created by
containing spending in other categories, mainly through the new pay policy and efforts to
reform the pension scheme for civil servants, and increasingly also through containing
transfers to parastatals. Since the approval of the budget, the government has decided to bring
forward a wage increase for teachers that was scheduled for 2007/08. The government will
offset the resulting cost of this step of Ksh 2.5 billion by making cuts in non priority
spending. In addition to total wage-related expenditures of Ksh 130 billion, wage and salary
payments for 3,000 nurses are covered by external support and our program allows for this
number to be increased. Moreover, those health workers whose externally funded contracts
will expire during 2006/07 will thereafter be absorbed into the civil service payroll. Wage
bill management is being strengthened by the new centralized Integrated Payroll and
Personnel Database (IPPD). Other priorities related to public sector wage and employment
reforms include steps to: restrict all salary and wage increases to at most one adjustment per
annum, to take place at the beginning of the fiscal year; accelerate efforts to fully implement
the Voluntary Early Retirement Scheme, by which over 21,000 employees were to retire over
a period of 3 years ending 2007/08. However, a court challenge delayed the scheme’s
implementation by one year. We plan to fill only half of the vacancies (except in priority
areas) created through this scheme and natural attrition.
17.
We intend to accelerate public expenditure management reforms—an area
critical for promoting efficient use of public resources and transparency. The Strategy to
Revitalize Public Finance Management (PFM) was launched in June 2006 and highlights
recent progress in this area, including better cash management through regular reconciliation
of all central government accounts, clearance of the backlog of audits, streamlined budget
formulation and budget preparation, and steps taken to strengthen cash flow planning,
including establishing zero-balance drawing accounts for all ministries in 2005/06. Further,
the introduction of a new economic classification system for public expenditure, based on the
GFS 2001 manual, has enhanced transparency. We also intend to request Kenya’s
participation in a Report on Standards and Codes on fiscal transparency. To align our PFM
with international best practice, our immediate focus will be on:
•

Operationalizing the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS),
for which about US$33 million has been made available under the PFM Reform
Program, to be effective for the 2007/08 budget implementation. A new steering
committee has been established, headed by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Finance, and includes representation from key line ministries. The committee will
establish an implementation plan to make the IFMIS operational in four spending
ministries (including education and health) for the management of the 2007/08
budget; provide quarterly reports on project implementation to the economic

63

committee of the Cabinet; and be responsible for the preparation of comprehensive
guidance documentation of the IFMIS for system users;
•

Strengthening the legal framework for PFM, drawing on the recommendations of the
recent FAD diagnostic PFM mission and submitting the draft legal framework for
PFM for cabinet approval;

•

Strengthening the monitoring of exemptions by including a tax expenditure budget
along with the regular budget documents from FY 2007/08 onward, and developing
and enforcing objective criteria for granting tax exemptions to remove discretionary
powers and enhance transparency and accountability in the tax exemption regime;

•

Strengthening budget reporting by ensuring timely production of monthly fiscal
accounts (including on pending bills and arrears) based on expenditure returns data
and publishing quarterly fiscal data based on expenditure returns no later than 45 days
after the end of each quarter;

•

Establishing a database on all extra-budgetary funds as well as semi-autonomous and
autonomous government agencies and adopting an action plan to rationalize them and
reduce their funding. Starting with financial year 2007/08, the annual budget
documents will include details of the operations of these funds and agencies; and

•

Establishing an automated database for parastatals to closely monitor their financial
performance and fiscal risks from their operations.

18.
Fully implementing the new Public Procurement and Disposal Act should
enhance effective use of public resources and limit the opportunities for corrupt
practices by fostering open and competitive bidding processes. To this end, we will make
the autonomous Public Procurement Oversight Authority fully operational under the Act. As
noted above, we will post procurement contracts above Ksh 0.5 million on the web. In
consultation with stakeholders, we shall develop indicators for monitoring efficiency and
transparency of procurements of the central government and, through a new manual, simplify
procedures. An independent review of procurement contracts under World Bank-supported
projects in the ministries of education, health, and roads and public works has been
completed. We shall follow up on its recommendations, including simplifying procurement
rules and making them more transparent. In addition, we have concluded our discussions
with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) on how it can help Kenya strengthen
overall procurement processes, and in particular, in the medical supplies sector. An action
plan has already been agreed and has been approved by the Board of the MCC.

64

C. Monetary, Exchange rate, and Financial Sector Policies
19.
Monetary policy operations will be geared toward securing low inflation over the
medium term. The CBK will target reserve money growth with the objective of limiting the
rate of inflation to 7 percent by June 2007—provided that there is no recurrence of drought
conditions so that the spike in food prices is reversed and international fuel prices moderate.
Consistent with the inflation objective, we shall limit the annual growth in both reserve and
broad money to 14 percent by end-June and 12 percent by end-September. With a view to
further enhancing the transparency of monetary policy and improving the signaling of policy
intentions to the market, the central bank will emphasize that policy will be geared to
attaining the reserve money target. In that regard, the Central Bank’s semi-annual monetary
policy statement to the Minister of Finance will provide added focus on inflation
developments vis-à-vis the government’s official inflation objective. To enhance the
effectiveness of the Central Bank’s indirect instruments of monetary policy, by deepening the
inter-bank money market, the Internal Loans Act will be amended to facilitate the use of a
master repurchase agreement for all inter-bank repo transactions, and efforts will be made to
achieve delivery versus payment (DVP) in the settlement for securities. We will propose
amendments to the Central Bank Act with a view to strengthen CBK’s governance while
enhancing the independence and accountability of the institution, particularly with respect to
the conduct of monetary policy.
20.
We will maintain a floating exchange rate regime. Foreign exchange
interventions—aside from securing foreign reserve targets—will be limited to smoothing
short-term fluctuations unrelated to economic fundamentals. Despite a nominal appreciation
of the Kenyan shilling against the U.S. dollar of over 10 percent in the last 2 years, the
exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with economic fundamentals, driven by robust
export growth, increased remittances, greater investor confidence, and strong capital inflows.
However, we will continue to monitor closely developments in our external competitiveness.
21.
The government is committed to developing a financial sector reform strategy
that is based on market principles. The strategy to be considered by Cabinet by September
2007 will encompass reforms to improve access to financial services by the greater majority
of Kenyans and strengthen efficiency and stability of the financial system. Important
initiatives are underway. Risk management guidelines were adopted in 2005 and revised
prudential guidelines for the banking sector were introduced in January 2006, with the latter
including changes to enhance provisioning requirements for all classes of non-performing
loans and assets. A comprehensive review of the Banking Act is being undertaken and the
draft amendments to the Banking Act are being circulated to relevant parties for comment.
The amendments are designed to address weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory
framework and align our regulatory practices to international standards. Key among the
changes are the provisions to strengthen enforcement of supervisory powers through (i) the

65

introduction of mandatory supervisory intervention and prompt corrective actions for
inadequately capitalized and failing banks, and (ii) the introduction of consolidated
supervision.
22.
Charterhouse Bank was put under statutory management of the Central Bank of
Kenya in June 2006. Upon the placement of the bank under statutory management the
former managing director of the bank filed an application in the High Court seeking ex-parte
injunction to stay statutory management pending full hearing of the application. The High
Court dismissed the application for injunction prompting the former managing director to file
an appeal. A number of cases were subsequently filed by depositors in various courts seeking
injunction against the Central Bank, leading to ex-parte decisions by two Judges ordering the
Central Bank to relinquish control of Charterhouse Bank. This then led to citing of contempt
and the issuance of warrant of arrest of the statutory manager following the refusal of the
Central Bank to comply. The contempt charges and warrant of arrest were stayed pending
proceedings before the Honourable Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal. On
March 9, 2007, the Court of Appeal rejected the application by Charterhouse Bank to remove
the statutory manager. This ruling set a legal precedent and gave direction for the other
depositors’ cases pending before the Honourable Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal.
Despite numerous legal obstacles, the Government has acted forcefully on the case of
Charterhouse Bank. In the beginning of December, 2006 the government issued a notice to
the former Charterhouse Bank directors of its intention to revoke the bank’s licence as
required under the Banking Act. The licence, which expired in December 2006, has not been
renewed by the government.
23.
The government intends to strengthen the legislation governing financial
oversight to help ensure that such problems do not emerge in the future. Recent
amendments to the Banking Act have been effected, transferring all licensing, supervisory,
and resolution powers from the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank. The government
intends to further amend the Act to extend the list of infractions for which statutory
management and liquidation may be undertaken (currently a bank may be liquidated only if it
is insolvent). In addition, the government will resubmit the Proceeds of Crime and AntiMoney Laundering Bill to Parliament. This legislation, together with the Suppression of
Terrorism Bill (being drafted), will establish a sound legal foundation to prosecute money
laundering and combat the financing of terrorism. In the meantime, the government will be
developing regulations for the implementation of the anti-money laundering law and will
prepare for the establishment of a Financial Reporting Centre that meets international
standards. The Financial Reporting Centre will receive, analyze, and disseminate reports
relating to suspicion of money laundering.
24.
Financial sector efficiency will be further enhanced by the divestiture of
government shareholding in state-owned banks. The transfer of ownership to reputable

66

private sector investors would aim to enhance the capital base, facilitate independent
management and provide strategic direction that would lead to improved financial
performance of the bank. To this end, the Cabinet has approved the restructuring of the
National Bank of Kenya (NBK) which will lead to the cleaning up of the bank’s balance
sheet by liquidating the non-performing loan portfolio and strengthening the management
team. Once the modalities for restructuring have been finalized, we intend to go back to
Cabinet for their concurrence with the proposed restructuring plan before the injection of
public funds through non-negotiable bonds. Concurrently, we will also present to Cabinet,
for consideration a number of possible options of selling government and NSSF shares in
NBK. Until the sale of shares is completed, the existing supervisory agreement between the
CBK and NBK will be continued. Under this agreement, NBK’s new lending will be limited
to the amount of its loan recoveries; NBK will seek CBK approval for any single operating
expense exceeding 1 percent of its 2005 operating expenses; and as long as NBK’s
capitalization compliance is dependent on any part of the non-negotiable government
securities it holds as an asset, NBK will be operating under CBK bank supervisory
intervention.
25.
A diagnostic audit of the NSSF will be undertaken. This will provide a basis for
considering options to address the financial and governance challenges facing the NSSF.
D. Public Enterprise and Other Structural Reforms
26.
An acceleration of public enterprise reforms is vital to strengthening economic
growth. The sale of part of government shares in Mumias Sugar Company was completed in
January 2007, and other specific actions already underway include: the restructuring and
preparation for privatization of Telkom and NBK among others; sale of part of government
shares in the Kenya Reinsurance Company and KenGen. Efforts to reach consensus will be
made on how to facilitate private sector participation in port operations, including the
container terminal in Mombasa port, and concessioning of other major utilities and
infrastructure providers. Following the enactment of the Privatization Bill, the immediate
focus will be to obtain Cabinet approval of a subsequent privatization program. A
Privatization Commission will be established and made operational by the end of May 2007.
Performance contracts for commercial public enterprises will be closely monitored and
enforced, and the accounts of the enterprises will be audited and published in a timely
manner. With a view to improving operations of parastatals, we will develop time-bound
restructuring plans for key entities in the agricultural sector such as the sugar companies and
Pyrethrum Board of Kenya. We will also implement the new coffee rules, develop a reform
strategy for development finance institutions, and review the operations of the National
Cereals and Produce Board with a view to coming up with recommendations to strengthen its
financial position and ensure its sustainability. In these areas, we expect to reach policy
understandings under the on-going consultations with the World Bank.

67

27.
Other structural reforms should also help enhance external competitiveness.
Inadequate infrastructure, particularly in the areas of roads, railroads, and electricity, as well
as obstacles to doing business represent major competitiveness hurdles for Kenyan
enterprises. Increased infrastructure spending as well as private operation of some
infrastructure should help alleviate some of these bottlenecks. In addition, our government
will quickly implement recommendations of the task force on legal and administrative
impediments to business activity—in particular by streamlining business licensing
procedures. By end-March 2007, over 700 licenses will have been simplified by merging the
ones that overlap and rationalizing the ones that remain, taking into account safety, the
environment, and health standards. Those licenses found not to serve a useful purpose will be
eliminated in the context of the 2007/08 finance bill. A Business Regulatory Reform Unit has
been established within the Ministry of Finance, and, subsequently, an electronic
consolidated regulatory registry will be established for all valid licenses, including those
introduced by local authorities. We are also moving forward with labor market reforms,
including updating relevant legislation, with a view to strengthening labor market flexibility
and linking more closely wage awards to advances in productivity. With the continuing
reforms in licensing and our intended focus on improving our rating in the World Bank’s
Doing Business indicators, the government plans to further strengthen the business
environment in order to spur the investments necessary for achieving growth envisaged in the
Vision 2030.
28.
Kenya will continue to pursue trade liberalization to enhance efficiency and
strengthen growth prospects. Within the region, our government will implement its EAC
commitments, continue to pursue greater regional economic and social integration, and
advocate for further steps to open up the Community with a view to enhancing competition
and efficiency. The government will also support efforts to bring the Doha Round of
multilateral trade negotiations to a successful conclusion that benefits all countries.
29.
The recent drought has highlighted the need for a stronger response to the
vulnerability of our people who live in marginal areas. Our government responded
quickly to the food emergency in early 2006, and we are now developing strategies to reduce
vulnerabilities on a sustained basis. In addition to on-going drought mitigation initiatives and
development programs in this area, the government will adopt a comprehensive policy for
Sustainable Development of the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands. This is aimed at improving the
livelihood of nomadic pastoralists, by developing alternative income-generating activities. In
addition, we shall work closely with the international community to strengthen timely
response and seek mechanisms to ensure adequate donor support in cases of food
emergencies, and commit to provide, when domestic resources are needed, adequate support
through the budget.

68

E. External Financing
30.
External financing requirements are projected to fall somewhat in 2006/07. Total
external financing requirements in 2004/05, at US$643.5 million, were lower than projected
at the time of the first review under the PRGF arrangement, due in part to the freezing of
payments related to security and other contracts now under investigation. The investigations
are ongoing and we intend to resolve these issues quickly and settle all valid claims. External
financing requirements are expected to fall from US$1,680.4 million in 2005/06 to
US$1,298.0 million in 2006/07, due to somewhat slower import growth, but are expected to
rise in the medium term with both public and private sector investment picking up and
imports again rising strongly. Meeting the projected external financing requirements is
expected to be manageable, as the government’s renewed commitment to strengthen
governance and implement its economic reform agenda is expected to elicit donor support
and sustained private inflows. While the baseline case assumes minimal donor budget
support, it envisages a total of US$607.3 million in bilateral and multilateral grants and
concessional financing for project support.
31.
The government will develop a legal and institutional framework for publicprivate partnerships (PPPs) that takes adequate account of the fiscal risks of such
arrangements, including contingent liabilities. All procurement, including under PPPs,
will continue to be subject to the transparent and competitive procedures established under
the Procurement and Disposal Act.
F. Statistical Issues
32.
Improving the compilation and dissemination of economic data remains a
priority. In line with the new Statistics Law, the government will establish in the course of
2006/07 an autonomous National Bureau of Statistics to replace the Central Bureau of
Statistics. The new Bureau will collect, compile, analyze, and publish statistical information,
and will be guided by explicit provisions for public access and dissemination. The recent
update of the national accounts (based on 1993 SNA) expanded coverage to include export
processing zones, as well as horticulture and informal sectors, and rebased the accounts from
1982 to 2001. Steps are also underway to improve fiscal data, in particular with the
preparation of monthly fiscal summary statistics. In 2006/07, we intend to further improve
data collection and dissemination, including production of quarterly data on GDP and
balance of payments.
G. Extension of the PRGF Arrangement and PRGF Access
33.
The government is requesting a further extension of the PRGF arrangement
through November 20, 2007. In combination with the earlier extensions to provide time to

69

complete the second review, this will extend the current three-year PRGF arrangement by a
full year, and facilitate completion of a third review under the arrangement.
34.
Kenya’s external position has improved significantly since the first review was
completed. The remaining access of SDR 150 million (55.3 percent of quota) is therefore
large in relation to Kenya’s balance of payments need. In view of this, we are requesting a
reduction in remaining access to SDR 75 million, which would equate to the total
disbursements for the second and third reviews as envisaged at the time of the completion of
the first review. This access would be available in two equal disbursements of
SDR 37.5 million.
H. Program Monitoring
35.
Technical memorandum of understanding (TMU). The program will be monitored
using the definitions, data sources, and frequency of monitoring set out in the accompanying
TMU. The government will make available to Fund staff all data appropriately reconciled
and on a timely basis, as specified in the TMU.
36.
Performance criteria and benchmarks. The quantitative performance criteria and
benchmarks to be used in monitoring performance in 2006/07 are provided in Table 4.
Structural performance criteria and benchmarks are identified in Table 3.
37.
Safeguards assessment. Following up on an earlier safeguards assessment, the CBK
remains committed to good governance and best practices. The Bank was subject to a
safeguards assessment by the Fund in the context of the augmentation of access under the
existing PRGF arrangement. The assessment, completed in September 2005, noted that steps
had been taken to implement the recommendations of the earlier safeguards assessments and
proposed measures to address the remaining vulnerabilities. Arrangements are underway to
repeal section 51 (I) of the Central Bank of Kenya Act and replace it with an accounting
policy that continues with the current practice which ensures that dividend distributions
exclude unrealized gains on exchange revaluations.
38.
Program review. The third review under the PRGF arrangement will be completed
no later than November 15, 2007. This review will focus on performance vis-à-vis the
performance criteria and benchmarks described in Tables 3 and 4 in Attachment I of the LOI
as well as implementation of other policies outlined in this memorandum, and specific
additional policy actions, if warranted by new developments.

Figures reflect new arrears incurred since completion of the first PRGF review and outstanding as of the end of the relevant period. Kenya accumulated two types of arrears that are excluded for the purposes of the
program. First, Kenya continued to accumulate arrears on external security-related commercial loans/suppliers' credit contracts; the government is disputing the validity of amounts under the contracts due to
governance concerns related to potentially fraudulent procurements. The contracts are being audited and the government intends to settle all payments that are found to be legitimate. Second, Kenya accumulated a
small amount of arrears due to billing information not being provided by a bilateral creditor. The arrears to the bilateral creditor (slightly less than $7 million) were settled in December 2006.

APPENDIX II—ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
V. INTRODUCTION
39.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Kenyan authorities and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative and
structural performance criteria and benchmarks, as well as the related reporting requirements,
for the program from July 2006 to November 20, 2007 under the three-year arrangement
supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which was approved on
November 21, 2003 and was initially extended to February 28, 2007, and subsequently to
April, 30 2007. A further extension to November 20, 2007 has been requested by the Kenyan
Authorities.
40.
All quantitative targets referred to in this memorandum are cumulative from
July 1, 2006 onward, and the program exchange rates referred to are the rates for June 30,
2006, as published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. Some key rates are
reproduced below:

VI. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
A. Cumulative Change in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK)
41.
Definition. The NFA of the CBK are defined as the difference between the Central
Bank of Kenya (CBK) holdings of gross official reserves (excluding crown agents and
reserve tranche, pledged, swapped, or any encumbered reserves assets, including but not
limited to reserve assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party external liabilities)
and its foreign liabilities (including IMF loans and other short- and long-term liabilities).
Table 4 in Attachment I of the Letter of Intent (LOI), dated March 22, 2007, shows the floors
on NFA, specified in Kenyan shillings, for March 31, 2007 (benchmark) and June 30, 2007
(performance criterion) as well as indicative targets for September 30, 2007 and December
31, 2007. The program exchange rates listed in Paragraph 2 will be used to convert the NFA
into Kenyan shillings at the end of each test period.

75

42.
Adjustment clauses. The NFA floors will be adjusted downward by the sum of
(i) excess in external debt service payments net of rescheduling; and (ii) shortfall in external
budgetary support. Excess and shortfall is defined as the difference between actual and
programmed amounts—the latter are set out in Table 4 in Attachment I of the LOI. The value
of external debt service payments will be converted into Kenyan shillings at the program
exchange rates defined in paragraph 2. The floor for NFA will be adjusted upward by the
sum of (i) the full amount of net foreign exchange proceeds from sales of licenses in the
telecommunications sector1; and (ii) the proceeds of any external sovereign bond issue, both
converted into Kenyan shillings at the program exchange rates.
43.
Adjustor for drought and flood relief expenditure. The NFA floor will also be
adjusted downward by an amount up to the additional government expenditure on drought
and flood relief in excess of the programmed amount of Ksh 3 billion.
44.
Reporting requirements. Data on gross international reserves, encumbered reserves,
and foreign liabilities of the CBK will be transmitted to the Fund on a weekly basis within
five working days of the end of each week. Detailed data on external project-related and nonproject-related budgetary support (by donor/creditor and by currency of denomination) will
be transmitted on a monthly basis within three weeks of the end of each month.
B. Cumulative Change in Reserve Money (RM) of the Central Bank of Kenya
45.
Definition. RM is defined as the sum of total currency outside banks, deposits of the
banking system (excluding deposits of the National Bank of Kenya) with the CBK and total
cash in till. Table 4 in Attachment I of the Letter of Intent shows the ceilings on RM for
March 31, 2007 (benchmark) and June 30, 2007 (performance criterion), as well as indicative
targets for September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2007. There will be consultation with the
IMF staff on any adjustment in the ratio of reserve requirement during the program period.
46.
Reporting requirement. The daily balance sheets of the CBK will be transmitted on
a weekly basis within five working days of the end of each week.

1

Net proceeds in the telecommunication sector is defined as the difference between foreign exchange proceeds
realized from the sale of the second national operator (SNO) licenses and actual government expenditures,
incurred in line with Government financial and procurement regulations, on the underwater fiber optic cable,
which are to be funded from these proceeds.

76

C. Cumulative Change in Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the Central Government
47.
Definition. NDF includes financing by the banking system (the CBK and commercial
banks), non-bank financial institutions, and the non-bank public of the budget of the central
government of Kenya; where the central government is defined as in the Appropriation
Accounts and in the parliament approved budget estimates for 2006/07.2 NDF consists of
treasury bills, government stocks and bonds, promissory notes and other domestic debt
instruments issued by the government, and loans and advances net of government deposits
with the CBK and the banks. For the purposes of the program, NDF excludes privatization
proceeds, the securitization of arrears and government debt issued for any bank restructuring.
NDF is calculated as the sum of (i) loans and advances to the government by the CBK,
including any interest arrears, minus all government deposits with the CBK, from the balance
sheet of the CBK; (ii) loans and advances to the government by the commercial banks,
including any interest arrears, minus all government deposits held with the banks, from the
balance sheet of the commercial banks; and (iii) the changes in the outstanding stock of
treasury bills, government stocks and bonds, promissory notes and other domestic debt
instruments issued by the government, including any interest arrears. Table 4 in Attachment I
of the LOI shows the ceilings on NDF for March 31, 2007 (benchmark) and June 30, 2007
(performance criterion), as well as indicative targets for September 30, 2007 and December
31, 2007.
48.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the sum of
(i) excess in external debt service payments net of rescheduling; (ii) shortfalls in proceeds
from privatization; and (iii) shortfall in proceeds from disbursements of external non-project
related budgetary support. Excess or shortfall is defined as the difference between actual and
programmed amounts. The programmed amounts are set out in Table 4 in Attachment I of
the LOI. The cumulative upward adjustment in NDF for shortfalls in proceeds from
privatization is capped at the equivalent of US$ 140 million, converted into Kenyan shillings
at the program exchange rates. The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted downward by the sum of
net proceeds from sale of licenses in the telecommunication sector, as defined in footnote 1;
and (ii) proceeds from any sovereign bond issue, both converted into Kenyan shillings at the
program exchange rates. As set out in Table 4 in Attachment I of the LOI, the 2006/07
budget assumes external budgetary support of US$ 20 million from the World Bank
retroactive disbursements for drought-related expenditures carried out in 2005/06. In the
event that additional budget support is received in excess of US$ 20 million, it will be spent

in the pro-growth and anti-poverty areas, as set as set out in the MEFP (paragraph 14) and the
Budget Strategy Paper, which reflects the priorities of the Investment Program for the
Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (IP-ERS).
49.
Adjustor for drought and flood relief expenditure. The ceiling on NDF will also
be adjusted upward by the amount of additional drought and flood relief expenditure in
excess of the budgeted amount of KSh 3 billion.
50.
Reporting requirements. Data on NDF of the central government will be submitted
to Fund staff on a monthly basis within three weeks of the end of each month.
D.

New Nonconcessional Medium- and Long-Term External Debt Contracted or
Guaranteed by the General Government and the Central Bank Kenya

51.
Definition. This performance criterion applies both to debt, as defined in point No. 9
of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (see, Decision of the
Executive Directors of the IMF No. 12274-00/85, August 24, 2000) and to commitments
contracted or guaranteed, for which value has not been received. It applies to debt contracted
or guaranteed with original maturities of more than one year by the CBK or the general
government of Kenya (as defined by the 2001 IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual).
It excludes financial obligations to the Fund, domestically issued Kenyan shilling
denominated treasury bonds with maturity greater than a year held by non-residents, and debt
subject to rescheduling and restructuring. The ceiling for new nonconcessional external
medium- and long-term debt will be USD 150 million on a continuous basis throughout the
program period, converted into Kenyan shillings at the program exchange rates. Borrowing
under this ceiling will only be in the form of a benchmark sovereign bond and the proceeds
of this bond will not be used to finance additional expenditures during the program period
(performance criterion). The USD 150 million excludes any new nonconcessional external
debt that is used to settle externally audited outstanding external payment arrears and future
obligations on suppliers’ credits for security-related and other contracts.
52.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it has a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated using currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs)
published by the OECD. For debt with maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year average
CIRR will be used, and for debt with maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average
CIRR will be used.
53.
Reporting requirement. Data on all new debt and guarantees by the CBK and the
general government (including terms of loans and creditors) will be provided to Fund staff on
a monthly basis within three weeks of the end of each month.

78

E. New Nonconcessional Short-Term External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
General Government or the Central Bank of Kenya
54.
Definition. This performance criterion applies both to debt as defined in point No. 9
of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign debt (see Decision
No. 12274–00/85, August 24, 2000) and to commitments contracted or guaranteed, for which
value has not been received. It applies to nonconcessional (see paragraph 14 above) debt with
original maturities of up to and including one year contracted or guaranteed by the CBK or
the general government (as defined by the 2001 IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual)
of Kenya. It excludes financial obligations to the Fund, normal trade-related credits, and
domestically issued Kenyan shilling denominated treasury bills with maturity of less than a
year held by non-residents. The ceiling for new external nonconcessional short-term debt will
be zero on a continuous basis throughout the program period.
55.
Reporting requirement. Data on all new debt and guarantees by the CBK and the
general government (including terms of loans and creditors) will be provided to the Fund
staff on a monthly basis within three weeks of the end of each month.
F. Accumulation of Domestic Budgetary Arrears
56.
Definition. Domestic budgetary arrears are defined as the sum of all due and unpaid
obligations of the central government of Kenya, where the central government is defined as
in the Appropriation Accounts and in the Parliament approved budget estimates for 2006/07,
including, but not limited to, payment obligations from procurement contracts for goods and
services and other contracts providing for payment in domestic currency, as well as statutory
obligations for payment (e.g., of domestic debt, domestic interest, wages and salaries, and
other entitlements). Changes in domestic budgetary arrears are defined as the stock of
outstanding domestic arrears on the test date minus the stock of outstanding domestic arrears
as of June 30, 2006. Under the program, the non-accumulation of new domestic budgetary
arrears is a continuous performance criterion throughout the program period.
57.
Reporting requirement. Detailed data on repayment and new accumulation of
domestic budgetary arrears and the remaining previous-year stock of domestic budgetary
arrears will be transmitted to the Fund staff on a monthly basis within three weeks of the end
of each month.
G. Accumulation of External Payments Arrears
58.
Definition. External payments arrears are defined as the non-payment of external
obligations of the CBK or the general government of Kenya (general government as defined
by the 2001 IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual) both with regard to principal and
interest that are valid and due, but shall exclude arrears on obligations that are subject to

79

rescheduling or restructuring, including arrears on suppliers’ credits for security-related and
other contracts that have been disputed by the Kenyan authorities. Under the program, the
nonaccumulation of new external payments arrears is a continuous performance criterion
throughout the program period.
59.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was
subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the augmentation of access under the
existing PRGF arrangement approved on December 20, 2004. The assessment, completed on
September 8, 2005, noted that the CBK has taken steps to implement the recommendations of
the earlier safeguards assessments and proposed measures to address the remaining
vulnerabilities.

Exchange Arrangements

The currency of Kenya is the Kenya shilling. Kenya has adopted a unitary exchange rate
structure in which the exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The official
exchange rate, which is set at the previous day’s average market rate, applies only to
government and government-guaranteed external debt-service payments and to government
imports for which there is a specific budget allocation. The exchange rate regime is a
managed float, in which the U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. Kenya
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for international current transactions. On March 6, 2007, the exchange rate was
K Sh 69.4=US$1.00

APPENDIX II—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of March 5, 2007)
Kenya’s development strategy is set forth in the Investment Programme for the Economic
Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (IP-ERS), endorsed by the Boards
of the IMF and the World Bank in May 2004. The IP-ERS provides a common framework
for Bank-IMF support to Kenya’s development efforts in the medium term. The government
also launched the preparation of Vision 2030 in October 2006, which highlights Kenya’s
aspiration to achieve the status of a middle-income country by 2030.
Development strategy and Vision 2030. In supporting Kenya’s development strategy and
the development of its Vision 2030, the IMF leads the dialogue on monetary matters and
coordinates with the Bank on macro-fiscal issues and reforms in the areas of public
expenditure management, governance, financial sector, revenue administration, trade, public
enterprises, and the public wage bill. The Bank takes the lead on monitoring progress on
implementation of the IP-ERS, dialogue and lending in the areas of infrastructure, human
development, private sector development, rural development, and reforms of the civil
service. In non-lending work, the Bank takes the lead on growth and poverty analysis, and
sectoral work in the areas of Bank’s lead, while the two institutions coordinate on trade, labor
markets, macro-fiscal work, poverty and social impact analysis, and debt sustainability
analysis.
Bank Group Strategy
A Country Assistance Strategy of reengagement for fiscal 2004–07 was endorsed by the
World Bank Board on June 17, 2004. The Bank’s strategy was formulated to promote in a
carefully sequenced program of growth and poverty reduction. At mid-course, the Bank has
prepared a Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CAS PR) (to be discussed by its
Board on March 27, 2007). The CAS PR discusses key accomplishments over the last three
years, including improved macroeconomic management and growth recovery. It documents
challenges such as high income inequality and inequitable access to services, and mixed
progress on corruption and some structural reforms. In an environment where governance
challenges are paramount, it also strives to maintain the balance between dealing effectively
with governance and corruption, and continuing to provide vital assistance to the poor.
Enhanced focus on equity. Reflecting greater attention to equity, the Bank’s support
program more directly targets the poorest people (with continuing attention to the drivers of
overall growth). In this regard, analytic work such as the ongoing joint poverty assessment
will help the government improve the targeting and use of public resources. Lending will
target some poverty hotspots, such as Western Kenya, Nyanza Province, and urban and
periurban slums, where about 70 percent of poor Kenyans live. New programs will provide

8

financial and technical resources for poor communities and entrepreneurs to provide
economic services and create employment.
Enhanced focus on governance. In supporting the government’s Governance Strategy for
Building a Prosperous Kenya (GSPK) and Governance Action Plan (GAP), the Bank will
focus on transparency initiatives (including transparency in the judiciary, and capacity
building in the prosecutorial and judicial services); broadening stakeholder involvement,
including additional private participation in infrastructure services such as the ports;
accelerating public financial management reforms; and improving governance in highpriority sectors—education, HIV/AIDS, health, and roads. Analytic work in such areas as
media development, parliamentary and judicial capacity, and police oversight mechanisms
will help lay the foundation for the development and governance agenda beyond this
GSPK/GAP and for the next CAS.
Continued attention to accelerated economic growth and improved public sector
management. A major economic study being carried out by the Bank focuses on how Kenya
will raise and sustain growth rates from about 6 percent currently to 10 percent as part of its
economic, social, and political vision to become a middle income country by the year 2030.
This is a multi-sectoral work covering macro-fiscal, infrastructure, trade, human
development, and financial sector issues, and is being carried out in close collaboration with
the government. Meanwhile, the current IP-ERS’s high priority to budgetary and public
expenditure reforms is expected to continue. This priority area of work is being informed by
a Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment which the Bank prepared in 2005 in close
collaboration with the government and other partners to help strengthen budget preparation
and execution, strategic resource allocation, procurement, and financial management.
Public sector institutional strengthening. An Institutional Reform and Capacity Building
(Technical Assistance) Project is helping the government strengthen capacity for budget
formulation and execution, public financial management, internal and external auditing,
revenue collection and management, and development of improved procurement practices.
To increase accountability of the administration to citizens, the project is strengthening
parliamentary committees to enable them to fulfill their oversight role. The project will also
build the capacity of key ministries to define, measure, and deliver results by supporting the
establishment of a system of results-based management, by building capacity for monitoring
and evaluation, and by strengthening mechanisms for citizen feedback. To enhance the
capacity of the Central Bureau of Statistics and other agencies, the Bank has prepared a
Statistical Capacity-Building Project (StatCap) scheduled for Board presentation in March
2007. In addition, the Bank is helping to build capacity for monitoring and evaluation
through a grant from the Institutional Development Fund.

9

Poverty reduction. In addition to supporting growth, the Bank is also targeting its support to
some of Kenya’s poorest communities. The Bank is in the process of preparing a poverty
assessment in close collaboration of the government and other donors based on the recently
concluded Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey. The Arid Lands Resource
Management Project Phase Two, effective in September 2003, is using a multisectoral,
district based, community driven development approach to reduce poverty in the arid and
semiarid districts of Kenya. In August 2006, the World Bank approved a US$60 million
additional financing credit for emergency drought interventions in Kenya’s arid and semiarid lands. The credit will be implemented under the Arid Lands Resource Management
Project (ALRMP) II. The additional financing operation would help finance the costs
associated with: (a) scaling up both geographically and substantively the successful drought
management and long term livelihood activities of the Arid Lands project in 28 districts;
(b) reimbursing eligible and audited non-food expenditures associated with the severe
drought which has affected the arid and semi-arid districts of Kenya over the last year; and
(c) scaling up the drought contingency fund which is operating under the current credit and
has been depleted due to the extended nature of the drought. The Executive Board of the
World Bank will consider a new operation, the Western Kenya Community Driven
Development and Flood Mitigation, late in March 2007. The objective of the proposed
project is to empower local communities of men and women to engage in sustainable and
wealth creating livelihood activities and reduce their vulnerability to flooding. Progress
towards achieving the project development objectives will be monitored through such
indicators as: (a) the number of men and women actively participating in decision making at
community and district levels; (b) percent of community and youth investment projects rated
satisfactory or better by participating communities; (c) percentage increase in real income of
households in project intervention areas; and (d) percentage reduction of financial cost
induced by average annual flooding in the Budalangi flood plain.
Sustainable development. The Bank is supporting measures to increase agricultural
productivity and competitiveness through lending and analytical work. The Agricultural
Productivity Project, which became effective in October 2004, is assisting the transformation
of Kenya’s research and extension system to a more demand driven, farmer-led and
pluralistic system, while supporting associated policy reforms. In addressing the challenges
of natural resource management, the Executive Board of the World Bank is expected to
consider a new operation, the Natural Resource Management Project, late in March 2007.
The objectives of the project are to enhance the institutional capacity to manage water and
forest resources, reduce the incidence and severity of water shocks in river catchments, and
improve the livelihoods of communities participating in the co-management of water and
forests. Achievements under the project will be measured by indicators tracking changes in
organizations and their performance, in the health of the natural resource base, and in welfare
of participating communities. Meanwhile, the ongoing multicountry GEF-supported Lake
Victoria Environmental Project is helping to establish institutions for the sustainable

10

management of the lake and its catchment area. The GEF-supported Western Kenya
Integrated Ecosystem Management Project seeks to improve management of soils, water, and
biodiversity, while raising the productivity of agriculture. The GEF-supported Wildlife
Conservation Leasing Demonstration Project, approved recently on August 2006, seeks to
motivate and enable landowners to maintain wildlife habitat on their land.
Education and health. In education, the Bank is supporting the government’s strategy
through the ongoing Free Primary Education Support Project. The government is
implementing a SWAp, approved by the Bank Board in November 2006, designed to: ensure
equity of access to basic education; enhance quality and learning achievement; provide
opportunities for further education and training; and strengthen education sector management
and governance. This will support the entire sector, but with an initial focus on primary
education and the development of acceptable strategies for the other subsectors of the
education system. This will lay the groundwork for future support to the sector through
SWAps or poverty reduction support credits. The grant-financed Global Development
Learning Network project effective in February 2004 is helping to develop enhanced
mechanisms of learning and knowledge-sharing among policy makers. In health, the Bank is
supporting the government’s strategy through the ongoing Decentralized AIDS and
Reproductive Health (DARE) Project, which seeks to improve mother and child health
through more integrated delivery of child survival, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS
services. The Bank has continued to work in collaboration with development partners on the
design of a health sector SWAp following recent government and Bank review which
confirmed concerns about corruption risks. The Bank and the Government of Kenya have
agreed to undertake the following steps to strengthen governance in the health sector:
(a) improving procurement practices, including publishing on websites information on all
contracts; (b) establishing a transparent vetting system to pre-qualify companies doing
business with the MOH to address conflict of interest and fraudulent companies;
(c) blacklisting companies found to have been involved in corruption; (d) rolling out and
using IFMIS in the MOH; (e) establishing a functional risk-based internal audit system, with
the MOH ministerial audit committees providing oversight effectively; and (f) developing a
community-based system for managing and financing local-level health facilities, using the
Ministry of Education's successful textbook program as a model.
HIV/AIDS. The Bank has been supporting the government’s program to control HIV/AIDS.
Kenya was the first country to access funds under the Africa Region’s Multi-Country AIDS
Program (MAP) through the Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Emergency Project. The
KHADREP closed at the end of 2005, and a new project (The Total War on AIDS Project TOWA) is being designed to support implementation of the Kenya National AIDS Strategic
Plan for 2005–2010. This focuses on governance and accountability strengthening, the
coordination of the national program following confirmation by government and Bank
reviews of corruption in KHADREP, and the provision of grants to implementing agencies

11

(including local communities and the private sector) to reach vulnerable groups. Through the
TOWA and following progress in addressing governance and anticorruption issues in
HIV/AIDS, the Bank would support the National AIDS Control Council and its provincial,
district, and local-level bodies, as well as selected line ministries in the mainstreaming of
HIV/AIDS-related activities. The TOWA is expected to be presented for Board consideration
by June 2007. As noted above, the medical response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be
integrated into the Health SWAP.
Privatization and private sector participation. The Bank group is supporting several
initiatives aimed at promoting private sector participation in the economy. The IFC was the
transaction adviser for concessioning the Kenya Railways jointly with Uganda Railways,
established in October 2006. The Energy Sector Recovery Project is supporting the reform of
the Kenya Power and Light Company whose management was transferred to a private
company in July 2006. IFC is also involved as a transaction adviser for the restructuring of
Telkom Kenya Limited. All these actions should lead to an enhanced role for the private
sector in managing these key utilities.
Private sector development. The investment climate assessment of 2003/04 and the Kenya
Growth and Competitiveness study have provided a greater understanding of the obstacles to
private sector development in Kenya and the policies needed to address them. The Bank and
IFC are supporting implementation of their recommendations, including a far-reaching
reform of Kenya’s licensing regime that will result in the elimination of numerous
unnecessary licenses. An update of the investment climate assessment is planned for June
2007. A joint Bank- and IFC-supported Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Project aims to
increase MSME’s access to finance and to business development services. A three-year IFCsupported pilot Small and Medium Enterprises Solutions Center, which started operations in
Kenya in March 2005, will help MSMEs access financial resources, information, and advice
through a single integrated service center. The IFC-supported multidonor Private Enterprise
Partnership for Africa will facilitate small firms’ access to financial and business services.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Authority is supporting private sector development
through international comparisons of competitiveness, through the provision of technical
assistance and capacity building services to the country’s investment promotion
intermediaries, and through the offer of political risk guarantees to foreign investors entering
the country.
Regional integration and improvement of trade environment are priorities of the
government. In 2005, Kenya launched a customs union with Tanzania and Uganda in the
context of the East African Community (EAC), which includes a common external tariff.
Kenya is also actively involved in negotiations and activities of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa, and in negotiations of economic partnership agreements with
the European Union. A trade report focusing on behind the border supply-side constraints

12

was prepared by the Bank in 2006 and is being used in the implementation of Private Sector
Development Strategy of the government.
Infrastructure development. The IP-ERS recognizes the lack of adequate physical
infrastructure as a major impediment to private sector development in Kenya. The Bank is
supporting the government’s investment program through the Northern Corridor Transport
Improvement Project, which is financing the reconstruction of the road network that links
Kenya with Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project
is also helping to upgrade Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to improve
passenger facilities and airport security. The joint concessioning of Kenya’s and Uganda’s
railways is expected to be a major catalyst to regional integration and growth. The grantfinanced Nairobi Water and Sewerage Institutional Restructuring Project, which became
effective in September 2004, aims at building a strong institutional and governance
framework that will promote efficient and sustainable delivery of water and sewerage
services in Nairobi. The EAC Regional Trade and Transport Facilitation Project is supporting
railway concessioning and customs reform at the Mombasa port. In the context of growth
analytical work, the Bank is supporting a review of roads portfolio with a view to improve
implementation of road projects and ensuring good economic rationale in selection of
projects.
Transparency and communications infrastructure. The government has been pursuing an
ambitious program of ICT reforms. Liberalization of the international voice/data market was
achieved with the award of more than eighteen international gateway licenses over the last 14
months, including for the two mobile network operators. Consequently, tariffs have fallen by
over 50 percent and critical local market innovations are taking place (for example, Celtel
launched in October 2006 a seamless local service across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania). In
late 2006, the Second National Operator license was awarded competitively for US$169.7
million. Telkom Kenya (TKL), currently a state-owned monopoly, is being restructured in
preparation for privatization. As part of the larger program to realize its ICT vision, the
government is seeking to create an enabling environment for achieving the following specific
goals: (a) tripling the number of telephone lines from 7.5 million to 23 million in three years;
(b) increasing the number of Internet users from 1.25 million to 5 million in three years;
(c) establishing at least one digital village or e-centre in each constituency within this year;
(d) ensuring that every school in Kenya has access to ICT resources by the end of the year;
and (e) providing e-government services at district and constituency level. Through a
Transparency and Communications Infrastructure Project, the Bank is supporting
investments in three areas—the enabling institutional and regulatory environment,
connectivity, and transparency—including e-government applications.
Financial sector development. The IP-ERS identifies the urgent need to reform the financial
sector in Kenya, which is beset with a relatively high level of nonperforming loans and wide

13

interest rate spreads, and operates within a weak legal and judicial system. To support the
government’s reform agenda, the Bank and the IMF conducted a joint Financial Sector
Assessment Program in 2004 that highlighted the vulnerabilities of the financial sector. A
Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Credit that was approved by the Bank’s
Board in October 2004 is supporting the development of financial and legal sector strategies,
the strengthening of financial and legal sector regulations and institutions, and the
establishment of a bank restructuring and privatization project within the Ministry of Finance
that will guide the process of divesting the state’s holdings in banks.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship in supporting
structural reforms in Kenya through lending, analytic work, and technical assistance.
Joint assessment of the IP-ERS progress report. The staffs of the Bank and the IMF have
jointly prepared the staff advisory note on Kenya’s Annual Progress Reports of the IP-ERS.
This document will be distributed to the Boards of the Bank and the IMF for information.
Macroeconomic work. The IMF leads the analysis and dialogue on monetary issues such as
monetary policy, inflation target, nominal exchange rate management, and central bank
operations. The Bank coordinates with the IMF on issues related to fiscal policy, debt
sustainability, real exchange rate, public sector management etc. and takes the lead on growth
and real sector issues. The teams are currently consulting on the growth analytic work being
carried out by the Bank in the context of Vision 2030.
Budgetary and public expenditure reforms. The Bank and IMF work closely to support
government efforts in budgetary and public expenditure reforms. The Bank leads the
dialogue on planning, the preparation of the medium-term expenditure framework, strategic
resource allocation (particularly aligning budgetary allocations with the priorities laid out in

15

the IP-ERS), expenditure restructuring, enhanced stakeholder participation, and issues related
to efficiency of public spending, such as expenditure tracking. A joint Bank-IMF Public
Expenditure Management Assessment and Action Plan was completed in May 2004. The
Bank, the IMF, and other development partners have used the public financial management
performance measurement framework developed by the Public Expenditure Financial
Assessment (PEFA) secretariat to monitor progress in Kenya’s in public financial
management. This will form part of the strengthened approach to support reforms of public
financial management. The Bank and the IMF collaborate on issues related to internal audit
reform and on the integrated financial management information system.
Strengthening revenue collection and administration. The Bank and the Fund have
recently carried out detailed assessments of customs operations and tax administration
respectively. The Fund has been providing technical assistance to the Kenya Revenue
Authority. The Bank assisted the customs department in carrying out a time release study of
clearing containers through customs. The Fund (through AFRITAC) and the Bank
collaborated closely in supporting the Kenya Revenue Authority to prepare a reform and
modernization plan. The Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Technical Assistance
Project will finance capacity building of the Kenya Revenue Authority. The EAC Regional
Trade and Transport Facilitation Project is supporting reform of customs.
Debt management and debt sustainability analysis. The IMF prepared an external debt
sustainability analysis in December 2003, which it updated in December 2004. The Bank
and Fund are preparing a joint debt sustainability analysis covering both external and
domestic public debt. In the context of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, a joint
World Bank/IMF initiative is being undertaken to support capacity-building in the area of
sovereign debt management and domestic debt market development.
Governance reforms. Governance reforms are a key element of the government’s strategy
to promote economic growth and reduce poverty. The Fund’s PRGF supports a deepening of
anticorruption measures. The Bank and the IMF coordinate closely on approach to
governance matters in Kenya. They jointly participate in the anticorruption donor group,
which is monitoring the implementation of the government’s anticorruption action plan. IMF
staff also participated in the Governance Missions in June/July 2006 and February 2007.
Financial sector reforms. The IMF and Bank are collaborating on financial sector reforms.
They have conducted a joint in-depth assessment of the financial sector (banking, insurance,
and capital markets) through the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Privatization and private sector development. The dialogue on privatization and
regulatory reforms is led by the Bank, and the IMF is a partner in this policy dialogue,
particularly on issues of the fiscal implications of parastatal reforms.

16

Regional integration and trade reforms. The IMF and the Bank both provided advice on
the implementation of the common external tariff, and the Bank is providing technical advice
on regional integration issues. The Bank has finalized a regional assessment of nonfiscal
investment incentives in each of the three states of the EAC, complementing an earlier IMF
report that advises on the harmonization of incentives in the context of the customs union.
The Bank is implementing a Regional Trade Facilitation Project aimed at providing politicalrisk and export insurance for cross-border trade between participating countries. The Bank
together with the African Development Bank is implementing the EAC Regional Transport
and Trade Facilitation Project. This project includes support for implementation of the
customs union, and institutional and investment support to facilitate transport in the region.
The Bank with the Africa Development Bank has prepared a regional integration assistance
strategy that will set out priorities for regional interventions in East Africa.
Prepared by World Bank staff. Questions may be addressed to Colin Bruce,
Country Director, Kenya, at 5368+3441, or Praveen Kumar, Country
Economist, at X-36347.

17
APPENDIX III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality and timeliness of Kenya’s economic and financial data are broadly adequate for
surveillance and program monitoring. Weaknesses in macroeconomic statistics reflect
managerial and organizational shortcomings, and inadequate resources provided to the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). In line with the new Statistics Law, the government plans
to establish an autonomous National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to replace the CBS during
the fiscal year 2006/07.
1.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module (IMF Country
Report No. 05/388) published on October 31, 2005 stated that methodological soundness is
uneven across datasets and significant improvement is required in government finance
statistics and national accounts. Accuracy and reliability do not receive adequate attention in
any of the datasets, while accessibility of the disseminated macroeconomic statistics are
adequate, except for the balance of payments statistics.
2.
Kenya participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and
the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. Metadata and detailed plans for improving the
data over the short and medium term have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Kenya received Fund technical assistance in this regard,
and further assessment of capacity building requirements has been undertaken by the
AFRITAC East Statistical Advisor.
3.
Monetary, exchange rate, and some external data are published on a monthly and
biannual basis by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in its Monthly Economic Review. Core
financial data are also made available to the Fund on a regular basis. A detailed account of
various sectoral activities and the corresponding statistical data are published annually by the
CBS in its Economic Survey.
National accounts
4.
Data quality, which was previously reported as good, has deteriorated significantly
because of budgetary and staff constraints at the CBS. GDP is believed to be significantly
underestimated, as important and increasing parts of the economy, such as the informal
sector, nonagriculture subsistence, horticulture, and self-employed professionals are not
properly covered. An STA peripatetic advisor assisted the authorities in rebasing the national
accounts estimates at constant 2001 prices and compiling institutional accounts for the
general government sector. National accounts estimates for the years 1996–2005 in current
and constant (2001) prices) have been published.
Prices and production
6.
In early 2002, the CBS began publication of a new national CPI (covering 13 urban
towns), with 1997 as reference year and outdated weights and basket of items derived from
the 1993-94 Household Budget Survey (HBS). Indices are produced for lower and

18
middle/upper income groups and Nairobi and other cities. The index is compiled and
published on a timely basis. No producer, export, or import price indices are produced.
Government finance statistics (GFS)
7.
The data ROSC mission emphasized a number of key areas in GFS compilation that
should be improved, including: (i) migration to the GFSM 2001 methodology;
(ii) broadening the coverage to include extrabudgetary and social security funds and report
on a general government level; (iii) reconciliation of fiscal statistics from various sources to
limit discrepancies; (iv) improve information on external financing, particularly on
expenditure directly financed from abroad; (v) compilation and dissemination of monthly and
quarterly budget execution data; and (vi) training of Ministry of Finance (MOF) staff in the
GFS methodology.
8.
Since the beginning of FY 2005/06, Kenya has followed a new economic
classification of the budget based on GFSM 2001 (with assistance from the AFRITAC-East).
However, serious delays have emerged in reporting, reflecting difficulties in establishing
budget execution and accounting systems consistent with the new classification. To ensure
timely reconciliation and monitoring of budget execution, the existing systems would need to
be promptly upgraded and made operational. Some progress has been made toward moving
to the IFMIS. There are still important gaps in ensuring proper reconciliation of fiscal data
from different sources, including from various units within the MOF. The discrepancies in
budget outturn data (between deficit/surplus and financing) remain significant, and the
recording of external financing and expenditure directly financed from abroad is still an
important area for improvement. The government has taken some steps to initiate a project to
rationalize/eliminate extrabudgetary funds, but the progress in compiling consolidated fiscal
statistics has remained limited.
9.
Kenya reports data to STA for the budgetary central government for inclusion in the
GFS Yearbook, albeit with a significant lag—the last data reported were for the year ending
June 2004. The CBS compiles the aggregate annual GFS revenue and expenditure data for
the budgetary central government based on detailed data in the reports of the Controller and
Auditor General. Kenya’s submission for publication in the 2006 GFS Yearbook was
reported in GFSM 2001 format, using bridge tables developed by the technical assistance
missions. The recent steps taken in the migration to GFSM 2001 may help reduce the
significant differences between CBS data and the data compiled by the MOF and reported to
AFR for surveillance and program monitoring purposes. Kenya also reports regularly
monthly and quarterly data for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics
10.
The CBK has a delay in the implementation of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual and development of the standardized report forms (SRFs). The authorities submitted

19
SRF test data; however, there has not been further progress. In March 2007, a STA mission
established the standardized report form for the data on the central bank; reviewed and revised
the reporting form and compilation notes for the other depository corporations (ODCs) in line
with MFSM data requirements; and identified the coverage of the ODC subsector. The
mission found misclassification of a number of central government deposits as private sector
deposits. A major issue for future work relates to the expansion of the coverage of the ODCs
to include the Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOS). As of end-March, 2007, there
were 3,800 SACCOs, accounting for about 30 percent of the total deposits of the banking
system. A follow-up mission is planned for mid-2007.
External sector statistics
The CBS compiles annual balance of payments statistics in Kenya shillings that are regularly
reported to STA, although with considerable delay. In addition, the CBK compiles a complete
set of annual balance of payments statistics in U.S. dollars, which are reported to AFR and
used for programming and surveillance purposes. The two datasets are not entirely consistent,
and Fund staff has strongly encouraged the authorities to reconcile them. More recently, the
CBK also started to compile and publish quarterly balance of payments estimates.
Although the overall quality of trade data may be reasonably good, data for other current
account and many financial account transactions are rather weak. Following the liberalization
of the exchange system in 1993–94, gaps emerged in coverage. The compilation system (other
than that used for compiling customs statistics), used since 1994, relies on reports from
domestic banks and may result in a substantial under recording of current earnings, including
tourism receipts; investment flows of the private sector; as well as transactions that are settled
via accounts held abroad.
Present estimates of direct and portfolio investment are believed to be substantially
understated. The large positive errors and omissions in the central bank data that have
emerged in the balance of payments since 1994 raise concerns as to the potential size of
external obligations. The MOF compiles data covering public and publicly guaranteed
external debt obligations to official and commercial creditors. This database does not take into
account nonresident purchases of the government’s domestic currency-denominated debt
securities. In developing the loan-by-loan debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in 2002, Fund
and World Bank staff identified several significant debt data problems that have been
addressed by the authorities. Nevertheless, significant debt data management problems
remain, along with more general issues in the area of external debt management and its
integration in the budget formulation and expenditure management systems.
To help address these issues, the January-February 2006 technical assistance mission
recommended introducing a foreign investment survey, enhancing the foreign exchange
statistics survey, and using a common methodology, including for estimations, in the use of
available data in the CBS and CBK.

KENYA
2006 Article IV Consultation and Second Review
Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility, and Requests for Extension and Rephasing of the Arrangement, Reduction in
Access, and Waiver of Performance Criteria—Supplementary Information, Revised
Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies

Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Anthony R. Boote
April 6, 2007
1.
This supplement is being issued to reflect the request by the Kenyan authorities
for a waiver of nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on the
nonaccumulation of external payments arrears under the PRGF arrangement.
2.
Kenya accumulated new external payments arrears of €182,000 to a bilateral
Paris Club creditor in January 2005.1 The existence of these arrears came to light during
the course of a detailed review of debt payments data for the Managing Director's report on a
noncomplying disbursement. Staff has concluded that the accumulation of these arrears
represents a nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on the nonaccumulation
of external payments arrears.
3.
The staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of nonobservance of the
continuous performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external payments
arrears. Kenya’s accumulation of a small amount of new external payments arrears after the
first review reflects previous weaknesses in its debt management system, but the authorities
cleared the arrears in full in January 2005 shortly after missing the payment date and have

1

As noted in MEFP Table 2: Outcomes on Quantitative Performance Criteria and Benchmarks Under the
Program for 2004/05, two types of arrears are excluded for the purposes of the program: 1) arrears on external
commercial loans/suppliers’ credits whose validity is being disputed by the authorities and 2) arrears
accumulated due to billing information not being provided by a bilateral creditor, which have since been
cleared.

2
undertaken reforms to strengthen debt management. The Government has been implementing
external debt management reforms with support from the World Bank/DFID under the
Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Program (FLSTAP). Since 2005, Kenya’s
external debt database has been updated; records have been validated; back office functions
have been consolidated and business procedures formalized; staff were added to the Debt
Management Department and capacity building programs have been scaled up; and a loan
files registry has been established with arrangements for automated record keeping. The
authorities report significant improvements due to these measures: external debt service
obligations are being settled on schedule and debt data are being reported more quickly and
accurately.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Kenya
April 11, 2007
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report
for the 2006 Article IV consultation and second review of the three-year arrangement under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (www.imf.org). The thrust of the staff appraisal
remains unchanged.
2.
Quantitative Benchmarks. Preliminary information indicates that the quantitative
benchmarks on net foreign assets, reserve money and net domestic financing of the central
government for end-March 2007 were met by comfortable margins.
3.
Inflation. Consumer price inflation declined to 5.9 percent (year-on-year) in
March 2007 from 6.8 percent in February. This decline was due to lower food price inflation,
which primarily reflected the unwinding of earlier drought-related food price increases.
Excluding food prices, the twelve-month inflation rate was unchanged in March at
6.1 percent.

Press Release No. 07/66
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 11, 2007

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under the PRGF Arrangement for
Kenya and Approves US$ 56.8 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Kenya's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the release of an
amount equivalent to SDR 37.5 million (about US$56.8 million), bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 112.5 million (about US$170.4 million).
In completing the review, the Board approved waivers for the nonobservance of five
performance criteria. These included two quantitative performance criteria, one on reserve
money and one on the accumulation of new external payments arrears; and three structural
performance criteria, one against the imposition of controls on banks’ fees and charges, one
on the issuance of new guidelines for wage arbitration by the Industrial Court, and one on
completion of the asset declaration of ministers, permanent secretaries, and heads of state
bodies.
The Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for an extension of the
arrangement to November 20, 2007. Consistent with the improvement in Kenya’s external
position, the Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for a reduction in access
by SDR 75 million, and rephasing of remaining disbursements under the arrangement,
bringing the total amount available under the arrangement to SDR 150 million.
The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on November 21, 2003
(see Press Release No. 03/201), in an amount equivalent to SDR 175 million. On December
20, 2004, the Executive Board approved an augmentation of access under the PRGF
arrangement by SDR 50 million (see Press Release No. 04/270). The arrangement was
subsequently extended to April 30, 2007 to allow time to complete the second review (see
Press Release No. 07/37).

2
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murillo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Chair, said:
“Kenya’s macroeconomic performance has improved markedly since 2004. The authorities
are to be commended for their prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which
have helped contain domestic debt, increase international reserves, and strengthen the
financial sector.
“Going forward, sustaining strong growth and macroeconomic stability will require
continued fiscal discipline to further reduce domestic debt, while increasing priority spending
on infrastructure and poverty reduction. To this end, untapped external concessional
resources should be explored, revenue efforts enhanced, and public expenditure management
strengthened. Priority reforms include operationalizing the Integrated Financial Management
Information System in key ministries and making the Public Procurement Oversight
Authority fully functional. An appropriate legal and institutional framework for Public
Private-Partnerships should be put in place to minimize related fiscal risks.
“Financial sector reforms need to be accelerated to safeguard macroeconomic and financial
stability. Recent efforts to allow greater interest rate flexibility and the enactment of the
Banking Amendment Bill are welcome steps, but further reforms are needed, including
divesting shareholdings in state-influenced financial institutions, expediting the passage of
the Anti-Money Laundering Bill, amending the Banking Act to align Kenya’s legal and
regulatory framework with best international practices, and developing a financial sector
reform strategy.
“The managed float exchange rate regime in conjunction with reserve money targeting has
served Kenya well. However, maintaining competitiveness would require faster structural
reforms and infrastructure improvements. Reserve money targets would need to be tightened
in the months ahead to safeguard macroeconomic stability.
“While recent governance reforms have strengthened institutions and increased transparency,
including in the procurement process, the legislative agenda on governance is unfinished and
more progress has to be made in the investigation and prosecution of prominent corruption
cases. Forceful implementation of the Governance Action Plan for Building a Prosperous
Kenya will be crucial to improve governance and root out corruption.
“The Executive Board noted the Kenyan authorities’ failure to ensure the accuracy of
information provided to the Board on nonconcessional borrowing and external payments
arrears, which resulted in a noncomplying disbursement following the conclusion of the first
review under the PRGF arrangement in December 2004. The Board took note of the
authorities’ explanation for the provision of inaccurate information. In view of the prompt
corrective actions taken to improve debt management practices, and the authorities’
commitment to the objectives of the program, the Executive Board decided to waive the two
incidents of nonobservance of the continuous performance criteria that gave rise to the
noncomplying disbursement,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Kenya and Rachel Gesami,
Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 11, 2007

Introduction
1.
The Kenyan authorities thank the mission team for the extensive consultation and
constructive dialogue during recent Fund Missions and for the comprehensive assessment
and valuable suggestions on Kenya’s economic development, and the implementation of the
reform program. The authorities welcome the well written and balanced staff report on the
2006 Article IV Consultation and Second Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement of the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF); and request the Extension and Rephasing of
the Arrangement (to November 20, 2007), a Reduction in Access, and a Waiver of
Performance Criteria.
2.
The Kenya Vision 2030 program launched recently, calls for a sustained increase in
GDP growth to an average 10 percent per annum, with a view to making Kenya a middleincome country by the year 2030. As a step in this direction, a medium-term strategy that
builds on the Economic Recovery Strategy is being developed for the period 2008-12 aimed
at accelerating growth, maintaining macroeconomic stability, reducing poverty, improving
equity and strengthening institutions of governance.
Performance under the PRGF Arrangement
3.
The authorities are committed to the implementation of the vision and the strategy.
However, the fact that the current PRGF program was burdened by the introduction of
numerous new prior actions in the middle of the program, causing significant delays, has
been of concern. Nevertheless, the authorities did not allow the delayed PRGF program to
reduce their resolve and determination to improve competitiveness, accelerate growth and
reduce poverty. They have instead pursued their reform program vigorously and steadfastly,
with impressive results. Despite the difficulties posed by additional conditions and
exacerbated by exogenous shocks, notable progress has been made in the main components
of the authorities’ reform agenda. This includes improvements in tackling governance
weaknesses, strengthened fiscal policy for stability and growth, enhanced public financial
management, actions to strengthen the financial sector, as well as progress in productive
sector reform, public enterprise reform, and the privatization program. My authorities have
therefore demonstrated their commitment to reducing poverty and establishing a
macroeconomic and institutional framework that is conducive to accelerating growth.
4.
Program implementation, supported by the PRGF arrangement remained broadly on
track in 2005/06 although five out of the thirteen performance criteria for 2004/05 were not

2
met. The end-March 2005 quantitative performance criterion on the reserve money of the
Central Bank of Kenya was also missed, as was the continuous criterion on non accumulation
of external payments arrears. The structural performance criteria on non-imposition of
controls on banks' fees and charges (Section 44 of the Banking Act) and the issuance of new
guidelines for wage arbitration by the Industrial Court, were also missed as was the structural
performance criterion requiring that the declaration of assets by ministers, permanent
secretaries, and heads of state bodies be completed.
5.
My authorities have, however, taken decisive remedial actions to address these
slippages. Among other things, they have developed modalities for implementing Section
44 of the Banking Act that are broadly consistent with the original program objectives. They
have cleared a small amount of bilateral external arrears, and taken steps to improve debt
management practices. Furthermore, they have begun an audit of external commercial
contracts on which payments were suspended due to governance concerns. In addition to this,
the Industrial Court issued new guidelines for wage arbitration in November 2005, and the
verification of asset declarations of ministers and senior officials is continuing.
6.
Given the good performance record achieved under difficult circumstances, and the
continued commitment to successful program implementation, the authorities request the
completion of the Second Review of the PRGF-supported program and the approval of the
associated waivers for the nonobservance of the five performance criteria detailed above.
They also seek an extension of the PRGF arrangement to November 20, 2007, which would
allow them time to complete the third review under the arrangement after reaching
understandings with Fund staff on the 2007/08 budget. In view of the substantial
improvements in Kenya's balance of payments since the approval of the PRGF arrangement,
the authorities also request a reduction in access of SDR75 million, with the remaining
access of SDR75 million to be disbursed in two equal installments for the second and third
reviews.
7.
On the issue of a noncompliant disbursement for Kenya and accumulated external
payments arrears, the authorities agree that in addition to the two non-concessional external
loans reported at the time of the second disbursement under the PRGF arrangement, a third
loan was contracted on January 20, 2004 which was not concessional. This should have been
reported as non-concessional borrowing at the time if information had been available. This
information became available following the recent audit by the Auditor and Controller
General and the publication of his report. This clearly shows that the governance measures
on transparency and accountability introduced by the government are working. The
accumulation of external payments arrears during the period monitored for the first PRGF
review was greater than the amount reported to the Executive Board in December 2004. The
authorities regret the inaccuracy of the information that was provided at the time of the first
review, which was attributable to weak institutional arrangements, a debt database
shortcoming, changes in key personnel in the Ministry of Finance and inadequate staff in the
debt management department at that time. The authorities have since undertaken a number of

3
actions to address these challenges including implementing external debt management
reforms with support from the World Bank/DFID under the Financial and Legal Sector
Technical Assistance Program to ensure that additional non-concessional loans are not
contracted or guaranteed and that outstanding legitimate external arrears are settled. The
authorities request for a waiver for nonobservance of the performance criteria underlying the
noncomplying disbursement.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
8.
The authorities have taken significant steps to secure macroeconomic stability and put
in place a strong foundation for growth. The results of this stewardship have been
impressive: GDP growth has increased ten-fold from a low of 0.6 percent in 2002 to an
estimated 6 percent in 2006; the highest level in two decades. Meanwhile, inflation fell
sharply to 6.8 percent in the 12-months to February as food price inflation eased. Non-food
inflation continued to hover around 6 percent. Economic growth has also been broad based.
9.
This positive outcome can be attributed to prudent macroeconomic policies, a
generally favorable external environment, rising world prices for tea and coffee, and
continued strong demand for horticultural exports. Manufacturing has also benefited from
strong regional demand and the formation of the East African Community Customs Union.
There has also been robust growth in the service sector.
10.
Last year, Kenya received its first international credit rating. Standard and Poor’s
Rating Service assigned Kenya a B+ for foreign currency and BB- for local currency. Within
Sub-Saharan Africa, only mineral- rich countries have a higher rating. The favorable longterm sovereign credit rating gave the country a positive outlook, emphasizing the authorities’
strong political commitment to prudent financial policies and market-oriented structural
reforms. The authorities have directed their efforts at reducing inflationary pressures through
tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and have taken measures to contain domestic debt and so
achieve program targets and maintain debt sustainability.
11.
With respect to governance, Kenya also received a moderate rating along side other
countries in the recent release of the Global Integrity Index, which assesses the existence and
effectiveness of anti-corruption mechanisms that promote public integrity. It is also
noteworthy that Kenya is one of the few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has
voluntarily subjected itself to the NEPAD’s Africa Peer Review Mechanism.
12.
The authorities believe that they have made important progress, delivering on
objectives outlined in the Economic Recovery Strategy and the Kenya Vision 2030. They
recognize, however, that a lot of work remains to be done. They acknowledge that the
economy still remains vulnerable to external exogenous shocks and that the government
continues to face challenges in a number of areas, including in improving the effectiveness of
key institutions, increasing the breadth and quality of infrastructure and pursuing a reform

4
agenda which continues to buttress strong growth and poverty reduction and improve
external competitiveness.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Management
13.
On the fiscal front, the authorities continue to pursue a fiscal policy that is supportive
of a higher growth path for the economy, while ensuring macroeconomic stability and fiscal
sustainability. They are refocusing and increasing expenditure to areas that will enhance
infrastructure development and reduce widespread poverty. Despite receiving less external
development assistance than expected, they took action to protect priority areas by, among
other things, cutting non-priority expenditure. This in turn helped to contain domestic
borrowing at 1.8 percent of GDP, while accommodating drought-related spending of
0.8 percent of GDP.
14.
The authorities realize that the reallocation of public expenditure is only a beginning
and more needs to be done. They will continue taking significant steps, including
strengthening revenue performance and tax administration, customs reforms, implementing
public expenditure management reforms, and increasing poverty reduction spending by
reorienting public expenditure in favor of essential social and economic outlays. Recognizing
the importance of infrastructure for continued competitiveness and enhanced growth, the
authorities doubled the allocation for development expenditure in the Ministry of Roads and
Public Works in the 2006/7 budget. With limited external financing available however,
scaling-up expenditure on core anti-poverty programs and expenditure will require a
determined effort to rein in non-priority spending and ensure strong domestic revenue
collection.
15.
Kenya has also managed its debt relatively well and has regularly met its obligations
to most of its creditors. The authorities’ limited external borrowing has left them with more
manageable debt ratios than most low-income country peers. The joint IMF- World Bank
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) found Kenya’s debt to be low and sustainable.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
Under its current monetary policy framework, the Central Bank of Kenya will
continue to target reserve money growth. Consistent with inflation objectives, the authorities
will control the growth in reserve money in order to achieve the broad money objective. They
are committed to further enhancing the transparency of monetary policy and improving the
signaling of policy intentions to the market. With respect to exchange rate policy, Kenya
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
international current account transactions. The current floating exchange rate regime is seen
as supportive of macroeconomic stability and external competitiveness.

5
External Sector
17.
Despite large inflows of remittances, the current account deficit widened on account
of higher world oil prices and the strong import demand in line with stronger growth.
Sizeable financial inflows resulted in a significant buildup in foreign exchange reserves and
an appreciation of the Kenyan shilling, largely reflecting increased confidence in Kenya’s
economy. This has not however affected Kenya’s external competitiveness. Nevertheless
there are risks ahead. Going forward the authorities are committed to continuing streamlining
Kenya’s business licensing system, pursuing efficiency-enhancing structural reforms and
increasing infrastructure spending while reducing outlays on parastatals and containing the
wage bill.
Financial Sector Policy
18.
The financial sector in Kenya remains stable. Key financial soundness indicators
point to a sector that is well capitalized, profitable and liquid. This soundness is the result of
strengthened financial regulation and improved compliance with prudential regulations over
the last four years. While the value of non-performing loans remains high, the number has
been substantially reduced.
19.
The authorities will submit a new Banking Bill to Parliament that establishes a legal
and regulatory framework for mandatory supervisory intervention and prompt corrective
actions against inadequately capitalized and failing banks. My authorities acknowledge the
contribution that a strong financial sector can make in the delivery of their objectives and
remain committed to implementing measures designed to ensure the stability of the financial
system and to develop it further.
20.
The Kenyan Government is also committed to accelerating public enterprise reforms,
including privatizing troubled financial institutions, and developing a financial sector reform
strategy that is based on market principles. The cabinet has approved the restructuring of the
National Bank of Kenya and the authorities are now preparing for cabinet consideration of a
strategy to divest from the National Bank of Kenya. Pending this divestiture, the bank will
remain under the close supervision of the Central Bank of Kenya. The Charterhouse Bank
(CHB) was put under management of the Central Bank of Kenya in June 2006. On 9 March
2007, the Court of Appeal rejected the application by CHB to remove the statutory manager,
while the license, which expired in December 2006, was not renewed by the government.
The authorities will also undertake a diagnostic audit of the National Social Security Fund
(NSSF) that will provide a basis to address its financial and governance problems.
Meanwhile, the Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Bill that will enable Kenya to comply
with international best practice, has been republished and will be submitted to Parliament.

6
Tackling Governance Weaknesses
21.
The authorities have achieved real progress in strengthening governance institutions,
but recognize that challenges still remain. Kenya’s Governance Action Plan (GAP) has set
out very clearly the authorities’ priorities. It has been well received and welcomed by
citizens, the private sector and donors. The governance policy initiatives will focus on four
broad areas namely: i) prevention, ii) investigation, iii) restitution, and iv) improving
governance in priority sectors. Top priority is being given to administrative and preventive
actions, which are expected to result in measurable improvements in governance and anticorruption efforts in the short run.
22.
A key objective of the 2006/07 program is to improve governance. The centerpiece of
this agenda is the implementation of the Governance Action Plan, focusing initially on
measures that can be undertaken without legislative action, yet with significant payoffs in the
short-run. The authorities have already taken decisive actions on corruption cases and
strengthened institutions to further enhance transparency and accountability. In this
connection, they have already begun the implementation of the Governance Action Plan, in
some cases, earlier than envisaged.
23.
The Government is also conducting audits of the Anglo leasing contracts, which
could provide additional evidence for subsequent prosecution. They intend to resubmit to
Parliament the Miscellaneous Amendment Bill, which contains key measures to support
implementation of the Governance Action Plan, including hiring 20 more judges and making
asset declarations by senior public officials available to the general public. Resubmission of
the bill to parliament will be a performance criterion for the third review.
24.
The authorities acknowledge the importance of prosecuting prominent corruption
cases and completing the legislative agenda for the Governance Action Plan. They have
made important progress in investigating corruption cases and bringing them to trial;
however, the pace at which cases are brought to conclusion has been slow. By
March 6, 2007, the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission had forwarded 254 files to the
Attorney General and recommended prosecution in 185 files. Of all these, the Attorney
General was unable to deal with only three files. There are currently a number of high-profile
corruption cases in court including cases involving three former permanent secretaries linked
to Anglo-Leasing contracts, two former central bank governors and one former Minister. The
remaining Anglo leasing contracts are being investigated by the Kenya Anti-Corruption
Commission in tandem with an external audit of the contracts to assess their fair values. The
Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission has indicated that it intends to complete its
investigations of all Anglo leasing contracts before making its recommendations to the
Attorney General’s office.

7
Structural measures
25.
The authorities have focused on further strengthening and improving public financial
management. A number of steps have been taken to enhance the efficiency of public resource
management and to improve governance. Important progress has been made in fiscal
reporting, improving transparency in granting exemptions, subjecting all procurement to
transparent and competitive procedures, timely presentation of the Controller and Auditor
General’s report to Parliament, and completing a survey of the contingent liabilities of
24 parastatals.
26.
On public enterprise reform and private sector development, the authorities have
made considerable progress in parastatal reform. This includes the concessioning of Kenya
Railways, the partial privatization of KenGen and Mumias Sugar Company, the introduction
of a management contract for Kenya Power and Lighting Company, and performance
contracts for all public commercial enterprises. The authorities have also made significant
progress in streamlining Kenya’s business licensing system. The result is a more favorable
business environment which will help to sustain growth driven by a vibrant private sector.
The reform program further envisages establishment of a Privatization Commission under the
Privatization Act.
27.
On trade reforms and regional integration, the authorities will continue to pursue
trade liberalization to enhance efficiency and strengthen growth prospects. Within the region,
the authorities will implement their East African Community (EAC) commitments, continue
to pursue greater regional economic and social integration, and advocate for further steps to
open up the EAC with a view to enhancing competition and efficiency.
Conclusion
28.
My authorities are committed to delivering on the objectives set out in the Economic
Recovery Strategy, Vision 2030 and the Governance Action Plan. They have taken important
steps in this regard. They are also committed to taking further additional steps that may be
necessary. They believe that the Fund can play a positive and catalytic role in supporting
them in the delivery of their objectives. The authorities intend to remain engaged with the
Fund, through an appropriate program, after the completion of the third review.
