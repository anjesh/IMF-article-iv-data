PARAGUAY
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representative for the 2010 Consultation with Paraguay
Approved by Rodrigo Valdés and Dominique Desruelle
May 21, 2010
Executive Summary


Context. The Paraguayan economy performed very well in the period 2003–08, as sound demand
policies supported by structural reforms helped real GDP grow by 5 percent a year. In 2009, a severe
drought and the global financial crisis triggered a recession, although countercyclical demand policies
helped contain the decline in real GDP to 3.8 percent. In concluding the 2009 Article IV consultation,
Directors supported the shift to more accommodative demand policies, while preserving
macroeconomic stability, and underscored the need to press ahead with structural reforms, especially
in the financial sector and public enterprises.



Outlook for 2010. The economy is expected to rebound from the 2009 recession, as real GDP would
grow by 6.0 percent in 2010. Favorable weather conditions will help produce a record soy harvest,
which—together with faster growth in key trading partners—will boost exports and private
investment. With renewed momentum in domestic demand and rising international commodity
prices, inflation is projected to increase from 1.9 percent in 2009 to 5 percent in 2010, and the
external current account deficit would expand moderately to 1.7 percent of GDP on the back of rising
imports. With continued net capital inflows, net international reserves would rise to US$4.1 billion
(25 percent of GDP). The authorities plan to continue supporting the recovery in 2010, although with
some removal of the 2009 stimulus. All available indicators suggest that the level of the guaraní is
consistent with its fundamentals.



2010 Article IV consultation. Discussions centered on the authorities’ plan to advance their agenda
of institutional reforms, drawing heavily on technical assistance from the Fund. These reforms
include the adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework, an inflation targeting regime, and further
enhancements to the macro-prudential framework. With these reforms, real GDP would grow by
4−5 percent a year over the medium term, while inflation would decline to 3 percent a year by 2014.



The 2010 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Asunción during April 12–20. The
mission comprised R. Rennhack (head), T. Dabán-Sánchez, S. Acosta-Ormaechea (all WHD),
E. Crivelli (FAD), and Sylwia Nowak (MCM). T. Roy (Resident Representative) assisted the
mission, and J. Maciel (OED) participated in the meetings. The mission met with Vice President
Franco, Minister Borda, Central Bank Governor Corvalán, congressional leaders, senior government
officials and representatives of the private sector and the donor community.



Other issues. Paraguay maintains a flexible exchange rate regime, and has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Section 2, 3 and 4. Its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions. The anti-money laundering law is being
implemented. The senate recently approved a law to combat the financing of terrorism.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Paraguay’s took advantage of the favorable global economic climate earlier this
decade to strengthen economic performance. The government ran a sizable primary surplus
in the period 2003–08, which cut public debt to less than 25 percent of GDP by end-2008.
The central bank brought inflation down to 7.5 percent during 2008, while maintaining
exchange rate flexibility. Structural reforms advanced in several areas, including financial
supervision, budget management, and the tax system. These policy efforts were supported by
two Fund arrangements. As a result, during 2003–08 real GDP rose by 5 percent a year,
helping to reduce poverty. Net international reserves rose to almost US$3 billion by 2008 and
the financial sector recovered from a severe crisis.
2.
In 2009, the global financial crisis coupled with a severe drought buffeted the
economy, causing a 3.8 percent decline in real GDP. Exports fell sharply in response to the
effect of the drought on agricultural production (about one quarter of the economy) as well as
the depressing effect of the global crisis on world commodity prices and growth in trading
partners. With the strong links between agriculture and the rest of the economy, real domestic
demand declined. This, together with the reversion of international commodity prices,
brought headline inflation down to 2 percent during the year and slowed the growth in credit
to the private sector to 25 percent (y-o-y) by end-2009, down from a peak of 78 percent in
May 2008. In addition, imports fell more sharply than exports, and the current account deficit
narrowed significantly to 1.3 percent of GDP. The real effective exchange rate (REER)
declined by 5 percent in the first half of the year, as the global crisis intensified. Interestingly,
net capital inflows expanded to 5 ½ percent of GDP, reflecting in repatriations by residents
seeking a safe haven for their assets. Overall, net international reserves rose by US$1 billion,
reaching US$3.8 billion (340 percent of short-term debt on remaining maturity basis and
25 percent of GDP).
3.
Drawing on the buffers built during the period 2003–08, demand policies in 2009
shifted to a countercyclical stance and helped limit the fall in real GDP.


The central government scaled back the primary surplus. After running sizable
primary surpluses in the period 2004–08 and reducing public debt below 25 percent
of GDP by end-2008, the government had the space to boost public spending,
especially on investment and conditional cash transfer programs. Government
expenditures increased by 25 percent in real terms. The wage bill increased sharply
from 7.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting an
expansion in public employment, as well as a 5 percent wage increase in mid-2009.
At the same time, total revenues rose by almost 2 percent of GDP, reflecting a jump
in income tax collections (from the settlement of 2008 taxes). Also revenues from the
sale of hydroelectric power rose to 3.1 percent of GDP, mainly as the depreciation of

4
the guaraní vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar boosted the domestic-currency value of these
royalties.1 All in all, the primary surplus fell from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to
0.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and the overall balance registered a surplus of 0.1 percent
of GDP. The fiscal impulse is estimated at 2 percent of GDP.


The central bank focused on providing ample liquidity. During the peak of the
global crisis, the central bank lowered the average policy interest rate2 from
4.0 percent at end-2008 to 0.6 percent in April 2009, and then raised the rate to
2.0 percent by mid-year as the economy began to recover. It also reduced reserve
requirements and opened a new short term liquidity facility. To smooth excess
currency volatility, the central bank made partially sterilized purchases of foreign
exchange, which also provided an additional source of liquidity to money markets.
For the year as a whole, the guaraní depreciated by 13 percent vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar.

4.
Banks held up well during the downturn but some signs of stress appeared in the
cooperatives. Banks remained well capitalized (with an overall capital adequacy ratio of
16.4 percent and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.1 percent at end-2009) and highly liquid (with
liquid assets equivalent to a third of total assets). The quality of the loan portfolio seems
strong, as non-performing loans amounted to only 1.9 percent of total loans, although about
15 percent of total loans were restructured or refinanced to avoid payment delays.
Cooperatives now account for one quarter of total financial system assets, but are lightly
supervised, with less stringent capital and provisioning requirements than banks. Nonperforming loans of cooperatives rose to 8 percent of total loans by end-2009.
5.
The government’s reform record has been mixed so far. Congress recently approved
the law allowing the government to capitalize the central bank in up to 6¼ percent of GDP,
through the transfer of interest-bearing Treasury notes, in line with previous Fund advice.
Since the last Article IV consultation, progress has been made in other areas, including:


strengthening tax administration by enforcing tax collection and re-establishing onsite tax audits;



improving the monitoring of public enterprises by re-establishing the supervisory council
of public enterprises and creating a specialized unit in the ministry of finance; and



enhancing banking supervision, including by setting a generic provisioning
requirement of 0.5 percent.

6.
The political situation poses significant challenges for policies. As the first
government in 60 years to be headed by a political party other than the Colorado party, the
government of President Lugo has no majority coalition in congress, which has strong
powers and often opposes government initiatives. In April 2009 congress delayed for another
three years the implementation of the personal income tax originally approved in 2004. These
differences could intensify ahead of the November 2010 municipal elections.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
In 2010, the economy is expected to rebound from the 2009 recession. Real GDP is
expected to grow by 6.0 percent. Favorable weather conditions will help produce a record
soy harvest, which—together with faster growth in key trading partners—will boost exports
and private investment. Other indicators in the first quarter—such as tax collections, imports
of capital and durable consumer goods, and credit to the private sector—also point to
renewed momentum in domestic demand. These trends, together with rising international
commodity prices, are expected to push inflation up to 5 percent in 2010 and expand the
external current account deficit moderately to 1.7 percent to GDP. With continued net capital
inflows, net international reserves would rise to US$4.1 billion (25 percent of GDP). Bank
credit to the private sector―which at 25 percent of GDP is low by regional standards—
would grow by 18 percent during 2010, while broad money would expand by 19 percent.
8.
Highly dependent on agriculture and international trade, Paraguay is likely to
remain exposed to swings in world commodity prices, demand in key trading partners and
weather cycles. Other vulnerabilities stem from the still-high dollarization in the financial
system, the limited oversight of cooperatives, and fiscal risks coming from losses of public
enterprises. Inflation expectations for end-2010 have come down to 5 percent, although
Paraguay’s history of volatile inflation underscores the need to improve the credibility of
policies further.
9.
For these reasons, the authorities are firmly committed to continue to strengthen
policy institutions, while maintaining prudent demand policies. With the economy in full
recovery, they will manage fiscal and monetary policy carefully to keep inflation under
control. Their reform agenda is broad and ambitious and includes the gradual adoption of a
medium-term fiscal framework and inflation targeting, while continuing to strengthen
financial supervision—all in line with recommendations from FAD and MCM. Other reforms
would include broadening the tax ratio—one of the lowest in the region—to help fund
additional spending on social programs and infrastructure and making public enterprises
more efficient.
10.
With these policies, staff projects that real GDP would grow by 4–5 percent a year
in the period 2010–15. This pace of growth would be supported by the outlook for firm
world commodity prices, robust growth in Brazil and the recovery in the global economy, as
well as the rebound from the drought of 2009. By 2015, private investment and savings
would recover to their levels in relation to GDP of 2004–05. The central bank is committed

6
to lowering annual inflation to 3 percent by 2014. The external current account would
register small deficits, which—together with sustained capital inflows—would lead to steady
gains in net international reserves. These trends would likely be accompanied by a gradual
real appreciation of the guaraní, which—according to all available indicators—appears to be
broadly in line with its fundamentals (Appendix 1). The authorities are closely monitoring
developments in Europe, which could alter this outlook if commodity prices were to fall or
growth in trading partners were to slow. However, they stand ready to adapt policies as
necessary to preserve macroeconomic stability.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: INSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO
STRENGTHEN POLICY MAKING
11.
Discussions focused on identifying and prioritizing key institutional reforms to
further strengthen macroeconomic policy. Institutional reforms would build a firmer anchor
for confidence and support a more vigorous pace of sustainable economic growth.
Discussions also included the most appropriate response to the state of the cycle and inflation
pressures.
A. Short-term Demand Management
12.
The authorities and staff agreed that demand policies should continue supporting
the recovery in 2010, with some removal of last year’s stimulus to keep inflation under
control. The authorities expect the overall balance of the central government to be in
equilibrium in 2010, compared with a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2009, which would
bring the fiscal impulse to 0.3 percent of GDP. Total revenues would remain stable in
relation to GDP. While tax revenues would raise moderately, the appreciation of the guaraní
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar would lower the domestic currency value of royalties. Spending
would remain stable in relation to GDP, reflecting increased conditional cash transfers to
low-income households and pension payments, together with scaled-back capital
expenditures. The central bank intends to limit inflation to no more than 5 percent and
intends to withdraw the excess liquidity as necessary, driving up the policy interest rate
(which is now less than expected inflation).
B. Fiscal Reforms
13.
The authorities agreed that fiscal reforms should maintain a small primary surplus
to keep public debt in the range of 20–25 percent of GDP over the medium term
(Appendix 2). Within this constraint, they would raise spending on infrastructure and social
programs, while controlling the growth of current spending. There is an urgent need to
upgrade transmission and distribution of electricity, improve the quality of telephone
landlines and internet connectivity, and expand the road network. Poverty continues to be
widespread at 40 percent of the population, and the rural poor were the most affected by last
year’s drought. The government increased the coverage of its conditional cash transfer
program (Tekopora) from 15,000 to 100,000 families in 2009. A further extension of the
program and improvements in the supply of basic health and education services are

7
warranted, provided that control mechanisms remain in line with best international practices
and in line with financing constraints. To finance the additional spending, they would aim to
raise the tax ratio to 15 percent of GDP over the medium term.
14.

The key fiscal reforms include:



Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). Some progress has been made with the
formulation of a macro-fiscal model, the reinforcement of human resources of the
macro-fiscal unit, and the preparation of a document outlining the government’s fiscal
strategy. Staff emphasized that for the MTFF to be an effective management tool, it
should be fully integrated in the budget process, include realistic medium-term
revenue projections, allow for the reconciliation of line ministries ceilings and
macroeconomic constraints and envisage regular debt sustainability analysis. Staff
recommended that the authorities attach the MTTF and the government’s fiscal
strategy paper to the draft budget to help focus the legislative discussion of the budget
on the medium-term constraints. The authorities stressed their commitment to
implement the recommendations from FAD and have requested further assistance
from the Fund, especially on debt management issues.



Improve quality of spending. Staff encouraged the authorities to develop
performance-based budgeting to measure the impact of expenditure. Staff noted that
the increase in the government’s wage bill during 2009 will lock in a higher level of
current spending. The authorities explained that much of the additional employment
was in social sectors where there was an urgent need to improve the delivery of
services. However they agreed on the importance of restraining the growth of current
spending going forward.



Manage additional compensations from Itaipu. Revenues from hydroelectric power
from Itaipu could rise by another 1.5 percent of GDP a year starting in 2010, once the
Brazilian congress approves a 2009 agreement.3 Staff fully supported the
government’s intention to de-politicize the use of these additional revenues by
seeking approval of a law that would place them in a special fund, which would pay
for high-return projects in infrastructure and technology and build up a
countercyclical reserve fund. Furthermore, staff suggested that the law include a
“permanent income clause” to allow the fund to provide a permanent source of
income.4 The authorities intend to channel a significant share of these payments to the
reserve fund, which could achieve a comparable result.

3

In July, 2009 the Brazilian and Paraguayan governments agreed to triple the price of the sale of Paraguay’s
share of the production from the Itaipu dam to Brazil.
4

The Selected Issues Papers include a presentation of the application of the permanent income rule in this case.

8


5

Additional tax effort (Box 1).5 Additional tax revenues would provide more fiscal
space for spending on social programs and infrastructure. These would also help
diversify revenue sources away from royalties from sales of hydroelectric power,
which are projected to decline sharply in relation to GDP over the next 10‒15 years.6
To that end, the authorities are stepping up their efforts to improve tax administration,
especially at the customs level, and have taken steps to broaden the tax base. In
particular, in October 2008

of a clear deadline and an
effective system to monitor these deductions. The authorities expect this step to raise
revenues by 1 percent of GDP a year over the next 3–4 years.7 With this measure and
continued efforts on strengthening administration, staff estimates that tax revenues
will grow by 1 to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2015. Going forward, staff supported the
government’s intention to explore the introduction of a small tax on sales of
agricultural products (as in Uruguay), while noting this was a second best measure.
Staff encouraged the authorities to extend the VAT to agricultural products, which are
now exempt, and to raise selective consumption taxes. The authorities cautioned that
any attempt to extend the VAT to agricultural products would meet stiff political
resistance. The authorities and staff agreed that, in spite of the recent decision by
congress to delay its implementation, the personal income tax would be an important
step toward a more efficient and fairer tax system and would enhance the
administration of the VAT.

The Selected Issues Papers include a comparative analysis of Paraguay’s tax system.

6

These revenues would decline as local demand for electricity rises and reduces sales of excess electricity to
Brazil (which earns a higher price per GWh). In addition, the price per GWh is adjusted monthly in line with the
CPI and industrial production index in the United States, which will probably grow by less than economic
activity in Paraguay.
7

Taxpayers may still deduct the stock of VAT payments outstanding as of October 2008 that had not been
deducted from the payments under the IMAGRO, and they expect this stock to be fully deducted in this period.

9
Box 1. Paraguay’s Tax System from a Regional Perspective
Paraguay’s tax ratio is low and tilted towards indirect taxation by regional standards.
Paraguay’s tax ratio (12.7 percent of GDP) increased only moderately during the recent period of
high growth (2003–08), especially compared with similar countries. This reflects Paraguay’s low
rates, narrow bases—which practically exclude agribusiness activities— and weak tax
administration. This could also result from an excessive reliance on indirect taxation. In fact, VAT,
excises, and import duties account for about 80 percent of total tax revenue (9.4 percent of GDP),
compared to about 60 percent on average (10.3 percent of GDP) in comparable countries. In
Paraguay, taxes on profits account for less than 20 percent of total revenue, compared to 30 percent
on average elsewhere.

Efforts to bring Paraguay’s tax ratio in line with peer countries should focus on improving
administration further and broadening tax bases.


Taxation of agriculture: Additional reforms of the income tax on agriculture (IMAGRO) could
include disallowing deductions for expenses other than business costs and inventory losses, and
implementing a unified regime for big and medium-size properties. As a complement, the
authorities could consider a sales tax on some agricultural products (as in Uruguay) at a rate of
2–3 percent.



VAT: The list of reduced-rate items (at 5 percent rate) and exemptions should be streamlined.
The current large number of exempt items results in significant revenue losses, incentives for
misclassification, and increased demand for refunds. It would be useful to phase out the
exemption on agricultural products.



Excises: These taxes could be applied to fewer products and the rates could be gradually
increased to regional standards on the remaining products (especially on tobacco and alcohol).
This will help simplify administration costs with very little revenue loss.



Personal Income Tax (PIT): The PIT will help formalize the economy, strengthen tax
administration, and improve tax mobilization. A PIT will also diversify the tax structure, and
add progressivity to the tax system, which may help improve the distribution of income.

10


Public enterprise reform. Currently, there are 9 major public enterprises in Paraguay
in sectors ranging from the distribution of petroleum products to the production of
cement. These enterprises operate complex subsidies, have excessive staffing and
other inefficiencies, often run arrears with suppliers, and suffer from a lack of
transparency in reporting their financial position. In August 2008, the Supervisory
Council of State-Owned Enterprises8 was re-established to set up and monitor
performance agreements with the major public enterprises, and it has already helped
improve the financial operations of several key enterprises. The authorities will
propose a law to enhance the powers of this council by granting it stronger authority
to require improvements in an enterprise’s financial position, including publishing
quarterly financial reports and rationalizing staffing levels. These enterprises would
also have to explore a wide range of options to improve efficiency, including by
investing in the context of public-private partnerships. Staff welcomed these steps and
encouraged the authorities to consider other ways to increase private sector
participation in the enterprises through capitalization or privatization and to expose
the public enterprises to competition from the private sector.
C. Monetary Policy Reforms

15.
The central bank is fully committed to the adoption of an inflation-targeting (IT)
framework over the medium term, relying on technical assistance from MCM. As a first
step in this direction, in 2010, the central bank announced an inflation target of 5 percent
with a band of +/- 2.5 percent. Staff agreed that a wide band was prudent at this stage, given
the need to establish credibility and develop more effective instruments of monetary control.9
The central bank also aims to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime, limiting foreign
exchange intervention to counter disorderly markets. In this regard, they agreed to consider
the staff recommendation to explore market-based mechanisms (e.g., auctions) to strengthen
the transparency of intervention.
16.
It was agreed that essential elements of a transition to an IT framework included
continued fiscal discipline and careful control of the liquidity in the banking system.
Specific areas for strengthening include:


Recapitalization of the central bank. In the coming months, according to the recently
approved law, the central bank and the ministry of finance will decide on key details
of the transfer of Treasury bonds to capitalize the central bank, including the
maturities and interest rates. The authorities agreed that the recapitalization should be
completed in a way that safeguards the long-term solvency of the central bank. This

Communications and the Attorney General.
9

The Selected Issues Papers include an analysis of Paraguay’s monetary transmission mechanisms.

11
step will enhance the credibility of the central bank and give it more flexibility in the
conduct of monetary policy.


Central bank’s operational capacity. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to focus on
(i) strengthening the coordination between the ministry of finance and the central
bank; (ii) improving the central bank’s forecasting and analytical models;
(iii) strengthening the domestic money market, especially by encouraging a secondary
market in domestic government securities; and (iv) modernizing the payment system.



Transparency and communication. The authorities intend to implement an effective
communication strategy supported by an explicit, forward-looking framework.
D. Financial Sector Reforms

17.
The authorities are committed to further strengthening banking supervision. In line
with MCM recommendations, the central bank will modify regulations to improve
information sharing among supervisors, strengthen licensing criteria for foreign banks,
enhance credit risk assessments, set provisions for problem assets, establish exposure limits,
improve internal control and audit within banks, and improve off-site supervision. These
changes would bring banking supervision into compliance with about 50 percent of the Basel
Core Principles. Additional gains in compliance with these principles would require
amendments to the banking law to address the remaining shortcomings, such as weak bank
governance; deficient sanctioning capacity of the superintendence of banks; and unclear “fit
and proper” criteria. In addition, the authorities have continued making progress with the
strengthening of the capital base of the deposit guarantee fund, although at a slower pace than
envisaged.10 Also the key public bank—the National Development Bank—remains well
capitalized, with a capital adequacy ratio of 35 percent. Although its operations are restricted
by law, it plans to focus on extending credit to small and medium enterprises, while
continuing to comply with prudential norms.
18.
Steps are underway to strengthen the supervision of cooperatives. The supervisory
agency for cooperatives (INCOOP) has started a program of institutional strengthening, with
support from the IDB and the German association of cooperatives. INCOOP is developing an
early warning system, strengthening reporting requirements and enhancing administrative
and operational procedures. It also plans to establish a deposit guarantee fund and a lender of
last resort facility for cooperatives. Staff welcomed these changes but urged the authorities to
extend the prudential norms for banks to cooperatives to limit the scope for regulatory
arbitrage. It also cautioned that INCOOP—which is governed by the cooperatives—lacked
sufficient independence to provide effective supervision.
10

The fund is currently worth US$87 million. According to the 2003 law governing the fund, the government is
expected to contribute about US$50 million in interest-free, non-negotiable bonds, but so far has only
contributed US$26 million.

12
Box 2. Paraguay: The Transmission of Monetary Policy
The Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP)’s monetary policy framework includes many sound practices. The
BCP’s charter establishes that the Bank objectives are the preservation of price and financial sector stability. For
2010 the Bank announced an annual inflation target of 5 percent within a band of +/- 2.5 percent. The BCP’s
policy instruments include open-market operations with sterilization bills (Instrumentos de Regulation
Monetaria (IRM)), reserve requirements, a short-term collateralized liquidity facility, and, on occasion, foreign
exchange intervention.

However, the implementation of monetary policy in Paraguay faces important challenges. In particular, given
the openness of the economy, imported inflation and the exchange rate can have an important effect on inflation.
Also money markets are still relatively underdeveloped, with very little secondary market trading of government
securities, which limits the ability to conduct monetary policy through repurchase and reverse repurchase
operations. Because the stock of IRM is still relatively small, it is more difficult for the BCP to inject liquidity
than to withdraw it. For this reason, the BCP relied on partially sterilized foreign exchange purchases in 2009 to
help implement a countercyclical monetary policy.
Staff analysis confirms that open market instruments, foreign exchange interventions and the exchange rate
all play a role in the transmission of monetary policy. Statistical analysis shows that:



An increase in the stock of open market instruments (a contraction of credit) produces a reduction in the
price level and output, as expected.



An increase in the stock of net international reserves produces only a short-lived increase in output and
prices, mostly likely capturing the effects of subsequent sterilization operations.



Paraguay has a sizable exchange rate pass-through compared to Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Uruguay.

These results suggest that a key challenge is to strengthen domestic money markets to enhance the
effectiveness of open market operations and the policy interest rate. Otherwise, the BCP will may face the
temptation to limit exchange rate flexibility and rely on foreign exchange intervention to help control inflation,
which could send a confusing signal about its commitment to low inflation.

It was agreed that continued macroeconomic stability provides the best way to
reduce financial dollarization further. Many banks report that they avoid currency
mismatches when lending to clients. The central bank sets a strict limit on banks’ net open
positions in foreign currency and applies higher reserve requirements to foreign currency
deposits than those for domestic currency deposits.
E. Other Issues
20.
While not the focus of this consultation, staff also reviewed other reforms to foster
vigorous growth and reduce poverty further. FDI inflows could be promoted by improving
the business climate, including by streamlining red-tape procedures for business registration,
improving the effectiveness and predictability of the judicial system, reinforcing property
rights, and upgrading creditor registries and bankruptcy procedures. The government is
currently discussing an agreement with a private company, which is considering locating an
aluminum smelter in Paraguay, which would lead to a sharp rise in FDI. It would also be
useful to foster export diversification by supporting efforts to improving farming methods,
and by encouraging the adoption of international quality standards.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
The authorities managed the challenges of the severe drought and global financial
crisis in 2009 reasonably well. They successfully shifted demand policies to a
countercyclical stance, and continued pressing ahead with structural reforms, including on
tax administration, monitoring of public enterprises and financial supervision. By end-2009,
inflation expectations for end-2010 had declined to 5 percent, in line with the central bank’s
objective, pointing to further gains in credibility. The prudent stance of demand policies, as
well as the global recovery and the favorable weather conditions, will help the economy
rebound in 2010. The central bank would signal its firm commitment to achieving its goal for
inflation by beginning to withdraw quickly the excess liquidity from the banking system and
lifting the policy interest rate above the expected rate of inflation. The central government
could support these efforts to keep demand pressures in check by monitoring the growth of
spending, and keeping the fiscal accounts in a balanced position.
22.
It would be important to press ahead with the ambitious agenda of institutional
reforms to provide an even firmer anchor for confidence and sustain vigorous economic
growth. As in the past, the Fund stands ready to provide technical assistance to help
implement these reforms. Provided this agenda advances, real GDP would grow by
4–5 percent a year over the medium term, supported by steady growth in exports and private
investment, while inflation and the external position would remain under control.
23.
Fiscal reforms should focus on increasing the tax ratio, strengthening fiscal
management and reducing fiscal risks. A top priority is the development of a medium term
fiscal framework to keep public debt in the range of 20−25 percent of GDP, while controlling
the growth of current spending and pressing for higher taxes to preserve sufficient room for

14
public investment and social spending. Another priority is to continue strengthening tax
administration and broadening the tax base, especially by increasing taxation on agribusiness
activities. In that connection, staff welcomes the authorities’ recent steps to broaden the base
of the current tax on agriculture income and their success in improving customs
administration. Other challenges ahead are to de-politicize the use of the additional revenues
from Itaipu and enhance the efficiency of public enterprises. The poor operation of these
enterprises makes the economy less competitive in electricity distribution, sales of petroleum
products, telecommunications and other sectors critical for growth.
24.
Staff welcomes the central bank’s commitment to adopt an inflation-targeting
framework in the next few years. This would further enhance the credibility of monetary
policy, in part by providing a transparent framework for communication. It would be useful
to implement without delay the recently-approved law for the recapitalization of the central
bank. Liquidity management could be strengthened further through better coordination with
the ministry of finance and the development of secondary markets for government securities.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to maintain exchange rate flexibility for the guaraní,
which appears to be at a level consistent with its fundamentals.
25.
Efforts to improve financial supervision should continue to be strengthened. The
financial system has coped well with the global financial crisis and continues to be solid and
solvent, but there are still significant disparities with regard to regulatory and supervisory
practices between banks and cooperatives. Staff welcomes the central bank’s plan to improve
the compliance with the Basel Core Principles through modifications in regulations, which
will help preserve the quality of bank loans amid the ongoing recovery in credit. INCOOP,
the supervising agency of the cooperatives, has achieved a few procedural advances, but the
information provided by the cooperatives is still lacking in scope and timeliness. Moreover,
technical advances are unlikely to translate into a qualitative improvement of supervision
unless the potential for conflict of interest, which is inherent to the self-regulatory design of
the cooperatives’ regulatory framework, is addressed more clearly. Moreover, it would be
advisable to extend prudential norms for banks to cooperatives to limit the scope for
regulatory arbitrage and to move towards a unified supervisory framework for all financial
institutions.
26.
Consultation. The staff proposes that the next Article IV Consultation take place
within the 12-month cycle.

After contracting by 6 percent by mid-2009, the economy started to stabilize in Q3, reflecting an improved external environment and
countercyclical policies. Annual inflation, which declined significantly, has also started to pick up and with core inflation at 3.2 percent
in April 2010. Under the expected good weather conditions, real GDP is projected to expand by 6 percent in 2010.

Several shocks have recently produced significant exchange rate developments in
Paraguay. The appreciation trend that the REER experienced since 2005 was interrupted by
the global financial turmoil

mid-2009, and consistent
with the recovery of the economy and the emergence of significant capital inflows, the
guaraní started to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, and has remained stable since early
2010. The REER, which closely follows the nominal exchange rate movements against the
U.S. dollar, has recently increased, reaching a level somewhat close to its historical average
as of February 2010, and somewhat below its pre-crisis level.
Standard CGER methodologies suggest that Paraguay’s REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals, yet slightly biased towards an undervaluation. Although some differences
arise depending on the applied methodology, none of them indicates a major misalignment
(see Table A1.1).

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach suggests that the guaraní is about
5.5 percent undervalued in real effective terms. This estimation considers the difference
between the underlying current account (CA) balance in 2009 (-0.4 percent of GDP)—which
takes the CA balance in that year (-1.3 percent of GDP) stripping away several transitory
factors such as the lower import and export values induced by the drought—and Paraguay’s
CA norm (-2.16 percent of GDP).
The external sustainability (ES) approach also indicates that the REER is slightly
undervalued. In this estimation we have assumed that Paraguay’s net foreign assets (NFA)
position remains at its end-2009 level (-15 percent of GDP). Accordingly, the stabilizing CA

29
balance at the benchmark level of NFA, roughly -1 percent of GDP, requires a REER
appreciation of about 1.9 to close the gap with the underlying CA.
Finally, a direct estimation of the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) considering
its long-run determinants indicates that the REER is slightly overvalued. According to
this methodology, the misalignment is only about

equilibrium level around 2008, which was later
reverted (see Figure A1.2).

30
APPENDIX 2. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The dynamics of Paraguay’s external and public debt levels are very similar given that
70 percent of total external debt is public debt and 85 percent of the public debt is
denominated in foreign currency. Both external and public debt levels are low and robust to
alternative scenarios for the underlying macroeconomic variables. Specifically, setting the
key variables that determine the overall debt dynamics at their historical averages gives rise
to debt levels below those of the baseline scenario. In addition, temporary negative shocks to
key variables, such as interest rates, the exchange rate, and real GDP growth, lead to an
increase in the level of public and external debt, but these ratios return to either a stable or
declining path once conditions normalize.
Public Debt
Paraguay’s gross public debt (domestic and external) is mostly long-term concessional
debt denominated in foreign currency. As of end-2009, total outstanding public debt
(excluding central bank’s bills) is about 18 percent of GDP, of which 85 percent corresponds
to external debt held mostly by multilateral organizations. At present, Paraguay’s
government does not issue bonds in international markets nor finances its borrowing on the
domestic capital markets on a routine basis.
The public debt level is expected to remain sustainable through the projection period
2010–15. Under the baseline scenario, and predominantly reflecting long maturities and
concessional terms, Paraguay’s debt service is expected to remain low, with the debt-to-GDP
ratio declining to about 13 percent of GDP by 2015. Under a deterioration of the primary
deficit, because of the authorities’ failure to increase tax revenues from 12.9 to 14.0 percent
of GDP, as assumed in the baseline scenario, the debt level would stay constant at about
16 percent. Under most adverse scenarios, such as low growth, a 30 percent depreciation of
the exchange rate, and the emergence of contingent liabilities, the debt level would rise to the
range of 18–22 percent of GDP by 2015, with some risks of reaching an explosive path in the
case of persistent low growth.
External Debt
The external debt level is projected to stay below 20 percent of GDP over the medium
term. Since 2002, and reflecting continuous sizeable primary surplus, Paraguay’s external
debt has continuously experienced a downward trend. This trend was interrupted in 2009,
when the debt level rose moderately from 21 percent of GDP to 25 percent of GDP, as a
consequence of the government’s increased recourse to multilateral lending to funding its
fiscal stimulus. Going forward, the external debt ratio is expected to decrease significantly,
due to the expected fiscal discipline and the sustained growth projected for the coming years.
Stress tests show that the most adverse shock would be a 30 percent currency depreciation,
which would raise the debt to GDP ratio about 11 percentage points in that year or about
8 percentage points over the medium term.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan guaraní.
The exchange rate regime is classified as other managed arrangement. The exchange rate is
determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, but the central bank intervenes in the
foreign exchange and monetary markets to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations in real
effective terms. The U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. On April 30, 2009, the
average interbank rate for the U.S. dollar was G4,712

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central
Bank of Paraguay (BCP) is subject to a full safeguard assessment in respect to the
arrangement approved on May 31, 2006. A safeguards assessment of the BCP was completed
in October 2006. The report stated that while the BCP has made some progress in
strengthening the safeguards framework since the 2003 safeguards assessment,
vulnerabilities remain in certain areas such as financial reporting and program data reporting
to the Fund.

ANNEX 2. PARAGUAY—WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
(As of March 31, 2010)
The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Paraguay was approved in April 2009.
Despite the limited implementation of the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
approved in 2003, the Bank decided to step up its involvement in Paraguay under the current
CPS, which has an envelope of US$500 million over the five year period FY09-FY13 and
includes a rich non-lending program in the Government’s priority areas.
The preliminary results under the current CPS show that there have been major
improvements from the previous CAS. In the area of lending, a total amount of $275 million
has already been approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors and all these projects have been
approved by Congress. This reflects an important joint effort between the Government and
the Bank to improve the dialogue with Parliament and to involve its members up stream as
investment operations are being prepared.
The policy dialogue with the current administration regarding the reform agenda and the
macroeconomic framework has been very active and positive. This has enabled the
launching of a programmatic development policy dialogue supported by a series of three
development policy loans (DPL). The first one of US$ 100 million was disbursed in
September 2009, and the second phase operation is envisaged early for FY11 with a
preliminary amount of $75 million. The Bank program includes an investment component
focused on the rural, energy and social sectors. An energy sector strengthening loan and a
community productive initiatives loan are expected to be approved in FY11 for an overall
amount of about $110 million.
The three World Bank-financed projects presently under implementation have a total value of
US$175.5 million in commitments, of which US$171.8 million remain undisbursed as of
March 30, 2010. In addition, Paraguay has a portfolio of four grants for a total amount of
US$3.8 million, with an undisbursed balance of US$2.8 million. The grants are supporting
statistical development, the institutional strengthening of Congress, improvements in the
management of indigenous lands and the promotion of development among indigenous
communities. Other initiatives are being prepared with support from the GEF (Biodiversity
Conservation) and IDF (Institutional Strengthening of the Congress – Phase 2).
The Bank has been playing an important role in the area of anti-corruption and governance.
Paraguay is a governance and anti-corruption (GAC) pilot country and is receiving technical
advice under the Stolen Asset Recovery (STAR) Initiative. In addition, the Bank program
includes a number of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) with the Government of
Paraguay. During FY10 three AAAs were delivered \ including a Study on the Implications
1

Prepared by the staff of the World Bank.

6
of Trade Liberalization in Mercosur, a Transport Sector Assessment and a Revision of
Poverty Measurement. AAAs currently under preparation include a Programmatic Poverty
Assessment, a Social Protection Technical Assistance, and a Public Sector Reform Technical
Assistance. The Bank completed a Fee for Services for the Payments System with the
Central Bank of Paraguay and is considering a second phase for FY11.

ANNEX 4. PARAGUAY—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Following a data ROSC mission in January–February 2006, the authorities’ response to the
report and the mission’s recommendations were published on the Fund’s website on June 30,
2006. The country is a GDDS participant.
A. Real Sector
National accounts estimates, broadly consistent with the guidelines of the 1993 SNA, were
released in 2005. However, no comprehensive regular program for data collection through
economic censuses and surveys exists (an industrial survey was conducted in 2002) and
source data for nonfinancial services, household consumption, and changes in inventories are
insufficient. Major areas of concern include: (i) the 1994 reference year needs to be updated;
(ii) excessive use is made of fixed coefficients for value added and household consumption;
(iii) changes in inventories are obtained residually; (iv) informal activities are not monitored;
and (v) supply and use tables have been compiled only until 1997. While the periodicity of
annual GDP meets GDDS recommendations, timeliness does not because data are
disseminated with a lag of 11 months. Several STA missions on the compilation of quarterly
national accounts (QNA) were fielded in August 2007, August 2008 and November 2009.
Production of definite QNA series would need to await a revision of the national accounts
base year and the compilation of supporting basic data, which are tentatively scheduled for
completion by 2009/10. The STA mission of November 2009 assisted the authorities in
outlining a work program for updating the national accounts’ base year.
Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on a regular and
timely basis. Since January 2008, the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has been using a new
CPI index based on the 2005–06 household budget survey. The geographic coverage of the
CPI is limited to Asunción (the capital) and expenditure weights are representative of the
consumption patterns of urban households. The PPI has a base weight period of December
1995 and its basket (150 items) is not fully representative of current national output;
electricity, water, gas, and services are not covered.
Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage and quality of
employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. However, frequencies
remain at the annual level, and the publication lag is close to one year. Wage indices are
updated twice a year.
The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector statistics and
constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993 SNA. The authorities
have been trying to address these resource shortcomings in the context of the recent
compilation of a new CPI and the production of provisional QNA series.

9
B. Fiscal Sector
The Government finance statistics (GFS) used for internal purposes and for reporting to
WHD is broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Manual on Government
Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The authorities have not yet prepared a plan to
migrate to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Monthly data are
available for the central administration (budgetary central government). The asset position of
the social security system is available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration
include data of the Postal Service Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the
statistics of the nonfinancial public sector include data of financial public corporations ––four
employer social insurance schemes. These social insurance schemes are treated as financial
corporations in the monetary and financial accounts. Data on medium- and long-term
external debt are reliable and available on a monthly basis. Domestic debt data are available
on request, but need to be fully integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies
remain in recording short-term supplier and commercial credit of the public sector.
Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal data reported by the monetary and fiscal
authorities. Measures are being taken to make reporting more transparent.
Annual data covering general government for 2007 have been reported for publication in the
2008 edition of the GFS Yearbook. However, since 1994 no outstanding debt data and no
breakdowns for expenditure by function have been provided for publication in the GFS
Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for publication in IFS.
C. Money and Banking Sectors
Paraguay completed the establishment of a unified compilation and reporting system for the
whole range of monetary data. This new system intends to harmonize monetary data for use
within the BCP, for reporting to STA for publication in IFS, and for operational and
monitoring purposes. A revision of the classification criteria has led also to a marked
reduction in the discrepancies of interbank positions. However, the lack of coverage of the
credit cooperatives remains a matter of concern since they account for around ¼ of deposits
and loans of the banking sector. The BCP, with assistance from STA, plans to include
monthly data of the 20 largest credit cooperatives in the monetary survey during 2010. The
Superintendency of Banks publishes a detailed and informative report on the soundness of
the financial system.
D. External Sector
The classification of the balance of payments and the international investment position (IIP)
follows the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition. Quarterly and
annual data on balance of payments and the IIP are available from 2001 onwards on the
central bank website, and are reported only once a year to STA for publication in the IFS.
Improvements have been made in the quality of the data on capital flows, especially in the
coverage of foreign direct investment, and in the recording of external debt transactions.

10
Special studies by the central bank have improved the estimation methods for remittances of
Paraguayans abroad and unregistered trade transactions, but serious deficiencies remain.
Also, there are deficiencies in the area of private capital outflows, which are difficult to
register due to Paraguay’s open capital account. An STA mission on Balance of Payments
Statistics assisted the BCP in November 2006 in implementing recommendations of the
ROSC mission. In particular, the mission focused on: (1) assessing the surveys used to
capture data on services, direct investment, nonfinancial private sector portfolio investment,
and other investment; (2) reviewing and updating the statistical techniques used to calculate
unrecorded trade; (3) reassessing the treatment of the binational hydroelectric energy
enterprises in the external sector accounts; and (4) reviewing and preparing a preliminary
template for reporting data on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Paraguay
On June 4, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Paraguay.1
Background
During 2003–08, Paraguay took advantage of the favorable global conditions to strengthen
economic performance. The government ran a sizable primary surplus, which cut public debt to
less than 25 percent of GDP by end-2008. The central bank maintained a prudent monetary
policy, supported by exchange rate flexibility. Structural reforms advanced in several areas,
including financial supervision, budget management, and the tax system. As a result, real GDP
rose by 5 percent a year during 2003–08, inflation declined to 7.5 percent during 2008, and net
international reserves reached almost US$3 billion by end-2008.
In 2009, the global financial crisis coupled with a severe drought buffeted the economy, causing
a 3.8 percent decline in real GDP. Exports fell sharply in response to the effect of the drought
on agricultural production (about one quarter of the economy) as well as the depressing effect
of the global crisis on world commodity prices and growth in trading partners. With the strong
links between agriculture and the rest of the economy, real domestic demand declined and
imports plummeted. This, together with the reversion of international commodity prices, brought
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the

headline inflation down to 2 percent and slowed the growth in credit to the private sector. Banks
held up relatively well during the downturn but some signs of stress appeared in the cooperative
sector.
In 2009, the authorities shifted policies to support aggregate demand. The central government
scaled back the primary surplus, resulting in a fiscal impulse of 2 percent of GDP. The central
bank focused on providing ample liquidity to the banking system and made partially sterilized
purchases of foreign exchange to smooth currency volatility, which depreciated by 7 percent in
real effective terms in 2009. The capital account surplus expanded to 5½ percent of GDP,
especially reflecting repatriations by residents seeking a safe haven for their assets, and net
international reserves reached US$3.8 billion (25 percent of GDP and 340 percent of short-term
debt on remaining maturity basis).
In 2010, the prudent stance of demand policies, as well as the global recovery and the favorable
weather conditions, are expected to help real GDP to grow by 6 percent. The projected rebound
in agriculture production and faster growth in key trading partners will boost exports and private
demand. These trends, together with rising international commodity prices, are expected push
inflation up and widen moderately the external current account deficit. With continued net capital
inflows, net international reserves would rise to US$4.1 billion. The overall balance of the
central government is expected to be in equilibrium, while the central bank intends to withdraw
excess liquidity as necessary to limit inflation to no more than 5 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Paraguayan authorities for preserving macroeconomic
stability in 2009 in the face of a severe drought and the global financial crisis. Sound
macroeconomic policies in recent years had permitted the timely shift to a countercyclical
stance, which had helped limit the fall in real GDP. A rebound in growth is expected for 2010,
underpinned by the continuation of prudent demand policies while keeping inflation under
control. Directors noted, however, that the economy remains vulnerable to swings in commodity
prices, weather-related shocks, and financial risks associated with high dollarization and the
operations of savings and loans cooperatives. These highlight the need to continue to press
ahead with the ambitious agenda of institutional reforms and export diversification, with Fund
technical assistance as appropriate.
Directors emphasized the importance of fiscal reforms, aimed at increasing the tax ratio,
strengthening fiscal management, and reducing fiscal risks. They supported the authorities’
objective of keeping public debt at prudent levels, which would be facilitated by the adoption of
a medium-term fiscal framework. This would require curtailing current spending, as well as
continued efforts to strengthen tax administration and broaden the tax base, including further
steps to increase taxation on agribusiness activities. These measures would help preserve
sufficient fiscal space for public investment and social spending. Directors called for the
implementation of the personal income tax without further delay. They also encouraged
continued efforts to enhance the efficiency of public enterprises, including through public-private

3
partnerships, with a view to increasing the competitiveness of economic sectors critical for
growth.
To keep inflation in check, Directors encouraged the authorities to begin to withdraw excess
liquidity from the banking system and raise the policy interest rate above the expected rate of
inflation. They supported the goal of adopting an inflation-targeting framework over the medium
term, and looked forward to the early implementation of the recently-approved law for the
recapitalization of the central bank—a step critical to increasing its credibility and operational
flexibility. The development of secondary markets for government securities would also help
strengthen the central bank’s liquidity management. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to maintain exchange rate flexibility for the guaraní, which appears to be at a level
consistent with its fundamentals.
In the financial sector, Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen the supervisory and
regulatory framework for cooperatives. They recommended extending prudential norms for
banks to cooperatives to limit the scope for regulatory arbitrage, and moving toward a unified
supervisory framework for all financial institutions. Measures to improve compliance with the
Basel Core Principles through modifications in regulations would help preserve the quality of
bank loans as credit picks up. Directors looked forward to the upcoming Financial Sector
Assessment Program update.

Statement by David Vogel, Alternate Executive Director for Paraguay,
and Jose Maciel, Advisor to Executive Director
June 4, 2010
On behalf of the Paraguayan authorities, we would like to thank the staff for their candid
and balanced reports, and wish to acknowledge the Fund’s valuable advice and constant
support in the implementation of the government’s economic program. Paraguay’s
economic program has proved to be successful and macroeconomic stability has been
fully maintained, despite last year’s severe drought and the challenges presented by the
global financial crisis.
Latest Developments
1.
Paraguay’s economy has rebounded strongly after last year’s recession.
Economic output fell by 3.8 percent in 2009, mainly due to a harsh drought that hit the
agricultural sector at the beginning of the year, the drop in export commodity prices, and
a contraction in domestic demand. The authorities’ countercyclical response to the fall in
economic activity was timely and decisive and, as a result, domestic demand began to
recover during the second half of 2009. The Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) acted
promptly injecting liquidity to the financial system and fiscal policies were deliberately
expansionary adding demand stimulus to the economy. Despite this loose stance, the
fiscal accounts ended 2009 with a small surplus, supported by strong fiscal revenues.
2.
The current account deficit narrowed in 2009, while net inflows grew, mainly
as a result of strong repatriation of capitals by residents. This situation helped to
boost the Central Bank’s international reserves by a billion dollars, reaching US$ 3.8
billion (near 25 percent of GDP) at end-2009. Given the still fragile state of the world
economy, and with a view to protect the country’s exposure to eventual external shocks,
the Paraguayan authorities consider an appropriate level of reserves a necessary buffer to
keep the economy stable in the short and medium term.
3.
GDP growth for 2010 is conservatively forecast at 6 percent. A favorable
climate and a significantly improved international environment have led to a strong
recovery of the agricultural sector, which will be the main driver of economic growth in
2010. Monthly indicators of economic activities are promising: soybean harvests are
reportedly high, meat production is flourishing, commerce and transports are
experiencing greater volumes, but there is also increased activity in the construction and
services sectors, suggesting that the recovery is broad-based. These increased activities
will boost domestic demand which, in turn, will contribute to sustaining the economic
recovery in 2010.

Fiscal Sector
4.
Despite the considerable fiscal stimulus amounting to 2 percent of GDP, the
central government accounts achieved a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP. Accordingly,
public debt was kept low at 23 percent of GDP. The authorities’ main focus to address
the economic downturn in 2009 was the implementation of appropriate countercyclical
policies while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Public spending was boosted by
public investments and conditional cash transfers. Improved tax administration
contributed to an increase of revenues equivalent to 2 percent of GDP.
5.
Within a challenging environment, the authorities are committed to
maintaining disciplined fiscal policies. Public investment and continued well-targeted
and transparent conditional cash transfer programs are focal points in the 2010 budget,
which aims at maintaining the fiscal position in balance. The authorities’ fiscal reforms
intend to enhance the efficiency of the tax system and to increase the tax revenue-to-GDP
ratio to a level similar to that of their regional peers. Many of the key fiscal reforms
mentioned in the excellent Selected Issues report prepared by the staff are already in
progress, with the continued support from Fund experts.
6.
Currently, there are several IMF technical assistance missions underway or
in the pipeline related to measures to enhance tax revenues and improve the
management of public debt. One of the priorities of the authorities is the adoption of a
medium-term fiscal framework, which would provide an important anchor to avoid
procyclical budgets. Considering future increases of revenues from the hydroelectric
binational plant Itaipú, jointly owned with Brazil, the implementation of a medium-term
fiscal framework would allow a wise use of these windfalls. Therefore, the authorities
have sought the Fund’s advice for the creation of a special sovereign fund for the
additional resources from Itaipú. The proceeds of this fund would be used exclusively
for three purposes, namely infrastructure, research and development, as well as
countercyclical funds.
7.
With regard to the Personal Income Tax (PIT), which was already created in
2004 but is not yet fully in effect, the authorities are continuing their efforts to avoid
a new postponement of its implementation. Recently the Senate has voted to delay its
application until 2013, and it is now up to the lower chamber of Congress to ratify the
Senate’s decision or reject the delay. The PIT is supported by the vast majority of the
population, think tanks, and entrepreneurial organizations, but there is a strong political
resistance from vested interests.
Monetary Sector
8.
At 1.9 percent in 2009, inflation was among the lowest in South America.
Admittedly, inflation was slightly below the Central Bank’s target of 5 ± 2.5 percent, but
it was in the context of an exceptional period of uncertainty so that the authorities

preferred to have a prudent approach, which has been the distinctive seal of the
authorities’ macroeconomic management. The inflation target for this year continues to
be 5 percent with a fluctuation band of ± 2.5 percent.
9.
The BCP is committed to the adoption of a pure inflation-targeting (IT)
regime and it has already taken several steps towards this end. The recently
approved law to recapitalize the Central Bank is critically important in this process, since
it will provide the BCP with the needed flexibility to conduct its policies. In addition,
there have been recent changes in the BCP’s communication strategy. As of last month,
the decisions adopted by the Open Market and Reserves Operations Executive
Committee (CEOMA) are released to the public to improve the transparency of monetary
policies. The authorities have requested technical assistance of the Fund, which they
believe is critical to move toward full-fledged IT regimes.
10.
Consistent with the accommodative monetary policy stance, interest rates of
the Central Bank’s sterilization bills were kept low throughout 2009 and 2010. In
addition, domestic-currency treasury bonds were issued at longer maturities, reflecting
the increased confidence in Paraguay´s macroeconomic stability. To dissuade an
eventual emergence of inflationary pressures, the Central Bank’s authorities announced a
tightening of its monetary policy stance, which will be reflected in gradual raises of its
referential rate.
11.
Our authorities share the staff’s view that the exchange rate is in line with its
fundamentals, and wish to reiterate their commitment to maintain the current flexible
exchange rate system.
Financial Sector
12.
The banking system remains solid, highly liquid, and strongly profitable.
While credits and deposits continue growing at a sound pace, the quality of banking
assets is confirmed by low levels of non-performing loans, which remained at 1.66
percent as of end-April 2010. Excessive liquidity of the financial system has decreased
since the beginning of the year, reflected in the gradual and continued reduction of the
banks’ current account balances within the Central Bank. This development has also
relieved the pressure on monetary policies.
13.
The distress created by the global financial crisis did not have much effect on
Paraguayan banks, since they were shielded by their limited exposure to foreign banks
and the strength of a well-regulated and supervised financial system. Several
improvements have been achieved since the last Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) took place in 2005, which is verified by an increased compliance with the Basel
principles. Nevertheless, there is still a need to continue to advance with the envisaged
reforms, for instance with those aimed at strengthening the legal and regulatory
framework for banking supervision. The Fund’s advice was critical for raising

compliance with these principles and more technical assistance is needed to achieve the
authorities’ goal to comply with at least 50 percent of the Basel Core Principles by the
end of the year, a target achievable without legal changes. A new FSAP mission is
planned for November 2010.
14.
An issue critical to the smooth functioning of the financial system is the
strengthening of the supervision framework for loans and savings cooperatives,
which presently accounts for 20 percent of total deposits of the entire financial system.
We would like to underline that critical and comprehensive reforms in this area constitute
a high priority for our authorities. As part of the needed process, the supervisory agency
for cooperatives is currently implementing a program of institutional capacity
strengthening funded by multilaterals institutions and bilateral donors, which will put the
agency in a better position to perform its regulatory and supervisory roles.
Final Remarks
15.
Paraguay has benefited both from programs supported by the IMF and from
the Fund’s technical assistance. The Fund’s advice to the authorities on their policies
and reforms has critically contributed to put the country in a better position to withstand
external shocks and take advantage of its growth opportunities. This is an excellent
example of a country that values the presence of the Fund, takes full advantage of its
advice, and recognizes the merit of it in the context of a huge improvement of the
country’s policies and institutions. However, this should be seen as the beginning of a
process aimed at critically changing Paraguay’s economy. It would be very unfortunate
to lose the presence of such an important partner in the reform process so, once again, the
authorities would like to ask Management to reconsider the decision of withdrawing the
position of the Fund’s Resident Representative in Paraguay.
16.
Our policy dialogue has been continuous and fruitful since the creation of the
IMF office in 2005. Much of the success of the Fund’s intense technical assistance in
the country must be credited to the coordinating role of the Res Rep (Paraguay is not
covered by any Regional Technical Assistance Center—RTAC). Perhaps most
importantly, the authorities appreciate the IMF Res Rep’s capability to explain to a wider
public the need to strengthen the institutional underpinnings of macro policies. In our
view, the permanent and constructive voice of an IMF representative will be needed, and
even more so than in the past, as we are moving toward inflation targeting and
strengthening our financial systems.
17.
The IMF’s medium-term budget plan to scale back Res Rep offices is a result
of strategic decisions that were taken before the onset of the global financial crisis.
Since then, the IMF has resumed responsibility and relevance on a global scale. A
working group on Fund Staff Presence in the field is currently reassessing the balance
between staff in headquarters and staff posted in regional and country offices. The

authorities of Paraguay are confident that the study will confirm the value added by Res
Reps. They also believe that it would be unwise to mechanically execute the closure of
the successful Fund representation in Paraguay, which was decided under assumptions
that are no longer valid.
Finally, the Paraguayan authorities would like to express their appreciation to the staff
and Management for their continuous support and look forward to continuing a close and
fruitful dialogue with the Fund.
