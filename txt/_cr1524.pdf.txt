STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Weak economic
growth has contributed to persistent and increasing poverty with deteriorating social
indicators. In a fragile environment, the uncertainty linked to political instability, weak
institutions, and weak governance has eroded the foundation for solid economic growth,
with short-term rent-seeking having taken precedence over longer-term nation building.
Outlook and Risks: The authorities are at a crossroads. A well-prioritized medium-term
economic program that is implemented concertedly would increase growth and reduce
poverty. This will require resources in order to undertake essential investment in
infrastructure, as well as to increase social spending on education and health. However,
there are downside risks, whereby a slow pace of reform implementation would keep
Madagascar on a path of economic stagnation and persistent poverty.
Fiscal Policy: There is a need to increase fiscal space in order to raise the level and
efficiency of pro-poor/pro-growth spending while preserving debt sustainability. This
will involve a broadening of the tax base, supported by a comprehensive revenue
mobilization strategy, improving the composition and quality of budgetary spending,
and reinforcing public financial management.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: To facilitate an active monetary policy and
safeguard macroeconomic stability, it will be important to increase central bank
independence, strengthen its oversight mechanisms, and recapitalize the central bank.
A floating regime remains appropriate, but it will be important to ensure that the foreign
exchange market is liquid and reflects market conditions.
Structural Reforms: There is a need to strengthen the economic climate, including
through improved governance and social development policies that would send a clear
signal, both within society and to development partners, confirming the government’s
commitment to reform. To help build public support for continued reforms, it would be
advisable to build an early track record of “small victories/quick wins”.

CONTEXT
1. Madagascar is now one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per capita having
halved since 1960. About 93 percent of the population lives below US$2 (PPP) per day (see the
Selected Issues Paper on poverty). Economic growth has been low (1.8 percent per year since 1960)
while population growth has been rapid (2.9 percent per year), reaching 22.9 million in 2013 from
5.1 million in 1960. Currently, about half the population is less than 20 years of age.

3. The most recent political crisis erupted in 2009 and led to economic stagnation and a
significant deterioration of development outcomes. The then-president fled Madagascar after a
period of civil unrest. The transition regime that assumed power was not recognized by a majority of
the international community. Donor financing dwindled, with a complete stop of budget support.
Significant fiscal tightening helped ensure that macroeconomic stability was not jeopardized, but at
a cost of a sharp reduction in public spending. Structural reforms stalled as the transition regime

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

lacked a medium-term vision and strategy. After a sharp fall in economic activity in 2009, annual
growth has not exceeded 3 percent. Social services have deteriorated, including basic health care
and primary education. The attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) has become an
increasingly remote target (Figure 1 and Table 9).
4. The government that assumed power in early 2014, following constitutional elections,
has shown a commitment to addressing these challenges. The new government has given
priority to raising social and infrastructure spending back to more normal levels (starting with the
2014 supplementary budget) and creating a foundation for faster and more inclusive growth and for
poverty reduction. In support of this commitment, the authorities received a disbursement
(SDR 30.55 million) under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) in June 2014. A new National Development
Plan (NDP) is under preparation that will cast the economic and structural reform priorities over the
medium term.
5. The bulk of the advice provided in the context of the last Article IV consultation (in 2007)
remains highly relevant today (Box 1). 1 However, the government’s capacity to provide for
Madagascar’s social and development needs is weaker today than in 2007, and progress on
structural reforms has been limited. Tax revenues have fallen back to low levels reflecting a more
prevalent informal economy, challenges in tax and customs administration, and increasing
corruption. Public financial management (PFM) has also weakened, and the authorities have yet to
implement measures to rehabilitate the electricity sector or deepen financial intermediation.
Box 1. Main Recommendations from the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Staff emphasized the following areas as key to maintaining macroeconomic stability and addressing key structural
problems that have hindered economic development:



Increase domestic revenues (broadening the tax base and implementing tax policy and revenue administration
reforms) to provide resources for social and development needs.



Improve public expenditure management and budget execution and control.



Pursue an exchange rate policy of a managed float with no predetermined path while utilizing capital inflows
to boost foreign exchange reserves.



Keep domestic budget financing at low levels to avoid crowding out credit to the private sector.



Implement structural reforms critical to private sector development, including restructuring and rehabilitating
of the public utility company (JIRAMA) and deepening financial intermediation.

Article IV consultations were suspended following the non-recognition of the transition government by the majority
of the international community. The Fund normalized its relations with Madagascar in March 2014.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6. The economic situation deteriorated significantly during the transition period
(2009-2013). The 2009 political crisis interrupted a period of economic growth, with sizable and
widespread private and public investment, that had started in 2003. In recent years, large mining
projects reaching commercial production have provided an impetus to growth, but are masking
stagnation and real declines in other sectors of the economy (Figure 2).

7. Preliminary estimates indicate an economic recovery, albeit limited, in 2014. Real GDP
growth is expected to have been around 3 percent with inflation at about 7 percent (Tables 1 and 2),
with the ongoing phasing out of fuel subsidies expected to increase inflation temporarily. While the
mining sector remained buoyant, other key sectors experienced a more modest rebound.
Agricultural production, in slow recovery following a severe locust infestation in 2013, is estimated
to have increased by less than 1 percent. Companies in the Export Processing Zone grew by about
2 percent in 2014. Tourism is recovering gradually but remained well below 2008 levels.
8. Fiscal policy has faced significant challenges in recent years. Weak revenues and waning
donor flows since 2009 have forced sharp expenditure cuts, targeting public investment and social
spending, but also goods and services (Figure 3). Additional budgetary pressures have come from
subsidized fuel prices (since 2010), losses at the public utility (JIRAMA), and financial imbalances at
the civil service pension fund. Given these circumstances, there was a significant accumulation of
budgetary arrears to domestic suppliers (with a stock estimated at about 4½ percent of GDP at endJuly 2014). There was however no evidence of external arrears. The stock of public debt, which is
mostly concessional, amounted to about 35 percent of GDP at end-2014.
9. Fiscal performance was mixed in 2014. While progress was made in implementing policies,
outcomes fell somewhat short of expectations. The 2014 supplementary budget (approved in June
2014 and in line with the understandings supported by the RCF) aimed to improve tax and customs

revenue collections, while increasing funding of priority public infrastructure and social spending.2
Tax revenues are estimated to have fallen short of the level envisaged in the supplementary budget
(by about 1 percent of GDP), which constrained expenditure (Tables 3 and 4). Donor budgetary
financing only became available towards the very end of the year. There continued to be budgetary
pressures from fuel subsidies, public enterprises, and the civil service pension fund, which have
diverted resources from high-priority spending. However, progress was made in coming to
agreement with creditors on a schedule for the clearance of domestic arrears and on some first
steps in defining a plan to shore up the finances of JIRAMA. In addition, a priority PFM action plan
was adopted. FAD technical assistance was provided on revenue administration, tax policy, PFM, and
fuel subsidy reform.
10. Broad money growth was driven by lending to the private sector in 2014. Growing
demand for short-term borrowing by the private sector and concerns about the weakening currency
prompted domestic interest rates to increase and raised the cost of domestic government financing.
As a result, the government relied on statutory advances from the central bank (1.4 percent of GDP
at end-November 2014, in excess of what was envisaged but within the norms envisaged in the
central bank law) as an alternative means of financing (Figure 5 and Tables 6 and 7). Contrary to
expectations, central bank international reserves dwindled somewhat.
11. The financial sector remains shallow and with limited access. Domestic credit as a share of
GDP remains low and the economy is largely cash based. Access to credit is expensive and limited,
especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and households. There is no stock exchange or
debt market, outside of government paper. The financial sector comprises 11 banks, 5 financial
establishments, 30 micro-finance institutions (MFIs), and 5 insurance companies. The financial sector
is dominated by banks (all-but-one foreign owned) that offer basic savings instruments and credit to
a limited customer base. New banks have entered the financial market in recent years and a new
investor acquired a controlling position in one of the largest banks in 2014. At the same time, the
MFIs have been growing rapidly, albeit from a low base.
12. While financial soundness indicators seem satisfactory in the aggregate, there are
pockets of vulnerability (Table 8). Following governance problems, one undercapitalized nonsystemic bank was closed in 2014, triggering some losses in other financial institutions with
cross-deposits. A temporary administrator was appointed to develop a restructuring plan for
underperforming MFIs.
13. The current account deficit (including official transfers) narrowed to an estimated
2 percent of GDP in 2014. The improvement was driven by growing mineral exports, decreasing
food import needs, and lower-than-anticipated international oil prices (Figure 4 and Table 5).
External vulnerabilities are accented by relatively low international reserves (now at 2 months import
cover).
2

Public spending on health and education increased from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to about 4 percent of GDP in
the 2014 supplementary budget.

14. Competitiveness has declined in recent years. Recent volatility in balance of payments
flows, driven by large scale mining projects and the political crisis, make a definitive assessment of
Madagascar’s exchange rate difficult. The three models that were used to assess the REER against
fundamentals do not provide a definitive assessment on the deviation from fundamentals. (Box 2
and see the Selected Issues Paper on the external sector assessment). However, there have been
recent downward trends in competiveness indicators, such as the World Bank Doing Business Report
(latest ranking: 163rd out of 189 countries) and the WEF Competiveness Index. The official exchange
rate is depreciating gradually (10 percent y-o-y in nominal effective terms at end-September 2014
and 14 percent y-o-y versus the U.S. dollar at end-November 2014) and the central bank has been
propping up the published exchange rate via round-trip bilateral transactions.3 Due to an illiquid
official market, anecdotal evidence suggests that a significant amount of large foreign exchange
transactions take place bilaterally at a somewhat more depreciated rate.

3

The published exchange rate is based on the weighted average of transactions in the official market. The central
bank has been influencing marginally the published rate by undertaking near-instantaneous round-trip transactions
with counterparts at the end of the day at rates that differ from the daily average up until that point.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The model-based analysis does not provide a definitive assessment on exchange rate valuation.
However, market indicators suggest that competiveness could be improved.
Balance of payments and REER performance
Balance of payments flows have been highly volatile in recent years, which make a definitive
assessment of Madagascar’s exchange rate valuation. Large scale mining investments, volatile
energy and food prices and the decline in donor flows following the political crisis have all
contributed to this volatility. Foreign exchange reserves have responded by peaking at 4
months of import cover in 2010, before declining to around 2 months at present.
Exchange rate valuation models
The macroeconomic balance approach (‘EBA-Lite' and GCER) suggests that the current account
deficit is higher than that implied by cross-country saving-investment norms. The CGER
methodology gives ambiguous results, while the EBA-Lite methodology suggests some
overvaluation.
The external stability approach suggests that the current account is greater than that needed
to stabilize the current net foreign asset (NFA) position. For a low-income country, such as
Madagascar, a higher ‘steady-state’ NFA is perhaps more appropriate, which would reduce the
size of the implied overvaluation.
The baseline equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests a relatively large
overvaluation of the exchange rate. However, this model is sensitive to structural breaks in the
data – one such event could be the large-scale mining projects, which began in 2008.
Controlling for this generates a model implied exchange rate that that is less overvalued.
Survey measures of competitiveness
A steady deterioration in survey based measures of competitiveness adds further evidence that
the equilibrium exchange rate may be overvalued. These measures expose deep structural
weaknesses in Madagascar’s ability to export goods and attract foreign investment.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15. The authorities are at a crossroads: to either undertake a well-prioritized medium-term
economic program that is implemented concertedly or to continue on the path of stagnation
and persistent poverty. This context served as the framework for the 2014 Article IV discussions.
The authorities’ forthcoming National Development Plan would delineate the principal axes of
reform and policy priorities for the coming years. It is envisaged that such reforms could increase
real growth to 5 percent a year, driven by agriculture (both higher productivity and expansion),
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

mining (given abundant natural resources), labor-intensive manufacturing including textiles
(absorbing a rapidly growing labor force), and tourism (given the strong potential for ecotourism)
(Figure 6). Investment, both public and private, would need to be scaled up accordingly across
various sectors, with additional resources needed to close the balance of payments and fiscal gaps
over the medium term.
16. There are significant downside risks (Box 3). The key risk is domestic and linked to slow
implementation of reforms, which would cap economic growth to well below 5 percent a year. The
lack of economic and structural reforms would not attract sufficient resources from investors and
development partners, forcing a significant import compression and putting pressure on foreign
exchange reserves. This would come at a considerable cost, as essential investments in infrastructure
would fall short of expectations. Lack of progress in tackling persistent poverty could also increase
social tensions. One external risk is the volatility in oil prices, which on the down-side could lead to
BOP and fiscal pressures. A wider spread of the Ebola pandemic could also have negative but likelymodest indirect effects (primarily linked to tourism). A more direct and significant effect could stem
from a possible intensification and persistence of the recent outbreak of bubonic plague. Appendix I
presents the highlights of what an alternative muddling-through low-growth scenario would imply.
17. Authorities’ views. Although recognizing that downside risks are significant, the authorities
were confident about the possibility of accelerating the pace of recovery and achieving annual
economic growth of 5 percent or more starting in 2015. They stressed the prudent assumptions
used for their projections, and several favorable factors that should support economic activity, such
as an expected rebound in the production of rice and other agricultural products, a recovery in
manufacturing exports (mainly textiles) thanks to the recent restoration of AGOA trade privileges,
and additional external financing that should reactivate infrastructure projects. The authorities were
of the view that, with a more ambitious scaling-up of infrastructure projects (subject to available
financing), one could envisage stronger economic growth rates of up to 10 percent per year over
the medium-term. The authorities noted that an eventual ECF program would provide needed
support to their medium-term reform plans.

most likely to materialize in the view of the IMF staff. The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and

POLICY DISCUSSIONS—IMPROVING SUSTAINABLE
GROWTH AND REDUCING POVERTY
A. Fiscal Policy: Creating Room for Pro-Poor/Pro-Growth Spending
18. The key fiscal policy goal is to generate budgetary space in support of inclusive growth
and poverty reduction. Against this backdrop, and as reflected in the draft 2015 budget,
discussions focused on (i) revenue mobilization; (ii) the level and composition of public spending;
(iii) financing options; and (iv) public financial management (PFM) reforms to improve the
effectiveness of spending.
19. The recently approved 2015 budget law envisages an overall fiscal deficit of 2.7 percent
of GDP by harnessing available resources to raise critical spending. Overall, staff are of the view that
the budget’s intentions are good, but will need to bolstered by a strong commitment in
implementation, particularly in terms of improving tax revenue. Tax revenues are projected to
increase to 11.5 percent of GDP (from about 10 percent in 2014), primarily as a result of improved
revenue administration. Key initiatives in this area will include the automation of VAT cross-checking,
tightening excise controls, increasing risk-based controls at customs, and improving
customs/domestic tax agency cooperation. The wage bill envisages the regularization of some
10,000 temporary (FRAM) teachers (raising the total payroll to 183,000 civil servants) and a 5 percent
structural salary increase. The ongoing phase-out of fuel price subsidies, compensated by a small
targeted urban transport subsidy, will limit spending on transfers and subsidies. Increased external
financing will support higher capital spending. Domestic arrears of about 0.6 percent of GDP will be
cleared during 2015, with the remainder being settled in subsequent years.
20. Improved revenue mobilization is critical (see the Selected Issues Paper on tax revenues).
Recent in-depth reviews of the general tax code and of revenue administration procedures indicate
that Madagascar’s tax rates are by-and-large consistent with those of a modern tax system, but
weaknesses in revenue administration and tax exemptions have eroded the tax base. In this context,
it will be important to finalize and implement medium-term reform plans for the customs and tax
administrations, supported by ongoing technical assistance.
21. Increasing and improving the composition of public expenditure are priorities. While the
self-imposed budgetary austerity during the transition years helped avert a macroeconomic crisis,
public spending has been inadequate to address Madagascar’s development needs. Expenditure
should be rebalanced in favor of priority spending on education, health, and infrastructure. Potential
areas for cost savings include, inter alia, reducing inefficient subsidies and budgetary transfers to
loss-making public enterprises and tackling the underfunding of the civil service pension funds.4

The 2015 budget envisages fuel subsidies of 0.1 percent of GDP, transfers to JIRAMA of 0.4 percent of GDP, and
transfers to the civil service pension fund of 0.5 percent of GDP.

22. PFM reforms would enhance the efficiency of public finances. There has been some
deterioration in PFM performance in recent years, as evidenced by their CPIA rating and the recently
published 2013 PEFA self-assessment. The overall performance of the PFM system has not improved
since the period 2006-2008 and nine performance indicators have been downgraded. Based on
these findings, the authorities have adopted in October 2014 a Priority Action Plan (PAP) for PFM
reforms to address several weaknesses by the end of 2015 and prepare the ground for a PFM reform
strategy covering the period 2016–18.
23. Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred that revenue performance was weak, and
emphasized that the 2008 tax reforms had simplified the tax system and current weaknesses were
mostly due to challenges in revenue administration. Their medium-term goal was a tax ratio
(excluding VAT refunds) of 14 percent of GDP, which they viewed as achievable. Their near-term
intention was to intensify revenue administration reforms, with a focus on widening the tax base and
better audit. An effort to modernize the Mining and Petroleum Codes was also underway.
Emphasizing the importance of transparency, the authorities indicated that they would issue an
EITI reconciliation report for 2012 and 2013 by end-December 2014, following the lifting (in
June 2014) of their suspension as an EITI candidate country.
24. With regards to spending, the 2014 supplementary budget launched the process of raising
the level and improving the composition of spending and the forthcoming NDP will flesh out their
medium-term priorities. The authorities confirmed their intention of eliminate fuel price subsidies by
mid-2015. A plan to revitalize JIRAMA is being prepared, with the assistance of the World Bank. New
legislation allows for greater scrutiny of JIRAMA’s accounts and its board of directors was replaced
in October 2014. With regards to financing, the authorities agreed to refrain from a net increase in
statutory advances during 2015. The authorities noted recent advances in PFM reform, including the

(see the Selected Issues Paper on exchange rate pass-through). Against this background, staff
advised the authorities to continue to maintain a floating exchange rate and pursue a monetary
policy aimed at steadily increasing international reserves and maintaining single-digit inflation.
Using an assumption that the long-term opportunity cost of holding reserves is 7 percent,
Madagascar’s optimal reserve cover is estimated at 3½ months of import cover, based on the Fund’s
reserve adequacy metric.
26. A more active monetary policy would improve its transmission mechanism. In addition
to giving more priority to mopping up excess liquidity through deposit auctions (appels d’offre
négatifs (AON)), it would give more relevance to the reference rate, which has not moved for several
years. To date, monetary policy has been relatively passive, allowing for large excess bank reserves
regularly in recent years, and subject to fiscal dominance in 2014, when the government increasingly
resorted to statutory advances from the central bank. The central bank also needs to be
recapitalized, due to some losses in recent years, which will also help provide the central bank with
instruments for liquidity operations.
27. The effectiveness of central bank operations would benefit from a well-prioritized
reform agenda. Priorities include measures to make the foreign-exchange interbank market more
efficient and moving towards international best practice, updating the regulatory framework for
banking sector supervision, and strengthening reserve management and central bank internal audit
and accounting.
28. An updated safeguards assessment identified additional steps to enhance the
independence of the Central Bank. The assessment noted that the political crisis in 2009 had
affected the Central Bank’s governance and financial autonomy, and interrupted the development of
internal controls. The appointment of the Central Bank Governor in October 2014 was an important
step towards restoring stability of the

assessment also recommended that an

has been provided to review the legal
framework of the central bank, so as to
strengthen its independence by reviewing its mandates, functions, instruments, governance and
control mechanisms.
29. Authorities’ views. The authorities gave priority to improving the effectiveness of central
bank operations and reviewing the legal framework of the central bank. The Central Bank has
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

already initiated a review of its legal framework to support the necessary reforms and strengthen its
autonomy. As priority actions, the audited financial accounts for the Central Bank for 2010–13 were
approved for publication, and the Central Bank intends to move forward with the creation of an
Audit Committee of its Board. As regards foreign exchange reserves, the central bank indicated its
intention to gradually increase its foreign reserves and scale back buyback transactions. With
regards to the need to recapitalize the central bank, the government has decided to settle
outstanding obligations through securitization and issuance of interest-bearing debt instruments,
though the needed appropriations may need to wait for the supplementary 2015 budget.
30. In terms of the financial sector, there are some emerging challenges in terms of
supervision of banks and MFIs (see the Selected Issues Paper on the financial sector). While
non-performing loans are on average at a moderate level, credit risk remains important and should
be monitored carefully. A few banks have a significant share of their lending focused on a few large
clients. Indirect interconnectedness is high, as many banks have deposits in other banks and banks
refinance MFIs. As all-but-one banks is foreign owned, it is important to develop Memoranda of
Understandings with the foreign supervisors of the parent companies. Additional resources should
be provided to the banking supervisors (CSBF) to increase the frequency of onsite supervision and
move towards a risk-based supervision system. Continued financial deepening would help to
increase domestic savings, make a contribution to poverty reduction, and make the country less
vulnerable to external shocks. Supervision of MFIs (currently the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance) needs to be strengthened significantly.
31. Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized the need to increase the sophistication of their
banking supervision to match that of the banks. In addition to launching their own financial stability
report and increasing their staffing level, the CSBF is in the process of preparing a three-year
strategic plan. The priorities are to update the legal framework for banking supervision and align it
with best international practices, move towards risk-based banking supervision, and automate data
collection, thereby freeing up more time for analysis of the financial sector data.

C. Supporting Inclusive Growth
32. The government has an important role
to play in raising Madagascar’s growth
potential and making it inclusive and
equitable. A majority of the population is now
extremely poor with deteriorating access to
education and health. Urgent actions are required
to: (i) improve governance and strengthen
institutions; (ii) raise infrastructure investment;
(iii) mobilize additional resources for health and
education; and (iv) strengthen employment
creating policies.

(iii) encouraging foreign investment.
34. Agriculture, tourism, and construction are the key employment-generating sectors.
While agriculture accounts for about 80 percent of employment, it is dominated by low productivity
subsistence farming with yields that are barely enough to feed a family. Overall, agriculture
contributes about 25 percent of GDP. The level of absolute poverty is almost twice as high in rural
areas in comparison with urban areas. An action plan is envisaged with measures to improve landownership regulation and transparency, productivity growth (especially for rice), and the investment
environment to attract private sector players. In tourism, the ambitious medium-term target of one
million visitors up from 200,000 in 2013 (compared to 375,000 pre-crisis in 2008) will require human
capacity building, harmonization of sector standards, attracting visitors from more countries, and
promoting and securing investment. The construction sector should benefit from a recovery in other
sectors and the revival of major infrastructure projects.
35. Spending on education and health is a key priority: The link between poverty and lack of
education is clear. Inadequate education is a main barrier to moving out of poverty. Public spending
on education has declined in recent years from a starting point already below that of other SubSaharan African (SSA) countries. As a result, most education indicators have deteriorated with falling
enrollment in primary education, and about half a million children who should but do not attend
primary education. Moreover, only children from the highest consumption quintile (covering the
most affluent 20 percent of the population) have a chance (albeit small) of attending post-secondary
education (Figure 7). Spending on health also is lower than in other SSA countries. A declining
proportion of the population is choosing, or can afford, to visit a health center and the use of formal
healthcare varies significantly depending on the income of the households. Against this background,
it is crucial that public spending on health and education is bolstered within the constraints of the
budgetary framework.

36. Addressing the infrastructure gap is critical for growth and to alleviate rural poverty.
Fostering a climate-smart agriculture with higher productivity and larger areas under cultivation
would require significant investment in new roads and irrigation. As a background, the World Bank
estimates the cost of just rehabilitating the existing significantly deteriorated road network to be
US$1.5 billion (14 percent of GDP). In terms of

effective manner.

37. To maintain macroeconomic stability, large spending needs must be balanced against
available financing and absorptive capacity. Madagascar’s public debt was 34 percent of GDP at
end-2013, below that of most SSA countries. As a result of prudent borrowing, the vast majority of
external debt has been on highly concessional terms, which leaves Madagascar with sufficient space
to borrow from external sources in coming years. However, strengthening revenue collection and
minimizing non-concessional borrowing will play an important role in maintaining Madagascar’s
“low” risk of debt distress. As such, new external borrowing should primarily be on concessional
terms and based on priorities established in the medium-term NDP and the Public Investment Plan.
A well-functioning project selection and evaluation process—that identifies projects with the highest
pay-offs—would help to secure financing and relevant expertise on best available terms. While
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) could be explored as additional funding options for large-scale
infrastructure projects, they would need to be underpinned by strong legal and institutional
frameworks to limit fiscal risks.
38. Authorities’ views. The authorities viewed the forthcoming NDP covering 2015–19 as critical
in laying out reforms to improve governance and make growth more inclusive. To build consensus
behind the NDP, they are engaging in a consultative dialogue including stakeholders from all parts
of the society. The NDP will include a well-prioritized investment plan with estimated financing
needs and is expected to be completed and presented to Madagascar’s development partners in
2015. While the authorities recognized the importance of seeking concessional sources of financing
to ensure sustainability, they also argued that, if these were not forthcoming from development
partners, there could be merit in funding critical projects on non-concessional terms—they stressed
the critical need to alleviate bottlenecks in the electricity sector and in transport infrastructure. They

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

were keen to consider some on semi-concessional terms (such as those offered by the African
Development Bank) given Madagascar’s currently low debt levels.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39. Despite ample upside potential, periods of rapid economic growth have been disrupted
by recurring political crises that have left Madagascar extremely poor. Its fractious political
context, weak institutions and governance, binding resource constraints, and vulnerability to shocks
create significant dimensions of fragility. There is an urgent need to reverse the ongoing
deterioration in development indicators by boosting pro-poor growth while preserving
macroeconomic stability.
40. The government has an important role to play in raising Madagascar’s growth potential
and making it inclusive. A comprehensive National Development Plan (under preparation) with
well-prioritized reforms and a costed investment plan would send a clear signal, both within society
and to development partners, of the government’s medium-term policy objectives and commitment.
To help build public support for continued reforms, it will be important to identify and include
measures that can build an early track record of “small victories/quick wins,” drawing on the
National Development Plan and ongoing technical assistance.
41. While the growth outlook is positive, the downside risks are considerable. The main risk
is policy uncertainty and related reform delays that could impact investment (both domestic and
external) and development partner support, which would force a significant import compression that
could risk destabilizing the economy. The trigger for less-than-projected capital inflows could be
either domestic (delays in implementing economic reforms) or external (such as an extended period
of slow global growth reducing financing from both official and private sources).
42. Increasing fiscal space will be important to in order to raise the level and efficiency of
pro-poor/pro-growth spending. This would require both a broadening of the tax base, supported
by a comprehensive revenue mobilization strategy, and improvements in the composition and
quality of budgetary spending. Notwithstanding several reform efforts since the 1990s, tax revenues
have fallen back to historically low levels because of a growing informal economy, weakening tax
and customs administration, and increasing corruption. Well-designed medium-term plans to
broaden the tax base and improve customs and tax administration reforms will be necessary to
achieve the authorities’ revenue target. It will also be important to reduce inefficient subsidies and
budgetary transfers to loss-making public enterprises, such as JIRAMA, and make inroads in
addressing the imbalances of the civil service pension funds. Continued strengthening of public
financial management is also needed.
43. With strong policy commitments and improved domestic revenue generation, there is
some room for careful external borrowing over the medium term. The public debt level is
relatively low and there is an urgent need for investment and maintenance to prevent a possible
collapse of the energy and transport infrastructure after years of compressed capital spending. The

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

authorities should make every effort to ensure that the government borrows on concessional terms
while requesting the international community to provide strong support. This will require quickly
finalizing the development plan, prioritizing investment, and asking donors to finance it without
delay. If a financing gap still remains, semi-concessional loans can be considered. More generally,
alternative financing modalities, such as PPPs, need to be undertaken carefully, with supportive legal
and institutional frameworks.
44. The central bank needs to be able to pursue an independent monetary policy. Important
components of this would include increasing the independence of the Central Bank, strengthening
its oversight mechanisms, and recapitalizing it. This would also facilitate a more active monetary
policy that would give priority to mopping up excess liquidity and give more significance to the
reference rate. The use of statutory advances to the budget from the central bank should be
avoided.
45. The current floating exchange rate regime is appropriate, but there is a need for the
central bank to increase its international reserves. The flexibility of the exchange rate has helped
the economy to adjust to shocks, and while the exchange rate does not appear out of line with
fundamentals, additional steps should be taken to improve competitiveness. By avoiding buyback
transactions, the Central Bank can facilitate the reabsorption of the off-market transactions that
emerged in 2013, while steadily increasing its international reserves to at least 3 months of import
cover.
46. Challenges in banking supervision should be tackled proactively. Ongoing efforts to
upgrade the quality of supervision, including launching of a financial stability report and preparing a
three-year strategic plan, are welcome. Continued monitoring of risk in both the banking and
microfinance sectors is critical. Impactful supervision will involve both a sound regulatory framework
and timely actions.
47. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
database remains weak, particularly in the areas of real sector, government finances, the balance of
payments, and social statistics.
48. An acceleration of economic and structural reforms will unleash Madagascar’s
significant potential for the benefit of the entire population. Priority should be given to reforms
that: (i) raise the level and efficiency of pro-poor/pro-growth government spending; (ii) improve
governance and strengthen institutions, including in the judicial system and the AML/CFT regime,
(iii) increase high return infrastructure investment; and (iv) improve the business climate so as to
achieve greater employment and private sector growth.
49. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix I. Alternative Medium-Term Scenario—Lower
Growth
The purpose of the alternative scenario is to illustrate a medium-term framework, based on weaker
policies in the absence of the fundamental reforms that are needed to raise the potential growth of
the Madagascar economy.
Under the alternative low-growth slow-reform scenario, real GDP is projected to grow by
3 percent a year, which is 2 percent lower than projected in the baseline scenario. This would be
only marginally faster than population growth, and in line with Madagascar’s average GDP
growth over the last 15 years. Development partners and foreign investors are assumed to scale
down plans for external financing and investment and as a result, inflows to the capital and
financial account (primarily FDI flows and donor financing) would be lower. As a result, total
external financing would decline by about 3½ percentage points of GDP on average.
Less external financing would force a significant import compression and the current account
would improve by close to 2½ percentage points of GDP on average. The scenario assumes that
the remaining financing gap would be closed by lower gross official reserves than in the baseline
scenario. Gross reserves are assumed to remain flat in the alternative scenario, while they would
increase to 2.8 months of import cover by 2019 in the baseline.
A slow pace of reforms would also have implications for the revenue generation with tax and
customs revenue collections remaining more or less constant in percent of GDP. In total, tax
revenue and grants are projected at 11.7 percent of GDP in 2019 (3½ percentage points of GDP
lower than in the baseline). In response, the authorities would be expected to reduce spending
including in terms of capital expenditure and social priority spending (classified under other
current spending). The financing of the deficit would also shift from foreign to domestic
borrowing with adverse effects on private credit growth.
The saving-investment balance would improve as a result of the import compression and the
improved current account. However, this superficial improvement would come at a considerable
cost as total investment would be lower and the difference between the lower-growth scenario
and the baseline would increase over time. By 2019, total investment is projected to about
11½ percent of GDP in the lower-growth scenario compared with 16 percent of GDP in the
baseline. Essential investment in infrastructure and new job-creating productive capacity would,
thus, not take place in the lower-growth scenario.

Fund as end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM) is expected to be
completed by end-December 2014. The assessment noted that governance arrangements do not
provide for adequate oversight and recommended the establishment of an audit committee of
the BCM’s Board. The central bank’s financial autonomy has been compromised; the BCM has
significant outstanding claims on the government and is in a negative equity position.
Transparency and accountability practices are also lacking. Most important, regular publication of
audited financial statements should be restored and external audit quality improved. The
authorities have already taken steps to address some of the assessment’s recommendations,
including through technical assistance to review the BCM legal framework.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Republic of Madagascar is the Malagasy ariary. The de jure exchange rate
arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market.
The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large
exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily
interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and
amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating.

The Republic of Madagascar accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the IMF Articles of
Agreement with effect from September 18, 1996. The Republic of Madagascar maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

WORLD BANK—IMF COLLABORATION
50. The Fund and the Bank teams working on Madagascar met to discuss reform
priorities and the division of labor. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Tsibouris (IMF) and
Ms. Kubota (World Bank).
51. The teams agreed that Madagascar’s main economic challenge is to create the
foundation for a sustained economic recovery and poverty reduction. To meet this
challenge, Madagascar needs to: (i) broaden the tax base and implement tax policy and revenue
administration reforms; (ii) strengthen its public financial management, including: strengthening
monitoring and control; improving the allocation and use of public resources to raise the
economy’s productivity, improve service delivery, and help meet acute social needs of vulnerable
groups; (iii) improve management of public enterprises, including the public energy and water
utility company JIRAMA; (iv) advance other policies that support economic growth, including
actions that strengthen governance and create a level playing field for the private sector; (v)
proceed with reforms that improve central bank operations and strengthen financial sector
stability; and (vi) promote financial access and financial inclusion..
52. Based on this assessment, the teams identified the following structural reform areas
as macro-critical:


Tax policy and revenue administration reform: Tax revenues have fallen back to
historically low levels because of a growing informal economy, increasing corruption, and
weakening tax and customs administration.



Public financial management (PFM) reform: Madagascar’s development challenges cannot
be resolved without scaled up fiscal spending, which in turn calls for a stronger PFM system.
Key reforms include improving budget preparation (with links to a macro-fiscal framework),
strengthening fiscal discipline, and finalizing a plan to clear domestic payment arrears.



Public investment and debt management: Infrastructure gaps create binding constraints to
growth. There is need to strengthen the institutional capacity to close the infrastructure gap
through implementation of well-prioritized projects, preparation of a debt management
strategy that maintains debt at sustainable levels, and establishment of a modern legal
framework for private-public partnerships (PPPs).



Service delivery and social safety nets: Public spending on health and education is lagging
compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries, the gap is growing, and access and use of
basic healthcare is not universal, decreasing, and increasingly rationed by money. It will be
important to scale up and target fiscal spending in favor of the most vulnerable, through
demand side interventions such as provision of school kits and cash transfer to households
conditional on children attending school, and supply side interventions such as rehabilitation
of basic health centers, increased provision of basic vaccines, and repairing school buildings.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR



Public enterprise reform: Public enterprises were established with the objective of
providing better services and products at less cost to the consumers. However, in some cases
(including the public utility company JIRAMA) consumers are now offered poor services from
inefficient companies that also need government subsidies to run their operations. The aim
of public enterprise reform is to improve services, develop sectoral policies and appropriate
regulatory frameworks, and restructure inefficient public enterprises.



Central bank operations: There is a need to develop a well-prioritized reform agenda to
improve central bank operations.



Financial sector stability: While the banking sector has been resilient and stable throughout
the recent crisis, updating the procedures and capacity of banking supervision and the
supervision of the microfinance sector is a priority.



Financial access and inclusion: The financial sector is not in a position to fully support
economic development, in light of the low levels of access to financial services for individuals
as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A coherent support framework for
financial inclusion needs to be put in place addressing access to savings, credits, insurance,
and payment systems.



Business environment reform: Reforms advancing governance and the rule of law and
creating a level playing field would be critical to improve the business climate.



Reform of the statistical system: Key statistics are provided by the National Institute of
Statistics (NIS) and other government agencies, as the central bank and ministries, and NIS
regularly undertakes standard economic and social surveys with donor financing. However,
quality and timely reporting remains an issue of concern. The last population census was held
in 1993 and the national accounts are currently based on the 1968 system of national
accounts. The quality of sector statistics can be improved, including through better
coordination. While data production has increased in recent years, data access remains
challenging.



Public expenditure efficiency: Public expenditure is highly concentrated in the central
government. Current expenditure represented 80 percent of the central government
expenditure in 2013, half of which was allocated to wages and salaries and regressive
subsidies on fuel and electricity consumed a large share of the remaining current
expenditure. Important to rebalance spending in favor of social priorities and improve the
efficiency of allocated resources.

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

53.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:



Tax policy and revenue administration reform: Shared responsibility. The Fund will
provide TA to improve tax and customs administration. In tax administration, reforms would
aim to modernize and simplify procedures, make better use of risk analysis to strengthen tax
compliance and broaden the tax base, establish an organization focused on tax payer service,
and strengthen oversight and management. In customs, reforms would aim to improve the
targeting of customs controls with an increased focus on fighting customs fraud, advance
and shorten customs clearance procedures and make them compatible with international
standards, strengthen internal control mechanisms, and offer specialized training to staff. The
Bank is preparing a new public sector support project to respond to the government’s
request to reducing informality.



PFM reform: Shared responsibility. The Fund TA will support the authorities’ efforts to
develop a prioritized medium-term reform agenda. Fund TA will also aim at: (i) developing
tools, procedures, and capacities required by a transparent formulation, management, and
execution of the budget; (ii) strengthening the production and dissemination to the public of
fiscal information; and (iii) strengthening the macro-fiscal capacity. The Bank’s public sector
project will support government’s effort in improving social sector PFM efficiency.



Public investment and debt management: To advance the public investment capacity, the
Bank has conducted a DeMPA exercise and provided follow up assistance in developing a
reform program. The Bank has also provided training on debt sustainability analysis and
medium-term debt strategy in the past year, and stands ready to provide any further support
that the public debt department may need to implement the reform program.



Service delivery and social safety nets: The Bank will take the lead. To support the
identification of needs and priority actions, the bank published a comprehensive poverty
analysis in March 2014. Through the Emergency Food Security and Social Protection Project
the Bank is supporting a labor-intensive public works program as well as the design and
implementation of a pilot Conditional Cash Transfer program. A Safety Nets Project under
preparation will prepare the ground for a more systematic and programmatic approach to
social safety nets as part of a larger social protection policy.



Public enterprise reform: The Bank is preparing an energy sector project to provide
technical assistance and financial support in developing a strategy to overhaul JIRAMA to
improve the company’s finances and service delivery. The project will also support
emergency repairs of JIRAMA’s assets, such as the purchase of parts needed to remobilize
the generation capacity that has fallen into disrepair.



Central bank operations: The IMF will take the lead. The Fund will assist the authorities in
developing a well-prioritized reform agenda to improve central bank operations, including in
the areas of monetary policy, reserve management, and central bank internal audit and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

accounting. The Fund will also offer technical assistance to make the foreign exchange
market and the Treasury bill market more efficient.


Financial sector stability: The Bank and the Fund will coordinate in providing support to
banking supervision (CSBF) to improve efficiency, including by updating the regulatory
framework for banking sector supervision. The Bank will take the lead in supporting the CSBF
in strengthening capacity for supervision of the microfinance sector and the related
regulatory and supervisory framework. The Bank will also support the insurance supervision
department at the ministry of finance to build capacity for effective supervision of the
insurance sector.



Financial access and inclusion: The Bank will take the lead to develop micro insurance and
the payment system (including mobile and branchless banking). The Bank will also continue
to strengthen its engagement in the area of SME finance and will step up efforts to promote
financial literacy.



Business environment reform: The Bank will take the lead. A Second Integrated Growth
Poles project (PIC2) is being prepared to increase economic opportunities and access to
enabling services in selected regions. At the national level, the project will support a series of
investment climate reforms and help strengthen the public-private interface to increase
investor confidence and private investment. At the regional level, the project will support the
implementation of targeted and integrated interventions to overcome barriers to private
investment and job creation in poor regions with high growth potential



Reform of the statistical system: Shared responsibility. The Fund will offer technical
assistance in national accounts and price statistics. The Bank supports NIS through a trust
fund and main activities include: (i) preparing the general population and housing census
(planned for 2016); (ii) revising national accounts for 2007-12 using the 1993 system of
national accounts and rebasing to 2007; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) updating the National
Strategy for the Development of Statistics. Madagascar is also one of the pilot countries for
the implementation of the Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystems Service.



Public expenditure efficiency: The Bank will finalize a public expenditure review in health
and education. The results will form the basis of the reform programs that will be supported
by the Public Sector project under preparation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of December 10, 2014)
I.
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
database remains weak, particularly in the areas of real sector, government finances, the balance of
payments, and social statistics. Fund technical assistance was interrupted in 2009 in response to an
unconstitutional change of government. Following re-engagement in March 2014, IMF staff have
undertaken missions to assess the need for technical assistance in statistics.
National Accounts: Production of complete national accounts (based on benchmark data) is
infrequent and depends on irregularly collected source data. The last complete sets of benchmark
data cover 2013. The reliability of national accounts estimates remains weak due to gaps in the
source data and methodological shortcomings. In particular, the estimates of agricultural activities
are poor because there is no suitable information about the size and the evolution of this sector.
Moreover, service activities are not properly covered and little information is available on the
magnitude of the informal sector. INSTAT used to produce two industrial production indices, one for
the export processing zone (IPI-ZF) and the other for enterprises outside the export processing zone
(IPI-RC) but the production has been suspended due to financing issues.
Price Statistics: The current consumer price index (CPI) covers the seven principal cities, has a base
year of 2000, and expenditure weights based on the 1999 household survey. The CPI is generally
reported to Fund staff on a timely basis. Data on producer prices, “l’Indice de la Production
Industrielle (IPI)”, were also available till 2008 but the publication has been suspended since then
due to financing issues.
Government Finance Statistics: The 2004 multi-sector mission found significant gaps in the
coverage of government financial statistics (GFS) and recommended that it be broadened to include
public agencies that are part of the central government. Also, the mission made recommendations
on the classification and recording of transactions, as well as the calculation of domestic arrears.
Data on central government financial operations are disseminated only annually. Since August 2014,
data on public debt are disseminated with the publication of the “Statistical Bulletin of Debt”.
Madagascar does not report sub-annual data for publication in International Finance Statistics (IFS).
Monetary Statistics: The BCM has reported monetary data to STA for publication in IFS since
August 2001.
Balance of Payments: The current compilation system is flawed, external trade data are derived
from customs data that suffer from inadequate coverage and deficient recording procedures. The
significant amount of smuggling, particularly in the mining sector, further reduces the reliability of
the trade data. The 2004 multi-sector technical assistance mission reviewed progress in the
transition to BPM5. The mission noted that the compilation system was still hampered by such
recurring issues as excessive processing lags due to partial automation of customs reports and
inadequate coverage of several transactions. The compilation of external debt statistics is generally
satisfactory.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
Madagascar participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2004.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Madagascar
On January 16, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Madagascar.
Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. In a fragile environment, the uncertainty linked
to political instability, weak institutions, and weak governance has been eroding the foundation for solid
economic growth. Since the political crisis in 2009, economic growth has been slow and social services,
including basic health care and primary education, have deteriorated. The government that assumed
power in early 2014, following constitutional elections, has shown a commitment to addressing
Madagascar’s challenges.
There are early signs of an economic recovery in 2014, with growth estimated at 3 percent and December
inflation under 7 percent. The current account deficit is projected to have narrowed to about 2 percent of
GDP in 2014 driven by growing mineral exports, decreasing food import needs, and lower-thananticipated international oil prices. Growing credit demand prompted domestic interest rates to increase
and raised the cost of domestic budgetary financing, leading the government to increase statutory
advances from the central bank.
Given still weak tax revenue collections, spending on high-priority areas, such as education and health,
continued to be constrained in 2014. The need to finance fuel subsidies, public enterprises (such as the
public utility JIRAMA), and the under-funded civil service pension fund added to budgetary pressures. At
the same time, the authorities started to clear domestic budgetary arrears, took steps to define a plan to
shore up the finances of JIRAMA, and adopted a priority action plan to strengthen public financial
management.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the first signs of economic recovery in 2014. Nevertheless, the country is
facing complex challenges stemming from weak institutions and governance, binding resource
constraints, vulnerability to shocks, and the urgent need to reverse the deterioration of development
indicators. Directors called for an acceleration of economic and structural reforms to unleash
Madagascar’s significant potential. The forthcoming National Development Plan should give priority to
reforms that would raise the level and efficiency of pro-poor/pro-growth government spending, improve
governance and strengthen institutions, increase high-return infrastructure investment, and improve the
business climate. Steadfast implementation of these reforms will promote employment and private sector
growth and reduce poverty.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on increasing fiscal space for urgent social spending on health
and education and infrastructure investment. Reforms in this area should involve well-designed plans,
with Fund TA support, to mobilize tax revenue and make customs and tax administration more efficient.
On the expenditure side, Directors supported the plans to phase out fuel subsidies, reduce budgetary
transfers to loss-making public enterprises, address imbalances of the civil service pension funds,
continue to strengthen public financial management, and clear domestic arrears.
Directors saw some room for cautious external borrowing over the medium term to address Madagascar’s
pressing infrastructure needs. They encouraged the authorities to make every effort to ensure that such
borrowing will be on concessional terms to the extent possible. Early finalization of the development plan
and prioritization of investments, taking into account absorptive capacity, will be important to mobilize
needed donor financing.
Directors stressed the need to strengthen monetary policy independence. They called for a prompt
recapitalization of the central bank and a strengthening of its oversight mechanisms, and recommended
avoiding the use of statutory advances for budget financing. Efforts to upgrade financial sector
supervision and risk monitoring and develop the financial system should also continue.
Directors viewed Madagascar’s current floating exchange rate regime to be appropriate, noting that it has
helped the economy adjust to external shocks. While the exchange rate does not appear out of line with
fundamentals, Directors encouraged the authorities to take steps to improve competitiveness and increase
international reserves over time.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of Madagascar will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye and Mr. Ismael on Republic of Madagascar
Executive Board Meeting
January 16, 2015
My Malagasy authorities appreciate the informative and candid policy dialogue with the IMF
mission during the 2014 Article IV consultation. They thank staff for their report and the
Selected Issues paper which provide a good analysis of the economic situation as well as helpful
policy recommendations that will be important going forward, as they prepare their mediumterm economic program.
Main Economic Developments, 2009–14
The Malagasy economy went through a period of economic stagnation, during the period of
political crisis, 2009 to 2013. During that time, real economic growth averaged slightly less than
1 per cent. The positive growth between 2011 and 2013 was mainly related to the foreign
investments in two large mining projects. Fiscal and monetary policies, however, remained
prudent, helping maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, though at a high social cost as
the level of poverty increased. Inflation remained at single digits and the nominal exchange rate
depreciated moderately. In spite of cuts in capital and social spending, which helped to keep the
fiscal deficit low, there was an accumulation of domestic arrears but all external obligations were
met.
The new government that took office in early 2014 has expressed its strong determination to
address the deterioration in the economic, financial and social conditions. A number of steps
were taken, and together with a return of confidence and external financing, including Fund
support under an RCF, real GDP is estimated to have grown by about 3 percent in 2014. A
supplementary budget was approved by parliament in June 2014 in line with the RCF-supported
program. This budget aimed primarily at improving tax and customs revenue collections while
increasing funding of public investment and social spending. However, while policies were
broadly implemented, their outcome did not meet expectations. Tax revenues were lower than
projected, and donor financing was not only less substantive than expected but became available
only towards the end of the year. As a result, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have increased to
about 3.2 percent of GDP. The government, however, put in place a plan to eliminate gradually
the petroleum subsidies. It also came to an agreement with domestic creditors on a plan to clear
domestic arrears, and it took initial steps to address the deficit of the JIRAMA.
The authorities also received much needed Fund technical assistance in the areas of tax policy,
revenue administration, PFM and reform of the fuel subsidy system. They are implementing the
recommendations of these technical assistance missions.
In the monetary sector, credit to the government increased as the latter relied on the central bank
to meet some of its financing needs. There was also an increase in the demand of credit by the
private sector, and as a result, interest rates increased. While the financial sector remains broadly
sound, the authorities have taken good note of staff’s advice and intend to upgrade and enforce
regulations more forcefully to ensure that financial stability is maintained.

2

The external current account improved significantly in 2014, with the current account deficit
estimated to have fallen to 2 percent of GDP, on the basis of higher mining exports, lower food
imports, and lower international oil prices. International reserves, however, fell and stood at
about 2 months of imports.
Medium-term Objectives and Policies for 2015
The Malagasy authorities intend to implement a medium-term economic and financial program
aimed at redressing the economy, raising living standards and moving Madagascar to a higher
level of income. In this regard, a National Development Plan (NDP), which has benefited from
consultations with major stakeholders, is being finalized and it sets out the main policy priorities
for the next five years.
The main medium-term objectives include increasing real GDP growth to 5 percent or more
annually, raising the tax ratio to 14 percent of GDP by 2017, and achieving a level of
international reserves equivalent to at least 3 months of imports. The authorities are well aware
of the risks they face, but they are confident that the goals they have set are realistic and
achievable. In addition to working on improving economic and financial performance, they will
also take steps to address governance issues and strengthen institutions, and ensure that growth is
inclusive.
The 2015 Budget was prepared with these objectives in mind. It places a special focus on
enhancing revenue mobilization, and increasing and improving the composition of the public
expenditure, so as to generate fiscal space to support the ongoing efforts to raise economic
growth and reduce poverty. Tax revenues are projected to increase to about 11.5 percent of GDP
mainly from measures aimed at strengthening tax and customs administrations and broadening of
the tax base. Moreover, in view of the growing importance of the mining sector in the economy,
the authorities are also undertaking a review of the Mining and Petroleum Codes with a view to
modernizing them and raising their contribution to the Budget.
On the expenditure side, there is little room for cuts in outlays. On the contrary, the Budget
projects some much needed increases in social spending, and the authorities expect to meet them
with careful expenditure prioritization, and reduction or elimination of subsidies and transfers,
including fuel subsidies and budgetary transfers to loss-making enterprises. Government
transfers to the civil service pension fund are also absorbing an important amount of government
revenue and discussions are underway to find a solution to end these transfers. The authorities
have also budgeted an amount equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP for the clearance of domestic
arrears in 2015. Overall, the 2015 Budget envisages an overall fiscal deficit of 2.7 percent of
GDP.
Monetary policy in 2015 will remain prudent with the objective of keeping inflation low, and
mopping up excess liquidity. The central bank will pursue its efforts to rebuild its reserve
coverage, and allow the official exchange rate to be market-determined. The monetary
authorities will also take steps to improve the effectiveness of central bank operations. In this

3

regard, the central bank is in the process of reviewing its legal framework in order to support the
necessary reforms and strengthen its independence. The authorities agree that the central bank
needs to be recapitalized and in this regard, the government intends to settle outstanding
obligations through securitization and issuance of interest-bearing debt instruments, with the
needed appropriations to be made in a supplementary 2015 budget. The authorities intend to
pursue a reform agenda that includes updating the regulatory framework for banking supervision
and strengthening reserve management and central bank audit and accounting. As noted above,
an important objective of the policies that the Malagasy authorities are putting in place is to raise
real GDP growth by 5 percent per annum or more over the medium term, and to reduce
significantly the level of poverty. Their assumption for growth is based on an expected increase
in agricultural production through better irrigation and extension services for which they are
receiving assistance from the World Bank and the African Development Bank. The authorities
also expect a recovery in the tourism sector and in manufacturing exports, in particular textiles
with the restoration of AGOA trade privileges, additional investments in and production in the
mining sector, and a higher level of public and private spending on infrastructure.
The authorities believe strongly that the lack of infrastructure is a major constraint to growth and
development. There is thus an urgent need to invest in the building of new roads and the
rehabilitation of the existing road networks. There are also significant investment needs in the
electricity and water sectors, as well as in the education and health systems. The NDP that is
being finalized will address these issues and come out with a well-prioritized investment plan
with estimated financing needs. It is the intention of the authorities to rely on the private sector,
in particular, foreign direct investment, and concessional financing for the execution of their
investment projects. However, given the urgency of some of the investments, especially as
regards electricity and roads, if concessional financing is not forthcoming, the authorities may
seek alternative sources of financing after consultation with staff.
Conclusion
Going forward, it is the firm intention of the Malagasy authorities to address the challenges
facing the economy. Implementation of the RCF-supported program was the first step in this
effort. With the normalization of the political situation, my authorities are putting in place their
National Development Plan to address in depth the economic and financial challenges.
Achieving the objectives of growth and poverty reduction, however, will require significant
investment, and in this regard, my authorities plan to present the NDP to development partners
and discuss with them their medium-term plan with a view to receiving their financial support. It
is their intention also to use the Plan as a basis for developing a comprehensive program of
structural reforms and supportive macroeconomic measures for which they intend to request
Fund support under an ECF.
