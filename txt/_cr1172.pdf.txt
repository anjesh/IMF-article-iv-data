I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


In the last two years, the Comoros authorities have made progress in addressing
long-standing inter-entity political tensions, and in initiating much needed
strengthening of the budgetary situation. In parallel, some progress in structural
reforms has been achieved, and a more enabling general reform context is emerging.
Concurrently, the country has enjoyed a surge in donor and private sector interest,
especially from the Gulf region.



Growth has rebounded modestly, and medium-term economic prospects appear
favorable. However, as the authorities concur, a further strengthening of economic
activity and faster progress in poverty alleviation will require continued close
adherence to reforms under the ECF arrangement, including timely implementation of
public utilities and other structural reforms, especially after the December 26, 2010
presidential elections.



The government’s fiscal strategy seeks continued fiscal consolidation to achieve a
sustainable fiscal position and stronger growth. Accordingly, the authorities are
committed to efforts to strengthen revenue and improve the quality of spending.
Enhanced inter-entity cohesion in managing the fiscal agencies and rigorous control of
the wage bill will be critical in the period ahead. To maintain debt sustainability, the
authorities intend to pursue a prudent debt policy, and will rely on grants and highly
concessional loans.



Performance under the ECF-supported program through end-June was
satisfactory. All performance criteria and benchmarks were observed. The authorities
are taking corrective measures to offset third-quarter slippages to keep the fiscal and
overall program on track. Nevertheless, a modification of the end-2010 performance
criterion on net domestic credit to the government is requested.



The government has initiated preparations for a comprehensive reform package
to begin addressing long-standing structural impediments to growth. With IFC
assistance, the authorities have drafted reform strategies for the public utilities, but
tangible progress in reforming these entities has yet to be achieved. To facilitate
progress, the government has requested a multi-year IFC technical assistance program,
and plans to call for bids in 2011 to enlist strategic partners in the management of the
public utilities.



The real exchange rate is subject to bouts of overvaluation pressures, but remains
broadly in line with fundamentals. Nevertheless, competitiveness should be
strengthened through determined implementation of ambitious structural reforms.



Staff supports the authorities’ request for completion of the second review under
the ECF arrangement and of the financing assurances review.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: ENCOURAGING SIGNS OF RECOVERY
1.
Political conditions have improved. A consensus national unity cabinet took office
in May 2010, tasked with organizing presidential and local elections. As a result, tensions
between the Union and islands authorities have subsided. In accordance with the 2001
constitution, the rotating Union presidency is to pass to Mohéli, the archipelago‘s smallest
island. The first round of presidential elections on the island, together with countrywide local
elections, took place last November; the final round is scheduled for December 26.
2.
Economic activity is trending up (MEFP ¶2). In the more enabling political
context, financial intermediation is expanding, and real GDP growth is projected at
2.1 percent for 2010 (1.4 percent in 2008–09). Contributing factors include a rebound in
donor-supported public works and private consumption, and a pick-up in remittances-based
housing construction. Also, prospects for tourism have improved as a tender to redevelop a
major hotel (Galawa), which when operating a decade ago accounted for 2–3 percent of
GDP, has been launched; and preparations have started for an inter-island maritime
transportation service. A large aid-financed settlement of wage arrears fueled a mid-year
inflationary spike1; nonetheless, inflation has since subsided and is projected at 3.2 percent at
end-2010, anchored by Comoros‘ membership in the Franc zone. The external current
account is projected to widen to 10.2 percent of GDP in 2010 (9 percent of GDP in 2009),
driven by a surge in aid-funded imports and a marked deterioration in the terms of trade.
Efforts at fiscal consolidation are continuing, and the fiscal program is expected to remain
broadly on track in 2010.
3.
Financial intermediation has expanded, with two foreign banks—Eximbank of
Tanzania and Persian Gulf-originated BFC (Banque Fédérale des Comores)—
commencing activities. This contributed to brisk expansion of credit to the private sector,
primarily to finance imports. To contain the expansion of liquidity and price pressures, in
June 2010, the Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) increased the required reserve ratio from
25 to 30 percent.
4.
Comoros made progress towards comprehensive debt relief. In July 2010,
Comoros reached the HIPC Initiative decision point; HIPC interim assistance and other debt
relief savings are projected at CF 16.7 billion (8.3 percent of GDP) for 2010 or 82 percent of
all debt service obligations due. Assuming satisfactory implementation of reforms, full HIPC
and MDRI debt relief could be achieved in late 2012, reducing the NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio to a more sustainable 86 percent from 343 percent at end-2009.

1

In May 2010 Qatar granted US$26 million in budget support (equivalent to 4.9 percent of GDP) earmarked
primarily for the repayment of domestic arrears, including several months of civil service wage arrears.

III. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES—CREATING CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINED STRONG
GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
5.
Discussions for the Article IV consultation focused on the challenges of restoring
fiscal and debt sustainability, and boosting growth to facilitate progress towards the
MDGs.

6.
The authorities emphasized the need for stronger growth to translate into higher
employment opportunities, especially for the young. The policy priorities that emerged
from the discussions confirmed the key objectives in Comoros‘ medium-term economic
program supported by the ECF arrangement, namely:


Creating fiscal space for higher pro-growth and pro-poor expenditures, while
ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability. This would notably be achieved with
stepped-up revenue efforts and prudent management of the wage bill, scaled-up aid,
and debt relief, including under the HIPC initiative and MDRI.



Accelerating the pace of structural reforms to improve productivity and
competitiveness. Critical to this end are the acceleration of reform of public utilities,
and early implementation of measures to improve the business and investment
climate, and to advance financial intermediation.

6


Providing incentives for remittances to be channeled to productive investments,
supporting durable growth. Consumption taxes could be used to encourage greater
savings and enhanced financial intermediation from remittances, which would
support stronger domestic investment.

ECF-supported reforms in the area customs administration have resulted
in a moderate improvement in revenue. The reform of the tax
administration is proceeding slower than expected.

Contain the wage bill

The wage bill has remained broadly unchanged as a proportion of GDP in
2009-10. Further efforts to contain it include the recently completed
computerization of the civil servant payment roster, and introduction of the
civil service organizational frameworks under the in 2011 budget. The bill
is projected to decline to 7.9 percent of GDP by 2012 (9 percent of GDP in
2009).

Accommodate higher progrowth and pro-poor
expenditures

From 2008 to 2010 domestic expenditure on health and education has
increased by around 40 percent; in 2010 domestically financed investment
outlays are projected to reach the highest level in the last 8 years.

Structural reforms
Complete the PRSP

PRSP completed in September 2009 and reviewed by the IMF and World
Bank Boards in March 2010

Maintain a flexible-pricing

Operational since 2008; price changes have been made only once and
retail petroleum prices have been generally comparable to those in effect
in the CFA Zone and in key peer and neighboring countries.

Reform state-owned
enterprises

Progress has been slow. With IFC assistance, reform strategies have been
developed for Comores Télécom and Société Comorienne des
Hydrocarbures. Preparations are underway for a reform strategy for
MAMWE (the power and water supplier), with AfDB technical support.
Strategic partners of international repute are expected to join management
of the three parastatals in 2011.

7
A. Medium-term Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
7.
Short-term macroeconomic prospects are in line with the initial program
projections (MEFP ¶7). Sustained donor support and remittances, higher FDI in
transportation and tourism, and improved political conditions should help push real GDP
growth higher to at least 2.5 percent in 2011, permitting the first, albeit modest, increase in
per capita income in five years. Inflation is expected to remain close to 3 percent. Reflecting
a pickup in growth-supporting imports, the external current account deficit is projected to
widen to 13.6 percent of GDP in 2011.
8.
In the medium term, growth is to be driven by tourism, fishing and agriculture.
The 2010 Doha conference promised US$80 million in FDI for tourism over the next five
years. Fishing and agriculture should also see increased growth on the back of a wide array
of projects envisaged in the PRSP. Annual GDP growth is expected to rise to 4 percent by
2013 and to stabilize thereafter; and Comoros‘ membership in the Franc Zone should ensure
that inflation remains within low single digits. A sustained increase in government revenues
and enhanced spending discipline should drive the domestic primary fiscal balance to
equilibrium by 2014, and into positive territory beyond. Containment of current expenditure
will allow domestically-financed investment to rise above 2 percent of GDP by 2014, from
0.8 percent in 2009. Reaching the HIPC completion point in 2012 would free additional
domestic resources for public investment.

9.
The government’s fiscal strategy seeks continued fiscal consolidation to achieve a
sustainable fiscal position and stronger growth (MEFP ¶9). Accordingly, the authorities
are committed to closely adhering to, and carrying beyond the ECF arrangement, ongoing
efforts to strengthen revenue and improve the quality of spending. Underpinning policy
actions comprise initiatives to expand the

2016. In addition, the authorities intend to

pursue a prudent
external debt policy, and rely on grants
and highly concessional loans. Accordingly, the financing gaps for the remainder of the
program period (2010–12) are expected to be filled by donor grants and ECF disbursements;
and continued donor support of similar magnitude and nature would be needed to fill the
financing needs for 2013–15 (Text Table 8).
C. Strengthening Economic Competitiveness and Long-Term Growth
Exchange rate developments and prospects
10.
Weak external competitiveness is stifling export growth and diversification. Over
the decade to end-2009, Comoros‘ real effective exchange rate appreciated by about
23 percent, mainly reflecting the strengthening of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar. Also,
available structural indicators suggest that the overall quality of the business environment has
been weaker than in peer countries, especially regarding the ease of doing business,
government effectiveness, and quality of regulation. These have discouraged entrepreneurship and hampered private sector development. As a result, export performance has been
sluggish—including in comparison with other countries in the CFA franc zone—leading to a
decline in Comoros share in world exports.

Nevertheless, available data suggest that while Comoros’ exchange rate is
subject to overvaluation pressures, it remains broadly consistent economic

Staff encouraged the authorities to closely adhere to the macroeconomic and
structural reforms under the ECF, to stem the erosion of competitiveness. Also, in
addition to timely implementation of PRSP plans to promote activity in agriculture, fishing,
and tourism, staff urged swift initiation of reforms to improve the business environment.
13.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment of exchange rate developments and
related policy recommendations. They noted the pressures on the external position, but
viewed the exchange rate peg as an appropriate anchor for stability and low inflation. The
authorities concurred with the need for rigorous implementation of the reform agenda under
the ECF arrangement; and, with technical assistance from the IFC, they have initiated
preparations for ambitious initiatives to begin addressing long-standing structural
impediments to growth. In this context, they notably plan to establish a one-stop business
licensing window.

14.
Comoros’s membership of COMESA could promote efficiency in tradable goods
production and create new export and investment opportunities. Technical preparations
to adopt COMESA‘s common external tariff are advanced and final decisions are expected
next year, which would reduce Comoros‘ existing four tariff bands of 0/5/15/20 percent to
three bands of 0/10/25 percent. Comoros is also participating as a member of the East and
South Africa group in discussions with the EU on a regional interim Economic Partnership
Agreement (EPA). Pending issues include the length of the transition period and the size of
the accompanying development program. Following Comoros‘ application for WTO
accession in 2007, a draft aide-memoire (a summary of all related tax and regulatory
regimes) is expected to be submitted by end-2010 after which a negotiating timetable would
be established.

constraining the supply of skilled labor and
increasing equilibrium wages. Moreover,
unlike incomes from domestic economic activity, remittances are hardly taxed, which
represents an important distortion with potentially negative repercussions on growth. Not
suprisingly, vanilla exporters are singling out migrant worker transfers as an important
reason for a higher reservation wage and increasing domestic input costs, erosion of
competitiveness, and sluggish exports. Remittances appear also to affect fiscal consolidation
efforts—sizable customs revenue from remittances-based imports have been accompanied by
weakening mobilization of other revenue categories. To ensure that remittances better
support growth, staff urged the authorities to notably (i) improve the investment climate, and
(ii) foster competition in the financial sector to lower the cost of remittance transfer and
increase the share of remittances channeled through the banking system (Annex II).

The prospect of a large increase in aid and FDI from the Gulf region raises
questions about Comoros’ absorptive capacity, and the potential macroeconomic effects
and appropriate policy responses. At the March 2010 Doha conference donors pledged
$540 million in aid for Comoros,

schedules for the coming years. These
resource pledges are therefore not included in the current macroeconomic framework under
the ECF. Nevertheless, the mission advised the authorities to guard against the risk of ―Dutch
Disease‖ and to avoid deepening Comoros‘ aid dependency. It underscored investing the
scaled-up aid in growth-supporting human and physical capital in due course; and using
public sector wage restraint to avoid wage-led price pressures. The government concurred,
and has established a secretariat to monitor aid disbursements and guide project implementation; and is planning improvements in capacity for budget preparation and implementation.
IV. SECOND REVIEW OF THE ECF ARRANGEMENT
A. Performance under the ECF
17.
Program performance through end-June was satisfactory (MEFP ¶4). All
performance criteria and benchmarks were observed. In particular, revenue was slightly
above projections despite delays in putting in place new revenue measures, the wage bill was
kept in check, and the benchmark on the primary fiscal balance was observed.
18.
The fiscal position deteriorated in the third quarter (MEFP ¶5). Revenue
mobilization weakened, partly reflecting delays in collecting assessed profit taxes, and in
implementing new fiscal measures under the program. In particular, a planned 5 percent
increase in the gasoline tax was not introduced; and recently (re)enacted excises—on motor
vehicles, business licenses, alcohol and tobacco, as well as radio frequency license fees—are
expected to begin generating revenue only in late 2010. The resulting revenue shortfall,
together with overruns on transfer spending, pushed the end-September domestic primary
deficit above the indicative target. Also, because of delayed budget support from the World
Bank and AfDB, the indicative target on net credit to the government was exceeded as well.

19.
The authorities have introduced corrective measures to offset the third-quarter
slippages and keep the 2010 fiscal program on track. These include the collection of CF
1.55 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) in profit taxes from Comores Télécom; the authorities are
also seeking CF 2.2 billion (1.1 percent of GDP) in additional non-tax revenue from the special
economic citizenship program. As a result, with expenditures broadly as programmed, the
domestic primary budget deficit is projected at 1.6 percent of GDP (1.5 percent of GDP under
the program). However, a programmed build-up in government deposits is expected to be
lower, and net bank credit to government higher, than anticipated because of the cancellation
of a CF 1.8 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) EU food security grant,2 and the authorities‘ failure to
promptly reduce domestic arrears repayments in response to the lower aid—as provided for
under the program.
20.

Implementation of the structural reform agenda has been satisfactory (MEFP ¶6).

B. Program for 2011
2011 budget and financing
21.
The 2011 budget continues the government’s medium-term fiscal consolidation
and poverty reduction efforts (MEFP ¶8). It targets a domestic primary fiscal deficit of
1.3 percent of GDP (1.6 percent of GDP in 2010), with revenue at 14.2 percent of GDP and
the wage bill reduced to 8.6 percent of GDP (8.9 percent of GDP in 2010). Domestically
funded spending for education and health are expected to increase to 6.1 percent of GDP
(5.9 percent of GDP in 2010). Estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP after interim HIPC assistance,
the fiscal gap for 2011 is fully covered (Text Table 8).
22.
To help achieve the targeted 14.2 percent of GDP in revenue, the authorities will
notably introduce measures to enhance inter-entity cohesion in the management of the
revenue agencies, especially the Directorate General of Taxes; and to improve the efficiency
of newly established ad valorem taxation of imports (MEFP ¶9).

23.
On the spending side, the focus remains on close monitoring of wage
expenditures through rigorous implementation of a new computerized wage payment
system, and introduction under the 2011 budget of ministry personnel lists that are
compatible with medium-term budget viability (MEFP ¶10).
Structural and financial sector reforms
24.
The authorities are continuing preparations for enlisting private sector
participation in the management of public utilities. They have requested a multi-year IFC
technical assistance program, and plan to issue calls for bids to potential strategic partners in
2011 (MEFP Table 2 and ¶16).

14
Comoros: Public Enterprise Reforms: Status Report
Comores Télécom (CT): Following an open bidding process, Mauritius-based BDO de Chazal
Dumée has been selected to audit the 2009 financial statements, and Ernest Young to conduct a
net-worth assessment of the company. On the basis of these evaluations, the authorities will
prepare and issue calls for bids to potential strategic partners before end-March 2011.
Société Comorienne des Hydrocarbures (SCH). A restructuring committee has been set up by
ministerial decree to help the government select a preferred reform option from the list prepared
by IFC staff. With IFC support, the committee will manage the SCH restructuring process.
Water and Electricity Company (MAMWE). The AfDB is providing financial support for the
preparation of a reform strategy.

25.
The health of the banking system strengthened somewhat in 2010 with
improvements in profitability and quality of risk. In June 2010, the ratio of nonperforming-to-outstanding loans declined for all banking institutions. However, the National
Post and Financial Services (SNPSF) and the Comoros Development Bank (BDC) continue
to experience difficulties in complying with key prudential ratios. The authorities have taken
steps to strengthen SNPSF management, and are on track with efforts to privatize BDC in the
coming months (MEFP ¶13).
26.
The Central Bank (BCC) is implementing recommendations from the 2010
safeguards assessment and improving banking supervision to support financial sector
development. BCC‘s cash holdings are subject to verification at year-end by an external
auditor and the Bank‘s financial controller reviews monetary data reported to the IMF staff.
The Bank‘s 2009 financial statements will be published on its website soon. Also, work is
underway to bring BCC financial statements up to international standards starting in 2011.
Furthermore, in line with recommendations by recent IMF (MCM) technical assistance
missions, BCC has set up a banking supervision unit, signed an agreement with the Central
Bank of Tanzania on joint banking supervision missions, and established cooperation
agreements with the French Prudential Supervisory Authority and the Central African
Banking Commission (COBAC). Over the next two years, the authorities will address
shortcomings in banking supervision pertaining to the adequacy of the legal framework,
scope of risks covered by prudential regulation, quality of internal procedures, and the
effectiveness of controls performed (MEFP ¶12).
C. Program monitoring, financing assurances, and short-term risks
A modification of the end-December 2010 performance criterion on net credit to
government is proposed (MEFP, Table 1). In spite of corrective measures taken to keep
revenue on target, the programmed build-up in Treasury deposits with the Central Bank is
expected to fall short of expectations because of (i) the cancellation of the 2010 EU food
security grant and (ii) the authorities‘ failure to promptly reduce domestic arrears repayments
in response to the lower aid as provided for under the program (TMU ¶10). As a result, net
credit to the government is expected to be higher than programmed, necessitating an

15
upwardly adjustment of the related end-December 2010 performance criterion.
Notwithstanding this, the underlying objectives of the fiscal program remain broadly
unchanged (¶19 above).
27.
To strengthen the likelihood of the program’s success, three of four prior actions
have been completed, and the fourth has been partially executed (MEFP, Table 2). The
program includes quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2010 and end-June
2011, and indicative targets for March 2011 (MEFP, Table 1). The prior actions and
proposed structural measures focus on public finance management and key sectors critical to
improved growth performance. They aim to enhance revenue mobilization and advance fiscal
consolidation, and to expedite reforms of public utilities, essential for strong growth and to
lessen potential subsidy pressures on the budget. The third review of the program will focus
on structural reforms designed to reinforce control over the wage bill. These include the full
implementation of the computerized pay slip system, completion of the civil service census,
and the implementation of the new civil service personnel frameworks.
28.
The authorities are on track with discussing and/or signing debt restructuring
understandings with bilateral and multilateral creditors, consistent with the November
2009 Paris Club Agreement; and in keeping with the HIPC Initiative framework. A
bilateral agreement has been signed with France, the major Paris Club creditor, and is
expected to be signed with Italy by end-2010, and with remaining Club creditors in early
2011. A number of multilateral and official bilateral creditors have agreed to further defer
payment of arrears and debt service falling due until end-2010, and the government has
initiated discussions with these and commercial creditors on terms comparable with the Paris
Club agreement and in the context of the HIPC initiative. The authorities have demonstrated
and intend to continue good faith efforts to reach collaborative agreement with the remaining
external creditors in line with the Paris Club‘s comparability of treatment requirement, the
HIPC Initiative, and the Fund‘s lending into arrears policy.
29.
There are risks to the program and medium-term economic outlook. Union
pressures for higher wages, and political resistance to public enterprise reform, pose risks to
fiscal consolidation and to the structural reform agenda. Also, a return of political instability
following the elections could hinder delivery of anticipated external resources, including
FDI. Furthermore, in the absence of much-needed technical assistance, weak absorption and
implementation capacity would limit the growth dividend from scaled-up aid and FDI. To
mitigate these risks, steadfast implementation of the reform agenda would help maintain the
program on track and ensure steady provision of donor financial and technical support. Also,
stepped-up efforts will be needed to secure enhanced public support for reforms and stronger
program ownership.
30.
The risks to Fund resources are manageable. Over the remainder of the program
period (2010–12), debt service to the Fund would average 0.04 percent of exports of goods
and services (Table 7), within Comoros‘ capacity to repay the Fund.

16
D. PRSP, HIPC, Data and Other Issues
31.
Implementation of the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) is
proceeding and a first Annual Performance Review is expected to be completed by endDecember 2010 (MEFP ¶19-20). Implementation of the PRS began in January 2010, and
the government is expecting support from the UN for obtaining and analyzing preliminary
data on progress thus far. To overcome capacity constraints at the Direction Generale du
Plan, the AfDB is providing technical assistance to refocus the PRS action plan to better
reflect implementation capacity, financial constraints and priority objectives. The revised
action plan will be completed by early 2011.
32.
Progress is being made towards meeting the HIPC debt management triggers.
The Debt Directorate will soon be installing new debt management software and equipment,
and receiving training with the assistance of the AfDB. In addition, the government intends
to request an evaluation of, and recommendations to improve, its debt management capacity
from the World Bank (DeMPA). A first annual report on debt for 2010 is planned for next
year.
33.
Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance, despite numerous
shortcomings. National accounts, prices and balance of payments data are weak in terms of
accuracy, timeliness and periodicity, but fiscal and monetary data reach a higher standard. A
peripatetic technical assistance project in national accounts and price statistics supported by
the AfDB will start in November 2010. The real sector statistics division at the Direction
Generale du Plan is understaffed and its ability to absorb additional technical assistance is
weak. Strengthening its capacity in compiling reliable and timely real sector statistics and
related data (e.g., agricultural statistics) should be a priority.
34.
Program-related policies are generally supported by important stakeholders.
The mission met with representatives from the private sector, unions, civic society, and the
national assembly. Despite specific concerns, particularly about the public enterprise reform
process, there is broad agreement on the importance of achieving the program targets and of
reaching the HIPC initiative completion point.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Comoros is experiencing a steady albeit slow return of political stability and a
modest uptick in growth. The run-up to the end-year presidential elections has been free of
major political disturbances, with the first round successfully completed in November. Real
GDP growth is catching up with that of population expansion, heralding much needed per
capita income gains in the period ahead. Concurrently, prospects point to a strengthening of
the budget position beginning in 2010. Against a backdrop of heightened donor and investor
interest in the country, especially from the Gulf region, these developments could usher in a
turnaround in Comoros‘ economic fortunes. Staff urges the authorities to ensure that
supportive, complementary, reforms are nurtured and expedited.
36.
Preserving macroeconomic stability must remain a key medium-term objective
for the government. The ECF-supported program calls for efforts to strengthen revenue

17
mobilization and keep spending at levels compatible with medium-term fiscal sustainability.
In this context, the authorities are notably striving to enhance inter-entity cohesion in the
management of the revenue agencies, especially the Directorate General of Taxes. They are
also maintaining wage expenditures under scrutiny through rigorous implementation of a
new computerized wage payment system, as well as the introduction under the 2011 budget
of ministry personnel lists that are compatible with medium-term budget viability. Staff urges
timely implementation of the ministry personnel lists to ensure that the fiscal program stays
on track.
37.
Staff welcomes recent progress in strengthening banking supervision, but urges
the authorities to implement swiftly remaining Fund recommendations. These include
addressing remaining shortcomings in (i) the adequacy of the legal framework, the scope of
risks covered by prudential regulation, (iii) the quality of internal procedures and controls,
and (iv) the reporting standards (IFRS).
38.
Putting the economy on a path of strong sustained growth will require
determined implementation of ambitious structural reforms. Staff welcomes the
authorities‘ plans to issue calls in 2011 for bids to enlist strategic partners in the management
of the public utilities. With technical assistance from the IFC, the authorities have initiated
preparations for reforms to begin addressing deep-seated structural impediments to growth,
including costly administrative barriers to starting and closing businesses. The authorities are
also developing policies to make remittances better support growth, and to maximize the
growth benefits from increasing aid and FDI. While the real effective exchange rate appears
to be broadly in line with economic fundamentals, these efforts will be crucial to keeping
overvaluation pressures in check, and to strengthening competitiveness. Staff urges the
authorities to ensure more involvement of the private sector in economic policy debate,
which would help inform investors‘ resource allocation decisions. Full implementation of
reforms in these areas would help raise real GDP growth to 4–5 percent by 2015, enhancing
the effectiveness of Comoros‘ poverty reduction strategy.
39.
Staff recommends the completion of the second review under the ECF
arrangement and of the financing assurances review, and modification of the end-2010
performance criterion on net credit to government. Corrective actions to offset
third-quarter fiscal slippages are being taken to ensure that Comoros‘ macroeconomic
performance remains broadly on track, in keeping with government efforts to enhance
revenue mobilization and reestablish spending discipline. However, progress on the structural
reform agenda needs to be expedited, to ensure that the country‘s growth and poverty
reduction prospects are not compromised. Against this background, staff welcomes the
renewed government collaboration framework with IFC in public enterprise and business
environment reforms. The onus for maintaining these initiatives on track remains on the
authorities; however, donor and especially IMF support will be critical in bolstering the
government‘s efforts and resolve.
40.
The main risks to the program relate to political frictions between the Union
and island authorities. Resumption of inter-entity tensions would delay implementation of
politically difficult reforms, in particular the streamlining of public service staffing levels and

18
restructuring of public utilities. There seems however to be broad national consensus on the
importance of achieving the program targets and of reaching the HIPC initiative completion
point. This, together with greater efforts to enlist public support for reforms, should help
mitigate the risks in the period ahead.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Union of Comoros
take place within 24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation
cycles in program countries.

fundamentals but remains subject to overvaluation pressures, and structural indicators suggest that Comoros’
business environment compares poorly to peer countries. Going forward, overvaluation pressures may build up
absent continued fiscal consolidation, sustained political stability, and structural reforms to improve the
business climate and governance.

A. External Sector Developments
1.
The real effective exchange rate (REER)
has appreciated steadily over the past decade.
Between 2000 and 2009, the CPI-based REER
appreciated by 23 percent, mainly reflecting the
strengthening of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar and,
more recently, the rise in oil and food prices.2

During the same period Comoros’ external
position weakened considerably. The terms of
trade deteriorated significantly, import growth was
strong, underpinned by increasing aid flows and
remittances, and export performance was sluggish—
including with respect to other countries in the CFA
franc zone.3 Exports were also held back by chronic
political instability, deficient infrastructure, and a
poor business environment, which discouraged
private sector initiative and foreign investors. As a
result, Comoros‘ share in world exports declined and
the trade deficit widened markedly (Figure 1).

B. Price Competitiveness: Exchange Rate Assessment4
The Macroeconomic Balance Approach (MB)
3.
The MB approach assesses the exchange rate alignment by computing the
difference between the underlying current account (CA) and its estimated equilibrium
1

Prepared by Valerio Crispolti.
Since joining the Franc Zone in 1979, Comoros operates under a fixed exchange rate regime.
3
Since its peak in 2004, the world price of vanilla—Comoros‘ main export—has collapsed; while, food and
fuel prices have trended upwards. At the same time, imports of goods and services rose from 33 percent of GDP
in 2000 to 48 percent in 2009.
4
The exchange rate assessment is based on Vitek, 2010, Exchange Rate Assessment Toolkit, and Aydin, 2010,
Exchange Rate Assessment for Sub-Saharan Economies (IMF internal documents). The dataset used for the
regressions contains annual data on non-oil exporting Sub-Saharan countries over the period 1990-2010.

percent

level (i.e. norm).5 The magnitude of the exchange rate adjustment required to close the gap
between the underlying and norm current accounts provides a measure of existing currency
misalignment (e.g. under- or overvaluation).6

The External Sustainability Approach (ES)
5.
The ES approach examines the relationship between the underlying CA and the
sustainability of a country’s medium-term net foreign asset position.8 Unlike in the MB
approach, the norm is derived in the ES analysis as the CA balance that would stabilize the
net foreign assets (NFA) position of the country at a benchmark level.
6.
Alternative scenarios were considered to determine the benchmark level for
Comoros’ NFA. Under a backward-looking scenario, the norm was computed as the CA
balance that would stabilize the NFA position at its end-2009 level (-37 percent of GDP).9
5

The underlying CA is derived by stripping temporary factors from the CA balance, including by closing the
country‘s and trading partners‘ output gaps and controlling for lagged effects of past exchange rate changes.
The norm is estimated as a function of the country‘s projected medium-term fundamentals. See Christiansen et
al., 2009, External Balance in Low Income Countries (IMF WP/09/221).
6
The exchange rate adjustment needed to close the gap between the underlying CA balance and the norm is
obtained using a country-specific elasticity of the CA balance with respect to real exchange rate changes. An
elasticity of -0.330 was used based on Tokarick, 2009, A Method for Calculating Export Supply and Import
Demand Elasticities (mimeo).
7
To check for robustness, staff also estimated the norm based on the CGER coefficients. The new norm is
consistent with the MB norm; but implies a somewhat higher overvaluation over the medium term (17 percent
in 2015). This result mainly reflects the fact that the CGER methodology does not take in to account aid flows
and remittances, which are important sources of financing for imports in Comoros (see Annex II).
8
In this section, staff assumed that Comoros attains HIPC and MDRI debt relief in 2012.
9
The benchmark level of NFA should be interpreted as illustrative rather than normative (i.e. an appropriate
level to attain), given that Comoros is in debt distress with an NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 343 percent at
end-2009—a level well above HIPC and low-income country debt sustainability thresholds (EBS/10/110).

30
Under a forward-looking scenario, the norm was derived as the CA balance that would
maintain the NFA position at its medium-term level; different FDI inflow assumptions were
considered and their effects reviewed10. In a pessimistic scenario, the FDI-to-GDP ratio
(2.6 percent of GDP in 2009) was assumed to gradually revert to its historical average of
0.7 percent of GDP over the medium term. Under more optimistic assumptions, the ratio
would reach 5 percent by 2015, a level in line with that of regional island economies.11
7.
Results based on the ES approach point to an overvaluation in the range of 22 to
28 percent (Table 1). To maintain the NFA position at the 2009 level, the CA deficit would
have to narrow to 2.5 percent of GDP (compared with a projected -9.9 percent of GDP for
2015), requiring a depreciation in real

The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Approach (ERER)
8.
The ERER approach directly estimates the equilibrium level of the exchange
rate as a function of its medium-term fundamentals.12 The gap between the actual REER
and its estimated equilibrium level identifies the exchange rate adjustment that is needed to
restore equilibrium over the medium term.

ERER-based estimates suggest that
Comoros’ REER is slightly overvalued
(Figure 3). At end 2009, the exchange rate was

Over the medium term, real overvaluation
would increase to about 8 percent on account
of higher aid flows and remittances.

31
The Purchasing Power Parity Approach (PPP)
10.
The PPP approach assesses the exchange rate alignment assuming that the PPP
hypothesis holds.13 The difference between the REER and its PPP equilibrium level
determines the degree of the exchange rate under- or overvaluation. For Comoros, this
approach points to an overvaluation in real terms of about 10 percent over the medium term.
C. Non-price Competitiveness: A Qualitative Assessment
11.
The World Bank’s Indicators of Doing Business (DBIs) and Governance (GIs)
point to overall poor quality of the economic environment (Figure 4) and persistent
weaknesses in governance (Figure 5). The 2011 DBI report ranks Comoros 159 out of
183 countries, stressing the need to address long-standing structural impediments to private
sector development, particularly in the areas of starting and closing a business, getting credit,
and enforcing contracts. At the same time, the GIs place Comoros much below average in the
CFA zone, especially on government effectiveness and quality of regulation.

D. Policy Recommendations
12.
The authorities concur with the need for continued fiscal consolidation and
determined implementation of structural measures to strengthen external
competitiveness. In addition to reforms under the ECF arrangement, they have enlisted IFC
assistance in preparing an ambitious structural reform agenda aimed at removing deep-rooted
structural constraints to growth.

13

Under the PPP hypothesis, the equilibrium level of the REER is approximated by a constant. As a result, the
nominal exchange rate moves to offset changes in price differentials with trading partners.

32
Annex II. Comoros: Remittances and Growth—The Missing Link1
1.
In 2009, Comoros was one of only two African countries with a remittances-toGDP ratio exceeding 25 percent (Figure 1A). This places the archipelago within the top
five worldwide. In 2008-09, remittances amounted to as much as the combined sum of aid,
exports of goods and services, and FDI (Figure 1B).

The rapid increase in remittances has not translated into growth in output and
productive capacity, as in other countries that recently experienced an explosion in
remittances (e.g. Moldova, Tajikistan). Unlike in countries with significant domestic
production where the multiplier effect from remittances can be important2, in Comoros
remittances have mostly fueled imports (Figure 1C).

The potential positive link between remittances and sustained long-term
growth—via investment—has been affected by government and market failures. The
high cost of doing business and the quality/price of complementary factors of production—
primarily infrastructure and public utilities—have depressed returns on private investment. In

adjustment with a human face possible? The case of Mexico.‖ Journal of Development Studies, 26: 387-407.

33
addition, the underdeveloped financial system has hindered the intermediation of remittances
into higher financial savings and expanded productive activities, as the high cost of money
transfers diverts three-quarters of remittances to informal channels (Figure 2).
4.
Migration and consumption patterns also play a role in the limited development
impact of remittances in Comoros. Studies from countries with important remittances
inflows have found that a large portion of returning migrants set up enterprises using funds
brought back from abroad.3 However, the large distance between Comoros and France, the
main migration destination, implies high migration costs, which favor permanent migration.
The large distance also lowers migrants‘ ability to oversee the use of transferred funds, which
results in lower equilibrium savings, since recipients tend to allocate a larger share of
remittances to consumption than preferred by the migrants.4 In addition, unlike in other
remittance-receiving countries where the marginal propensity to save from remittances is
higher than from other forms of income,5 in Comoros a disproportionate share of remittances
is used for consumption as part of Grands Marriages.6
5.
Migration and remittances affect negatively competitiveness and public sector
reform. The reduction of the working age population through emigration and the higher
reservation wage of recipients of remittances, are reducing the labor supply and putting
upward pressure on wages. In tandem with the Dutch disease effect of remittances on the real
exchange rate, the higher level of wages is eroding Comoros‘ competitiveness. Remittances
also lower the motivation for implementing much-needed public sector reform efforts; by
boosting customs revenues (on account of higher imports), they reduce incentives for muchneeded structural reforms to strengthen tax and customs administration.

Remittances do provide an important cushion against poverty:


They have supplemented the income of the poorest, although their effect on
income inequality is ambiguous. The 2004 household survey reveals a U-shape
distribution of remittances across income quintiles, with the poorest and more
affluent households receiving the bulk of transfers, at the expense of the marginally
poor (Figure 3A). Remittances also explain the lower poverty incidence on the island
of Ngazidja—35 percent compared to 38 percent in Anjouan and Moheli. Ngazidga
has the largest Diaspora in France, with per capita transfers through the banking
system about 2.7 times higher than for the other two islands (Figure 3B).



Remittances have proven highly counter-cyclical. They are inversely correlated
with real GDP growth, and provide an important safety net for resident Comorians;
in 2009 the transfers held steady notwithstanding the global economic crisis.
Remittances also act as countercyclical buffer to domestic shocks, increasing (e.g.) in
the quarter following an accumulation of government domestic payment arrears,
primarily on wages.

To ensure that remittances better support growth, staff urged the authorities to:


Encourage competition in the financial sector to help lower remittance transfer costs
and expand remittances-based savings and investment.



Improve the investment climate to help remove distortions that prevent the
channeling of remittances into investment.



Increase returns on private investment by ensuring the supply of complementary
factors of production (give priority to pro-growth spending and push ahead with the
reform of public utilities).



Consider indirectly taxing remittances by shifting the tax mix towards consumption
taxes; and beefing up spending on projects that complement domestic economic
activity.

ANNEX III
UNION OF THE COMOROS

Moroni, November 29, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Following the courageous institutional reforms initiated two years ago, the Union of
the Comoros is gradually returning to a path of political stability. This process should be
consolidated after the December 2010 island and presidential elections, when the first
President of the Union and Governors of the islands will be chosen in accordance with the
2009 constitutional amendments and in strict observance of the rotating Union Presidency.
These important developments create a political climate that is calmer and more conducive to
development efforts. The government intends to use this opportunity to accelerate the
ongoing reforms to boost growth and more effectively combat poverty, with the support of
the IMF and other development partners of the Comoros.
2.
The government's economic policies continue to be built upon the National Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP) adopted in 2009, which serves as the
foundation for the three-year reform program supported by the IMF under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). In the context of this program, the government intends to strengthen its
efforts to stabilize the economy to lay the foundations for sustained and equitable growth,
while improving public finances and strengthening the country‘s economic and social
infrastructures. Thus, the government is working with resolve to expand fiscal space so as to
increase spending in priority and growth-supporting sectors. To strengthen overall economic
competitiveness and foster stronger growth, the ECF program continues to include an
important agenda focused on restructuring public utilities. The government is also engaged in
reassessing the priority actions of the PRGSP and will establish a more realistic
implementation timetable for them. It intends to ensure the rigorous implementation of this
refocused PRGSP action plan starting in 2011.
3.
Our discussions with Fund staff for the second review of the ECF program
established that all performance criteria and quantitative and structural benchmarks for endJune 2010 were observed. The primary fiscal balance was kept within the program ceiling,
thanks in particular to firm control over non-transfer expenditures, including wages. In the

36
structural area, efforts to computerize the civil service payroll are ongoing, in particular with
the coming on stream of the computerized pay slip system. However, the fiscal position
deteriorated in September following delays in the collection of revenue from some taxpayers,
as well as an unforeseen increase in expenditure on goods and services associated with
preparations for the end-year elections.
4.
The government is determined to continue its fiscal consolidation efforts. It intends,
before end-November 2010, to obtain payment of tax arrears from the third quarter, and to
collect additional revenues under its economic citizenship program. This would enable it to
meet its revenue target for the current fiscal year. The government nonetheless recognizes
that expenditures on goods and services cannot realistically be expected to be held within the
program limit, because of the cost of the elections. However, by endeavoring to hold all other
expenditure categories within program limits, the government should be able to minimize
any slippage from its budget outturn objective. In light of these corrective measures, the
government requests completion of the second review and disbursement of the related ECF
resources.
5.
A number of positive developments in 2010 have had a favorable impact on the
country‘s economic performance. Political tensions have been eased significantly, in tandem
with an increase in foreign aid and the return of tourists. Moreover, after a cutback associated
with the Yemenia accident in 2009, in-country visits by members of the Diaspora rose
sharply in 2010. Even more important, credit to the economy has been sustained, supported
by expanding financial intermediation. All these factors explain the relative acceleration in
the rate of real GDP growth, which is expected to reach 2.1 percent as compared with an
initial projection of 1.8 percent. Inflation remains moderate, owing to the country‘s
participation in the franc zone. Reflecting a significant increase in imports financed with help
from grants from development partners, the external current account deficit is not expected to
narrow in 2010.
6.
The government‘s IMF-supported reform program under the ECF is aimed at
underpinning a sustainable economic recovery that is now taking shape. The program‘s
architecture and basic objectives remain unchanged. However, to take account of the impact
of lower-than-expected budget support, we wish to request a modification of the endDecember 2010 performance criterion for net credit to the government. The program will
continue to focus on a prudent fiscal policy, and will seek to accelerate the structural reforms
necessary to enhance competitiveness. Underpinning policies are set forth in the attached
memorandum on economic and financial policies; the government intends to implement them
with determination. If necessary, it would consult Fund staff before any revisions are made,
in accordance with the Fund's policy on such consultation. It is expected that the third review
of the ECF arrangement will take place in June 2011, and that the fourth review will be
completed by mid-September 2011.

37
7.
In line with our commitment to transparency in government operations, we agree to
the publication of documents relating to our discussions with Fund staff under the second
review of our ECF-supported program.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2011
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economic reforms supported by the International Monetary Fund under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) are aimed at improving fiscal sustainability, building
institutional and governance capacity, and rehabilitating economic and social infrastructure,
particularly public utilities, in order to stabilize the macroeconomic framework, enhance the
competitiveness of the economy, and impart new impetus to growth so as to combat poverty
more effectively. This memorandum takes stock of progress in implementing these reforms
in 2010. It also sets out the measures and policies that the government plans to implement in
2011 in order to achieve its objectives.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
A. Recent economic developments and outlook for end-2010
2.
Economic activity recovered modestly. GDP growth is expected to reach
2.1 percent in 2010, a rate slightly higher than that of 2009. Economic growth is beginning to
benefit from the effects of relative political stability and a more favorable sub-regional
situation, reflected in a substantial increase in external assistance and, in all likelihood, in
foreign direct investment. Inflation should continue to be contained, reflecting the country‘s
membership in the franc zone. Excluding the impact of spending for the elections in
December 2010, overall fiscal performance has remained in line with the program‘s
objectives. However, tax revenues, in particular from domestic direct and indirect taxes,
remain below program targets owing to the persistence of weaknesses in tax administration.
Government revenue is expected to be equivalent to the 14.4 percent of GDP envisaged
under the program, thanks to a good performance in customs revenues and the boost
provided by nontax revenue, in particular the revenues associated with the economic
citizenship program. The value of imports increased, driven by rising prices for major
imported products and supported by increased external assistance. Consequently, the external
current account deficit is expected to deteriorate in 2010. Foreign exchange reserves should
remain at a comfortable level, equivalent to 6.1 months‘ imports of goods and nonfactor
services.
3.
The external debt of the Comoros remains unsustainable. It is expected to be
equivalent to 308 percent of goods exports (in net present value terms) at end-2010. The
government is continuing its efforts to find a comprehensive solution to its debt situation

39
under the HIPC Initiative, for which it reached the decision point in July 2010. It intends to
continue ensuring satisfactory implementation of the reforms with assistance from its
partners, including the timely implementation of triggers, so as to reach the completion point
in 2012. At present, in conformity with the debt rescheduling agreement reached with Paris
Club members in November 2009, we have signed a debt rescheduling agreement with one
of our principal creditors. Other agreements still pending should be finalized promptly; the
government remains determined to honor the commitments entered into within this
framework in a timely manner. This provides for a significant reduction in the debt service
falling due during the mid-2009 to mid-2012 period. For 2010, various creditors have agreed
to defer the settlement of external arrears and current debt service amounting to
CF 21.2 billion, or 88 percent of the gross debt service for the year, pending debt relief under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative on terms comparable to those agreed with Paris Club creditors.
B. Program implementation
4.
Implementation of the program was satisfactory in the first half of 2010. All
performance criteria and quantitative benchmarks were met, as were the structural
benchmarks of the program; in particular, the revenue target was achieved. In addition, the
target for the primary fiscal deficit was met despite spending overruns noted on transfers, in
particular to the University of the Comoros. In the structural area, preparations for the
introduction of computerized pay slips progressed; the government submitted to the National
Assembly a draft law setting forth the personnel frameworks for the Civil Service; and the
representative of the Office of the President of the Union on the reform monitoring
committee (CREF) was appointed.
5.
Although weakened in the third quarter of the year, the fiscal position is
expected to improve in the fourth quarter and to move closer to the initial program
path for 2010. A shortfall in revenue of CF 1.75 billion was recorded in the third quarter,
reflecting the combined impact of: (i) the still limited effectiveness of new revenue measures
under the program, the full yield of which will not be realized until the next few months;
(ii) abandonment of the 5 percent increase in the tax on petroleum products, which was
deemed politically sensitive; and especially (iii) the late collection of profits tax payable by
the State-owned Telecommunications Company (Comores Télécom). Owing to this revenue
shortfall and delays in the disbursement of financial support from some development
partners, the main fiscal objectives of the program for end-September, including the target
relating to net credit to the government, could not be met. The government has taken
corrective measures. In particular, in November it obtained settlement of the profits tax
payable by Comores Télécom, as well as the payment of sizable revenues under the
economic citizenship program. In tandem with the improved yield from the program‘s new
tax measures for 2010, in particular the introduction of fees on the use of radio frequencies,
these efforts should enable the government to meet its revenue objective for the year.
However, the government still faces an irreducible overrun in spending associated with the
elections, equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP. Under these circumstances, the primary domestic

40
fiscal deficit is expected to amount to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2010 (2.6 percent of GDP in
2009), as compared with the initial program target of 1.5 percent of GDP. In addition, owing
to the cancellation of budget support expected from the European Union (CF 1.8 billion), the
accumulation of government deposits with the BCC is expected to be less than projected,
necessitating a change in the ceiling on net credit to the government from CF -1.130 billion
to CF 156 million. These developments require a modification of this performance criterion
for end-December 2010.
6.
Preparation of the public utility reforms is continuing in the second half of 2010.
The government has recruited consultants and begun work on auditing the 2009 accounts of
Comores Télécom, which will be followed by an appraisal of the enterprise's net worth with
a view to issuing calls for expressions of interest from potential strategic partners in the
period ahead. At the same time, a committee has been established for monitoring the reform
of the petroleum product-importing company (Société Comorienne des Hydrocarbures—
SCH) in order to assist the government with finalizing its choice of an appropriate reform
strategy. Finally, with support from the AfDB, the government is continuing preparatory
work for the reform strategy for the electricity company (MAMWE).
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2011
A. Macroeconomic Framework
7.
In 2011, real GDP is projected to increase by 2.5 percent, and inflation to remain
moderate. Growth is expected to be driven by subsistence agriculture, private construction
supported by funding from the Diaspora, the rehabilitation of economic infrastructure
financed by development partners, a rebound in financial services resulting from increased
financial intermediation, and a greater availability of electric power. Furthermore, attracted
by the easing of political tensions, new sectors of activity are expected to emerge with some
dynamism; in particular, an inter-island transport service is expected to be launched and work
should begin on rebuilding the Hôtel Galawa, which will support growth. Price pressures are
not projected to increase in 2011, which will help contain inflation below 3 percent.
However, given the low level of exports and the continuing high demand for imports, the
external current account deficit is projected to increase to 13.6 percent of GDP.
B. Fiscal Policy
8.
The government is resolved to continue its ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in
2011. The fiscal program will be focused on measures to mobilize government revenue and
improve the control of expenditure, particularly wage outlays. The deficit of the domestic
primary fiscal balance is not expected to exceed the equivalent of 1.3 percent of GDP,
compared with an average of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2008-2009. The government‘s net
financing needs for fiscal 2011, after debt relief, is estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP, and will
be fully covered by budgetary support from development partners. If the government
receives external budget support in excess of programmed amounts, it will consult with the

41
IMF on its use and will establish a new supplementary budget specifying how these resources
will be allocated, giving priority to the settlement of domestic payments arrears and to other
priority sectors.
9.
Domestic revenue is expected to reach CF 30.175 billion (14.2 percent of GDP).
Achieving this objective will require an improvement in the efficiency of the tax and customs
administrations. At the Directorate-General of Taxes (DGI), two major reforms will be
carried out by end-March 2011: (i) establishment of a Board of Directors made up of the
Minister of Finance of the Union and the Governors (or their delegates) and an operational
unit bringing together the tax offices of the Union and the islands, with a director-general
who has sole responsibility for reporting to the authorities through the Board of Directors;
and (ii) the effective operation of offices of the large taxpayer unit in Anjouan and Mohéli.
At the same time, the monitoring of declarations by large enterprises will be further
strengthened in order to increase the voluntary filing rate to 95 percent. Implementation of
these major reforms has benefited from technical assistance from the IMF‘s Fiscal Affairs
Department, from which a team of experts visited the Comoros in November 2010. In 2011,
revenue mobilization will also reflect the full effect of new domestic tax measures taken in
2010, including the introduction of fees on the use of radio frequencies in the
telecommunications sector. Regarding Customs, the ad valorem taxation of imports will be
subject to closer monitoring. To this end, the operational resources of the central office
responsible for the valuation, type, and origin of goods will be strengthened, and the flat tax
per container will be eliminated definitively.
10.
To ensure that its fiscal objectives are fully met, the government intends to
rigorously control expenditure. Expenditures will be capped at CF 49.269 billion, or
23.2 percent of GDP, of which CF 18.350 billion for the wage bill, nearly CF 2.9 billion
(1.4 percent of GDP) for investment expenditure, and CF 13 billion (6.1 percent of GDP)
financed with own resources for the education and health sectors. The government will
ensure the effective operation of its new computerized payroll management system, and the
rapid completion of the census of government employees and officials following the election.
It intends to ensure the timely implementation of recommendations from the census,
including the elimination of fictitious workers. To avoid any new accumulation of payments
arrears, the government will ensure the more effective operation of its Cash Flow Committee
chaired by the Minister of Finance. Moreover, it will introduce measures aimed at improving
over the medium-term the still poor quality of the public expenditure management system
(see paragraph 17 below).
11.
The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis, including grants) is projected at
CF 4.771 billion (2.2 percent of GDP). With net external financing (including debt relief
and other deferrals of external debt service) projected at CF -1.466 billion, and net domestic
financing (including the use of CF 1.2 billion in 2010 budget support held in reserve)
amounting to CF 1.549 billion, the government‘s net financing requirements for 2011 are
estimated at CF 4.689 billion (2.2 percent of GDP). This will be covered as follows:

42
(i) World Bank: CF 1 billion; (ii) AfDB: CF 0.8 billion; (iii) Gulf region partners:
CF 1.1 billion; and (iv) IMF: CF 1.8 billion.
C. Money, Credit, and Financial System
12.
Government borrowing from the banking system will remain prudent, to allow
an adequate expansion of credit to the private sector. Broad money is expected to grow at
a rate of 8.6 percent in 2011, faster than the growth of nominal GDP, compared with
12.7 percent in 2010. The required reserve ratio will continue to be the main liquidity
management instrument. Set at 25 percent in 2008, it was increased to 30 percent in 2010 in
response to a pronounced increase in demand for credit and in domestic prices in the third
quarter, as well as to a substantial increase in liquidity associated with sharply higher
external budget support. Subsequent changes in the ratio will continue to be subject to the
need for the BCC to provide adequate liquidity to the economy, while preserving overall
price and macroeconomic stability. The BCC will continue to ensure implementation of the
main recommendations from the safeguards assessment conducted in 2010. In this context,
the Bank‘s cash holdings are already subjected to external auditing and certification; the
work to bring the BCC‘s financial statements into conformity with international standards is
ongoing, and should be completed in 2011. In addition, the monetary data reported to Fund
staff are subject to prior review by the Bank's internal controller. Finally, in 2011, the BCC
will complete its work to strengthen banking supervision, with technical and financial
support from the IMF and the Banque de France.
13.
Overall, the financial position of the Comorian banking system continues to be
satisfactory. The prevalence of nonperforming loans declined in 2010, and though affected
by the crisis, the overall profitability of banking institutions—and microfinance institutions
in particular—remained stable. The government has also taken steps to begin strengthening
management of the National Postal and Financial Services Company (SNPSF), with a view
to improving the institution‘s financial standing and helping protect depositors‘ savings.
D. Balance of Payments and External Debt
14.
The external current account deficit, including grants and private and official
transfers, is expected to widen in 2011, to 13.6 percent of GDP, compared with
10.2 percent in 2010. This largely reflects a return to normal levels of official grants,
following the strong expansion noted in the previous year. Having begun discussions for
substantial debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and on terms comparable to those
provided by Paris Club creditors, the government reaffirms its commitment to a prudent debt
policy so as to avoid jeopardizing the sustainability of the country's external debt.
15.
Any external borrowing contracted or guaranteed by the government is subject
to prior approval by the Minister of Finance of the Union, and the autonomous
governments of the islands do not have the authority to contract or guarantee external
borrowing. As in the past, the government will neither contract nor guarantee any short-term

43
or nonconcessional borrowing as defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU). The authorities will continue to consult the IMF before contracting or guaranteeing
any concessional external debt in excess of US$20 million. With support from the African
Development Bank, the Public Debt Directorate will soon be provided with an effective debt
management software and training for staff. The government will shortly submit to the World
Bank a request for technical assistance to assess its debt management capacity. On this basis,
it will be able to develop an effective program for enhancing its expertise in this area.
E. Structural Policies
16.
The government aims to impart new impetus to its public enterprise reform
program. To this end, it has notably made a request for multiyear technical assistance from
the IFC. With support from the African Development Bank, by end-December 2010 it will
finalize the recruitment of the consultant tasked with preparing the reform strategy for the
electric company (MAMWE); the strategy should be completed by end-March 2011. In the
first quarter of 2011, the government intends to call for expressions of interest from potential
strategic partners for Comores Télécom and SCH. It will do the same for MAMWE before
end-June 2011.
17.
Public finance structural reforms aim to improve budget management. The
government has requested World Bank assistance in drawing up a list of priority sector
expenditures. By end-March 2011, it will adopt the terms of reference for a study aimed at
introducing a budgetary framework and medium-term expenditure plans. Also by end-June
2011, it intends to adopt a list of priority expenditures which it will have rigorously
monitored by the inter-unit committee responsible for monitoring PRSP implementation.
This should help ensure that the saving resulting from the debt service reduction under the
HIPC Initiative will be used to effectively finance the priority sectors defined in the poverty
reduction and growth strategy.
18.
Efforts underway in the area of public administration are aimed at
strengthening the sustainability of the budget in the medium term. The National
Assembly recently adopted new personnel frameworks for the civil service. These will be
implemented starting in fiscal year 2011, making it possible in particular to reduce civil
service staffing (including that of the army) to about 10,600, as compared with 12,300 at end2010. This is more in line with the government‘s financial resources. The government is
continuing to seek technical and financial support from its development partners for the
preparation and implementation of a staff separation support program.
F. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and Improvement of Economic and
Social Statistics
19.
The government intends to make its Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) more
operational. It is improving the prioritization and the specificity of projects and policies,
especially those associated with the HIPC Initiative completion point triggers. With the

44
assistance of development partners, the preparation of an action plan refocused on the PRSP
will be finalized by end-2010. The government intends to implement it rigorously starting in
2011, with technical and financial support from its development partners.
20.
The government is resolved to continue its efforts to improve the sociodemographic and macroeconomic database needed in the design and monitoring of its
development policy. In this connection it is receiving significant technical assistance from
the AfDB, particularly in respect of the preparation of the national accounts and the
consumer price index. The program to improve the quality of national accounts and
consumer price index statistics is expected to be completed in 2011.
IV. MONITORING OF PROGRAM EXECUTION
21.
Before the discussion of the second review of the program by the IMF Executive
Board, the government will (i) provide Fund staff with evidence of payment to the
Treasury‘s account at the BCC of the balance of the amount due from the profit tax (IBD) of
Comores Télécom for 2010, namely CF 1.553 billion; as well as CF 2.247 billion in
additional revenue from the economic citizenship program; (ii) request multiyear technical
support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to implement smoothly the reforms
of Comores Télécom and SCH; (iii) provide Fund staff with specimens of the computerized
payroll slips for the Union, Ngazidja, Anjouan, and Mohéli; and (iv) request technical
support from the World Bank to drawing up a list of social and priority expenditures.
22.
The program will be monitored on the basis of quarterly targets with
performance criteria established on a half-yearly basis (Tables 1 and 2). The authorities
will provide the IMF with such information as needed to monitor the program, in accordance
with the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. During the program period, the
authorities will not introduce or intensify restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, and will not introduce or modify any multiple currency practices,
conclude any bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the
IMF's Articles of Agreement, or impose any restrictions on imports for balance of payments
purposes.
23.
The third review of the ECF arrangement will take place in June 2011. In the
area of structural reforms, the review will focus primarily on measures aimed at
strengthening control of the wage bill, particularly: (i) the introduction of computerized pay
slips; (ii) completion of the census of government employees and officials; and
(iii) implementation of the Civil Service organizational frameworks.

ATTACHMENT 2
UNION OF THE COMOROS
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

Moroni, November 29, 2010
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
performance criteria and quantitative and structural benchmarks to monitor the
implementation of the program supported by the three-year arrangement under the Extended
Credit Facility. It also describes the data to be reported for program monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITION
2.
Unless otherwise specified below, "the government" is meant to include the
government of the Union of the Comoros and the autonomous island governments. Local
governments, the central bank, or any government-owned entity with separate legal
personality are excluded from the definition of government. The units covered under this
definition of government are consolidated for the needs of the program.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
3.
Quantitative performance criteria are proposed for December 31, 2010 and June
30, 2011 with respect to changes in net domestic credit to the government and net changes in
domestic payments arrears; with benchmarks for March 31, 2011. The following
performance criteria are proposed for monitoring on a continuous basis: (i) the external
payments arrears of the government; (ii) the contracting or guaranteeing of new
nonconcessional external debt by the government; and (iii) the contracting or guaranteeing of
new short-term external debt by the government.
A. Change in Net Domestic Credit to the Government
Definitions
4.
Net domestic credit to the government is defined as overall net credit extended to the
government from domestic bank and nonbank sources. Net bank credit to the government
reflects the net debt position of the government vis-à-vis the central bank, commercial banks,
and the National Postal and Financial Services Company (SNPSF), as well as microfinance
institutions. It is the difference between the government's gross indebtedness to the banking
system and its claims on the banking system. These government claims include all deposits at

49

the central bank and commercial banks, as well as Treasury cash holdings. The government's
debt to the banking system includes central bank credit (statutory advances as well as any
long-term credit and IMF net credit) and commercial bank credit, as well as net deposits at
the SNPSF. Domestic nonbank credit to the government includes changes in the stock of
Treasury bills placed in the domestic market, privatization receipts, and any other domestic
financial debt of the government held outside the banking sector, other than arrears.
5.
The change in net domestic credit to the government as of the date for the
performance criterion or benchmark is defined as the difference between the stock on the
date indicated and the stock on December 31, 2010.
Performance criteria
6.
The amounts set out in Table 1 of the MEFP on Net Credit to Government for
December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 are ceilings and constitute performance criteria. The
amount set out in the above table for March 31, 2011 is a ceiling and constitutes an indicative
target.
Reporting requirements
7.
The BCC will report the provisional data on net bank credit to the government to
Fund staff on a monthly basis, with a lag of no more than 45 days after the end of each
observation period. Final data will be reported with a maximum lag of two months. The
Ministry of Finance will report monthly on any financing from nonbank sources.
B. Domestic Payments Arrears
Definition
8.
New domestic payments arrears of the government are defined as any of the
following: (i) any invoice that a spending ministry has received from a supplier of goods and
services, delivered and verified, and for which payment has not been made within 90 days
after the date the payment order (ordonnancement) was cleared; (ii) in the case of specific
contracts between the suppliers and the government, any invoice received and not paid on the
due date stipulated in the contracts; (iii) tax credits confirmed by the proper authorities after
review, and not paid within 60 days from the date when the payment order was issued; and
(iv) wages and salaries and any payments to a government employee that were due to be paid
in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th day of the following month.
Performance criterion
9.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate any new domestic payments
arrears and will gradually reduce the outstanding amount of such arrears determined as at
December 31, 2010. The amounts set out in Table 1 of the MEFP on Domestic Payments

50

Arrears and Net Credit to Government for December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 are ceilings
and constitute performance criteria. The amount set on in the above table for March 31, 2011
represents a ceiling and constitutes a quantitative benchmark.
Adjuster
10.
If external budget support is less than expected, the floor on the reduction of domestic
payments arrears will be lowered by the full amount of the shortfall. In the case of a surplus
in the amount of external budget support, the floor on the net reduction of domestic arrears
will be raised by the full amount of the surplus. Cumulative from January 1 of the year in
question, the program assumes external budget support of CF 19.300 billion by endDecember 2010, CF 0 billion by end-March 2011, and CF 1.972 billion by end-June 2011.
Reporting requirements
11.
The authorities will report to Fund staff any accumulation of domestic payments
arrears as defined above as soon as incurred, as well as the status of outstanding balances
(restes à payer) of the Treasury.
C. External Payments Arrears
Definition
12.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due but unpaid on
outstanding external debt (for a definition of external debt see paragraph 16) that has been
contracted or guaranteed by the government, with the exception of external payments arrears
arising from public debt being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club members.
Performance criterion
13.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate any external payments
arrears with respect to the public debt, except for payments related to renegotiations with
creditors, including Paris Club members. This performance criterion will be monitored on a
continuous basis.
Reporting requirements
14.
The authorities will report to Fund staff any accumulation of external payments
arrears as soon as the due date has been missed. They will provide each month, within a
maximum lag of 15 days, a table showing external debt due (after rescheduling) and paid.

51

D. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional External Debt
or Short-Term Debt by the Government
Definition
15.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 1441-(09/91), effective
December 1, 2009), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the government for
which value has not been received.
16.
Short-term debt refers to external debt with a contractual maturity of less than one
year. External debt refers to debt owed to nonresidents.
17.
The definition of debt, as specified in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, reads as follows: ―(a) For the purposes of this
guideline, the term ‗debt‘ will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debt can take a number of forms, including: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the
obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers‘
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers‘ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property; (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a), arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.‖
18.
Any external debt of which the present value, calculated with the reference interest
rates mentioned hereafter, is superior to 50 percent of the nominal value (grant element of
less than 50 percent) is considered nonconcessional, with the exception of IMF lending under

52

the Extended Credit Facility, which is considered concessional even if it does not meet the
35 percent grant element threshold. For debt with a maturity of more than 15 years, the tenyear reference market interest rate, published by the OECD, is used to calculate the grant
element. The six-month reference market rate is used for debt with shorter maturities.
19.
For the purposes of this performance criterion, government is understood to include
the government (as defined in paragraph 2 above), as well as local administrations, public
institutions of an industrial and commercial nature (EPICs), public administrative institutions
(EPAs), public enterprises, and government-owned or -controlled independent companies
(i.e., public enterprises with financial autonomy of which the government holds at least
50 percent of the capital).
Performance criterion
20.
The government as defined in paragraph 19 will not contract or guarantee
nonconcessional or short-term external debt as defined above. This performance criterion
will be monitored on a continuous basis. It does not apply to debt rescheduling and
restructuring operations. In addition, import-related credit and pre-export financing secured
on export contracts of less than one year maturity are excluded from this performance
criterion on short-term debt.
Reporting requirements
21.
The authorities will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as
soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government.
III. QUANTITATIVE BENCHMARKS
A. Domestic Primary Balance
Definition
22.
The consolidated domestic primary fiscal balance (payment order basis) is calculated
as total government revenue (defined below), excluding foreign grants, less expenditure,
excluding interest payments, and foreign-financed technical assistance and investment
expenditure.
Quantitative Benchmarks
23.
The benchmarks for the floor on the domestic primary fiscal balance, cumulative
from the beginning of the 2011 calendar year, are set at CF –3.141 billion for December 31,
CF –0.366 billion for March 31, 2011, and CF –1.354 billion for June 30, 2011.

53

Reporting requirements
24.
During the program period, data on the domestic primary fiscal balance (payment
order basis) will be forwarded to Fund staff monthly by the Ministry of Finance of the Union
within 45 days following the end of each month.
B. Government Revenue
Definition
25.
Government revenue is defined as reported in the consolidated government financial
operations table (TOFE), and includes all tax and nontax receipts and excludes external
grants.
Quantitative Benchmarks
26.
The floor on government revenue, cumulative from the beginning of the 2001
calendar year, is set at CF 28.848 billion for December 31, 2010, CF 7.008 billion for
March 31, 2011, and CF 14.446 billion for June 30, 2011. These amounts are considered
benchmarks under the program, for the respective dates.
Reporting requirements
27.
The Ministry of Finance will report preliminary revenue data to Fund staff monthly,
with a lag of no more than 45 days, on the basis of actual collections as recorded in Treasury
accounts. Final data will be provided once the final Treasury accounts are available, but not
later than two months after the reporting of preliminary data.
C. Expenditures Made by Cash Advances
Definition
28.
Expenditures made by cash advances include all expenditures paid without prior
commitment order.
Quantitative Benchmarks
29.
Responsibility for achieving the ceiling on expenditures outside of normal procedures
rests with both the Union government and the autonomous island governments. This ceiling,
cumulative from January 1, 2011, is set at CF 150 million at December 31, 2010, March 31,
2011, and June 30, 2011.

54

Reporting requirements
30.
Data on expenditures made outside of normal procedures will be forwarded to Fund
staff monthly by the Ministry of Finance of the Union, within 30 days following the end of
each month.
D. Domestically Financed Social Spending
Definition
31.
Total domestically financed social spending (current and capital) is calculated, for
each category of current expenditure (wages, goods and services, transfers and subsidies) and
capital expenditure as: (1) expenditure executed by the Ministry of Health (under "health"),
and (2) expenditure executed by the Ministry of Education (under "education"). Domestically
financed social spending is classified according to the above categories (health and
education) based on a classification of each project presented in the 2010 budget into health
and education. Total domestically financed current and capital social spending includes
social spending financed by domestic resources, including revenues, domestic financing, and
general external budget support, and excludes all social spending financed by project-specific
foreign grants and/or loans.
Quantitative benchmarks
32.
The floor on total domestically financed social spending for the period from
January 1, 2010 to end-December 2010 is set at CF 11.870 billion. This amount is an
indicative target under the program.
Reporting deadlines
33.
During the program period, data on domestically financed social spending will be
forwarded to Fund staff by the Ministry of Finance within 45 days following the end of the
period.

VIII. Summary of Safeguards Assessment. An update of the August 2007 safeguards
assessment of the Banque Centrale des Comores (BCC) was completed in April 2010.
The safeguards assessment found that despite capacity constraints the central bank has
taken steps to strengthen its safeguards framework; it recommended that efforts to
implement International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) should be intensified
and the financial controller should review data submitted to the Fund for each program
test date, starting in December 2009.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The currency of the Comoros is the Comorian franc,
which is pegged to the Euro at €1 = CF 492. The Comoros has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

XI.

Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
December 15, 2008 (Country Report No. 09/42). Executive Directors noted that the
return to political stability is allowing the authorities to address deep-rooted
macroeconomic distortions and structural rigidities. Directors welcomed the authorities'
intention to implement a broad-ranging macroeconomic and structural reform program
aimed at achieving fiscal sustainability, while improving the investment climate and
strengthening institutions and governance. Directors recognized that Comoros' fiscal
prospects remain difficult as illustrated by sizeable financing requirements for 2009
and beyond and by unsustainable public debt levels.

III. COMOROS: RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
A. Bank Group’s Support in Comoros
1. The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) started operations in Comoros in 1978 and
has since approved thirteen operations comprising twelve projects and one study. Cumulative
Bank Group commitments net of cancellation amount to UA 46.7 million as of 31 March 2010,
the bulk of this financing (64%) being from the concessional window, the African Development
Fund (ADF). In addition, the AfDB approved a UA 1.5 million emergency financing to assist in
mitigating the adverse impact of the food crisis in February 2009, plus a UA 0.6 million grant
under the Institutional Capacity Building Project (ICBP) in November 2010. Overall, the AfDB
operations in Comoros have been directed toward supporting economic-related infrastructure,
budget support and rural livelihoods. In terms of sector distribution, infrastructure sector
projects received the largest share (51 percent) of the total resources committed, followed by
multi-sector (30.2 percent, comprising operations in governance, economic and financial
reform) and agriculture (11.2 percent).
B. Strategic Orientation
2. The Bank Group re-engagement in Comoros is recent. Following the resolution of the
Anjouan crisis in 2007 and the lifting of sanctions in February 2009 after clearance of its arrears
with the Bank under the Bank‘s Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF), a two-year Interim
Country Strategy Paper 2009-2010 (I-CSP) was approved in April 2009. The I-CSP is aligned to
the Interim Growth Strategy and Poverty Reduction Paper (I-GSRP) prepared by the Government
of Comoros (GoC). This I-CSP builds inter alia on the new strategic orientations of the Bank for
increased commitment in fragile States aimed at mitigating the country‘s situation of fragility
and providing support to create an enabling environment for sustainable development, as well as
helping Comoros to reach the completion point of the HIPC Initiative in the near future. In this
respect, the Bank‘s I-CSP (2009-2010) aims at: (i) improving economic management through
support for institutional capacity building, and (ii) creating a better environment through
improved water supply and sanitation. All the Bank‘s operations are articulated around the two
I-CSP pillars: (i) strengthening institutions and the macroeconomic framework, and
(ii) improving water supply and sanitation. The envelope available for Comoros for the 2009–
2010 period stands at UA 15.9 million, comprising the normal performance-based ADF XI
allocation (UA 5,9 million) and the FSF Enhanced Support (UA 10 million). In addition,
Comoros just received US$2 million from the Fragile States Facility Targeted Support Window
for capacity building, including for the finalization of the PRSP, training of civil servants,
revision of the fiscal code, fiscal re-organization, preparation of the PFM strategy and action
plan, capacity building to the CGP and to the water and sanitation Ministry.

7
C. Lending Portfolio
3. Currently, the Bank‘s ongoing portfolio in Comoros is composed of two operations, the
Economic Support Reform Program (ESRP) consisting in a budget support operation and the
Institutional Capacities Strengthening Project (ICSP) whose objective is to strengthen national
capacities in public financial management (PFM), debt management and macroeconomic
statistics. Consistent with the I-CSP, a Water and Sanitation Project was approved by the Boards
in December 2009. Overall, current disbursement trends remain in line with forecasts. A
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) is scheduled for the second half of 2011.
D. Non Lending Activities
4. During the preparation of the I-CSP, the Bank identified a series of possible avenues for
economic and sector work (ESW) chief among these was the common objective of the
Comorian authorities and the Bank to pay particular attention to growth impediments and
identify key sectors likely to leverage and sustain economic growth over the medium-long term
in Comoros. A study on the Sources of Growth in Comoros has been launched in August 2009.
The first phase consisting in a macro and sector diagnosis is currently at the completion stage.
The second phase scheduled for 2011 will focus on fine tuning sector surveys and elaborating a
decision-making tool targeted at policy makers with respect to investment choices and economic
policy impact. Specific areas for ESWs would be further explored through consultations with
Government and other development partners in the context of the preparation of the next
Country Strategy Paper (CSP).

IV. COMOROS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Comoros—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of November 18, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The

statistical database has deficiencies in all sectors largely due to inadequate staffing and
funding, as well as lack of integration of island-based data.
National accounts. Shortcomings in national accounts compilation undermine accuracy and
reliability of the data and impart a high degree of uncertainty to economic analysis. The
absence of basic source data requires estimates of GDP to be prepared with outdated
benchmarks and rely on crude assumptions and extrapolations. Due to lack of funding and
staffing, there have been no survey-based national accounts since 1995, when one was
prepared with UNDP assistance, and to date there has been no survey at all on
manufacturing. In 2004, with the support of donors, a new population census and surveys on
subsistence agriculture and households were completed; unfortunately, these surveys have
neither been fully processed nor updated. A July 2006 AFR mission helped the authorities
improve GDP estimates for 2001–05. The authorities are well aware of these shortcomings
and the Commissariat Général au Plan (CGP) has asked the assistance of the African
Development Bank for long term technical assistance in both national accounts and price
statistics.
Consumer prices. The accuracy and reliability of the consumer price index (CPI), represents
another key source of uncertainty. Expenditure weights are based on a survey from the late
1980s and sub-indices are compiled irregularly across the islands. Most price data are
collected only for the country‘s capital. CPI compilation is largely conducted by one person.
Government finance statistics. In August/September 2005 STA mission found that the
public chart of accounts did not accurately record the execution of the budget and that a
standardized presentation on outstanding public debt is not compiled. Classification of
budgetary data is often not consistent over time or across the islands. In particular, problems
arise in data on domestic arrears, external debt, and external support including its investment
spending components, complicating fiscal analysis.
Monetary and financial statistics. The Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) produces adequate
monetary statistics on its own accounts, for the commercial banks and the development bank
active in the country, for the deposits collected by the postal administration, and for two
microfinance networks. The Franc Zone arrangement has established accounting and
prudential standards that prevent data disruptions. A major shortcoming is the absence of
data on the large amount of Euro cash in circulation, handicapping surveillance. In June 2009
the BCC started reporting monetary and financial statistics to the IMF using Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs). The current presentation and content of monetary statistics accords
largely with the methodology in the IMF‘s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

9

External sector statistics. The BCC compiles balance of payments statistics along the lines
of the methods recommended in IMF‘s Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition.
Nevertheless, despite technical assistance and some improvements over the past few years,
shortcomings in coverage and compilation continue to affect accuracy and reliability and
impart uncertainty to economic analysis. A single BCC economist is responsible for
compiling balance of payments statistics, precluding desirable improvements needed in
coverage and data validation, particularly for trade, nonregistered trade, services, and foreign
direct investment.
Income distribution data and social indicators. Some progress was made with collecting
income-distribution statistics and social welfare indicators when the I-PRSP was being
prepared in 2003–04. Since then, coverage has remained limited hampering the monitoring of
progress towards the MDGs.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Comoros does not participate in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

Forthcoming technical assistance
In 2005, the authorities requested a Statistics Department (STA) multi-topic technical
assistance mission with a view to a thorough revamping of the statistical system. STA is
planning to provide technical assistance in the area of national accounts. A Statistics
Department GDDS metadata development mission scheduled for January 2007 was
postponed at the request of the authorities. A 2010 request for assistance with reviewing the
methodology and practices for preparing national accounts and CPI statistics was withdrawn
following the initiation of AfDB technical assistance in the same areas.
As regards monetary statistics, the authorities are requesting a technical assistance mission to
review the SRF test data and identify possible methodological departures from the
recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

Statement by the Staff Representative
January 18, 2011

1.
This statement provides an update on the status of the prior actions since the issuance
of the staff report and the associated correction (www.imf.org). The additional information
does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.

All prior actions have been implemented and the program remains broadly on track.


As noted in the staff report (www.imf.org), completion of the second review under
the ECF arrangement is subject to the implementation of four prior actions, all of
which have now been fully implemented. In particular, the authorities have taken
steps to address the fiscal slippages incurred in the third quarter of 2010, including
the collection of 0.8 percent of GDP in tax arrears owed by the state-owned
telecommunication company and recovery of over 1 percent of GDP in receipts
under the economic citizenship program. These revenues were collected in late
December 2010 and early January 2011, respectively.



At this stage, staff has no comprehensive information on the fiscal outturn for end2010. However, available partial data bode well regarding the likelihood of the
authorities meeting the modified end-December 2010 performance criteria on net
credit to government and the reduction of domestic arrears. The authorities have
expressed the view that the two program targets are within reach.



In light of the late recovery of receipts under the economic citizenship program,
staff intends to assess in the context of the next review, when full information on
the outcome for end-2010 becomes available, if there is a need to amend the endJune 2011 performance criterion on net credit to government to keep the fiscal
program on the envisaged path.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 2, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Comoros
On January 21, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Comoros.1
Background

Over the last two years, economic activity in the Union of Comoros has gained momentum
despite a challenging external environment. Real GDP increased by 1.8 percent in 2009,
benefiting from a gradual return to political stability and the launch of reforms to begin removing
deep-seated structural impediments to economic development. Preliminary data point to a
further strengthening of economic conditions in 2010, with real growth rising to 2.1 percent,
underpinned by a rebound in donor-funded public investment, a pick-up in remittances-based
private sector construction, and stronger activity in tourism; as well as an expansion of financial
intermediation. From its peak during the food and energy crisis of 2008, inflation has eased to
low single digits, hovering around 3 percent. Contributing factors include a prudent monetary
policy under the Franc zone and somewhat subdued pressures on food and fuel prices.
However, in the face of real appreciation of the euro-pegged Comoros franc and deteriorating
terms of trade, the external current account deficit is estimated at the relatively high equivalent

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

of 10.2 percent of GDP in 2010. Reflecting broadly satisfactory performance under IMF- and
World Bank-supported reforms, Comoros reached the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative Decision Point in July 2010.
Against this background, progress in fiscal consolidation has been slow. The domestic primary
fiscal deficit stagnated at 2.6 percent of GDP in 2009, and delays in collecting taxes and
implementing new fiscal measures under the IMF-supported program pushed the deficit above
the program target for end-September 2010. However, corrective measures introduced late in
the year and in the first quarter of 2011 should help keep the fiscal program on track. On the
structural front, the authorities have completed reform strategies for key public utilities, with
however limited progress in implementing related measures. To advance the public enterprise
reform program, the authorities have requested a multi-year technical assistance program from
the International Finance Corporation (IFC). In 2011, the government plans to issue calls for
bids to enlist private sector involvement in the management of the state-owned
telecommunication and petroleum-importing companies.
Economic growth is expected to rise to an annual average of 4 percent in the medium term
driven by stronger activity in agriculture and fishing, inter-island transportation, and tourism.
Inflation should remain subdued, consistent with Comoros’ membership in the Franc zone. By
2014, the authorities aim to bring the domestic primary fiscal balance to equilibrium, with
government revenue rising to at least 15 percent of GDP. In the external sector, the HIPC
Initiative Completion Point is expected to be reached in late 2012, putting external debt on a
sustainable position while freeing additional resources for pro-growth and pro-poor programs.
This requires close adherence to reforms under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper. Risks to the outlook include civil service pressures for higher wages
and political resistance to public enterprise reform, which could delay progress in fiscal
consolidation and in implementing the structural reform agenda. Moreover, a return of political
instability following the 2010 elections could hinder delivery of anticipated external resources,
including Foreign Direct Investment. Also, in the absence of much-needed technical assistance,
weak absorption and implementation capacity would cloud the medium-term growth prospects.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Comorian authorities for their broadly satisfactory policies
in a challenging political and economic environment, including the uncertain global recovery and
renewed pressure on commodity prices.
Directors welcomed the improved fiscal performance in the first half of 2010, but expressed
concern at slippages later in the year. They welcomed corrective steps underway and urged the
authorities to implement expeditiously planned revenue and expenditure measures to
strengthen the fiscal position.

3
Directors noted the importance of reforms to enhance the budget process, tax administration
and expenditure control especially as regards the public sector wage bill, with a view to creating
fiscal space for needed pro-growth and pro-poor spending.
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent debt management and efforts in reaching
debt restructuring understandings with all external creditors, which are essential to addressing
Comoros’ unsustainable external debt.
Directors welcomed recent progress in strengthening banking supervision and adopting the
recommendations from the 2010 Safeguards Assessment. They urged the authorities to
address lingering structural impediments to financial intermediation, including weaknesses in
the legal framework and inadequate internal control mechanisms and reporting standards at
banks.
Directors underscored that achieving a higher growth path will require far-reaching structural
reforms to bolster Comoros’ competitiveness and increase the economy’s ability to intermediate
remittances and aid inflows. In particular, they stressed the need to improve the business
environment and the management of public utilities.
To mitigate risks to the program, Directors urged the authorities to nurture the national
consensus on the importance of building on the progress achieved so far and of reaching the
HIPC Initiative completion point under the ECF-supported reform agenda.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under ECF Arrangement with the Union of
the Comoros and Approves US$2.42 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second review
of the Union of the Comoros‘ economic performance under a program supported by the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). The Board‘s decision enables the immediate disbursement of an amount of
SDR 1.56 million (about US$2.42 million), bringing total disbursements under the ECF to the
Comoros to SDR 7.34 million (about US$11.41 million). The Executive Board also approved a
modification of the end-2010 performance criterion on net domestic credit to the government.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion on the Comoros, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
―Economic performance under the ECF-supported program has been broadly satisfactory. Despite a
challenging political environment, economic activity is accelerating and efforts are made to build on
progress to date in macroeconomic management. Initiatives are in place to remove structural
impediments to growth and make further inroads into poverty alleviation.
―Recent fiscal slippages need to be addressed by strengthening revenue mobilization and containing
the wage bill with a view to channeling resources to pro-poor and pro-growth programs. Additional
action is also needed to improve the efficiency of tax and custom administration and reform the
budget process.
―The authorities‘ prudent debt management and good faith efforts in reaching debt restructuring
understandings with all external creditors are essential to addressing Comoros‘ unsustainable external
debt.

2

―On the structural front, renewed efforts are needed to improve the business environment and the
management of public utilities. Progress in these areas will bolster Comoros‘ competitiveness. In
particular, enlisting private sector participation in the management of the telecommunications,
electricity, and oil-importing parastatals remains a priority. In the financial sector, the authorities
need to further reinforce banking oversight
―A continued commitment to the macroeconomic and structural reform agenda as well as a national
consensus on policy direction will be crucial for the program‘s success,‖ Mr. Shinohara added.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for the Union of the Comoros
January 18, 2011

I.

Introduction

Against the backdrop of a stable political environment and the strengthening of the country‘s
institutions, my Comorian authorities have embarked on an ambitious economic reform agenda
underpinned by the 2009 Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP). This paper
also serves as the foundation for the three-year reform program supported by the IMF under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Under this program, my authorities are implementing sound
policies aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability, raising the level of economic growth while
tackling poverty more effectively. These efforts are also receiving the support of the international
community through a substantial increase in external assistance.
As confirmed by staff in the report, my authorities have continued to make progress under the
Fund-supported program. In particular, all June 2010 performance criteria and quantitative and
structural benchmarks were met. Macroeconomic performance has also been broadly
satisfactory, thanks in part to an increase in FDI and the authorities‘ sound policies under the
ECF which have contributed to a strengthening of domestic demand.
During the second half of 2010, the fiscal position weakened in the third quarter due, among
others, to a shortfall in revenues reflecting delays in the payment of taxes owed to the Treasury
by Comores Télécom. As a result, the fiscal objectives as of end-September 2010 were not met.
In addition, the delayed disbursement of financial support from some development partners
adversely affected government deposits at the central bank and therefore led to a breaching of the
ceiling on net credit to the government. The authorities took corrective measures, and in
November they obtained the settlement of the profit taxes owed by Comores Télécom, along with
other revenues. Nevertheless, there was still an overrun in spending associated with the elections
equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP.
My authorities would like to reassure Directors that they remain fully committed to the
objectives of the program. They have completed all prior actions, and going forward, the
program will continue to focus on the implementation of a prudent fiscal policy and on the
adoption of structural policies that will enhance the economy‘s competitiveness. In this regard,
my authorities would like to point out that many of the taxes enacted in 2010 started to generate
revenue only in late 2010 but will be fully effective in 2011. Moreover, the government has
recruited external consultants who have begun work on auditing the 2009 accounts of Comoros
Télécom, which will be followed by an appraisal of the enterprise‘s net worth, with a view to
issuing calls for expressions of interest from potential partners. At the same time, a committee
has been established to monitor the reform of the petroleum product-importing company in order
to assist the government with finalizing the choice of an appropriate reform strategy. The
government is also working with the African Development Bank to develop a plan to reform the
electricity company.

2

The fight against poverty will remain at the core of my authorities‘ development agenda as they
strive to make their PRGSP more operational. In this regard, they are currently finalizing the
preparation of an action plan with the assistance of development partners to better prioritize
development projects and policies. They look forward to raising spending in priority sectors in
the period ahead with the much-needed resources that will be freed upon reaching the HIPC
completion point. In this vein, my authorities would like to reiterate their firm commitment to
pursuing a timely implementation of all the triggers in order to reach the completion point in
2012 as expected.
II.

Policies Under the Extended Credit Facility

In 2011, my authorities will pursue the implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies under
the program. In particular, they are aware of the need to accelerate progress towards a more
sustainable fiscal position. The strict implementation of these policies within a more stable
political and social environment should help contribute to a strengthening of economic activity
led by investment in infrastructure and private construction. Accordingly, real GDP is projected
to reach 2.5 percent in 2011 (from 1.8 in 2010), increasing more rapidly than population growth,
thereby raising the population‘s living standards following many years of stagnation. Inflation
will remain in the low single-digit, thanks to Comoros‘ membership in the zone Franc‘s
monetary framework which continues to serve the economy well.
In the fiscal area, my authorities are determined to continue in 2011 their fiscal consolidation
efforts, and reduce the fiscal deficit from 3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.2 percent in 2011. To
this effect, they intend to strengthen government revenues while keeping a strict control over
expenditures—particularly the wage bill—while improving the quality of spending, preserving
pro-poor expenditures, and avoiding the accumulation of arrears. The projected increase in
domestic revenues to 14.2 percent of GDP in 2011 from 13.1 in 2008 is expected to result from
the improvement in the efficiency of the tax and customs administration currently being
undertaken, based on the recommendations of a recent Fiscal Affairs Department T/A mission.
New domestic tax measures will also contribute to raising domestic revenues.
Fiscal expenditures in 2011 will be capped at 23.2 percent of GDP, and a particular attention will
be given to keeping the wage bill under strict control. In support of these efforts, Comoros‘
National Assembly has adopted recently new personnel frameworks for the civil service that will
help reduce civil service staffing starting in 2011, and lead to a decline in the wage bill.
In the context of increased financial intermediation resulting from the introduction of two new
foreign banks in Comoros, the banking system’s financial position remains satisfactory. NPLs
declined in 2010 and the overall profitability of banks stayed stable despite the relative impact of
the global crisis. These developments will positively contribute to further entrench the economic
recovery through increased credit to the private sector. Measures have also been taken to
strengthen the national postal and financial services company (SNPSF)—which shows relatively
weaker prudential ratios than other financial institutions—with a view to improving its financial
standing and helping protect depositors‘ savings.

3

The current account deficit is projected to widen to 13.6 percent of GDP in 2011 from
10.2 percent in 2010 driven by an increase in imports. My authorities are confident that the
projected increase in FDIs in the coming years notably following the 2010 Qatar Conference will
greatly contribute to an economic diversification towards key sectors identified in the PRSCP
such as agriculture, fishing, and tourism. This will contribute to raising exports and curbing the
current account deficit over time. Foreign exchange reserves, however, will remain comfortable
at above 6 months of imports cover at end-2011.
On the structural front, my Comorian authorities intend to further accelerate the reform of
public enterprises in 2011 with the assistance of development partners, notably the World Bank
and the African Development Bank. Progress has already been achieved in identifying the
appropriate reform strategy for the Société Comorienne des Hydrocarbures while the preparatory
work for the reform strategy of the water and electricity company is ongoing and should be
completed by end-March 2011. The authorities intend to issue calls for expressions of interest
from potential strategic partners for Société Comorienne des Hydrocarbures and for Comores
Télécom in the first quarter of 2011, as noted above. As for the electricity company, a call for
expressions of interest should be issued before end-June 2011.
My authorities are thankful to the partners that are providing interim debt relief under the HIPC
initiative and to those who have agreed to defer debt service payments pending debt relief under
the initiative. Moving forward, they would like to reaffirm their commitment to a prudent debt
strategy and, accordingly, will neither contract nor guarantee any short-term or nonconcessional
borrowing. Furthermore, as regards concessional borrowing, they will consult with Fund staff
before contracting or guaranteeing any such external debt in excess of USD$20 million.
III.

Conclusion

My Comorian authorities would like to reiterate their deep commitment to the program of
adjustment and to the achievement of its objectives. It is their intention to further strengthen their
efforts to boost growth and reduce poverty more rapidly. In this spirit, they would like to express
their deep gratitude to the Board for its support and guidance throughout the years. They request
once again Executive Directors‘ support for the completion of the second review under the ECF,
and for the modification of a performance criterion for end-December 2010.
