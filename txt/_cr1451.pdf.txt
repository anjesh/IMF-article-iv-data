STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 24, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. With GDP growth below trend and the investment phase of the mining boom
having passed its peak and beginning to decline, a key issue is how Australia can manage
the mining-production/export phase and encourage broader-based growth. The main
external risks include a slowdown in China over the medium term and surges in global
financial market volatility. The pickup in housing market activity, though welcome to date,
could pose a future risk if prices accelerate and lead to overshooting.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. With the exchange rate still moderately overvalued
and weighing on non-mining activity, accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate.
Monetary policy should remain the primary macroeconomic tool for managing aggregate
demand, although there is fiscal policy space to respond in the event of a deterioration in
the outlook.
Medium-term fiscal policy. The government’s aim to return the budget to surplus over the
medium term would help rebuild fiscal buffers. Staff’s analysis shows that without increases
in revenue this would require sizeable cuts in projected spending.
Financial stability. The financial sector is resilient and has strengthened in recent years,
although banks’ reliance on offshore funding will continue. The emphasis on tight lending
standards and intensive supervision should help limit financial sector risks.
Transition to broader-based growth. Higher resource exports will make the economy
more sensitive to terms of trade shocks, and the floating exchange rate will be an essential
buffer. Robust income growth over the past decade was supported by the sharp increase in
the terms of trade. As this effect unwinds, a significant pickup in productivity will be needed
to maintain growth in living standards.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Setting. The Australian economy has performed well relative to many other advanced
economies since the global financial crisis. However, a transition phase has now been reached as the
terms-of-trade-driven mining investment boom of the past decade has peaked and the economy is
moving to the production and export phase. Mining-related investment which accounted for almost
half of GDP growth in the past couple of years is expected to drop sharply in the near term (text
figure and Annex 4), and a recovery in non-mining investment will be needed to underpin demand
and return the economy’s growth rate to trend.
2.
Real economy developments. Annual growth has slowed to 2¼ percent in the third
quarter of 2013, below the trend growth of around 3 percent. In addition to the slowdown of
investment in new mining projects, non-mining investment has been weighed down by excess
capacity and an overvalued exchange rate (Box 2, Figure 1). In line with relatively weak consumer
sentiment, consumption growth has been modest and the household savings rate has remained
above 10 percent, leaving the household debt-to-income ratio stable at around 150 percent. On the
plus side mining exports, mainly to China, are growing as new capacity comes on stream and in
recent months housing market activity has begun to pick up with building approvals, transactions,
and prices increasing (paragraph 8 and Annex 2). Nevertheless labor market conditions have
remained soft and the unemployment rate has risen gradually from a trough of 5 percent in mid2011, in part reflecting the mining sector moving
Australia: Mining Investment
to the less labor-intensive production phase.
(In percent of GDP)
3.
Inflation. Annual inflation slowed to
2¼ percent in the third quarter, close to the
middle of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA)
target band. With the weakening of overall labor
market conditions wage inflation has slowed to
2¾ percent, the lowest rate since 2000 (text
figure).
4.
Monetary policy. In response to
weakening demand the RBA has eased the policy
rate by 225 basis points since November 2011 to
2½ percent, with the most recent cut in August
2013 (Figures 3 and 4). This has begun to support
interest-sensitive spending and asset values.
Market lending rates, key indicators of the overall
monetary policy stance, are now well below their
historical averages. Overall credit growth however
has remained relatively subdued.

5.
Fiscal policy. The budget deficit was reduced from 3 percent of GDP to 1½ percent in
2012/13. The previous government’s goal of returning the budget to surplus last year was held back
by slower-than-projected output growth and weaker commodity prices. Revenue fell short of
projections as the lower terms of trade together with the persistently strong Australian dollar
reduced nominal GDP and dented corporate profitability, with company tax revenue coming in
around ½ percent of GDP lower than expected. Capital gains and resource rent taxes were also
weak. Spending was somewhat higher than anticipated, exceeding plans by 1¼ percent of GDP.1
6.
Recent market and financial sector developments. Aside from some welcome
depreciation of the dollar, Australian markets were little affected by the market turbulence following
the announcement of prospective Fed tapering in May 2013. The banking system has been
performing well, with profitability remaining strong and balance sheets continuing to strengthen
(paragraph 17).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Near-term outlook. With the drop off of mining investment, growth will likely remain soft
in the near term. Growth this year is projected at 2½ percent, rising to its trend rate of about
3 percent by 2016/17. While resource exports will increase, the outlook for the non-resource sector
is more uncertain. An accommodative monetary stance could support housing investment, but the
soft labor market, excess capacity in the non-mining sector holding back investment plans, and a
strong Australian dollar could continue to act as headwinds to overall growth. The near-term risks
relative to this baseline scenario are broadly balanced. On the downside the transition to broaderbased growth could prove more difficult than currently expected, particularly if the exchange rate
were to remain stronger than implied by fundamentals. On the other hand recent indicators suggest
that business conditions are beginning to improve and the revival in the housing market could
contribute to improved consumer confidence and growth.
8.
Housing sector risks. After several years where

debt, there is a risk that rapid house price growth could give rise to expectations-driven, selfreinforcing demand dynamics and price overshooting. In this context there have been some signs
that banks have responded to increased demand pressures by increasing mortgage lending to the
investor segment of the market (paragraph 20). A sudden house price decline—triggered perhaps
by a shock to household incomes or borrowing costs—could reduce consumer confidence and
impact overall economic activity. The authorities would need to be prepared to take preventative
actions if household credit growth, transactions volume, and prices accelerate.
9.
External risks. Australia’s growth prospects remain exposed to external developments
(Annex 1). In particular:


A sharp slowdown in growth in China over the medium term and a related sustained decline in
commodity prices. Over half of Australia’s exports go to emerging Asia and nearly two thirds are
non-rural commodity exports. With the volume of these exports increasing sharply in future
years, Australia’s economic outlook will be closely tied to developments in this region. Increases
in global supply of Australian export commodities coming on stream are expected to bring
about a steady decline in their prices—these projections are built into our baseline scenarios—
but a sustained steep decline could have significant implications for Australia’s growth prospects
(paragraph 27).



Surges in global financial market volatility related to the exit from unconventional monetary
policy. An orderly tightening would likely have a positive impact by weakening the exchange rate
and supporting the adjustment of the Australian economy. However, a bumpy exit from
unconventional monetary policies and renewed international financial market volatility would
likely raise the cost of Australian banks’ wholesale borrowing.

The external and domestic risks are closely interlinked. A hard landing in China could reduce
demand for Australia’s mineral exports, worsen the terms of trade, reduce household income and
trigger a fall in house prices. These interlinked risks could amplify any given shock as collateral
effects further weaken consumer demand and growth, and could in turn lead to a market
reassessment of Australia’s growth prospects, and negatively affecting banks’ balance sheets.2

2

The challenge in assessing the impact of an adverse scenario is that it is unlikely that a single risk identified would
occur in isolation. Modeling tools aimed at identifying the impact of isolated shocks are not well suited for multiple
simultaneous shocks. Bearing in mind these caveats, previous IMF work suggests that a one percent slowdown in
China’s investment growth could lower growth in Australia by 0.2 percent (Ahuja and Nabar, IMF Working Paper
12/267). The recent work by Vitek (IMF Working Paper 13/253) estimates that the comovement of output gaps
between China and Australia could be relatively weak. But these results are highly uncertain, and the effects on
output would likely be bigger for joint shocks and given non-linearities. Rather than focusing on general equilibrium
quantitative models, the Treasury estimates the sensitivity of their growth projections directly to terms of trade
shocks (paragraph 27). Also, emphasizing forecasting challenges, a recent Treasury working paper looking at
estimates of uncertainty around budget forecasts concludes that with a 70 percent confidence interval real GDP
growth in 2013-14 is expected to range from 1½ to 3¼ percent.

10.
Policy space to manage risks. The floating exchange rate provides a key cushion against
such shocks. The RBA has some room to respond, and the rapid and effective monetary transmission
mechanism in Australia would allow for a nimble policy response should these risks emerge. But
with the policy rate currently low at 2½ percent, the scope for monetary policy to offset shocks is
limited and a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook would call for additional policy responses.
As discussed below, Australia’s modest public debt level gives the authorities the scope to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate in full and to temper the pace of budget deficit reduction when
needed.
11.
Potential Outward Spillovers. With Australia as its most important trade and financial
partner, New Zealand is vulnerable to a sharp slowdown in Australia’s economic prospects.3 Beyond
the trade linkages, Australian bank subsidiaries constitute 90 percent of New Zealand’s banking
system (Figure 11). As subsidiaries rather than branches, however, New Zealand banks are financially
ring-fenced, do not rely on their parents for funding, and are well-capitalized with substantial
liquidity buffers, although they would likely suffer indirect reputational effects from financial stress
in the parent which could affect their access to funding from global wholesale markets.4 Statutory
obligations underpin cross-border cooperation between the two countries, improving regulatory
and supervisory oversight.
12.
Authorities’ views. Recognizing the risks to the domestic economy, the authorities have
recently revised down near-term growth projections (currently in line with staff’s). They argued that
the sustained reduction in policy rates should continue to support growth in interest-rate sensitive
sectors—indeed, recent house price developments had been a not unexpected consequence of this
policy, and are providing a boost to housing investment which has been structurally weak for some
time. They noted that there has been some increase in mortgage lending, although overall
household leverage has not picked up, suggesting that the housing sector has not yet become a
near-term risk. Nonetheless they are closely monitoring the situation and believe they have the tools
for a targeted and proportionate response to any emerging risks (paragraphs 21 and 22). The
strength of the Australian dollar will be a key factor for growth prospects, and in this regard an early
exit from unconventional monetary policies abroad is likely to contribute to a lower value for the
Australian dollar, which would help facilitate an adjustment to broader-based growth. On the other
hand, Australian assets’ relatively high credit ratings make them attractive to foreign investors, and
there is a risk that shifts in portfolio preferences could result in capital inflows and put upward
pressure on the Australian dollar. The authorities continue to regard a slowdown in China over the
3

There are also close trade and financial linkages with the Pacific Islands (see Global and Regional Spillovers to
Pacific Island Countries Sheridan, Niamh ; Tumbarello, Patrizia ; Wu, Yiqun, IMF Working Paper 12/154, June 01, 2012)
and these economies would also be affected by developments in Australia.
4

Analysis shows that New Zealand’s banking sector would be resilient in the face of a severe economic shock. A
recent stress test conducted jointly by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and APRA included a 40 percent fall in the
world price of New Zealand’s commodity exports, a six-month freeze on wholesale debt markets, a cumulative
output loss of 4 percent, a rise in unemployment to 11½ percent, and a fall in house, farm and commercial property
prices of 30 percent. The test indicated that banks would still comply with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio in place at
the time of 4 percent (see New Zealand Article IV Consultation 2013, Country Report No. 13/177, Annex 1).

medium term and a related fall in commodity prices as the main external risk to the Australian
economy. They emphasized the role the floating exchange rate provides as a cushion against such
shocks.

POLICIES TO SUSTAIN GROWTH
13.
Monetary policy. Staff views the RBA’s monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate.
Inflation is within the target range and inflation expectations remain well anchored. With growth
currently on the soft side, the real exchange rate still strong, and efforts to reduce the budget deficit
likely, monetary policy should remain accommodative and act as the primary macroeconomic tool
for managing aggregate demand in the near term.
14.
Fiscal policy. Australia's fiscal position compares well to its advanced economy peers,
although debt has increased in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (Annex 5). The
government considers it a priority to return the budget to surplus to preserve its favorable standing
with external creditors against the background of relatively high overall net foreign debt
(paragraph 23). To this end, the government has announced the broad aim of returning the budget
to a sustained surplus, building to a 1 percent of GDP surplus by 2023/24. A more detailed
framework will be established when the government announces its fiscal strategy in May. The
government has also pledged to scrap the carbon tax and the mineral resource rent tax which will
reduce revenue by about ¼ percentage point of GDP compared to total budget revenues from the
mining sector of around 2 percent of GDP. Staff supported the broad aim of improving the budget
position over the medium term, which would help rebuild fiscal buffers and increase the policy
scope to deal with adverse shocks, but cautioned that it should be done in a way that does not
disrupt growth prospects in the near term.
15.
Consistency of the fiscal projections. Achieving and sustaining a surplus over the next
decade will be challenging in light of current social spending commitments. Staff’s analysis shows
that achieving a surplus would require either an increase in revenue or sizeable cuts in projected
spending (Box 1). Early decisions on policy changes required to ensure the medium-term
consistency of fiscal policy goals would help to preserve policy flexibility.
16.
Authorities’ views. While recognizing relatively weak near-term growth prospects, the
authorities expected private demand outside the mining sector to increase at a faster pace, though
they pointed to the considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The RBA had not ruled out
further interest rate cuts, but emphasized that the effects of the reduction in policy rates already
made are still being felt. They also noted that foreign exchange intervention remained part of the
policy toolkit, although more recently used only at times of market dysfunction. The government is
expected to soon articulate its fiscal strategy in more details. To achieve the aim of returning to and
maintaining a budget surplus, sizeable cuts in projected spending would be required. Important for
this would be the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit’s Review of the efficiency
and effectiveness of expenditure and of spending pressures over the medium term.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

Box 1. Medium-Term Fiscal Consistency
The Government has committed to delivering a surplus of 1 percent within the next decade.
Achieving this looks difficult on current spending plans without a large increase in budget revenue
or a cut in spending or a combination of both.
Identifying spending pressures
Long run spending projections are discussed in the latest 2010 Intergenerational Report (published
every 5 years by the Treasury). Around 40 percent of government spending is directed to health,
age-related pensions and aged care, disability, and education (here referred to as “social spending”).
Spending on these areas is projected to increase significantly over the Report’s 40-year horizon.
Rising health costs account for around two-thirds of the overall increase. Some policy and legal
changes—in education and the second round of private health insurance in particular—have been
made since the Report was published which affect the composition of spending pressures, although
the outlook remains broadly the same.
To assess the consistency of the government’s fiscal targets over the next decade, we do a simple
exercise of applying the Intergenerational Report’s expenditure growth models and projections for
social spending to see how this might affect overall spending. Specifically, health and disability
spending are expected to increase over the next decade by ½ percent of GDP each, and education,
assistance to the aged and pensions by 0.2 percent each.
These spending trends imply that if other “non-social” spending were to be held at its current level
as a share of GDP, overall expenditure would reach 26½ percent in ten years. If tax revenue is held
at its average level over the last decade, the resulting budget deficit in 2023/24 would reach
2 percent of GDP. Reaching the government’s budget surplus target would thus require cutting
spending by around 3 percent of GDP, either by reducing net non-social spending or by putting in
place policy measures to contain increases in social spending (figure).

The National Commission of Audit
The government recently established the Commission as an independent mechanism to review and
report on the performance, functions and roles of the Commonwealth government. Among the
main objectives are to identify areas of unnecessary duplication between the activities of the
Commonwealth and other levels of government, to identify areas or programs where
Commonwealth involvement is inappropriate, no longer needed, or blur lines of accountability, and
to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness with which government services and policy advice
are delivered.
The Commission will report to the Prime Minister, Treasurer, and the Minister for Finance with both
phases of the audit due by the end of March 2014. The recommendations are expected to inform
the decisions presented in next budget. The established priorities are meant to allow savings
conducive to improving the medium-term fiscal position.

increase in the deposit base related to the recent jump in the household savings rate. Banks’
external liabilities remain fully hedged to exchange rate and maturity risk.

FSAP findings. The IMF’s 2012 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) found
Australia’s financial system to be sound and well managed. Stress test scenarios suggest the
financial system is resilient to a range of solvency shocks, although a severe shock would make
major inroads into these banks’ capital buffers requiring recapitalization efforts, and central bank
support would be needed in the event of a liquidity shock. 5 Recognizing this latter risk, APRA will be
introducing Basel III liquidity standards in 2015 ahead of the Basel committee’s deadline. Progress is
being made on many of the recommendations of the FSAP to further bolster financial system
stability, including higher loss absorbency for systemically important banks, stress testing, and
intensifying the supervision of liquidity (see Text Table, page 18). The government announced that
there would be a wide-ranging Financial Sector Inquiry which is aimed at fostering an efficient,
competitive and flexible financial system. It will report in November 2014 and is likely to cover some
aspects of the FSAP recommendations
19.
Key macro-financial risks. The four major banks are systemic with broadly similar business
models and, though reduced, reliance on wholesale funding is still high and continues to pose some
rollover risks. Residential mortgages account for a large part of banks’ assets, a sector that is
vulnerable to price fluctuations and household leverage is still high. These are longstanding
structural issues that will remain sources of risk over the medium term. In a tail event of a sharp
5

The FSAP stress scenario assumed a severe recession accompanied by a decline in house prices of 35 percent, a
decline in commercial property prices of 40 percent, and a decline in equity prices of up to 47 percent. Cuts in
interest rates to a floor of 1 percent help to mitigate the effects on activity.

increase in global financial market volatility, banks’ wholesale funding costs would rise and would
likely be passed on to corporate and households. While monetary policy could still respond, its
scope would be reduced. In these circumstances fiscal policy may need to provide support. Given
Australia’s modest public debt, there is space to respond to a significant shock (see annex 5).
20.
Mortgage market developments.
Household credit growth has remained moderate,
rising broadly in line with incomes, with the recent
pick up in lending concentrated in investor loans
(Annex 2, paragraph 7). The increasing popularity of
property investment among self-managed
superannuation funds, although still a small
segment of the mortgage market, has further
stimulated demand for investor loans which, for tax
purposes, are typically interest-only loans. This
helps to explain why the proportion of mortgage
approvals that are interest-only increased by
about 2½ percentage points over the past year to
nearly 40 percent. Loans to investors are around
a third of total housing mortgages, and the
proportion of high loan-to-value mortgage
approvals is also around one third. Overall,
households are currently using the low interest
environment to pay down principal and build up
substantial mortgage buffers. Nonetheless, APRA
and RBA recently cautioned banks about need to
maintain tight lending standards.

Regulatory and supervisory framework. The authorities’ framework seeks to address these
financial sector vulnerabilities (Annex 2, paragraphs 11 and 12). Conservative risk weights give
Australian banks higher quality capital than most of their advanced country peers. In addition there
are features of the Australian regulatory, supervisory, and legal approach to property lending that
differ from other advanced economies which would help to limit the impact of a sharp decline in
house prices on the financial system. Higher household savings rates and an increase in principal
prepayments have allowed households to build large mortgage buffers (text figure). The full
recourse nature of lending provides an incentive for continued repayment and lending standards are
tightly enforced with a strong regulatory focus on the borrowers’ ability to service their loans. A
banking system dominated by only four banks and close cooperation between the RBA and APRA
enables swift communication and enhances the effectiveness of prudential tools should risks
emerge. Overall, Australia’s regulatory and supervisory framework is likely to have contributed to the
low level of non-performing mortgage loans sustained over the past decade.

22.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that should an acceleration in housing price
inflation become a risk, their intensive supervisory approach gives them the tools to respond in a
more targeted and less distortionary manner than through a more formal macroprudential policy
framework. In particular, APRA's supervision involves continuous monitoring and oversight of
regulated entities' behavior to ensure that they comply with prudential standards, are in a sound
financial condition, and maintain effective governance and risk management systems. APRA follows
a proactive and risk-based approach under which regulated entities that pose greater risks receive
more intensive supervision. APRA generally prefers to adopt a suasion approach when it identifies
weaknesses in lending standards, with communication with management and boards central to the
approach. However, APRA can and does also impose prudential capital requirements beyond the
minimum requirements of the Basel framework for individual authorized deposit taking institutions
with higher risk profiles. The authorities also pointed to a wide range of legal powers that enable
direct action where there are threats to financial stability. Coordination between authorities is
conducted through the Council of Financial Regulators which includes the Treasury and the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) as well as APRA and the RBA. The
authorities highlighted this framework’s success in helping cool the housing market following the
large run up in house prices in the early 2000s (Annex 2, paragraph 10).

ASSESSING EXTERNAL STABILITY
23.
Current Account and external debt. Australia has run current account deficits for most of
its history, with deficits averaging around 4 percent of GDP in the last three decades. This has
reflected a structural saving-investment imbalance with very high private investment relative to a
saving rate which is already high by advanced country standards, resulting in net external liabilities
of around 55 percent of GDP (Annex 3). Looking forward, as imports related to mining investment
decline and mining export capacity comes on stream, the trade balance should turn to surplus, offset
by a widening income account deficit as global interest rates normalize and mining income accruing
to foreign investors’ increases. On net the current account deficit is currently expected to remain
below 4 percent of GDP over the medium term, stabilizing Australia’s net foreign liability position as
a share of GDP. The stock of external debt has become more stable over the past several years—the
decline in short-term offshore borrowing by banks and increased foreign holdings of long-term
public debt have lengthened the maturity profile, and a major portion of resources sector
investment has taken the form of less volatile foreign direct investment.
24.
Exchange rate. Despite some recent depreciation the real exchange rate, currently in the
range of 89 cents to the U.S. dollar, is 5-10 percent above the level predicted by Australia-specific
factors from a medium-term perspective (Box 2). There are a number of factors contributing to the
current high level of the Australian dollar, including the substantial capital inflows to fund the
mining sector investment, the gap between domestic and foreign interest rates, and portfolio
allocation towards Australian dollar assets by foreign institutional investors. If these factors were to
ease, possibly triggered by exit from unconventional monetary policies by major advanced
economies, the exchange rate would likely depreciate further, supporting the transition of the
economy towards more balanced growth. Budget deficit reduction should help take pressure off the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

dollar over the medium term by boosting national savings, and additional steps to encourage
private saving such as the planned increase in the superannuation contribution rate will also help.
Box 2. External Sector Assessment
Despite the recent depreciation the real effective exchange rate remains elevated and is still around
20 percent above the long run average since 1983. The current account deficit narrowed somewhat
in 2013 as mining investment has begun to decline from the record levels reached this past year.
Model-based approaches in the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA)1 suggest that Australia’s
real exchange rate at the end of 2013 appears overvalued by 5-10 percent and the current account
looks around ½ to 1½ percent of GDP weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies domestically and globally, although the current account gap can be partly
attributed to the mining investment boom. These estimates are, however, subject to considerable
uncertainty. Cross-country panel regressions indicate that terms of trade gains and Australia’s
positive interest rate differentials vis-à-vis other advanced countries have contributed to the high
levels of the dollar in recent years. That part of the overvaluation not captured by the fundamental
factors may be related to short-term factors including strong portfolio inflows, especially to the
official government debt market since 2009.
Household's Net Saving Rate
Staff’s assessment is also sensitive to

growth in household net worth, driven by
higher equity and housing prices. In this regard much will depend on whether the post-crisis
increase in household savings represents a structural break from past behavior. If the household
saving ratio were to fall closer to pre-crisis levels, the current account deficit would widen which
would imply a larger overvaluation of the exchange rate.

25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the current account deficit is likely to be
lower in the period ahead than in the past decade, as the investment phase of the mining boom
comes to an end and mining sector export volumes increase, though this outlook is subject to a
degree of uncertainty. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to a freely-floating

exchange rate, emphasizing the role it has played in maintaining macroeconomic stability and
containing external vulnerabilities—in contrast to past mining booms, the floating exchange rate has
helped the economy to absorb a sharp increase in terms of trade without leading to an overheating
domestic economy and a spike in inflation. Like staff, they expressed some surprise during
consultations that the exchange rate had remained high despite the decline in the terms of trade,
although it has depreciated more recently. Going forward, a lower level of the exchange rate would
help balance growth in the economy. They noted that despite the level of net foreign liabilities, the
economy as a whole has a net foreign currency asset position, and so a nominal exchange rate
depreciation would strengthen Australia’s overall balance sheet.

ROLE OF THE MINING SECTOR AND SHIFT TO
BROADER-BASED GROWTH
26.
Resource investment boom and export prospects. Australia’s terms of trade
strengthened to an historic high in 2011 driven by record high global prices for key Australian
exports such as coal and iron ore, reflecting strong demand for steel in China (Annex 4). In response
mining investment has risen from about 2 percent of GDP in 2002 to more than 8 percent of GDP
expected last year. Investments in coal and iron ore drove the early pick up but more recently
liquefied natural gas projects (LNG) have increased to meet rising global demand for energy. This
year’s peak in investment will be followed by a sharp rise in mining export volumes as investment
projects bear fruit—volumes of non-rural commodity exports including coal, iron ore and LNG are
projected to grow by more than 30 percent in the next five years. As a result, total mining
production’s share in the economy, currently about 10 percent of GDP, could rise by several
percentage points over the next several years. Available resource deposits are large and are likely to
remain for decades with an increased role of mining as a structural feature of the economy going
forward.
27.
Sensitivity to terms of trade shocks. The increased resources exports will make the
economy more sensitive to terms of trade shocks. However, several factors should help mitigate the
direct effects of a decline in the terms of trade. Export volumes for most mining sector projects are
relatively inelastic to modest declines in prices, given their competitively low marginal production
cost. The floating exchange rate can help buffer shocks by depreciating when the terms of trade fall,
making other tradable goods and services more competitive. Since the mining companies have
globally distributed shareholdings, the effect on profits will be spread between Australia and abroad.
The indirect effects however could be large. The impact of a faster-than-anticipated decline in the
terms of trade on nominal output would affect budget revenue more broadly. Income for sectors
servicing the mining sector would also be reduced. The impact on domestic and foreign confidence,
although difficult to predict, could be significant—consumer confidence would likely be affected and
falling profit margins in the economy’s most dynamic sector could lead financial markets to reassess
more generally Australia’s prospects and increase the country’s borrowing costs. The Treasury’s
sensitivity analysis suggests that absent a depreciation, a permanent fall in terms of trade around

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

AUSTRALIA

4 percent would cause a fall in nominal GDP of ¾ to 1 percent and decrease the underlying budget
cash balance by around ¼ percent.
28.
Long-run growth. Robust income growth over the past decade has been supported in large
part by the unprecedented increase in the terms of trade, which as it unwinds, is likely to detract
from income growth going forward. This implies that a significant pickup in labor productivity will be
needed to maintain growth in living standards over the coming decade (Annex 4, Box). While
productivity in the mining sector should improve as the investments begin yielding results, this will
not be enough to maintain current levels of per capita growth, and productivity growth in other
sectors will also need to rise. Since Australia has already benefited from sizeable productivity
improvements following substantial structural reforms in the 1990s, finding further scope for
improvement will not be easy. A shift to broader-based growth would be helped by making the
most of the opportunities offered by a growing Asian middle class, which could support demand for
Australia’s services exports—in particular health, education, tourism and professional services.
29.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the greater role of mining in the economy
had increased Australia’s exposure to terms of trade fluctuations. Australia’s terms of trade have
declined by almost 20 percent from their historic peak in 2011, and are expected to decline further
over the coming years as global mining capacity increases. For this reason, the government’s
medium-term budget revenue projections are based on a significant decline in the terms of trade.
They emphasized that despite increased mining exports, the sector will still play a smaller role in
Australia’s economy than the service sector, particularly with respect to employment. Finding ways
of improving multifactor productivity is regarded as essential for maintaining growth in living
standards going forward, and they agreed that this will be challenging. Addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks is a key priority, and enhancing the framework for the selection and prioritization of
infrastructure projects based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis, and including more involvement by
the private sector, would help allow for spending on infrastructure consistent with the government’s
deficit reduction goals.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Outlook. The Australian economy has reached a transition phase as the
terms-of-trade-driven mining investment boom of the past decade has peaked and the economy is
moving to the mining production and export phase. Mining-related investment is expected to drop
sharply in the near term and a recovery in non-mining investment will be needed to underpin
demand and return the economy’s growth rate to trend.
31.
Risks. The recent revival in housing market activity is welcome as it could contribute to nearterm growth and begin to help address persistent structural supply shortages, but the authorities
will need to be prepared to take actions should credit growth and transactions volume pick up
sharply to prevent an unsustainable acceleration in house price inflation. The main external risks
include a sharp slowdown in growth in China over the medium term and the risk of a surge in global

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

financial market volatility. The authorities have both monetary and fiscal policy space to react if the
outlook deteriorates.
32.
Monetary policy. Monetary policy should remain accommodative—inflation is within the
target range, growth is currently on the soft side, and the real exchange rate is still strong. Monetary
policy should act as the primary macroeconomic tool for managing aggregate demand in the near
term.
33.
Fiscal policy. The government’s aim to return the budget to surplus in the coming years will
help rebuild fiscal buffers and increase the policy scope to deal with adverse shocks, but will be
challenging in light of current social spending commitments. Cuts in projected spending and/or
increased revenues are likely to be needed, and early decisions on policy changes required would
help preserve policy flexibility.
34.
Financial sector. The banking sector is sound, balance sheets have strengthened over the
past year, and stress tests show the major banks would be able to withstand a sizeable shock to
output, terms of trade, rising unemployment, and a fall in property prices. The banks remain
exposed however to highly leveraged households and rollover risks associated with short-term
offshore funding needs. The authorities’ intensive supervisory framework should allow for a targeted
response if house price inflation becomes a risk, and there are features of the Australian regulatory
and supervisory approach to property lending which would limit the impact of a sharp decline in
house prices on the financial system.
35.
External stability. Increasing mining exports should improve the trade balance, and the
current account deficit should settle at a level that stabilizes Australia’s net foreign liabilities.
Prospects for both near-term growth and external sustainability will depend on whether the
exchange rate, which currently looks moderately overvalued, moves consistently with Australia’s
fundamentals going forward. In this regard monetary policy tightening by major advanced
economies would help weaken the dollar and support the transition toward more balanced growth.
36.
Medium-term growth prospects. The increased role of the mining sector will make the
economy more sensitive to terms of trade shocks. The floating exchange rate will play an essential
role in buffering shocks by depreciating when terms of trade fall, making other tradable goods and
services more competitive. The key challenge going forward will be finding ways of increasing
productivity to maintain growth in Australia’s living standards. Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks
in a manner consistent with the government’s deficit reduction goals is a priority.
37.
It is recommended that the next article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Develop a top down stress testing
framework and publish top down stress
test results in the Financial Stability
Review (RBA)

On track. The RBA is developing a top down stress testing
framework for banks, to complement APRA’s stress tests. Practices
at other central banks have been assessed and the RBA is consulting
stakeholders. Intended implementation 2014.

2

Devote more resources to stress testing
(APRA)

Implemented. APRA has increased resources for stress testing and is
implementing an internal stress testing strategy.

3

Introduce higher loss absorbency (HLA)
for systemic banks (APRA)

On track. APRA released and information paper setting out its
framework for identifying and imposing higher loss absorbency on
domestic systemically important banks. The framework will come
into effect from January 1, 2016.

Financial Sector Oversight
4

Intensify on-site supervision of bank
liquidity and upgrade daily liquidity
reporting requirements to ensure
consistency (APRA)

On track. Liquidity themed reviews have increased in frequency and
number. APRA will adopt Basel III liquidity standards, including
standardized emergency daily reporting capacity.

5

Improve the effectiveness of conduct of
business supervision for insurance
companies (note recommendation 6
below) (ASIC)

Further consideration required. This recommendation is being
considered in light of other work that may be undertaken in relation
to ASIC’s supervision of financial services licensees more broadly.

6

Ensure sufficiency and stability of ASIC
core funding (Treasury)

Further consideration required. Discussions are ongoing and will
take into account broader discussions on funding and wider policy
questions about the level of proactive supervision required.

7

Extend risk based capital requirements,
large exposure rules, and reporting
requirements to ensure that AFSL holders
are appropriately covered (ASIC)

Partially implemented. ASIC has introduced increased risk based
capital adequacy requirements and periodic reporting for additional
classes of licensees e.g. custodians. ASIC is gauging the extent to
which there are significant potential risks from large exposures.

Crisis Management
8

Re-evaluate the merits of ex-ante funding
for the FCS with a view to converting it to
an ex-ante funded scheme (Treasury/CFR)

On track. In August 2013 the previous Government committed to
establishing a dedicated Financial Stability Fund, from January 2016.
Implementation will be subject to the outcomes of the Financial
System Inquiry.

9

Introduce HLA for systemic banks (APRA)

See recommendation 3 above.

10

Ensure ADI implementation of single
customer view (SCV) on, or where
possible, ahead of the agreed timetable
(APRA)

On track. Under the Prudential Standard banks were required to
have implemented the SCV by January 1, 2014. A number of banks
have received an extension to this deadline due to the complexity
and size of the IT system changes.

11

Conduct frequent and focused crisis
simulations and other forms of resolution
testing (APRA/CFR)

On track. APRA is reviewing its internal framework for crisis
simulations to include more frequent simulations of various scopes.
The CFR Crisis Management Working Group is also reviewing the
framework for cross-agency and Trans-Tasman simulations.

12

Continue recovery planning and introduce
resolution planning (APRA)

On track. APRA has conducted a pilot recovery plan project for ADIs
and is considering developing a formal framework for recovery
planning. APRA is developing its strategies for resolution planning.

Annex 1. Risk Assessment Matrix
Nature/ Source of Risk
Potential Domestic Shocks
Medium term
Sharp fall in house and/or
commercial real estate prices.

Likelihood/
Direction

Expected Impact on the Economy and Policy Response

Low

Medium
The pickup in housing market activity could contribute to growth
and help boost housing supply. However if prices accelerate
together with leverage and transactions this could lead to
overshooting. But a collapse of house prices is not an imminent
risk. A construction boom has not accompanied the run-up in
house prices and housing supply appears tight in a number of
areas. An average LTV ratio of 50 percent provides a buffer
against a large fall in house prices, though it would dent wealth
and consumption. Households have prepayments equivalent to
around twenty-three months of mortgage payments.
Commercial real estate prices have adjusted sharply since 2008
and NPLs have passed their peak.

Potential External Shocks
High
Surges in global financial market
volatility related to the exit from
unconventional monetary policy.

Medium
Volatility in wholesale and external
funding.

Sharp slowdown in China over the
medium term.

Medium

Low

Medium
Australia was little affected by the bout of volatility following the
Fed’s tapering announcements. Orderly tapering would likely be
beneficial for the economy and may help bring about an
exchange rate depreciation. Disorderly tapering may lead to
some overshooting but would be manageable. If financial market
disruption is prolonged and affects growth in key emerging Asia
or European markets, that could prompt rises in long term bond
yields adding to debt service costs.
Low
Banks’ reliance on wholesale and external funding has fallen back
a little but remains high. Foreign liability positions are largely
hedged and explicit liquidity support from the RBA means that a
reversal in capital flows is unlikely to result in forced asset sales.
Nevertheless volatility in funding markets could raise banks’
funding costs which may be passed on to households and
corporates.
High
Over a half of Australia’s exports go to China and emerging Asia,
leaving growth prospects vulnerable to their economic outlook.

High
The free floating exchange rate would help buffer the impact on
the economy, but as iron ore exports form a substantial part of
Australia’s exports a sustained decline would have an adverse
effect.
Policy responses to shocks: For downside shocks there is room for easier monetary policy and for full operation of
automatic stabilizers. In the event of a severe shock the authorities could react as they did at the onset of the global
financial crisis including considering a government guarantee if banks lose access to wholesale funding.

Sustained decline in commodity
prices.

Annex 2. Australia: Housing Market1
Long term developments in the Australian housing market
1.
Reflecting structural factors both shared with many other countries and unique to
Australia, real house prices have roughly doubled since 1990 (Figure 1). After growing broadly in
line with real GDP per capita from 1960-90, real house price inflation picked up in the 2000s and
exceeded income growth for much of the period up to the global financial crisis (Figure 2). As a
result, the median house price to income ratio rose sharply from around 3 at the beginning of the
2000s (when based on the authorities’ preferred measure for all dwellings) peaking at just over 4 in
2009 (Figure 3). Since then the price/income ratio has eased back and international comparisons
suggest that while Australia’s is on the high side it is not out of line with peers (Figure 4). Rising
house prices were also accompanied by increased household borrowing with the debt to income
ratio rising from among the lowest at 46 percent in 1990 to around 150 per cent in 2013.

Commercial property prices have also risen strongly over the past two decades. While
banks’ exposures to the commercial property sector are substantially smaller than residential real
estate (10 percent of the loan book), the commercial real estate sector has accounted for a
disproportionate share of non-performing loans. This reflects the fact that the construction lags are
longer than for other sectors and loans do not have the same disincentives to default as a
residential mortgage.2 Impaired loans peaked in 2010 at 6 percent of commercial real estate
exposures but have fallen back to 2 percent since then.
3.
A number of fundamental factors have contributed to the long term increase in
Australian house prices. Importantly, as in other economies, financial liberalization in the 1980s
and 1990s, lower inflation and lower interest rates facilitated easier access to credit, increased the
serviceability of higher levels of household debt and enabled the use of housing as collateral.
Households’ borrowing capacity increased and they moved to a higher steady state level of
indebtedness and higher house prices relative to incomes.3
4.
Since the early 2000s, the favorable terms of trade and demand linked to mining
investment resulted in regional housing booms in Perth and Western Australia more broadly.
This is a similar pattern to that observed in other commodity exporting economies such as Canada.
More generally, higher wealth, income expectations and demographics underpinned demand for
housing.
5.
Supply side constraints have also been a major factor. Australia’s population has grown
rapidly, particularly since 2004, boosted partly by
Figure 5. International Comparison: Population
immigration, but housing supply has not kept pace.
Growth and Housing Investment
Housing completions are currently averaging 150,000
a year, similar to the early 1990s when the population
was one quarter smaller. Given rapid population
growth, housing investment over the last decade has
been relatively moderate compared to other OECD
economies (Figure 5). Declining household size
relative to the 1990s has also contributed to higher
price levels. Also, while Australia is heavily urbanized
compared with other developed economies,
Australians have a preference for low density housing
(Figure 6 and 7). Sydney is only 40 percent as dense
as Toronto, Melbourne half as dense and, out of 276

Recent Trends
6.
Since the global financial crisis, house prices have lagged incomes and prices have
undergone two corrections with prices falling in 2008 and 2011/12. But this does not appear to
have led to undue distress with residential mortgage non performing loans below 1 percent.
7.
Recently, interest rate cuts have begun to feed through to the housing market.
Housing approvals have picked up and house prices are

percent of SMSF assets and three quarters of this is in

many households continue to pay down debt. The higher household savings ratio of recent years
also suggests a more prudent pattern of household consumption than in the mid 2000s.

New South Wales, South Australia, western Australia and Queensland. There are some tentative

signs that a trend to higher density housing may have started with part of the increase in approvals
since 2012 due to approvals for higher density housing.
Risks and Mitigating Factors
9.
There are two distinct risks from house prices that the economy could face. First, house
prices could gather momentum and risk overshooting. Second, some volatility across regional
housing markets is to be expected with the end of the mining investment boom. Regional housing
markets have already experienced different patterns of activity and the 2009-2012 experience
suggests that a correction in nominal house prices can be tolerated. But a protracted and bumpy
adjustment process with shocks to unemployment could leave some borrowers stretched.
10.
The authorities have some past experience in moderating a housing boom. The large
run up in house prices in the early 2000s followed a period of robust consumption growth and the
introduction of more favorable tax treatment for investors, and this was accompanied by rapid credit
growth concentrated in investor loans. But this period was not followed by falling house prices, even
in real terms—instead house prices leveled off after 2003. Housing market developments were a
contributing factor to the RBA’s 2003 increase in interest rates. In 2002/3 the RBA commented that
the high rates of house price inflation and credit growth were not sustainable and that borrowers
entering the market would be taking on significant risks. 5 APRA called for a more conservative
approach to lending practices by banks in late 2002 and sought more information on the extent and
nature of exposures. Increased communication about the risks by APRA and the RBA, stricter
enforcement of tax claims for rental properties, plus the timing of interest rate hikes appear in
retrospect to have helped deliver a cooling of the housing market without a sharp decline in prices.
11.
Some features of the Australian supervisory and regulatory approach to property
lending could help limit the effect of falling house prices on the financial sector. Most
mortgage lending is by institutions that are prudentially regulated by a single regulator (APRA)
which may enable vulnerabilities to be detected at an early stage. Intensive supervision allows a
targeted approach to help identify and rein in riskier behavior by institutions—either via
communications with the board and management or by imposing capital requirements and taking
enforcement action.
12.
The authorities have powers to use a number of prudential tools. Lending standards are
tightly enforced with a strong regulatory focus on debt serviceability as well as the quality of
collateral. Loans are full recourse, giving borrowers an incentive to continue payments even under
stress. There is little securitization and few low documentation loans, Australia applies a tighter
setting of prudential rules on housing loans than is required under the Basel framework and

institutions’ capital positions are strong.6 APRA has the powers to implement a range of prudential
measures—similar to those adopted or under consideration by other economies (see Box)—should
they be needed; this could include requiring banks to increase interest sensitivity buffers.
Box: Comparison of Prudential Policies Adopted by Selected Economies
A number of countries have recently adopted a variety of prudential tools to manage risks from rising
household indebtedness and house prices after a prolonged period of low interest rates. Some examples
are:

Canada. The Canadian system has extensive government backed mortgage insurance. Since 2008 the
mortgage insurance rules for high LTV loans have been tightened in variety of ways including by:
reducing the maximum amortization period; reducing the LTV ratio for new mortgages, non-owneroccupied properties and mortgage refinancing; reducing the maximum debt service ratio; and tightening
other requirements. A guideline for mortgage underwriting practices was issued in 2012 building on the
Financial Stability Board Principles for Sound Residential Mortgage Underwriting.
New Zealand. In May 2013 a Memorandum of Understanding was agreed by the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) and the Minister of Finance for macroprudential policy and operating guidelines. In
September 2013 the RBNZ introduced higher capital requirements, for high Loan to Value ratio (LTV)
housing loans. And, in October, they restricted the amount of high LTV lending (above 80 percent) that
banks can take to 10 percent of new mortgage lending. The aim is to introduce a speed limit rather than
a ban on high LTV lending. The restriction is seen as a temporary tool which will be removed when
imbalances in the housing market are viewed to have abated.
United Kingdom Using its new powers, in June 2013, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC)
recommended an assessment of the vulnerability of borrowers and financial institutions to higher interest
rates. In November 2013 further measures were implemented or in train. In addition to an earlier
announced increase in capital requirements, the authorities announced the removal incentives for
household lending via the Funding for Lending Scheme in 2014. New stress tests, including risks arising
from housing-related portfolios, will be used to assess capital adequacy. Stronger mortgage underwriting
standards will put in place, following the Mortgage Market Review.
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland are requiring banks to hold more capital against mortgage
exposures or have adopted early implementation of the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer. Hong
Kong has a debt service cap after a stress test of an applicants’ repayment ability for a 300 basis point
rise in interest rates. Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and some EU countries have restrictions on
maximum LTVs, debt service ratios, and/or mortgage terms.
Australia. Banks already hold more capital against higher risk mortgages. Banks typically obtain
mortgage insurance for loans to households who take out high LTV mortgages. A feature that
distinguishes Australia is that banks include an ‘interest rate buffer’ in their evaluations of loan
serviceability. APRA is able to impose restrictions on maximum LTVs but to date has taken the approach
of encouraging banks to improve their internal risk management processes in areas such as
collateralization and serviceability.

Lenders using the ‘standardized’ approach to capital adequacy are required to hold more capital against higher-risk
mortgages than the Basel framework requires. Banks using the ‘advanced’ approach must assume a minimum 20 per
cent LGD on mortgages in their risk models, compared to 10 per cent minimum in the Basel framework.

Households have significant mortgage buffers. Australia encourages the early repayment
of mortgages by not imposing penalties on households who pay down their mortgage. When
interest rates are cut borrowers often continue to their

Average leverage is low, assets provide
substantial cover and indebtedness is skewed to the top end of the income scale. The average
loan to value ratio is around 50 percent. Household non-financial and financial assets are
respectively around three times and twice bigger than household debt. Only a small number of
indebted households (around 4 percent) currently have debt which exceeds assets. Households in
the top two income deciles held around 70 percent of mortgage debt in 2010 and only 10 percent
of mortgage debt was held by households in the bottom two income deciles and these tended to be
older households with typically smaller mortgages and higher net asset holdings.

15.
Despite banks’ large mortgage portfolios, these features have contributed to the low
level of non performing mortgage loans over the past decade. Australian banks have similar
business models with residential mortgages accounting for over 50 percent of total lending which
makes the financial system exposed to housing market distress. Yet, despite price fluctuations, nonperforming housing loans have remained low compared to other countries over the last decade,
with the total less than 0.7 percent of total housing loans, with quarter of these considered impaired.
16.
Nevertheless, preventative action would be needed if household credit growth,
transactions volume, and prices accelerate. The recent increase in activity has been concentrated
in investor loans and a relatively high proportion of investor loans and owner occupier loans are
interest only. For Australia, interest only mortgages may pose less of a risk as even for interest only
loans mortgage prepayments remain high. The provisions of the National Consumer Credit Code
also require lenders to meet responsible lending standards.8 Nonetheless, information on the
repayment plans for these mortgages and their sensitivity to interest rate, income or asset shocks
could be helpful. APRA and RBA have also recently emphasized that investor returns on housing are
likely to be lower going forward than they were over the past decade and have noted the need for
caution.

A lender cannot provide a credit contract to a consumer that is unsuitable for them. Separately, Ellis notes the
lender must be able to show that the consumer can be expected to repay the loan from their own resources, without
having to sell the collateral. (Macroprudential Policy: A Suite of Tools or a State of Mind? Ellis, L October 11, 2012.).

Annex 3. External Sector Developments and Prospects1
The long view
1.
Australia’s current account has been in deficit for most of the period since 1861
reflecting a persistent structural saving-investment imbalance. Current account deficits have
averaged around 4 percent of GDP in the last three decades (Figure 1). Gross savings in Australia
have been comparable to those of other advanced economies, but its investment level has been
significantly higher than those of its peers (Figure 2).

Fueling these deficits in recent years are high levels of investment related to
Australia’s resources sector investment boom. 2 Investment spending in Australia’s resources
sector rose from just under 2 percent of GDP in 2002 to the peak of 8 percent of GDP achieved this
past year, offsetting declines in other private sector investment and driving a significant part of the
economic growth in this period (Figure 3). As around half of the value of the resources investment
projects is imported, this has also led to a

larger than would be predicted by the fundamental factors, as proxied by per capita income,
population growth, age dependency ratio, terms of trade, social insurance, the budget balance and
others (Figure 4). 3 As a cross-country panel regression using the same set of fundamental factors as
in the EBA did not suggest that private saving in Australia is lower than would be consistent with the
fundamentals (as in the case of New Zealand, Figure 5) and its public saving has been relatively high
among comparable countries, the unexplained current account deficit is likely to be attributed to the
high investment levels that are not captured by an observed set of medium-term fundamentals.
Similarly, investment-related capital inflows, together with terms of trade gains from high
commodity export prices, may account for the persistently strong Australian dollar in recent years.

The counterpart to the prolonged savings-investment imbalance has been a buildup in
net foreign liabilities, currently high relative to many other advanced countries. Net foreign
liabilities increased to around 55 percent of GDP in 2012 (Figure 6), with public debt held abroad,
private financial sector debt, and private nonfinancial corporate sector each accounting for about
one third of the total net external debt liabilities (Figure 7). The resources sector investment boom
since the early 2000s (estimated to have totaled $284 billion by 2012), however, did not cause sharp
increases in nonfinancial corporate sector’s net foreign debt. Around four-fifths of funding for
mining sector physical investment has been sourced from offshore, of which three-quarters was in
the form of foreign direct investment (FDI). Since 2007, a large portion of the FDI in the mining
sector has been supplied through the reinvested earnings of the resources companies (Arsov et al
2013).

Australia’s net foreign liabilities as a share of GDP could stabilize or decline as mining
investments bear fruit, with resources exports expected to grow strongly over the coming
years. This would represent a reversal of past sluggish export growth due to supply constraints on
resource exports and the appreciation of the exchange rate weighing on non-commodity exports
(Figure 8). According to the projections by the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics (BREE),
total resources sector export volumes will grow

increase by 50 percent in the next couple of years and to double in the medium term.
6.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario the current account deficit would remain a bit
below 4 percent of GDP over the medium term, and net foreign liabilities as a share of GDP are
projected to stabilize around 60 percent by 2018/19. The improvement in the trade balance is
projected to be partly offset by the widening income account deficit due to the nomalization of
global interest rates and the increased mining income accruing to foreign investors given the large
foreign ownership in Australia’s mining sector. This assessment is sensitive to projections of
household savings behavior as well as commodity prices. The private sector deleveraging process in
recent years may turn out deeper than expected and push up household and corporate savings if
the projected decline in terms of trade lasts longer or the economy’s transion towards broader
based growth gets bumpy.

Non-structural factors affecting the current exchange rate
7.
The Australian dollar has remained relatively high in recent years, even accounting for
the structural factors discussed above. Despite the depreciation since April last year, the real
effective exchange rate is still about 20 percent above the monthly average since 1983, and the
divergence between the real exchange rate and the terms of trade in the recent period is
inconsistent with the long run one-to-one relationship between the two series as shown in
Chowdhury (2012) (Figure 9). One approach as part of the IMF’s EBA which aims to account for
persistent structural factors (by including

currency strengthened somewhat in September-November, perhaps related to the Fed’s decision to
delay the QE tapering, but declined again in the last months of the year amid weak economic data
(Figure 12). As the Australian dollar is generally viewed by the market as a commodity currency and
a proxy for China’s growth, much of the strength of the dollar will depend on global commodity
prices and China’s growth prospects. Exit from unconventional monetary policies by major advanced
economies may lead to tighter global financial conditions and less portfolio inflows to Australia.

Annex 4. Managing the Transition from the Mining Investment Boom1
1.
Mining investment boom. Since the early 2000s, global commodity prices began a sharp
and sustained increase driven by the rapid industrialization and urbanization in emerging
economies, particularly China. In response, resources producers increased their investment as they
sought to boost output to meet the new sources

Imports. Australia’s mining investment
boom seems to have been associated with
significant increases in imports, similar to the
experiences in Norway during the oil boom in
the 1970s and in Chile during the copper boom
in the 1980s-1990s (Annex Figure 1). Australia’s
total merchandise imports as a share of GDP in
2003-2012 was 3 percentage points higher than
in the previous decade, driven by strong growth
in imports of capital goods as well as consumer
goods.

3.
Foreign ownership. Investment in Australia’s resources sector has relied heavily on foreign
funding. It is estimated around four-fifths of the physical investment has been sourced offshore, and
the share of foreign ownership in the mining industry is large (Arsov et al 2013). In comparison,
foreign companies’ investment in Canada’s energy sector is less than half of that of the domestic
companies (Figure 2), although the latter may also have some foreign shareholdings. In Norway and
Chile, resources sectors are dominated by public companies, which have allowed the public sector to
establish sovereign wealth funds to manage fiscal savings and use them as a tool to buffer against
commodity price shocks.

Near-term Challenges: Resources Reallocation
4.
The decline in mining investment and its impact on growth. Mining investment peaked
in 2013, and managing the transition from the investment boom to broader based growth is a key
near-term challenge. Mining capital expenditure, which accounted for more than half of the GDP
growth in the past two years, is projected to fall sharply in the coming years (Figure 3). A back-ofthe envelope calculation suggests the sector’s net contribution to growth will decline significantly
(Table 1). The offsetting factors include the

6.
Employment. The share of total employment accounted for by the resources sector
doubled from the mid 2000s, to around 9¾ percent in 2011/12. About one quarter of the overall
increase was in the workers employed in the resources extraction sector, while the remainder has
been due to an increase in employment in industries that service the operations of mines (Bishop et
al 2013). A recent Treasury working paper determines that mining sector output and employment
are relatively insensitive to Australian economic cycles and far more sensitive to world economic
cycles (Battersby et al 2013). In addition, as shown in Minifie (2013), the mining investment boom
has supported wage growth in less skilled occupations, which are heavily represented in mining and
construction. As the sector moves to the more capital intensive production and export phase, its
demand for labor is expected to fall. Skills mismatch could therefore become an impediment to a
smooth labor reallocation from mining to the other sectors.
7.
Effects across states. The mining investment boom has supported rapid growth in the
resource-rich states of Western Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. Strong wage growth
in these states also attracted international and interstate migration and “fly-in, fly-out” workers.
While the level of mining operations and investment is concentrated in the resources states, the
distribution of the mining receipts is more dispersed across the country, as evidenced by strong
wage growth in both mining and non-mining states (Minifie 2013). The particular channels include
the purchase of intermediate inputs from non-mining states to serve mining activities, widely
dispersed Australian equity holders, and tax payments to the government to be spent across the
country (Connolly and Orsmond 2011). These positive cross-state spillovers imply that the negative
impact of the investment decline in the mining states could be transmitted quickly to the other parts
of the country.
Coping with Increased Volatility
8.
Terms of trade shocks. The increased size of the mining sector means that the Australian
economy is becoming more exposed to external demand volatility and terms of trade shocks,
although for a plausible range of shocks the first-round effects might be relatively contained:


for the mining sector itself, since mining supply is relatively inelastic and prices are likely to
remain above marginal cost for most projects, the effect on export volumes might be small.2



as has usually been the case, for other sectors the floating exchange rate can help buffer shocks
by depreciating when the terms of trade falls, as has been making other tradable sectors more
competitive.

2

Australia is the source of more than one-third of the world seaborne market for iron ore. Its average production
cost, estimated at around $70 to $75 dollars a ton, is competitive compared to China’s domestic iron ore production
cost, estimated at around $120 a ton. Australia total iron ore production, however, is less than half of China’s (USGS
2011).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



the negative impact on mining revenues and profits would be spread between the Australian
economy and abroad as mining companies have globally distributed shareholdings. 3 As the
investment is largely financed by FDI, domestic bank exposures are low.



The direct fiscal impact of the mining sector itself is somewhat lower than would be suggested
by mining’s share of companies’ gross operating surplus. This is because the sector’s effective
company tax rate—as in many capital-intensive industries—has been low given deductions and
write-offs (15 percent compared to 25 percent for the corporate sector as a whole). Additional
revenues from state royalties and the federal resource rent tax are small, under 1 percent of
GDP. The main channel for a terms of trade shock to affect the budget is through lower nominal
GDP, as in 2012-13.4

9.
Second-round effects. Although the first-round effects are likely to remain relatively
contained the overall impact could be bigger depending on the second-round effects on factors
such as confidence and household income and consumption. Tentative model simulations aimed at
incorporating these effects suggest that as mining exports increase by 30 percent, as is expected
after several years, the impact of the temporary negative external demand shock in emerging Asia
on nominal GDP could increase by one-fifth (Annex Figure 2).
10.
LNG pricing. Additional volatility may arise from the evolution of LNG pricing in the global
market. LNG has grown from less than 5 percent of world gas consumption in 2000 to over
10 percent, enabling it to be more of a global commodity. The International Energy Agency (IEA)
forecasts that Australia’s LNG exports will increase rapidly from 2015, making Australia the world’s
largest exporter of LNG. Asian and Pacific countries, main importers of Australia’s LNG exports, have
historically agreed to long-term purchase contracts at oil-indexed prices (Deloitte, 2013). However,
more diverse and competitively-priced supplies will create conditions in the global LNG market that
may lead to a transition away from oil-price indexation and increase the price sensitivity for the LNG
producers. This could be particularly challenging for high-cost Australian LNG projects.

3

Connolly and Orsmond (2011) estimate that Australian residents accrued a little over half of the total receipts
earned from the mining operations.
4

Treasury estimates suggest that a permanent fall in the terms of trade of around 4 percent in 2013/14 would cause
a fall in nominal GDP of around ¾ percent in 2013/14 and 1 percent in 2014/15. The fiscal impact would widen the
underlying cash deficit by around 0.2% of GDP in 2013/14 and 0.3% of GDP in 2014/15. Staff simulations show
comparable results.

Productivity and potential output over the medium term. In order to deliver sustained
growth at a rate around 3 percent in the long run, multifactor productivity growth needs to reverse
its declining trend to compensate the likely decline in the growth of capital inputs (Figure 7).5 Some
of the productivity gains may come from the mining sector, which has experienced a sharp decline
in measured productivity partly due to investment-to-output lags (See Box and Productivity
Commission 2009). Staff’s sectoral analysis indicates that as the mining sector’s share in the
economy rises, if mining productivity growth increases to above 2 percent and if productivity growth
in the other sectors remains at the average level of the last decade, total multifactor productivity
growth will rise to near 1 percent, a level consistent with GDP growth at around 3 percent.6

5

Assuming that hours worked grow at the same rate as population at an annual rate around 1.8 percent, capital
input grows in line with GDP, and the relative labor and capital income shares remain at their current levels, a 3
percent annual growth rate requires the multifactor productivity (MFP) to grow at 0.7 percent a year, close to the
historical average of 1994-2011.
6

A study by the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics (BREE 2013) finds that after removing the influence of
both deposit quality depletion and production lags, the MFP growth rate in Australia’s mining increases from an
average annual rate of negative 0.65 to positive 2.5 per cent between 1985-86 and 2009-10.

Australia’s Productivity Challenge
Labor Productivity Growth

Australia’s productivity growth weakened over the
past decade and is now below historical average.
Following a period of economic reform driven
productivity increases in the 1990s, productivity growth
fell back sharply over the past decade. However, this
slowdown did not translate into lower living standards
owing to the substantial increase in Australia’s terms of
trade over the past decade, as well as favorable
demographics.

Productivity and Income
(March 1990=100)

The decline in productivity is partly attributable to
the mining investment boom, and some bounce
back can be expected as the production phase
begins. Investment-to-output lags imply a decline in
measured mining productivity. The mining investment
boom may also have contributed to general skills
shortages hampering productivity growth. In the utilities
sector the shift away from coal powered energy to more
expensive sources and technologies adversely affected
measured productivity. Despite the slowdown,
productivity in Australia (as a percent of U.S. labor
productivity) is still higher than the OECD average.
With terms of trade now declining, productivity
growth needs to increase to continue delivering
rising incomes. As the mining investment phase peaks,
mining output is set to increase strongly in the coming
years, boosting productivity in the sector. Similarly,
investments in water management and utilities reform
are likely to improve productivity. Broader-based
productivity growth is also part of the government’s
agenda, with focus on deregulation and infrastructure.
In this context, infrastructure financing will be one of
Australia’s priorities while chairing the G20.

1/ The IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF), a multi-region dynamic general equilibrium model (for the
theoretical structure see Kumhof and others 2010), can help illustrate the impact under two scenarios: mining exports accounting
for 60 percent of total exports (the current level), and accounting for 80 percent of total exports (as mining export volumes rise).
The model is calibrated to contain three regions: Australia, Emerging Asia (home to Australia’s main export destinations), and the
rest of the world. The shock is a temporary one percent decline in Emerging Asia’s aggregate demand.

Annex 5. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public Debt. Australian general government gross debt is expected to peak at around 32 percent of
GDP in 2015 and is among the lowest in advanced nations.
The authorities‘ medium-term objective is to reduce the budget deficit over the projection period
and reach to surplus afterward. Outside the Commonwealth budget, the States and Territories also
anticipate a gradual reduction in deficit over the medium term. For the General Government, the
baseline envisages a stabilization of gross debt at around 30 percent of GDP in the projection period
and for net debt to increase to just under 20 percent of GDP.
The standard shocks in the DSA are all considered to be downside scenarios. Under the standard
DSA scenarios:
•

The primary balance shock is based on keeping a constant primary balance as a proportion of
GDP at the level of 2013. Gross debt would rise slightly reaching around 40 percent of GDP by
2018.

•

The historical shock is based on keeping a constant primary balance as a proportion of GDP at
the level of the average of the last 10 years. This leaves gross debt little changed at around
30 percent of GDP by 2018.

•

The contingent liability shock is based on a scenario assuming a rescue by the public sector of
10 percent of the financial sector. Gross debt would reach a little over 50 percent of GDP on
impact and would stay at that level by 2018. Staff considers this to be a tail risk, given that the
FSAP found the financial system to be resilient to a number of stress scenarios. Such a shock
would in any case leave public debt at manageable levels.

External Debt. Australia’s net foreign liabilities are high by advanced country standards, reflecting
sustained current account deficits. The net foreign liability position has fluctuated between 55 and
60 percent of GDP for a number of years, within which net debt liabilities equated to around
50 percent of GDP. Gross external debt, around 100 percent of GDP, is relatively low among
advanced countries.
As indicated by the 2013 ABS Foreign Currency Exposure survey, most of Australia’s foreign liabilities
are denominated in Australian dollars and the majority of its foreign assets are denominated in
foreign currencies. As at the end of March 2013, Australian entities overall had a net foreign
currency asset position equivalent to 27 percent of GDP even before taking into account the use of
derivatives for hedging purposes (ABS Cat No 5302.0, June 2013). This net foreign currency asset
position means that a depreciation of the Australian dollar would reduce the size of Australia’s net
foreign liability position.

boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year
historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is used to
project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2010. This scenario assumes foreign exchange hedging effectively
covers 80 percent of foreign currency denominated debt, consistent with the findings of the 2013 ABS Foreign Currency
Exposure survey. Because Australian entities as a whole have a net foreign currency position, a depreciation of the
Australian dollar would reduce the size of Australia's net foreign liabilitiy position.

Annex 6: Australia Main Recommendations of the 2012 Article IV
Consultation
Fund Recommendation
Fiscal Policy
The plan to maintain surpluses over the medium
term should help relieve pressure on monetary
policy and thereby the exchange rate, and put
Australia in a better position to deal with future
shocks and the long-term cost of aging.
Australia's modest public debt gives the
authorities scope to delay their planned return
to surpluses in the event of a sharp deterioration
in the economic outlook.
Monetary Policy
The RBA's high degree of credibility and the
rapid monetary transmission in Australia allows
monetary policy to react quickly and flexibly to
changing economic circumstances. If the global
recovery stalls or international markets are
disrupted, monetary policy should act as the first
line of defense and the RBA has the scope to cut
the policy rate and provide liquidity support to
banks.
Financial Sector Policy
Stress testing indicates that the major banks are
adequately capitalized and are likely to
withstand large macroeconomic shocks, but
would require RBA liquidity support to withstand
an extreme funding shock. The authorities
should continue to emphasize intensive bank
supervision and introduce higher loss
absorbency for systemically important banks.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Policy Actions
The sharper-than-expected decline in revenues
as commodity prices declined and the economy
slowed have delayed the timing of the
authorities' plan to return to surplus.

The RBA has eased monetary policy by 225 basis
points since November 2011 to 2.5 percent. The
funding situation of banks has continued to
improve over the post-crisis period as banks
have shifted to more stable and longer maturity
sources of funding.

APRA put in place its framework for Basel III
capital requirements in January 2013, raising the
level and quality of the regulatory capital.
Looking ahead, banks are well placed to meet
APRA's accelerated capital requirements. APRA
has introduced the Basel Framework for
domestic systemically important banks. The
Basel III liquidity standards will be introduced
2015--ahead of the committee's deadline.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the
amount of such arrears will be shown in this section.
Exchange Rate Arrangement. Australia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free from restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange
restrictions that are maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security and
which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). The
exchange rate is free floating, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to
intervene. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange.

Restrictions on Capital Transactions. Australia maintains a capital transactions regime that is virtually
free of restrictions. Two main restrictions on foreigners require: authorization for significant ownership
of Australian corporations; and approval for acquisition of real estate.
Article IV Consultation. Australia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The 2012 Article IV
consultation discussions were held during September 6-20, 2012; the Executive Board discussed the
staff report (IMF Country Report No. 12/305) and concluded the consultation on November 12,
2012.
FSAP Participation. The last FSAP Update involved two missions: April 23-May 15 and July 9-24,
2012; the Executive Board discussed the assessment (IMF Country Report No. 12/308) on November
12, 2012.
Fourth Amendment. Australia has accepted the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). In recent
years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has taken several initiatives to further improve the quality of the
data, such as including the prices of financial services in the CPI and developing new measures of labor
underutilization. Method to calculate contributions to growth has also been revised so that each volume
component adds to total volume GDP growth.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Australia

On February 10, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Australia.
The Australian economy has performed well relative to many other advanced economies since
the global financial crisis. However, a transition phase has now been reached as the terms of
trade driven mining investment boom of the past decade has peaked and the economy is moving
to the production and export phase. Mining-related investment which accounted for almost half
of GDP growth in the past couple of years is expected to drop sharply in the near term, and a
recovery in non-mining investment will be needed to underpin demand and return the economy’s
growth rate to trend.
Annual growth has slowed to 2¼ percent in the third quarter of 2013, below the trend growth of
around 3 percent. In addition to the slowdown of investment in new mining projects, non-mining
investment has been weighed down by excess capacity and an overvalued exchange rate.
Consumption growth has been modest and the household savings rate has remained above 10
percent. On the plus side mining exports are growing as new capacity comes on stream and in
recent months housing market activity has begun to pick up with building approvals,
transactions, and prices increasing. Nevertheless labor market conditions have remained soft and
the unemployment rate has risen. Inflation remains anchored in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s
(RBA) target range.
After several years where house prices have lagged income growth and construction has been
weak, the recent revival in housing market activity could contribute to near-term growth and
begin to help address persistent structural supply shortages but has also boosted house price
inflation. To date overall credit growth has remained moderate with many households continuing
to prepay mortgages. Looking forward though, there is a risk that rapid house price growth could
give rise to expectations-driven, self-reinforcing demand dynamics and price overshooting, and
the authorities would need to be prepared to take preventative actions.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

In response to weakening demand the RBA cut its policy interest rate substantially over the last
two years. This has begun to support interest-sensitive spending and asset values. With growth
currently on the soft side, the real exchange rate still strong and efforts to reduce the budget
deficit likely, monetary policy should remain accommodative and act as the primary
macroeconomic tool for managing aggregate demand in the near term. The prospects of tighter
monetary policy in major advanced economies may help weaken the Australian dollar, a key
factor for achieving broader-based growth in the economy.
The budget deficit was reduced from 3 percent of GDP to 1½ percent in 2012/13. The goal of
returning the budget to surplus last year was held back by slower-than-projected output growth
and weaker commodity prices. Revenue fell short of projections as the lower terms of trade
together with the persistently strong Australian dollar reduced nominal GDP and dented
corporate profitability. Spending was also somewhat higher than anticipated. The government
has announced the broad aim of reaching a fiscal surplus in a few years, and the aim of reaching
a 1 percent surplus in a decade. A more detailed framework will be established when the
government announces its fiscal strategy in May.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound and prudent macroeconomic
management which has contributed to a strong economic performance in recent years. Directors
noted that the Australian economy rests on solid fundamentals but its near-term outlook remains
vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks and downside risks. Against this background, they agreed
that the transition to a growth path along which investment in mining plays a lesser role presents
important policy challenges in the period ahead.
Directors considered that the current macroeconomic policy mix is broadly appropriate. With
inflation in the target range, growth below trend, and the real exchange rate on the strong side,
monetary policy should remain accommodative and act as the primary tool for short term
aggregate demand management. Directors also supported the government’s aim to return to
fiscal surplus without undue prejudice to growth to help rebuild fiscal buffers in the coming
years. In this context, they emphasized the usefulness of early decisions on the spending cuts and
revenue increases needed to reach the fiscal objectives.
The financial system remains sound and well managed. Furthermore, the intensive and proactive
supervisory framework limits the likelihood that house price fluctuations will have an adverse
impact on the financial system. Directors observed, however, that banks could be exposed to
highly leveraged households and to rollover risks associated with offshore funding needs.
Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors emphasized that Australia’s floating exchange rate has been an important element of its
macroeconomic policy framework and has served the country well by cushioning terms of trade
shocks. They took note of the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate currently appears to be
modestly overvalued in real effective terms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to embark on a comprehensive new round of structural
reforms. They concurred that renewed efforts to strengthen competition in labor and product
markets as well as to address infrastructure bottlenecks are critical to increase productivity and
further diversify the sources of growth.

Statement by Ian Davidoff, Alternate Executive Director for Australia,
Nghi Luu, Senior Advisor, and Chay Fisher, Advisor
The Australian economy is in transition. The terms of trade have fallen from record highs and
mining-related capital investment has declined after an unprecedented surge over the past
decade. While the large-scale investment in mining capacity will continue to boost export
growth, this next export-led phase of the mining boom will not provide the same support to
growth and employment as the investment phase did. Other sectors of the economy will
therefore need to strengthen to fill the gap in growth left by mining investment. Though long
anticipated, this transition is unlikely to be perfectly smooth. However, it has begun to take
shape. Activity in the non-resource sectors of the economy, especially housing construction,
is picking up gradually. The recent depreciation of the exchange rate, ongoing low interest
rates, and an emerging recovery in confidence, should continue to support the transition
towards broad based growth. While activity outside of the resources sector accounted for less
than half of total growth in the past two years, non-resource based activity is expected to
account for some four fifths of growth in 2014/15.
Set against this backdrop of change, the medium-term economic outlook remains generally
favorable. The Australian authorities expect growth for the current year to be slightly below
potential (at 2½ percent), with growth picking up modestly in subsequent years as the
economic transition takes hold. Labor market conditions are expected to soften, with the
unemployment rate drifting up to a peak of 6¼ percent by mid-2015. Inflation is expected to
remain within the Reserve Bank’s target range. The financial sector remains in good health
and is well placed to weather any market volatility related to the Federal Reserve’s exit from
unconventional monetary policy; banks source a significantly lower share of funding from
short-term wholesale debt markets than they did prior to the financial crisis, and have
sufficient liquidity to withstand periods of disrupted market access.
As part of the economic transition, the Australian authorities are committed to raising
productivity by initiating a program of structural reforms. The authorities are also committed
to strengthening Australia’s medium-term fiscal position, to build policy buffers for the
future.
The Australian authorities welcome the Staff report and agree with its main findings.
An economy in transition
External sector
From the mid-2000s, Australia experienced the largest rise in its terms of trade for over a
century, as the prices of many commodities surged alongside strong growth in the economies
of Australia’s Asian trading partners. High commodity prices encouraged unprecedented
investment in the extraction of Australia's natural resources, especially iron ore, coal and
natural gas (LNG). Strong growth in mining investment has seen the ratio of mining

2
investment to GDP more than quadruple over the past decade, to an estimated peak of around
7½ percent in 2012/13 (a significantly higher share than in previous mining booms), while
the mining capital stock has more than tripled. However, as the terms of trade have fallen
from their peaks in 2011, the flow of new mining investment projects has slowed. The
authorities anticipate that mining investment as a share of GDP is likely to fall back towards
historical averages over coming years. Ongoing resources investment is increasingly
concentrated in the LNG sector, with Australian LNG projects currently underway estimated
to account for more than two thirds of current global LNG investment.
The increased capacity in the mining sector is now translating into higher export volumes.
The terms of trade remain elevated by historical standards. Exports of bulk commodities –
such as iron ore and coal – are expected to increase strongly over the next few years as
increased supply meets ongoing strong demand from key trading partners such as China.
While the authorities agree that the possibility of a ‘hard landing’ in China poses a risk to the
outlook, they also share the Fund’s central view that the Chinese economy will continue to
grow at annual rates of around 7½ percent in the next few years. The authorities also expect
that LNG exports will make a significant contribution to export growth from around the
middle of the decade as new LNG production facilities come on line.
Higher exports, in combination with lower imports of capital goods into the mining sector,
are expected to result in the trade balance moving to surplus. The current account deficit is
expected to remain stable at around 4 percent of GDP over the next few years.
The exchange rate
Australia’s floating exchange rate has been a vital shock absorber for the economy during the
upswing of the mining investment boom, and it will continue to play a pivotal role during the
economic transition. Throughout 2012 and early 2013, as the terms of trade fell, the
exchange rate did not depreciate as would normally be expected, with the Reserve Bank
having publicly described the currency as 'uncomfortably high'. More recently, the Australian
dollar has depreciated – by around 15 percent on a trade-weighted basis since April 2013 –
and the authorities see scope for further depreciation as the United States starts to return
monetary policy to more normal settings.
A lower exchange rate has improved the outlook for sectors such as tourism, education and
manufacturing and should, over time, lead to a pick-up in non-mining investment. The
flexible exchange rate would also provide an important buffer to the economy in the event of
a sustained fall in commodity prices. As a relatively low-cost producer of key commodities
(including coal and iron ore), Australia would expect to increase its share of global
commodity markets under such circumstances, as other higher cost producers reduce output.
Financial conditions
Monetary policy is playing its role in facilitating the transition towards non-resource sectors
by supporting domestic demand. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its policy rate by

3
225 basis points over the past two years and, at 2½ percent, the cash rate is currently lower
than it was at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008/09. As a result, borrowing rates
for households and businesses are well below average and, with banks’ balance sheets in a
healthy position, low-cost finance is available for sound projects.
The transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is working much as the Reserve
Bank expects, with interest-sensitive sectors of the economy responding to the
accommodative policy stance. Most notably, activity in the housing market has picked up,
with turnover increasing and prices rising. Nationwide housing prices have risen by
17 percent since early 2012, after gradually falling over the previous year. As anticipated,
higher prices have contributed to increased construction activity and higher dwelling
investment, which supports growth and also helps correct an undersupply of dwellings;
additions to the dwelling stock have failed to keep pace with population growth for a number
of years.
The Australian authorities agree with the Staff’s assessment that the housing market does not
pose a notable or imminent threat to macroeconomic or financial stability. There are a
number of features of the Australian housing market – both cyclical and institutional – which
suggest that recent developments are not a cause for alarm. These include:








Household leverage has not increased – household credit growth has accelerated only
modestly and households’ aggregate debt-to-income ratio has been stable for several
years.
Households have significant mortgage buffers – many household are ahead on their
repayments and balances in mortgage offset and redraw facilities are equivalent to over
20 months of scheduled repayments (at current interest rates).
Loan-to-valuation ratios (LTVs) remain modest and stable – the average LTV on the
stock of outstanding mortgages is 50 percent; and the share of new loans approved with
relatively high LTVs has been stable in recent years.
Asset quality is sound – only around 0.7 percent of Australian banks’ mortgage portfolios
are classified as non-performing, and around three quarters of these are well covered by
the value of collateral.

The authorities nevertheless remain alert to the possibility of future over-confidence on the
part of borrowers and lenders. In particular, the authorities are closely watching some
segments of the market in which activity has picked up relatively strongly, including investor
activity in Sydney. More generally, sound lending practices are supported by the Australian
Prudential Regulation Authority’s proactive, risk-based, approach to supervision which
subjects institutions that pose greater systemic risks to more intensive supervision, and
potentially higher capital or other prudential requirements.
Fiscal Policy
Australia’s public finances remain healthy by international standards. Nevertheless,
Australia’s fiscal position has deteriorated over the past twelve months, partly due to the

4
changing domestic economic landscape and also one-off expenditures. The authorities have
chosen to let the automatic stabilizers work, reflected in lower tax receipts and higher
expenditure outlays over the budget forward estimates associated with softer nominal and
labor market conditions.
The medium-term fiscal outlook has worsened, in part due to changes in demand driven
programs focused on education and disability services. Gross debt is projected to continue to
increase, with total central government debt securities on issue rising to 26 percent of GDP
by 2023-24 if there are no policy changes. Although it is yet to outline its fiscal strategy in
detail, the new government is strongly committed to strengthening the budget position over
time, with a focus on expenditure restraint in order to achieve sustained surpluses building to
1 percent of GDP over the next decade. To guide it in putting in place sustainable fiscal
policy settings, the government has established a National Commission of Audit, composed
of independent advisors, to assess the role and scope of government and the efficiency of
government spending. The final Audit will be completed in March, and the government will
draw upon its findings when it outlines its detailed fiscal strategy in the May budget.
Structural reform
As part of the economic transition, Australia needs to lift its productivity growth. The
unprecedented rise in the terms of trade over the past decade has accounted for almost half of
the recent rise in Australia’s national income. Over this period, a temporary demographic
sweet spot – with a steady rise in the number of people of working age as a share of the
population – has also boosted growth in per capita income. However, as the terms of trade
decline and demographic trends become less favorable, the Australian economy will need to
become more efficient in order to sustain recent rates of increase in national income.
Australia undertook a wave of significant reforms across product, labor and capital markets
in the two decades leading up to and at the beginning of the millennium. The new
government recognizes the importance of building on these reforms, which set Australia up
for significant growth in economic prosperity, by setting in train a new wave of reforms that
will reverse the relatively low ebb in productivity growth that Australia has experienced over
the past decade. Specifically, the government has:






commissioned the first comprehensive review of competition laws since the early 1990s;
embarked on a wholesale review of the financial services sector, the first review of the
sector in 16 years;
committed to a review of the taxation system, with details still to be announced;
undertaken to streamline regulatory approval processes for large-scale projects; and
begun to outline a plan for significant investments in economic infrastructure, including
leveraging private capital, in order to overcome supply-side bottlenecks.

These steps are expected to help the Australian authorities to fashion an ambitious structural
reform agenda focused on lifting productivity over the next decade.
