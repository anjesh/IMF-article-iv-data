STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Addressing the Household Debt Overhang
The economy is slowly emerging from its balance sheet recession. Housing prices
have steadied, exports are rising on expanding global trade, but consumption
continues to contract on an annual basis, held down by household deleveraging and
weak incomes.
The risks to the outlook are on the downside. Near term risks stem from euro area
weakness and geopolitical spillovers, while medium-term growth prospects are
clouded by the slow progress in addressing the large household debt overhang.
Addressing the household debt overhang is key to securing a robust recovery.
Encouraging reprofiling of underwater mortgages, increasing intergenerational
transfers, and reducing pension contributions for the young would support orderly
household deleveraging.
Strengthening the banking sector would reduce housing risks and support
credit in the recovery. Stronger capital buffers and more ambitious medium-term
targets for reducing LTV ratios and mortgage deductibility would encourage more
corporate lending and reduce the risks from the housing sector.
Expanding the rental market would ease pressures on home ownership.
Deregulating private rentals, improving the targeting of social housing, and
liberalizing zoning laws would create a more efficient and resilient housing sector.
Accommodative macro policies and structural reforms to raise productivity
would support balance sheet adjustment and enhance potential growth. During
deleveraging, fiscal policy should aim to be supportive by maintaining a structural
balance over the medium term, while avoiding targeting headline balances. Structural
reforms to strengthen the SME sector, address labor duality and expand the
availability of equity financing are also needed to raise productivity.

Progress in household
deleveraging has been slow. Following
a decline of 27 percent in real terms,
housing prices have held steady over the
last year, halting the decline in
household wealth. Household leverage,
however, remains high, with debt to
income ratios still around 300 percent,
almost double the levels in the early
2000s. The loss of housing wealth has
been significant at about 60 percent of
GDP, concentrated mainly among
younger cohorts where nearly two-thirds
of mortgages are underwater.

1.
The recovery continues but remains sluggish. After contracting in Q1 2014, GDP
expanded in Q2 by 0.7 percent (q/q), led by growing exports.1 High frequency indicators, such as
PMI and industrial production, point to expansion continuing through, but at a slower pace. Exports
are rising on expanding global trade, but consumption is still contracting on an annual basis as
indebted households continue to save.

Rising unemployment and declining inflation reflect the sizeable output gap. While the
unemployment rate barely rose during the early phase of the crisis, the rate has risen to 7.2 percent

In March 2014, Statistics Netherlands started reporting national accounts data in according to the European System
of Accounts (ESA) 2010. Under the newly adopted standard, GDP in current prices is nearly 8 percent larger than
under ESA 95, mostly due to the inclusion of R&D costs in investments and new data sources.

in 2014, some 2 percentage points above its long term average. Labor slack and the large output
gap (4½ percent of GDP) have pushed down core inflation close to zero, raising real interest rates
and the burden of household debt.
4.
The external current account surplus now exceeds 10 percent of GDP, supported by a
rising trade balance. Based on the ESR assessment, the external position is stronger than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings by 0-4 percent of GDP.
Relative to the euro area, the real effective exchange rate has declined since 2005. Other country
specific factors include a fully funded pension system and high savings from household
deleveraging (see Box). The large surplus

above its pre-crisis levels, mainly due to weak domestic demand. Structural reforms to raise
productivity and progress in repairing household balance sheets and the banking system will
support domestic demand and contribute to reducing external imbalances. A slower pace of fiscal
consolidation and shift towards more productive investment will also help in the rebalancing.
5.
The risks to the outlook are mainly on the downside and if realized, are likely to
interact, causing regional and global spillovers (see RAM).
a. Geopolitical tensions and euro area weakness. An escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis
that leads to more sanctions or higher fuel prices would hurt the Dutch economy, mainly
through indirect spillovers and financial linkages with the rest of Europe. Russia is the fifth
largest exporter to the Netherlands, supplying mostly crude oil and minerals. Dutch FDI in
Russia is also sizeable (10 percent of GDP), mainly in the energy sector. The Netherlands is
also exposed to weakness in the euro area which accounts for 60 percent of Dutch exports.
Outward spillovers could occur through Dutch banks’ exposures in Germany and the
United States and their links to global trade finance.

Box 1. The Puzzle of the Netherlands’ Current Account Surplus
The current account has been in surplus since 1981, reaching 10 percent of GDP in 2013 and reflects in
part the Netherlands’ growing role as a global trade hub for multinationals.
Over the past decade, the current account surplus has been driven by the net lending of Dutch
non-financial corporations (NFCs). Corporate surpluses driven by strong profits and stagnant
investment have pushed up the current account to above 10 percent of GDP, from around 4 percent of
GDP in the late 1990s. This is mainly reflected in the trade balance, which reached 7½ percent of GDP
over 2010-13, highlighting the Netherland’s growing importance as a global trade hub.

A favorable tax environment has supported the Netherland’s role as a center for trade and FDI.
The Netherlands benefits from a lower tax rate among OECD countries, with a number of tax provisions
aimed at supporting trade and FDI. These include a large network of tax treaties, taxation mechanisms
protecting exporters’ cash flow, advance tax rulings, and reduced taxes on intangibles. In addition,
group financing has a favorable regime for intra-company dividends, interest and royalties, and
protective rules on netting of profits and losses between affiliates.

and pension
systems as helping to lift
confidence and activity. In particular, the reduction in pension premiums and temporary gift tax
exemptions boosted disposable income which increased for the first time since 2007. On lower
inflation, the authorities highlighted falling global commodity prices as driving headline prices and
saw the risks of deflation as low given the continued rise in real wages. Recent ECB liquidity support
measures should also support prices mainly through its impact on the exchange rate.

7.
Views differed on the drag of household debt on consumption. The authorities were
generally more sanguine on the growth headwinds from household deleveraging. They highlighted
studies that found that younger households had increased their savings in response to the fall in net
wealth, but their overall impact on consumption was small.2 Others, however, noted the impact of
household deleveraging extended beyond the immediate borrower and generated negative
externalities by reducing labor mobility and constraining credit through lower collateral values.

Policy Response

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood
of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10
and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

8.
Instead, the authorities saw the main risks as a slowdown in the euro area. In particular,
an unanchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area would affect the Netherlands through
lower external demand and its impact on domestic prices. The authorities also noted potential
downside risks from geopolitical tensions, but saw these so far as moderate. If the Russia-Ukraine
conflict were to escalate, spillover channels would be mainly indirect through weaker demand from
the rest of the euro area and greater uncertainty.
9.
On the external current account, the authorities saw the surplus as being driven
primarily by growth in multinational profits and re-exports, as well as household
deleveraging and did not expect these factors to subside in the near term. They saw few signs
of a significantly undervalued exchange rate as inflation pressures remain weak and real wages are
rising. Nevertheless, they agreed that policies to address the household debt overhang and increase
investment, especially by SMEs, would over the longer term bring down the surplus.

POLICIES TO PROMOTE ORDERLY DELEVERAGING
10.
Over the past year, the government has taken important steps to address the housing
market, support indebted households, and implement pension and labor reforms. In particular,
policies regarding mortgages have stabilized expectations and supported a pickup in housing prices
and transactions. These and other reforms to strengthen the financial system and assist SMEs have
helped boost confidence, increase policy certainty, and support the nascent recovery.
11.
To secure a robust recovery, it will be important to build on these reforms to reduce
household indebtedness, enhance the resilience of the financial system, and improve the
efficiency of the housing market. At the same time, accommodative macro policies and structural
reforms to raise productivity, especially for smaller firms, should support the balance sheet
adjustment and improve the economy’s growth potential. The Article IV consultation focused on a
comprehensive strategy for promoting orderly household deleveraging while supporting growth.

A. Addressing the Household Debt Overhang

Context

High household debt is at the center of the weak economy. The legacy of the
housing crisis has left behind a large household debt overhang, a distorted housing
market, and leveraged banks that have all contributed to depressing aggregate demand.
Indebted homeowners have reduced consumption to repay debt, which in turn has held
back investment demand. With their large mortgage portfolios, banks are overleveraged
and vulnerable to a growth shock or a cutoff in wholesale funding. Public recapitalization

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

of the banks and various support of home ownership create risks for the fiscal sector.
These in turn have contributed to excess savings and growing external imbalances.
The burden of the large debt overhang is also unevenly distributed across
generations. Aggregate household net wealth is high at 400 percent of GDP but is
concentrated mainly among the older generations who benefit from high pension
savings and low mortgage debt,

Faster progress in repairing household balance sheets would support a more
robust and sustained recovery and reduce intergenerational imbalances. Staff
simulations suggest that under current house prices and deleveraging trends, it would
take about 10 years before household leverage ratios return to their pre-crisis levels
(even longer for a new lower “equilibrium” debt ratio). During this period, growth would
remain subdued as reduced spending (higher savings) by low net wealth households

Addressing the household debt problem among the young would lift overall
spending. Policies to assist younger cohorts with a higher propensity to consume would
lift overall spending and could include:


Increasing transfers between generations. A temporary tax exemption for monetary
gifts of up to €100,000 was introduced last year to reduce mortgage debt and was used
by more than 50,000 households. Staff estimates suggest that around 0.4 percent of
GDP has been transferred and likely contributed to the nascent housing recovery. Absent
any extension of the measure beyond its expiration at end-December, the authorities
could consider increasing the €50,000 limit for tax-free transfers, allowing gifts to all
family members to be used to repay mortgage debt. To help lower income groups,
individuals could be allowed to spread payments over several years up to the limit.



More reprofiling of underwater mortgages. Banks have taken steps to renegotiate
mortgages with distressed borrowers, but progress on reprofiling debt has been slow.
Supervisors should encourage banks to remove restrictions and limits on prepayment
and sequestered savings accounts to facilitate reprofiling into longer-term, amortizing
mortgages. Regulatory measures, such as higher risk weights on interest-only loans,
could lead to greater price differentiation in favor of traditional annuity mortgages.



Reducing the stigma of personal bankruptcy. Mortgages in Dutch law are fullrecourse and easily enforceable, even in personal bankruptcies. This has kept mortgage
defaults very low, but limited the use of the system for insolvent borrowers. Easing

alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration or mediation could also
help avoid foreclosure and personal bankruptcy.
The authorities saw the temporary tax break on monetary gifts as having
contributed to a revival in the housing sector. The program was designed to be
temporary to bring forward spending and was allowed to expire as part of a broader
effort to scale back exceptional support to the housing market. Nevertheless, the
authorities saw merit in expanding the general €50,000 exemption for tax-free transfers
in order to give lower income groups more time to build up savings and benefit from
the transfers.

Box 2. Deleveraging and Household Debt Overhang
The deflation of the Dutch housing bubble has reduced the aggregate housing wealth by
approximately 60 percent of GDP and impeded consumption growth. While house prices generally
influence consumption through changes in the net wealth of house owners, the strength of the effect
depends on country specific characteristics. International comparison of the relationship between
household consumption and house prices shows that the influence of house prices is particularly
strong in the Netherlands. Consequently, the recent contractions of private consumption in the
Netherlands can be at least in part attributed to the loss in housing wealth and the debt overhang (for
details see Mrkaic (2014), House Prices, Consumption, and Household Debt Overhang in the
Netherlands.)
The losses in home equity have been greater among highly leveraged younger house owners
than among the old. Younger households have suffered particularly large losses in home equity. They
purchased houses near the peak of the market and had to absorb large price declines. In addition, due
to their high leverage, their home equity declined more than that of the older house owners. The loss
in house equity is equal to the percentage change in house prices times the leverage multiplier. The
-1

leverage multiplier is equal to (1-LTV) ; it grows rapidly with leverage. In 2011, the leverage multiplier
for highly levered house owners below 45 years of age was approximately 12 and only 1.8 for older
ones. Currently, approximately two thirds of younger households have negative housing equity.
Duration of deleveraging depends on the magnitude of debt overhang and macroeconomic
environment. The negative shock to the housing wealth of young house buyers, together with their
low levels of financial wealth, incentivizes them to increase savings in order to rebuild their net wealth.
The speed of debt overhang reduction depends on the rate of saving, income growth, inflation, and
growth of house prices. A flow of funds analysis shows that deleveraging is a slow process; under the
assumption of no new policies it would be a drag on consumption over the medium term.
Intergenerational rebalancing could accelerate deleveraging of the young households and
reduce the negative effect on their consumption.
Reducing pension contributions (as described in the main

Despite the high share of underwater mortgages, default rates have remained low
and are unlikely to rise. For these reasons, the authorities saw little need to reprofile
underwater mortgages on a large scale. Banks were already encouraging heavily
indebted borrowers to switch from interest-only to longer-maturity amortizing
mortgages, but faced challenges given the strong tax incentives for borrowers to retain
their current loan. To avoid moral hazard, they stressed that any reprofiling should be
agreed with lenders on a voluntary basis. The authorities believed that the price impact
of increasing risk weights to discourage interest only mortgages would likely be small
and dominated by the favorable fiscal incentives under the MID.
The authorities highlighted that the Dutch personal bankruptcy code now allows
for a “fresh start.” The new arrangement under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act allows a
bankrupt borrower the opportunity for discharge after meeting payment requirements
for three years, and education and training programs are in place to support work
during probation. Mortgage debt relief is also possible under the discharge. However,
the track record of successful repayment is mixed, and the stigma associated with
bankruptcy remains severe.
Reducing pension contributions for the young could also free resources to reduce
debt. Under the Dutch system where occupational pension accrual rates are equal for all

more drastic measures such as using pension savings to pay down mortgages would
need to be considered in the context of broader reforms so as to safeguard the fully
funded system which has served pensioners well. Options to reduce intergenerational
imbalances include adjusting accrual or contribution rates or possibly moving closer to a
defined contribution system with individual accounts. Discussions on broader pension
reforms are expected to start next year.

among SMEs. The authorities estimate
that banks need to further raise €20 billion in capital by 2019 to meet Basel
requirements, mainly through retained earnings.

Advice

Stronger capital and liquidity buffers would ensure that banks have the capacity to
support the recovery and the adjustment of household’s balance sheet. Supervisors
should encourage banks to frontload their capital raising plans before 2019, to ensure
that banks are prepared for the transition to Basel III and have adequate capital to
support lending in the recovery. 5 Capital raising plans should be based on tapping
private sources and suspending dividend payments, rather than cutting credit. Greater
use of securitization and covered bonds could help banks to reduce their funding costs
and mortgage and SME loan exposure.

4

The accrual rate was already lowered from 2.25 to 2.15 percent in 2014.

5

See the DNB Occasional Study “Bank Lending and Capital”, Vol. 12/No. 3 (2014), which estimates that shortfall in
banking capital would reach €3.2-4.3 billion, depending on the pace of investment recovery. According to staff
calculations, under a 5 percent increase in credit to the economy given unchanged capital, the core tier-1 capital
ratio would fall by 65 bps, roughly half the improvement in the ratio during 2013-14.

Authorities’
Views

The authorities saw that banks were on track to complete their adoption of
Basel III requirements and raise the needed capital by 2019. However, they
recognized that the capital target did not account for the higher national leverage ratio
of 4 percent, the SIFI surcharge, and the new requirements for the Deposit Guarantee
Scheme and Single Resolution Fund. The authorities viewed banks’ capital as sufficient to
support lending in an environment of moderate growth, but raised concerns that high
required rates of return on capital may push banks to take on excessive risks. Banks were
expecting tax deductibility for Tier-1 capital instruments from January 1 and the ECB’s
comprehensive assessment before issuing new capital.
Securitization of Dutch mortgages faces challenges. The authorities noted that high
LTVs, a large share of non-amortizing loans, and public mortgage insurance limited the
eligible loans for securitization and pushed up the cost of credit enhancements to a very
high 6-15 percent.

Context

The DNB will become the resolution authority for banks in the Netherlands. With
the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism
Regulation in place from 2015, the authorities decided to place the resolution authority
with the DNB to improve coordination and synergies between the institutions.

Advice

Further improvement to the framework for risk management and resolution are
needed. In particular, national arrangements for resolution and backstopping should be
completed to safeguard financial stability.

Authorities’
Views

The authorities were positive about the benefits of the banking union. Progress in
the banking union will diversify sources of funding and reduce borrowing rates through
greater cross-border competition. They noted that the completion of the ECB’s
Comprehensive Assessment would help reduce uncertainty, increase investments, and
support growth. As regards the Single Resolution Mechanism and the national backstop,
preparations are underway but the authorities were hesitant to issue ex ante
commitments before bail-in of private creditors. In the event that public funds are
needed, they can go directly to Parliament, as was done in the case of SNS Reaal.

Macro prudential measures should be tightened to reduce housing vulnerabilities
Advice

Macro prudential policies face the tradeoff between safeguarding financial
stability and supporting the housing recovery. The authorities’ policies to gradually
reduce loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) on new mortgages to 100 percent by 2018 and allow
mortgage interest deductibility (MID) only for new fully amortizing loans are appropriate
to mitigate housing risks and were accompanied by a gradual housing recovery. Beyond
2018, the authorities should aim for a faster pace of LTV reduction, eventually reaching
80 percent. Clarifying now the LTV path after 2018 would enhance regulatory certainty
and give buyers time to build savings. The average LTV for new mortgages has declined
to around 90 percent, suggesting that borrowers and lenders are internalizing declining

would help create buffers in household balance sheets and avoid the sharp swings in
consumption experienced during the crisis, but saw room for a soft LTV cap given the

accompanied by other housing reforms, such as expanding the private rental market.
The Financial Stability Committee (FSC) will address housing related macro prudential
measures in November.

Authorities’
Views

Reducing the procylicality of pension funds can assist in household deleveraging
Advice

Dutch pension funds should look to reduce further the procyclical link between
interest rates and payouts. In 2008, the financial crisis shrunk real pension fund assets
by 11 percent. This together with low interest rate increased liabilities triggering
reductions in benefits and increased contributions in order to restore coverage ratios
above the regulatory minimum of 105 percent. The close link between interest rates and
payouts has created a procyclical bias, adding to the pressures on households to
deleverage. To address this bias, the authorities should encourage pension funds to
hedge interest rate risk more aggressively and use more stable discount rates.

Authorities’ The authorities saw it as the first priority to ensure that the reduced accrual rates will be

the interest rate risk would lower the expected returns of their investments, since they
would have to match assets to liabilities, thereby increasing investment in treasury

C. Building a More Competitive, Flexible Housing Market
Context

The Dutch housing market suffers from numerous distortions that have
contributed to the debt overhang. Compared to the rest of Europe, the Dutch private
rental market is small, squeezed between an oversized social housing sector which owns
nearly one in every three dwellings and strong ownership demand fueled by generous
mortgage interest deductibility (MID) and other fiscal support. Full MID combined with
high LTVs has also led to a buildup of long-term interest only mortgages.
The authorities have undertaken a number of measures to shrink the social
housing sector (SHC) and expand the rental market. They have increased rents for
higher income individuals and shifted SHC rents closer to market levels. To shrink the
SHC sector, improve its efficiency and governance, the authorities have also imposed a
levy, and encourage the sale of dwellings into the non-regulated housing sector.

Advice

The size of the SHC sector should be scaled back to focus on its social mandate and
allow the development of the private rental market. Accordingly, the authorities
should continue to raise taxes on SHCs, apply more rigorous and frequent means testing
to determine tenants’ eligibility to social housing, and complete the shift to marketbased rents. To reduce fiscal contingent risks, public support of SHCs through
guarantees should be scaled back to core social tasks, and replaced with a more
targeted system of direct subsidies to lower income groups. Price controls on rents
should be lifted to attract private investors and help expand the private rental market.
Zoning regulations should be eased to expand housing supply.... The supply of new
housing has been held back by tight zoning regulations and a fragmented jurisdictional
system. The authorities should relax gradually constraints on new construction by
incentivizing municipalities to open land for new developments through increased
shares of property tax revenues and by elevating more zoning decisions to the level of
provinces and the central government.
…while scaling back public support would reduce housing risks to the government.
The National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) scheme insures lenders against default and
sets flat, below market premiums, independent of borrower risk, with payments almost
fully backed by the government. NHG-related contingent liabilities amount to around 27
percent of GDP. Shifting to risk-based pricing and lowering the maximum guarantee
threshold would reduce distortions in mortgage financing and contingent liabilities for
the government. The government is also considering packaging NHG-backed mortgage
bonds through the National Mortgage Institute (NHI) to attract pension funds and other
nonbank investors. To avoid further contingent liabilities, the NHI should not expand
fiscal risks beyond its packaging of NHG-backed bonds.

Box 3. Reforming Social Housing Corporations in the Netherlands
Social housing corporations (SHCs) overlook the housing market, managing 2.4 million dwellings or
34 percent of the total stock and offering cheap housing to low and middle-income households. Social
housing also accounts for nearly 80 percent of the rental sector and in big cities, such as Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, more than half of all dwellings are social.
About 420 SHCs dominate the rental market. Most housing corporations were established before
th

1930, with the oldest ones founded in the second half of the 19 century by corporations, charitable
institutions, churches, and municipalities. Housing corporations constructed 60 percent of all new
dwellings in 2011, and operate their dwellings within government rent-price regulation and tenure
protection in various forms. Housing corporations manage tenures through a complex scoring system
for dwellings and waiting lists for tenants. On average, the waiting time for social housing in
Amsterdam and The Hague is 8 and 6 years, respectively.
SHCs have to be self sustaining and could be given more flexibility to sell their real estate
holdings. The 1995 reform (“Brutering” or Balancing-out agreement) ended subsidies and public
support to housing corporations and gave full ownership of the social housing stock to the SHCs. Ever
since, SHCs fund themselves through rents and other real-estate activities. Selling dwellings also allows
SHCs to realize the latent value added on their books. Additionally, SHCs rely on cross-subsidies and
financial transfers among housing corporations, mainly from stronger to weaker SHCs.
SHC funding also benefits from public guarantees.
SHCs are incorporated as non-profit corporations
under a Board of Directors, with a majority
established as foundations. They are eligible for
government guarantees when raising funding from
the Guarantee Fund for Social Housing (WSW), and
reduced prices for purchasing land from local
governments. At end-2013, housing corporations had
borrowed about 14 percent of GDP (€86.2 billion)
from the WSW.

Some SHCs were found lacking proper governance and transparency. SHC Board of Directors are
self-appointed with limited supervision by public authorities. They often engage in activities beyond
their core business, including risky non-real estate related investments. For example, the large losses
on derivative deals by the top housing corporation in 2012 prompted the authorities to strengthen
oversight and enforce more stringent reporting.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

New risk-sharing instruments could be introduced to protect homeowners. Reliance
on debt financing concentrates the risk of declining house prices on borrowers.
Introducing new financing instruments, such as debt-equity swaps for underwater
mortgages, equity loans for home buyers, or futures contracts to insure against
idiosyncratic drops in house prices, could diversify housing risks across the economy and
facilitate an orderly adjustment of household balance sheets. The authorities could
explore the possibility of supporting these new risk-sharing instruments, such as by
setting market standards, pricing benchmarks or offering GFI preferential treatment of
such contracts.
Authorities’
Views

The authorities agreed on the need to gradually ease restrictions on the private
rental market. This has been done mainly through increasing rents in social housing
sector for higher income dwellers and by making the rent-setting mechanism less
administrative and more market based. In addition, the authorities have encouraged the
sale of social dwellings, including through a tax on social housing corporations. They,
however, noted the difficulties in introducing changes to SHC governance through
legislative measures because they are private entities. To encourage further housing
developments, the authorities have also increased the share of property taxes received
by municipalities from 2016 onwards. They noted that the lack of land for residential
construction was not a binding constraint in the housing market given the unused land
available for construction and low demand.
The government’s exposure to housing risk through the NHG is set to decline. The
authorities have already taken steps to reduce the maximum value of insured properties
and increase the insurance premium. Since January 2014 the NHG exposure has been
reduced to 90 percent of the claims. In addition, from January 2015, 15 bps of the
mortgage insurance premium will be set aside to safeguard against the risk of excessive
defaults. The authorities, however, cautioned against reducing further the NGH’s
guarantee limit and raising its premium which could undermine the NHG’s social
mandate to promote affordable housing.
On new financial risk-sharing instruments, the authorities saw benefits for
households to hedge risk to their most important asset but noted that this went
against the push for greater simplicity in financial instruments. Over time with a firm
housing recovery and stronger balance sheets, banks could consider developing such
instruments to help borrowers hedge their risks.

D. Supportive Macro Policies and Structural Reforms
Context

After several years of consolidation, the fiscal stance is set to return to neutral.
Cuts to health and long-term care and social security as well as increased revenues
reduced last year’s headline deficit to below 3 percent of GDP, allowing for an exit from
EDP in June. In 2014-15, the fiscal impulse is expected to be around zero, as the
government has shifted to targeting a structural balance in line with their medium-term
framework. Looking ahead, the headline deficit is expected to narrow further and the
general government debt to decline to 67 percent of GDP by 2019. For 2015, the
authorities plan to reduce the tax burden on labor by €1 billion by increasing the
employed persons’ tax credit and cutting the lowest rate of income tax. They also plan to
start discussions in 2016 on more fundamental reforms to the tax system.

Advice

To support growth during deleveraging, fiscal policy should focus on structural
targets. For 2015, the budget should continue to aim for a neutral stance to avoid
harmful tightening in the event that growth slows. Over the medium term, fiscal policy
should maintain a structural balance and avoid targeting headline balances in response
to adverse shocks. To mitigate the need for active fiscal policies, automatic stabilizers on
the revenue side appear to function well, but are constrained on the expenditure side
due to the real spending ceilings in the budget. Moving cyclical spending such as
unemployment insurance above the ceiling could allow for more automatic responses to
economic conditions.
A shift to a medium-term budget framework would also enhance the predictability
and responsiveness of fiscal policy. The current budget framework based on tight
expenditure ceilings depends crucially on the quality of macro projections over a 4 year
period and is linked closely to the political cycle. Moving to a medium-term budget
framework that is reviewed annually and allowing automatic stabilizers full play could
better incorporate macro developments and minimize the risk of procyclical tightening.

Tax reform should aim to reduce the debt bias, VAT distortions, and the labor tax wedge
Debt bias. The tax system allows interest deductibility to households and corporations
with no similar benefit to equity financing. To address this bias, an Allowance for
Corporate Equity (ACE) could be introduced to extend tax allowances to corporate
equity at a specified “normal return.” The ACE could link the “normal return” to
corporate bond rates, apply the allowance only on new investments, and allow the
netting of benefits for holding companies. Such an approach could also be extended to
households to build new home equity.

Labor tax wedge. The
Netherlands has one of the
highest marginal income tax
rate at 52 percent in the OECD.
Reducing the labor tax wedge,
especially the highest marginal
tax rate would help expand the
labor supply and provide
incentives for new hires.

Unifying VAT. The standard
and the reduced VAT rates are
21 percent 6 percent respectively, with the reduced VAT rate applying to items such as
foodstuffs, books, and pharmaceuticals. VAT reforms should aim to unify the tax system
by reducing exemptions and moving to a single standard rate.

Authorities’
Views

Authorities agreed on a neutral fiscal stance as the appropriate medium-term
target to anchor fiscal sustainability. Recent measures to reduce health care spending
have helped to contain longer-term expenditure pressures. On shifting to a mediumterm budget framework, the authorities noted that with the exit from the EDP, they are
now returning to a trend-based fiscal framework that has performed well under normal
times. They saw the framework as sufficiently flexible to shocks and an effective
instrument to coordinate expenditures across ministries. On automatic stabilizers, they
saw benefits to keeping more spending within the ceiling to enhance predictability and
maintain spending efficiency but noted that when needed, items such as unemployment
insurance can be moved outside the ceiling. To better anchor expectations, they
highlighted the lesson of relying on more cautious fiscal projections at the beginning of
budget periods.
On eliminating the asymmetry of tax treatment of debt and equity, the authorities
saw some scope for reform. For example, aligning the tax deductibility of equity and
debt would encourage the buildup of capital and strengthen bank and corporate
balance sheets. The authorities were in favor of simplifying the VAT system by reducing
exemptions and did not rule out unifying the VAT rates. Simplifying the VAT by reducing
exceptions would provide an opportunity to lower the tax burden on labor.

Further labor reforms would support employment and SME growth.
Context

The labor market suffers from a high degree of duality. Restrictions against dismissal
under regular contracts are extensive as measured by the OECD. High severance
payments and lengthy trial periods have raised the cost of dismissals and contributed to
the shift towards more flexible temporary and self-employed hires whose share in the
labor force has risen to 10 percent in 2012, from 7 percent in 2001.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Advice

Easing protection for regular workers combined with reductions in the tax wedge
would support employment. To enhance the protection of temporary workers, the
authorities recently reduced the number of extensions of a temporary work contact from
two to one. Reducing the length of trial periods and streamlining notice procedures
would ease employment protection and encourage the hiring of regular workers.

Supporting innovative SMEs would boost productivity
Context

Dutch SMEs were hit hard by the slump in domestic demand. Compared to large
firms, SMEs suffer more from high leverage, weak profitability, and tight credit
conditions after the housing bust. The loan rejection rate for SME was among the
highest in the euro area, reflecting in part their weak financial conditions.
Important insolvency reforms are underway that could support corporate
restructuring, including for SMEs. These reforms aim to prevent abuse, rescue viable
businesses, and modernize insolvency proceedings. Key features include prepackaged
bankruptcies. The bills are expected to enter into force in 2016.

Advice

Improving the quality and sharing of credit information would enhance the
availability of credit for SMEs. This could be achieved by developing a credit bureau
system to collect and share loan exposures, collateral, and payment history. Such a
system could contribute to greater standardization of SME loans and facilitate
securitization and should feature both positive and negative information, as well as
cover nonfinancial and public agencies.
Shifting public support from credit guarantees to equity or quasi-equity initiatives
could foster SME startups and innovation. Developing alternative sources of market
financing, such as securitized loans and mini-bonds, and broadening the range of
eligible collateral such as receivables or inventory could help lessen dependence on
bank financing. Encouraging Dutch pension funds to invest more in domestic alternative
assets, such as venture capital and private equity, could expand the availability of longerterm risk capital.

Authorities’
Views

The authorities saw weak domestic demand as the main reason for SME difficulties.
They saw few financing constraints, noting that Dutch banks had sufficient capital buffers
but saw little demand for funds. A number of policies have been put in to support SME
financing, such as credit guarantees, but demand for these schemes has been low. A
smaller portion has been allocated for equity support for innovative SMEs.
The authorities agreed on the need for broader sharing of credit information and
were considering to what extent this should be undertaken by the public sector.
Efforts to improve the quality and coverage of credit information were underway under
the ECB directive to introduce granular credit registries. While there were no legal

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

impediments to creating a public credit registry, concerns over data privacy remains.
Creating a public centralized registry also risks crowding out private firms already in this
field. Companies also raised concerns that a credit registry could be used as a “blacklist”
to deny credit, rather than as an instrument for credit scoring.
The authorities broadly agreed with the need to develop alternative sources of
financing for SMEs but saw it as a medium-term objective. SMEs need more equity
but this should come without explicit public support. Securitization of SME credits was
difficult due to heterogeneity of loans and currently unfavorable capital treatment.
Expanding the range of collateral for secured lending faced challenges in the proper
valuation. In the near term, the authorities highlighted the recently created National
Investment Institute—a private initiative aimed at matching investors with viable
projects—as providing support to innovative startups.

STAFF APPRAISAL
12.
The recovery continues but remains sluggish. After contracting for two consecutive years,
the economy has entered a tepid, export-led recovery with consumption still declining as indebted
households continue to save. Deleveraging pressures are expected to keep growth low at 0.8
percent this year before rising gradually to 1.2 percent in 2015. Investment growth is projected to
remain sluggish due to weak domestic demand and reduced euro area growth.
13.
Progress in household deleveraging has been slow. Household leverage remains high,
with debt to income ratios still around 300 percent, almost double the levels in the early 2000s. The
loss of housing wealth has been significant at about 60 percent of GDP, concentrated mainly among
younger cohorts with nearly two-thirds of mortgages underwater.
14.
After several years of consolidation, the fiscal stance is set to turn neutral in 2014.
Expenditure cuts and increased revenues allowed for an exit from EDP in June. In 2014-15, the fiscal
impulse is expected to be around zero, as the government has shifted to targeting a structural
balance in line with their medium-term framework. Over the medium term, the headline deficit is
expected to narrow further and the general government debt to decline.
15.
The risks to the outlook are on the downside. The Netherlands is exposed to weakness in
the euro area which accounts for 60 percent of Dutch exports. An escalation of the Russia-Ukraine
crisis that leads to more sanctions or higher fuel prices would also negatively affect growth, mostly
through trade and financial linkages with Germany. Combined with a decline in house prices, this
would further weaken household balance sheets and spending. Over the medium term, low inflation
would exacerbate real household debt burdens and increase the risk of disorderly deleveraging.

Box 4. Financing Small and Medium Enterprises in the Netherlands
Dutch SMEs were hit hard by the housing price collapse which reduced the value of their collateral.
Developing a credit bureau system with sharing of positive and negative credit information could reduce
banks’ reliance on secured lending as well as expand the availability and lower the cost of credit.
Dutch SMEs are concentrated in the services and trade sectors. Almost half of SME employment
and value added in 2013 was from the services, and
another quarter from trade. More than 90 percent of
firms employ less than 10 employees. Only eight
percent of Dutch SMEs are exporters.
Weak domestic demand has worsened financial
position of Dutch SMEs, especially at the tail end of
the distribution. Around half of the firms had falling

which reduced significantly the value of their collateral and the availability of credit.
Underwriting SME loans is costly for Dutch banks. Dutch banks typically rely on real estate collateral
for SME lending given the high fixed costs relative to the size of loans and lack of equity and credit
information, including through a centralized registry. This has led to a rationing of credit for those
firms with high quality collateral and away from riskier startups, even at higher interest rates.
Addressing the information asymmetry in SME lending by facilitating the sharing of credit information
should lower borrowing costs and expand the availability of credit, including to riskier borrowers.
A comprehensive credit bureau system that collects and shares both positive and negative
information could address this lending risk gap. Positive information on payment history, incomes,
loan exposures, and assets can complement negative information on defaults in developing credit
scoring models that relate the probability of default to firm characteristics. Cross-country evidence
suggests that after the introduction of a credit bureau, firm access to finance increases, interest rates
drop, maturity lengthens, and the share of working capital financed by banks increases.

position. In particular, the policy measures regarding mortgages have stabilized expectations and
supported a gradual pickup in housing prices and transactions. These and other reforms to
strengthen the financial system and assist SMEs have helped boost confidence, increase policy
certainty, and support the nascent recovery.
17.
Addressing the private debt overhang is key to securing a robust recovery. Faster
progress in repairing household balance sheets would support a more robust and sustained
recovery and reduce intergenerational imbalances. Encouraging more reprofiling of underwater
mortgages and reducing the stigma of personal bankruptcy could help address the problem of
heavily indebted borrowers. Facilitating transfers between generations could also support
deleveraging while stimulating spending.
18.
Dutch banks continue to face pressures from the weak economy and their own need to
deleverage. Stronger capital and liquidity buffers would ensure that banks have the capacity to
support the recovery and the adjustment of household’s balance sheet. Further strengthening of the
framework for risk management and resolution are also needed. More ambitious medium-term
targets for reducing LTV ratios and mortgage deductibility would reduce housing risks.
19.
The Dutch housing market suffers from numerous distortions that have contributed to
the debt overhang. Deregulating the private rental market would ease pressures on home
ownership. The supply of land for residential construction should be made more elastic. Reforms to
the government-owned financial institutions (GFIs) are needed to reduce contingent liabilities.
20.
Supportive macro-fiscal and structural policies are needed to safeguard the recovery.
To support growth during deleveraging, fiscal policy should focus on structural targets. A shift to a
medium-term budget framework would strengthen predictability and responsiveness of fiscal policy
to shocks. The upcoming tax reform should reduce the debt bias and distortions in the VAT
exemptions. Structural reforms to boost potential growth would support activity during the
adjustment period.
21.
Improving the quality and sharing of credit information would enhance the availability
of credit for SMEs. This could be achieved by developing a credit bureau system to collect and
share loan exposures, collateral, and payment history. Such a system could contribute to greater
standardization of SME loans and facilitate securitization and should feature both positive and
negative information, as well as cover nonfinancial and public agencies.
22.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held in the usual 12-month
cycle.

Annex I. Progress Against IMF Recommendations
The authorities have taken on board several policy recommendation made by the Fund in
previous Article IV consultations. They have implemented tighter macro prudential measures,
differentiated rents in the social housing sector by income, and passed structural reforms to
improve the functioning of the labor market.
Housing and macro prudential policies
The Fund recommended that after the stabilization of the housing market, consideration be
given to reduce maximum LTVs below the current target of 100 percent. While there is
sufficient time to implement further reductions after 2018, the authorities have not committed
to a course of action after 2018. In line with the Fund advice, the authorities have implemented
measures to increase the supply of land for new housing developments by enhancing property
tax revenue sharing with the municipalities. Increases in social housing rents for higher income
dwellers are also in line with past Fund advice to better target social housing support to lower
income individuals. However, measures to gradually phase in caps to the size of MID in
nominal terms and target MID to lower-income citizens have not been announced.
Financial sector issues
In line with the Fund advice, banks have increased their capital base, although the leverage
ratio remains comparatively high and more capital is needed to reach their Basel III targets.
After a sharp reduction after the global financial crisis, foreign claims of Dutch banks have
been broadly unchanged since mid-2012.
Fiscal issues
The 2013 Article IV report recommended a more relaxed fiscal stance than the one adopted by
the authorities. More broadly, the Fund recommended that fiscal consolidation focus on
structural targets and allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully. The authorities instead
attached greater importance to lowering the headline deficit below the SGP limit of 3 percent
of GDP.
Structural reforms
The authorities have proposed several structural reforms to increase potential growth that are
in line with past Fund advice. These include the labor market where the authorities are working
to bring the employment conditions of the self employed closer to those of regular
employees. On research and development, the Netherlands is set to reach its target of R&D
spending of 2.5 percent by 2020.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt is expected to remain sustainable supported by recent fiscal consolidation and
favorable growth. Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to peak at
70 percent of GDP in 2015 and decline steadily onwards to close to 66 percent by 2019. A
negative growth shock represents the largest risk to the debt outlook, and could increase the debt
by about 8 percent of GDP in 2016. In all stress test scenarios, the debt remains on the
downward trajectory over the medium term.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is projected to reach [0.8] percent in 2014, driven
mostly by expanding exports. Inflation is expected to be low in 2014-15 at between 0.5 and 0.7
percent and is projected to remain below 2 percent over the forecast horizon, reflecting weak
domestic demand. Growth will average [1.3] percent over the medium term. The output gap
will narrow but not close completely by 2019. The Netherlands’ level of government debt,
which exceeds 60 percent of GDP, calls for using the higher scrutiny framework. Gross
financing needs are projected to be between 10-13 percent of GDP in the medium term.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The Staff’s forecasts of the relevant macroeconomic
variables are broadly within the 27-75 interquartile range, indicating that there are few forecast
outliers that could bias the analysis. The median forecast for real GDP growth during
2005−2013 has been somewhat optimistic, with the median forecast error of -0.45 percent.
The primary balance forecast has been very precise, with the median error of 0.05. Inflation
(GDP deflator) forecasts have been slightly on the downside, with the median forecast error of
0.16.
Baseline scenario and stress tests. Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decrease to 66 percent by 2019, after peaking at 70 percent of GDP in 2015.
Under all macro-fiscal stress tests, the debt-to-GDP ratio first increases in response to the
shocks and afterwards declines over the medium term. The strongest shocks to the baseline
are to real GDP growth, after which debt-to-GDP ratio initially increases to 78 percent in 2016
and declines thereafter, and the primary balance shock, which elevates the debt to GDP ratio
to 73 percent in 2016. Gross financing needs remain at or below 20 percent of GDP, with the
exception of the contingent liability shock, which temporarily increases the financing needs
above 30 percent of GDP.
The Main Shocks to the Baseline
Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation over 2015-16, that is, 2.4 percentage points below the baseline scenario. The
assumed decline in growth also lowers inflation by 0.6 percentage points over the same
period.
Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a dual shock of lower
revenues and rise in interest rate, leading to a 1.7 percent deterioration in primary balance
over 2015-16. This shock increases the debt to GDP ratio to 73 percent in 2016.
38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Contingent liability shock. This scenario assumes a shock stemming from an increase in the
need to support the banking system due to a large shock that wipes out 10 percent of the
loans to the private sector. The shock reduces the primary balance in 2015 by approximately
20 percentage points, leading to a large but temporary increase in gross financing needs and a
large increase in the gross public debt to GDP ratio. The magnitude of this shock is large due
to the large size of the Dutch banking system; however, this shock represents a tail risk event.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds (bp).
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = effective nominal interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Text Table 1. Recent Policies Targeting the Owner-Occupied Housing Sector
Changes to the tax system
■ Since January 2013, only interest on fully amortizing mortgages is tax deductibile.
Mortgages outstanding as of January 1, 2013 are unaffected.
■ Transfer tax on purchase of existing homes was reduced from 6 to 2 percent.
■ Interest paid on outstanding debt remaining after a house sale can be deducted
for up to 10 years.
■ As a temporary measure until end-2014, mortgage debt can be reduced through a
one-time tax-free donation for a maximum €100,000.
Mortgage Code of conduct
■ LTV was capped to 106 percent (104 + 2 percent transaction tax) in January 2013. It
will fall further by 1 percent per year until it reaches 100 percent, with possible
further reduction after 2018. Interest-only mortgages are capped at 50 percent LTV.
■ Prepayment on mortgages with 10 years or less of remaining maturity is possible
without penalty.
NHG mortgage guarantee
■ The maximum purchase threshold for NHG guarantee was gradually reduced
back to its pre-crisis €265,000 level in July 2014. It will further decline to €225,000 in
2016, then will adjust to the average house price.
■ In parallel, the NHG premium has increased from 0.7 percent to 1.0 percent. The
fee remains tax-deductible, and lowers mortgage rates by 40-50 bps.
Loan portfolio market
■ Creation of a National Mortgage Institution (NHI) in 2014 to assist banks in
securitizing mortgage loans through a state-supported credit guarantee.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
National accounts
The Netherlands adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in March 2014. The
transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA 95) entailed a revision of national accounts data. New data
sources have been incorporated in the new estimates. As a result of these changes, the GDP level
in 2010 has been revised 7.6 percent upward (only 3 percent because of the ESA 2010). Historical
data series are available from 2001.
Government Finance Statistics
Government finance statistics reported to Eurostat and the Fund are compiled using the ESA 95
methodology and are converted to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 format.
Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics data will be based on ESA 2010
methodology which is likely to include revisions of the general government deficit and debt
levels from 1995 onwards. Revised ESA based data series will be published in October 2014.
External Sector Statistics
The DNB compiles the balance of payments in close cooperation with the CBS. An agreement
between the CBS and the DNB was formally ratified in 2006 to further strengthen the decadeslong cooperation between the two institutions. Balance of payments and international
investment position (IIP) statistics are compiled according to the Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition (BPM5) and the legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat. The Data Template on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly and quarterly external
debt data are reported to the World Bank for redissemination in the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
(QEDS) database.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics
are based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and
reporting monetary data.
Financial Soundness Indicators
The Netherlands participates in the financial soundness indicators (FSIs) project. Quarterly data
for most of the 40 FSIs are posted on the FSI website for the period 2008:Q1 to 2012:Q4.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Data ROSC is available.
Dissemination Standard since June 11, 1996.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Netherlands

On December 3, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Netherlands.
The Dutch economy continues to improve, supported by exports, rising house prices, and
improving sentiment. Exports are rising on expanding global trade, but consumption remains
sluggish as indebted households continue to save. The external current account surplus now
exceeds 10 percent of GDP, led by an improving trade balance. Labor slack and the large
output gap have pushed down core inflation, raising real interest rates. Following a decline of
27 percent in real terms, housing prices have gradually increased this year, halting the decline
in household wealth. Household leverage, however, remains high, concentrated mainly
among younger cohorts.
On this basis, growth is expected to reach 0.8 percent this year before rising gradually to
1.2 percent in 2015, supported by rising exports and a modest recovery in housing prices.
Investment is projected to remain subdued due to weak domestic demand. The risks to the
outlook are on the downside. Near term risks stem from the euro area weakness and
geopolitical spillovers, while medium-term growth prospects are overshadowed by the large
household debt. Lower energy prices or a faster pickup in housing prices could lift growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the continued economic recovery and the pickup in exports
and house prices. Directors noted nevertheless that consumption is still sluggish, held down

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

by high household indebtedness and weak incomes, while inflation is still low. In light of
these developments and the elevated current account surplus, accommodative
macroeconomic policies would be important to boost domestic demand and growth, while
also facilitating external rebalancing. Directors called on the authorities to build on recent
progress to ensure orderly deleveraging of households, reform the tax and pension systems,
and advance broader structural reforms to improve the housing and labor markets,
productivity, and potential growth.
Directors emphasized that further repair of household balance sheets is needed to sustain a
more robust recovery. They recommended steps to assist the heavily indebted young
borrowers, including by facilitating a reprofiling of underwater mortgages, out-of-court debt
workouts, and intergenerational transfers to pay down mortgage debt. Directors noted that
reducing pension contributions for younger generations could also be considered as part of a
broader reform, while safeguarding the soundness of the pension system.
Directors considered it important that banks have strong capital and liquidity buffers to
underpin the recovery. They looked forward to the completion of national arrangements for
resolution and backstopping in support of euro area institutional reforms for the banking
sector. Directors also saw merit in setting ambitious medium-term targets for further
reducing the maximum loan-to-value ratios and mortgage interest deductibility, while
carefully taking into account the stability and broader developments in the economy.
Directors welcomed the government’s comprehensive reform of the housing market to
remove remaining distortions and restore confidence. They supported steps to deregulate the
private rental market and scale back public support for the social housing sector. Continued
reforms to the social housing corporations are needed to further reduce distortions in the
rental market.
Directors broadly supported a neutral fiscal position and a focus on structural targets. They
agreed that maintaining a structural balance should remain the medium-term goal, although a
few saw scope for a more expansionary stance to prop up growth in the near term. Directors
noted that more frequently updated trend forecasts in the context of the Netherlands’
medium-term budget framework would help strengthen predictability and responsiveness of
fiscal policy to shocks. A number of Directors also supported the authorities’ commitment to
maintain the fiscal rules under the Stability and Growth Pact. Directors welcomed the
planned reform of the tax system, noting that consideration could be given to options to
promote equity financing, reduce the labor tax wedge, and simplify the value-added tax.
Directors highlighted the role of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in promoting
employment and growth. They called for continued efforts to enhance the availability of
credit for SMEs, including by improving the quality and sharing of credit information and
developing alternative financing sources.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director and Jeske De Lint, Advisor to the
Executive Director for Kingdom of the Netherlands - Netherlands
December 3, 2014
We thank staff for the report which provides useful insights into important issues of the
Dutch economy, with a special focus on household debt. While we recognise that there are
significant risks stemming from the international environment, we are more positive than
staff regarding the fundamentals of the Dutch economy. The medium-term outlook for the
economy is supported by the reform agenda the government is currently implementing.
Although fragile, the Dutch economy is recovering slowly. Currently growth is mostly
driven by exports, but investments and consumption are on the increase and in 2015 domestic
demand will contribute substantially to GDP growth. The unemployment rate is declining
faster than expected, while employment is on the rise. Public finances have improved
significantly. The housing market is showing clear signs of recovery, both in prices and in
transactions. The positive outcome for the Dutch banks in the ECB’s comprehensive
assessment confirms the stronger capital base of banks.
The government is implementing an ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda.
Important and politically very contentious issues were tackled in the housing market, the
labour market and the health care sector. The state pension age will be increased more
rapidly which results in a retirement age of 66 in 2018 and 67 in 2021. Thereafter, the state
pension age will be linked to life expectancy. The reform package includes both short-term
measures, with an aim to compensate for the negative impacts of the crisis, and reforms
designed to make institutions and frameworks fit for the future. Meanwhile, the government
is planning further reforms. Discussions on a comprehensive tax reform are scheduled for
next year. Currently the government and social partners are heavily engaged in an open
dialogue on the future of the pension system. In designing the measures, budget implications,
the impact on long-term growth and redistribution effects are taken into account to make sure
the overall package is well-balanced and sustainable.
On staff’s assessment
We recognise that Dutch households face relatively large mortgage debts resulting in
negative net equity for a large number of households, but the term ‘debt overhang’
might be a bit too strong. Dutch households have substantial assets (e.g. pensions and
saving accounts linked to mortgages) which creates an overall positive net wealth at the
macro level. Moreover, the effect of underwater mortgages on consumption and economic
growth remains uncertain. Staff suggests that growth will fall to 1.5% annually compared to
2.3% annually in the period 2000-2007 because of household debt overhang, an assumption
which does not seem well underpinned. There is uncertainty to what extent households with

2
underwater mortgages are increasing their savings in order to pay down mortgages or
increase buffers. There are several factors at play that may mitigate the effect on
consumption, such as saving accounts linked to mortgages (which are sizeable but do not
appear in headline figures), backing of more than half of the underwater mortgages by the
National Mortgage Guarantee Scheme (NHG) and relatively high incomes and future earning
potential of the households affected. The delinquency is low (suggesting that immediate
liquidity problems are small) and by postponing to move to a larger house, households
deleverage without reducing non-housing consumption. More in general, an increase in
disposable income is the key driver for consumption growth. Disposable income is expected
to rise by 2% in 2014 and 1% in 2015. This trend will likely compensate for the potentially
negative impact on overall consumption of deleveraging by households.
The government has undertaken several measures to support households that face
negative net equity due to lower housing prices. For instance, mortgage interest
deductibility (MID) remains possible for residual debt. Also, residual debt can be financed
under the NHG insurance scheme, to reduce the risks for indebted borrowers. Furthermore,
the temporary exemption from the gift tax facilitates intergenerational transfers. The extent to
which underwater mortgages remain problematic, will strongly depend on the development
of the housing market. If, for instance, nominal house prices were to rise by 2 percent
annually as from 2014, prices would return to the pre-crisis level in ten years time. Three
quarters of the underwater mortgages would be ’above water’. Recent developments are
encouraging in this regard.
The government has enacted a comprehensive reform of the housing market,
encompassing the owner-occupied and rental sectors. These measures have restored the
necessary confidence in and stability of the housing market and prevent households from
taking up excessive debt in the future. The government strikes a balance between the
implementation of reforms on the one hand and safeguarding the stability of the housing
market and income position of households on the other hand.
We agree with staff that gradually reducing LTV ratios is important, but further
reduction of the LTV ratio below 100 percent, as suggested by staff, will depend on
developments on the housing market and requires a careful cost and benefit analysis.
Financial stability would benefit from conservative LTV ratios. New proposals in this
direction are, however, conditional on a robust recovery of the housing market and should
carefully taking into account the broader development of the housing sector, including the
situation on the private rental market. Timing is critical, since further reduction of the LTV
ratios may hamper recovery of the housing market and will also require substantial additional
savings, mainly from younger households, putting a drag on consumption. The phasing in of
the new mortgage interest deductibility (MID) regime for new mortgages will contribute to
lowering LTV ratios after 2018. Discussions on housing related macro prudential measures

3
will continue in the Financial Stability Committee (FSC) in the coming months.
A scale back of public support of social housing corporations (SHCs) through
guarantees to core social tasks, as advised by staff, is already being implemented.
Legislation is being prepared that requires SHCs to separate their services of general
economic interest (SGEI) from their non-SGEI activities. Whilst reforms are implemented,
lower income groups are supported by targeted rent subsidies. Moreover, social housing
corporations’ tasks extend under a broader social mandate touching on general living
conditions in neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the government focuses on the development of
the private rental sector, as expansion of this sector will contribute to a more balanced
housing market.
Any reform in the pension system should not be done in isolation but be part of a
broader overhaul of the framework by taking into account short and long-term
implications, including transition costs. Two things are important to consider in relation to
the staff’s advice to make accrual rates actuarially fair. First, a reduction in the contributions
for the younger generation risks increasing the relative cost of older employees, which can
have severe and unintended implications when at the same time the retirement age is lifted.
Second, a transition to actuarially fair accrual rates has to take into account the complex issue
of intergenerational fairness. For this reason, the government is facilitating a comprehensive
and open dialogue on the sustainability of the pension system. This dialogue focuses on
aspects related to solidarity, freedom of choice, collectivism and responsibilities in the fully
funded part of the pension system. The government will present its vision on the future of
the pension system before summer 2015. Regarding staff’s advice to reduce procylicality in
the pension system, it should be noted that the new financial assessment framework (FTK),
which enters into force next year, will result in more stable premiums as well as pay-outs.
As regards the budget, the government remains fully committed to the European
budgetary rules as laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. Now that the
development of Dutch public finances looks favourable for 2015 and the EMU balance
gradually moves away from the -3 percent benchmark, there is more room for trend-based
fiscal policy, the fiscal policy framework successfully used in the Netherlands since 1994.
With regard to staff’s remarks in Annex I on progress on fiscal issues against IMF
recommendations, the sentence on the SGP limit of 3 percent could be misread. Any
suggestion that staff is advising against meeting the European budgetary objectives should be
avoided.
The loan rejection rate for SMEs is relatively high in the Netherlands because the few
enterprises that request financing are mainly the weaker micro firms facing high risks.
The main reason for lack of SME financing is because of weak demand and not so much
because of supply constraints. We agree that improvements in sharing of positive credit

4
information could be beneficial to the process of SME lending, while still respecting privacy.
Finally, we note that a new and somewhat different format was used for this article IV
consultation. The report has a narrow focus on some specific issues and presents the
authorities’ views issue by issue. Although, as said, we welcome the report as it provides the
authorities with useful input on complex and relevant matters and we had valuable
discussions during the mission, for the next article IV we would appreciate a return to the
more traditional, holistic approach covering all the key macroeconomic and financial issues.
