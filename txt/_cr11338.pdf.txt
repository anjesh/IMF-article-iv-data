THE BAHAMAS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 20, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is beginning to recover. Real GDP is projected to grow at about
2 percent in 2011, owing to an improvement in tourism and the start of large
investment projects. Government revenue remains low. Substantial projected foreign
direct investment (FDI)-related imports and higher oil prices will widen the external
current account, but the reserves position will remain reasonably strong.
Policy challenges. The key policy priority is implementing a sustained fiscal
consolidation. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 69 percent by end
FY 2015/16, from 44 percent in FY 2008/09.


Fiscal consolidation. The deficit of the central government is projected to average
about 4¼ percent of GDP during FY 2011/12–2015/16. Reforms to the tax system
and in public finance management, containing expenditures, and strengthening of
the financial position and transparency of public enterprises, are necessary to
reverse the deterioration of the fiscal position.



Enhancing medium-term growth prospects. Sustaining high employment will
require removing key impediments to growth. Efforts should focus on improving
the business environment, enhancing the provision of government services,
fostering linkages across sectors and among islands, and encouraging innovations
in downstream value-added activities.



Strengthening regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Although bankingsector capital adequacy ratios remain high, the elevated level of non-performing
loans and relatively limited provisioning calls for strong monitoring. The
establishment of the proposed credit bureau, that will help assess creditworthiness, as well as reforms to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks for the non-banking system, including by bringing credit unions under
the supervision of the central bank, are welcome.

THE BAHAMAS

BACKGROUND
1.
The diversity of economic
characteristics and the large number of
islands that comprise The Bahamas presents
unusual challenges for providing government
services and for formulating development
strategies. The archipelago has about 30
inhabited islands. The country’s economy has
two main drivers, tourism and financial
services, with the tourism product
differentiated across the islands from large
resorts to small boutique-type properties.
Financial services span both offshore and
onshore activity: activity in the offshore center
is linked with onshore financial services;1 the
onshore financial system has 276 banks and
trust companies (eight commercial banks, with
a strong presence of Canadian banks).
2.
The Bahamas enjoys a stable
democracy. Elections must be scheduled by
May 2012. The Free National Movement
(FNM), currently in power, and the Progressive
Liberal Party (PLP) are expected to run
campaigns, focused on the economy, jobs, and
stopping crime. Doubt about the strength of
the U.S. recovery will exacerbate political
uncertainty in the run-up to the elections.
3.
Despite slow growth since the
beginning of the decade, the country was
well positioned at the beginning of the
crisis. With one of the highest per-capita
income levels in the Caribbean and a relatively
1

Offshore operations in The Bahamas are mostly
conducted through International Business Corporations
(IBCs)—non-financial legally established entities
permitted to carry out business outside The Bahamas.
These vehicles operate under the IBC Act, 2000. IBCs
support employment in financial (banking and trust
operations) and corporate service providers, the securities
industry, and the legal and accounting professions; and
contribute to government revenues through fees for
incorporation and annual registrations.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

low public debt-to-GDP ratio for the region,2
the Bahamas has had a strong sovereign credit
rating, reaffirmed in May 2011 by Standard
and Poor’s as BBB+ with a stable outlook.3
4.
The Bahamas was strongly hit by the
crisis. Tourism collapsed following the
recession in the United States (the main source
of tourists). As a result, GDP shrank by about
1½ percent in 2008 and 5½ percent in 2009.
To mitigate the impact of the contraction, the
authorities strengthened the social safety net
with temporary unemployment programs and
increased public investment. At the same time,
the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial
Group failed in January 2009, and the
conglomerate’s local insurance company,
CLICO-Bahamas, was put under judicial
management. Difficulties in liquidating CLICO’s
assets hindered a resolution, leading the
authorities to issue government guarantees to
facilitate the sale of the traditional lifeinsurance policies.
5.
In concluding the 2010 Article IV
Consultation, Executive Directors
commended the Bahamian authorities for
their commitment to medium-term fiscal
adjustment. Directors welcomed the revenue
and spending measures in the budget for
FY 2010/11 (July to June), but noted that
broader reforms to the tax system and public
finance management were needed over the
medium term to improve the fiscal position.
They also encouraged the authorities to build
up foreign reserves to support the
longstanding exchange peg to the U.S. dollar
and commended the authorities for their
efforts to strengthen the financial system.

2

As of end-2007, total public sector debt was about
40 percent of GDP, mostly domestic.
3

In August, Moody’s affirmed The Bahamas’ A3 bond
rating, but revised the outlook from stable to negative.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
After having been severely impacted
by the global financial crisis, the Bahamian
economy began a tepid recovery in 2010.

The external current account deficit
remained broadly stable at 11½ percent
of GDP. Exports rebounded, and growth of
non-oil imports remained subdued by
weak economic activity. However, rising
FDI and other private capital inflows
boosted reserves to US$860 million at
end-2010 (about 2½ months of next year’s
imports of goods and services).



Staff estimates that the deficit of the
central government deteriorated in
FY 2010/11. Total revenues increased
owing to sizeable one-off transactions,
related to stamp taxes on the signing of
the Baha Mar project (a $3.5 billion resort
complex) and the transfer of ownership of
the Bahamas Oil Refining Company
(1½ percent of GDP). Excluding the large
one-off transactions, revenues increased
by about ½ percent of GDP. Trade and
property taxes continued to underperform.
Expenditure increased more than

Real GDP grew by about one percent.
The rebound was led by the trade,
hospitality, transport, and governments
services sectors, while the construction and
offshore financial services sectors
continued to contract.

Inflation remained subdued at
1½ percent (y-o-y). Food prices declined
by over 1 percent. In contrast, fuel and
transportation prices rose by about
2½ percent, but had a lower impact on
inflation than in other Caribbean countries,
because of their relatively lower share in
the CPI basket.

Public debt continued to rise. At end2010, central government debt was
48 percent of GDP, up from about 34
percent of GDP two years earlier, while
total public debt reached almost
62 percent of GDP.5 Domestic debt
accounts for more than 80 percent of
public debt. The debt is mostly in variable
rate instruments and held mainly by
commercial banks, public corporations,
and pension funds, which (given capital
controls) are mandated to invest primarily
in domestic securities.

High NPLs are a source of concern.
Banks have maintained high overall
capital-adequacy ratios (well above the
minimum requirement of 17 percent)
(Figure 5). Banks’ loan portfolio, however,
continued to show signs of weakness, as
the severe economic downturn pushed up
the non-performing loans-to-total loans
ratio over 10 percent – above regional
peers. In addition, the level of provisioning
to NPLs appears to be below peers.

Expenditure increases included an employment program
and pension liabilities assumed by the government
following its partial divestment from the
telecommunications company.

Total public debt includes all debt from non-financial
public corporations (guaranteed and non-guaranteed).

The near-term outlook is for
stronger growth, but a weaker fiscal and



6

Real GDP is projected to grow at about
2 percent in 2011, driven by a rebound in
tourism and construction activity. Tourist
arrivals in general, and cruise ship arrivals
in particular, are increasing, with stopover
arrivals projected to approach the level of
2008 by year-end, although yielding lower
average revenues. In addition to doubledigit growth in the cruise sector, there has
been a strong rebound in the key market
of advance group reservations. Inflation is
projected to rise to about 2½ percent, in
line with higher global food and fuel
prices, while the external current account
deficit is expected to widen, driven by
higher oil imports and a pick-up in FDIfinanced construction. The overall balance
of payments, however, is projected to
record a surplus of about US$94 million
owing to strong FDI and private capital
inflows.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



The fiscal accounts will remain under
pressure. The budget for FY 2011/12
contemplates measures aimed at
strengthening revenue performance,
including an effort to centralize the
collection of taxes (on business, property,
stamp, hotel occupancy, and casino).
However, the budget increases spending
on new government initiatives (e.g., the
introduction of e-government), extends tax
holidays, and lifts the freeze on public
wages that was imposed in last year’s
budget. Staff estimates that these plans
would increase the central government
deficit to about 5 percent of GDP by endJune 2012 and raise central government
debt to about 50 percent of GDP.
Additional risks to the fiscal outlook stem
from the continued weak performance of
non-financial public corporations—and the
need for more transparency in this area—
and contingent liabilities from the failed
insurance company CLICO.

THE BAHAMAS





The scope for supportive monetary
policy will remain limited. In June 2011,
against a background of subdued price
pressures and a stronger reserves position,
the central bank lowered the discount rate
to 4½ percent (from 5¼ percent).
Although this action, the first rate change
in six years, was aimed at supporting the
incipient recovery its effects on credit
demand and activity are likely to be weak.
The increase in non-performing loans is
expected to abate due to stronger
activity. Stress tests conducted by the
authorities suggest resiliency of the
banking system.

8.
The medium-term outlook is mixed.
Output growth is expected to rise to
2½-3 percent in 2012–13, driven by tourism
and new FDI projects. Of these projects, the
most important is Baha Mar, which is likely to
have a significant impact on the economy,
particularly during the peak of construction
(2012–13).6 Growth would remain in that range
thereafter, with upside potential if key projects
under study materialize. Strengthened tourism
receipts would help narrow the external
current account deficit to about 13 percent of
GDP by end-2016, while higher fiscal revenues
would help lower the primary deficit. The
central government deficits, however, would
remain at almost 4½ percent of GDP per year
during the period, raising the central
government debt-to-GDP ratio to close to

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

56 percent, and overall public debt to about
69 percent by 2016.
9.
The outlook is subject to downside
risks. While a faster rebound in tourism
activity or the start of large-scale hotel
investments would improve the outlook, risks
appear at this stage tilted to the downside. A
slower-than-expected recovery of output and
employment in the United States could
dampen the pickup in economic activity and
weaken the fiscal and external positions.
External accounts are also highly sensitive to
increases in the international prices of food
and fuel. Given the exposure to the real estate
sector, some commercial banks could see
excess collateral diminish and vulnerability
increase if the recovery stalls. Finally,
vulnerability to hurricanes (Hurricane Irene hit
The Bahamas in August, although the impact
appears to have been relatively small)
highlights the potential fiscal costs of natural
disasters.
10.
Delays in implementing reforms (in
particular revenue reforms, to curb the
debt) could jeopardize a sustained recovery.
The large borrowing necessary to improve the
physical and social infrastructure constitutes a
source of vulnerability. A delay in reversing the
rising debt trajectory could raise financing
costs.

6

During the construction period, the project operators
expect the work force will increase by up to 4,400
persons, and US$750-900 million could be injected into
the economy, triggering additional second-round
economic activity. Project documents also estimate the
complex will attract 400,000 additional stay-over arrivals
and generate direct tax revenues of about US$60 million
(¾ percent of 2011 GDP) per year.

THE BAHAMAS

Box 1. Expanding Tourism Potential in The Bahamas: Challenges and Strategy
The Bahamas is an island archipelago of 700 islands
and about 2000 cays, with a total land mass of about
14,000 square km scattered over almost 260,000 square
km of territorial waters. Starting at just 80 km off
Florida’s eastern coast, The Bahamas has leveraged its
proximity to the United States and natural beauty in its
marketing strategies. With 70 percent of its population
of 350,000 people living in New Providence, the scope
for expansion of a variety of tourism products to the
sparsely populated Family Islands is vast.
Forms of Tourism
The main industries of The Bahamas are tourism,
financial services, light manufacturing, and transshipment operations, the latter located mainly on
Grand Bahama. New Providence accounts for 55–60
percent of the country’s tourist activity, and follows the
large seaside resorts model (the most prominent of
which is the Atlantis Resort). In the Family Islands, the
preferred model is small boutique hotels and luxurious
private villas, catering to wealthy tourists and secondhome owners from the United States and Canada.
Market Diversification
Given the seasonality of the tourism industry, capacity
utilization on the islands ranges from near 100 percent
during the peak winter season to less than 30 percent
during late summer. Promotion campaigns strive to
attract tourists during the low season. The authorities,
in partnership with large private hotel owners, have
embarked on a strategic plan to diversify and increase
tourist arrivals from Latin America, especially Brazil and
Argentina. As part of this strategy, the authorities have
succeeded in attracting daily flights from Panama City,
which acts as a hub for a Latin American air carrier.
With demand during the winter season in the Southern
Hemisphere coinciding with the period of low
utilization of hotel capacity in The Bahamas, increasing
the arrivals of South American tourists could mitigate
the cyclical pattern of tourism revenue.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Developing the Family Islands
The main challenge to developing tourism in the Family
Islands of The Bahamas is the high per capita cost of
providing basic infrastructure, utilities, and social
services, including health facilities. Overcoming these
challenges will require creative and cost-effective
solutions. In health infrastructure, for example, one
solution proposed is the setting up of satellite health
units on strategic locations, combined with efficient
emergency travel systems. Another challenge is the cost
of providing adequate airlift to the remote islands,
given the relatively small scale of operations. An
envisaged model is for one or two large “magnet”
resorts, capable of attracting jet services from target
markets, combined with a ‘hubbing’ concept (possibly
using smaller aircraft) to feed tourists to the smaller
boutique-hotels in nearby islands. These large resorts
can also be focal points for economies of scale in
setting up desalination or power generation plants, as
well as for encouraging the development of small
enclave industries for the provision of ancillary goods
and services.
Diversification Efforts
Although labor and utility costs are quite high in The
Bahamas, some large outer islands, such as Andros,
have large water and land resources ideal for
developing agriculture. For such activities to develop,
however, it will be important to act rapidly in reducing
costs to doing business in The Bahamas.

THE BAHAMAS

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The Bahamas’ key policy challenge is to ensure sustainability of public finance and raise
real GDP growth on a sustained basis. The authorities noted their commitment to fiscal
consolidation, in particular through revenue mobilization. They also viewed improving
the business environment and strengthening the soundness of the financial system as
important for private-sector-led growth.

A. Consolidation Strategy
11.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment to strengthen fiscal
performance and place the public debt on a
sustainable path. Their strategy comprises
both revenue and expenditure measures, and
an improved debt management.




7

New revenue measures mainly hinge on
improvement in the tax administration.
The authorities explained initiatives
underway to improve tax administration,
including strengthening customs;
consolidating the collection of several
taxes in one institution; and introducing a
new procedure to reduce smuggling of
tobacco products. They also noted the
introduction of a revamped business
license tax.7
Narrowing the scope of tax
expenditures and transfers is another
element. The authorities are introducing
time limits and transition arrangements for
fiscal incentives provided under the
Industries Encouragement Act. In addition,
they are seeking to reduce transfers to
public corporations, including by
encouraging private-public-partnership
arrangements.

These initiatives and measures complement those
adopted in the previous fiscal year, which included
improved tax administration and higher tax rates on
vehicles, air departure, and hotel rooms.



Improving debt management. The
authorities are giving priority to greater
coordination of debt management at the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.

12.
Staff welcomed the authorities’
medium-term strategy, but noted this
would not be sufficient. In particular, staff
welcomed the consolidation of tax collection
in one unit, and the plan to stabilize incentives.
13.
Staff urged the authorities to adopt
more comprehensive policies geared at
placing the government debt-to-GDP ratio
on a declining path over the medium term.
A stronger fiscal effort was needed to create
buffers for future shocks, improve physical and
social infrastructure, and keep borrowing cost
low. Staff also noted that delaying action on
fiscal consolidation, particularly with regard to
revenue reform, might result in additional
external risks and fiscal pressures.
14.
Staff suggested giving priority to
revenue mobilization. It noted that the most
dynamic sectors of the economy generate a
small share of revenue, and that their spells of
growth did not translate proportionately to
higher fiscal revenues. Reforms aimed at
broadening the tax base, for example through
the adoption of a domestic consumption tax,
should therefore be a key priority. Further, staff
noted that the time limits currently applied to
the Industries Encouragement Act could be
extended to the other fiscal incentive regimes.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE BAHAMAS

15.
The authorities agreed that revenue
reform was a key priority. They concurred
that the current revenue structure is inefficient
and inequitable, and noted that they had
sought technical assistance from the IDB to
reform the tax system. They noted, however,
that actions in this area were unlikely under
this legislature.

the contribution of public enterprises to the
overall fiscal stance is a vulnerability that
needs to be addressed. Several public
enterprises are inefficient and require recurrent
government transfers to operate. A strategy to
lower the drag of these enterprises on public
finances (including through divestments) is
urgently needed.

16.
Expenditure restraint is also needed.
Government expenditure is projected to
remain at about 20 percent of GDP over the
medium term. The government’s wage bill
accounts for over 40 percent of revenues, and
is projected to rise following the lifting of the
wage freeze adopted in FY 2010/11; transfers
to public enterprises are high, and interest
costs are rising. Staff highlighted the need to
gradually return the wage bill, as a share of
GDP, to the pre-crisis level, and keep transfers
and other current expenditures under control.

18.
Staff also encouraged the
authorities to continue improving fiscal
transparency. It stressed the need for more
timely and accurate accounts for public
enterprises, and improving the data on intrapublic sector financing, in particular from the
national pension fund. While welcoming the
authorities’ interest in receiving Fund technical
assistance on these areas, staff encouraged a
focus on:


Improving revenue forecasting;

17.
The financial position of public
enterprises must be improved. The financial
position of several public enterprises
(including Bahamas Air, and the electricity and
water and sewerage companies) appears to be
weak, and the lack of timely information on



Preparing consolidated accounts for the
public sector; and



Making public all tax incentives (including
costs, main terms and conditions, and
beneficiaries).

B. Growth Strategy
19.
The government’s strategy to
improve growth performance was
discussed. Near-term growth was likely to
increase owing to the recovery of tourism and
the start-up of large projects.8 The government
strategy comprises:


Growth-enhancing measures. These
include: (i) measures to increase airlift and
expand coverage to the Family Islands, and

Large projects include the development of the Baha Mar
resort, expansion of existing resorts, and continuing the

boost cruise arrivals;9 (ii) an aggressive
program to increase FDI from Canada, the
U.S., Latin America, and China; and (iii)
fostering the development of small- and
medium-size enterprises.


9

Improving the business environment.
Measures to reduce red tape and
streamline administrative procedures
(including by launching the e-government

system) are being adopted.10 At the same
time, a job-readiness program aims to
improve productivity.


Combating crime. The authorities are
providing greater resources to law
enforcement, expanding the courts system,
and strengthening the prosecutorial
process.

20.
Staff welcomed the authorities’
broad-based growth strategy. It noted that

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the emphasis on measures different from fiscal
incentives for boosting growth was a positive
development, since the country’s growth
performance over the last decade suggests
that the fiscal incentives model had not been
effective in promoting sustained growth. Staff
also suggested improving economic
diversification and employment through
innovation in high value-added downstream
tourism products. Staff noted the need for
investment in public utilities to improve
efficiency and provide adequate infrastructure
to support the growth strategy.

C. External Stability and Exchange Rate Policy
21.
There was agreement that the fixed
exchange rate system has served The
Bahamas well. The authorities restated their
commitment to support the peg and continue
building reserves. They explained that their
recent decision to lower the policy rate had
been taken in the context of adequate reserves
(about US$1,075 million or close to three
months of imports) and low inflationary
pressures.
22.
Staff and the authorities agreed that
the exchange rate level remains broadly in
line with medium-term fundamentals
(Figure 3). Estimates from the macrobalance
approach suggest that the projected mediumterm current account deficit for The Bahamas

is close to the estimated current account
“norm”, while regressions suggest that the
current level of the real exchange is broadly in
line with fundamentals.11 These results,
however, are subject to potentially severe
estimation shortcomings and are sensitive to
the assumptions used. In this connection, the
authorities noted that the higher FDI expected
in the coming years would raise the country’s
growth and export potential over the medium
to long term. Given the uncertainties from a
weak global environment, staff noted the
importance of investing in basic infrastructure
and ensuring the efficient delivery of basic
utilities to attract revenue-producing FDI and
enhance the country’s competitiveness.

D. Financial Sector
23.
Capital adequacy ratios are high, but
the weak loan portfolio highlights the need
for intensified supervision. Stress tests
conducted by the authorities suggest that the
system could withstand a further deterioration

in the banks’ loan portfolio without
endangering compliance with capital
requirements. Capital adequacy ratios (CARs)
at end-May 2011 (26 percent, on average),
were well above the regulatory threshold,
while excess liquidity was about 20 percent.

10

The Bahamas ranked 77 of 183 countries in the Doing
Business 2011 Report, down from 68 in 2010. The decline
in ranking reflected lower rankings in all categories with
the exception of ‘Enforcing Contracts”.

11

Key variables used in the exchange rate equations
include the oil balance, the fiscal balance, net foreign
assets, and income growth.

THE BAHAMAS

Banks’ loan portfolios, however, which have
been weakened by the slowdown in activity,
represent a vulnerability.
24.
Reliance on macro-prudential
policies also has increased. A CAR trigger of
14 percent on banks has been in place since
the onset of the global crisis. In addition, since
November 2009, banks have been required to
seek central bank approval to distribute
dividends. The central bank has continued to
require a debt service-to-income limit of 45
percent, and a loan-to-value ratio cap of 85
percent on personal loans—measures that
exist since 2004. The establishment of a credit
bureau, projected to start operating in early
2013, should help to further mitigate credit
risk, by collecting information on individuals’
borrowing and bill payment records, thus
helping lenders assess credit worthiness.
25.
Additional steps to strengthen
financial sector supervision are ongoing.
The central bank has implemented an
enhanced risk-based supervision framework,
adopted the use of special focus examinations
(e.g., credit risk delinquency management),
and is pursuing a number of initiatives.12 These
include (i) the enhanced supervision of all large
financial institutions; (ii) bringing credit unions
under the purview of the central bank;
(iii) drafting legislation to facilitate
consolidated supervision across different
financial sectors (including securities and
insurance); and (iv) participating in regional
supervision efforts and coordinating with
Canadian regulators.13

12

The central bank exercises regulatory and supervisory
oversight of banks, trust companies, money transmission
businesses and private trust companies.
13

An update assessment of the Bahamian financial system
under the Financial Sector Assessment Program is
scheduled in 2012.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

26.
The authorities have also made
progress in enhancing the AML/CFT
framework. Various guidelines on regulation
have been amended to address (i) enhanced
customer due diligence requirements;
(ii) strengthening internal controls, and
compliance and audit procedures;
(iii) improved record keeping for high-risk
countries; and (iv) establishing conditions for
third party introducers. Given that control
processes for activity originating in the
offshore sector may take place in locations
outside the jurisdiction of The Bahamas, the
central bank has also focused on ensuring the
integrity of local governance and risk oversight
arrangements in institutions under its
purview.14
27.
Progress was reported on the
resolution of CLICO-Bahamas. Settlement of
the failed insurance company is now more
likely, following the favorable ruling regarding
the Wellington Preserve in Florida. Staff
welcomed the positive developments and
urged for a prompt resolution that minimizes
fiscal contingent liabilities.

14

The Bahamas Compliance Commission, a part of the
jurisdiction’s anti-money laundering efforts, is a
supervisory body for groups of professionals (e.g.,
lawyers, accountants) that hold funds on behalf of clients.
It works closely with the Inspector of Financial and
Corporate Service Providers, who regulates persons
providing corporate management services.

THE BAHAMAS

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Bahamas economy has started
to recover from the global financial crisis,
but unemployment remains high. Real GDP
in 2011 is projected at 2 percent, driven by the
rebound of tourism and the launch of large
investment projects. The medium-term growth
outlook has improved, compared to the 2010
Article IV staff report, but downside risks are
high. On the domestic front, risks arise from
delays in implementing fiscal and economic
reforms necessary to reverse the rising trend in
debt, build buffers, including for damage from
natural disasters, and improve efficiency and
competitiveness. These could have adverse
effects on private investment and financing
costs. On the external front, the main
downside risk is a weaker-than-expected
recovery in the United States, which would cap
the rebound of tourism and delay the large FDI
tourism projects.
29.
Fiscal consolidation should be the
main policy priority. A strong fiscal
consolidation strategy is essential to place the
public debt-to-GDP ratio on a sustainable path
and to build buffers, including reserves, that
could be used to mitigate the impact of
natural disasters and external shocks. Revenue
mobilization can be strengthened through
improvements in tax administration and lower
tax expenditures. In addition, early
implementation of revenue reform (e.g., a
consumption tax) is essential, since delays may
result in additional risks and pressures.
Expenditure restraint, especially on wages and
transfers, strengthening the weak financial
position of public enterprises, and enhancing
fiscal transparency would also underpin the
fiscal effort.

particularly promising. Staff welcomes the
lower reliance on fiscal incentives, which has
failed to deliver high growth rates. Further
improving basic infrastructure, particularly
regarding energy and water provision, and
developing high value-added downstream
tourism products will be key to achieving
higher growth rates.
31.
The fixed exchange rate system
continues to serve the country well. Staff
analysis suggests that the level of the
exchange rate remains broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals. The authorities
are committed to maintaining the exchange
rate peg and strengthening the external
position by building reserves over the medium
term.
32.
Staff welcomes the recent measures
to strengthen financial sector supervision,
but highlights the importance of
maintaining close monitoring of financial
developments. Recent measures adopted to
further strengthen the financial sector,
including the adoption of macro-prudential
policies, and steps to facilitate stronger
supervision across sectors and at the regional
level, should enhance the resilience of the
financial system. The planned establishment of
a credit bureau and bringing credit unions
under the purview of the central bank are also
welcome. The high level of non-performing
loans, and limited provisioning, however, calls
for further intensifying the monitoring of
financial institutions.
33.
Staff recommends that the next Article
IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

30.
The authorities’ growth strategy is
broadly appropriate. Measures aimed at
reducing obstacles to doing business are

The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

ANNEX III. THE BAHAMAS––STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical data are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, but weaknesses
remain. The central bank produces annual,
quarterly, and monthly reports on
macroeconomic developments, and monetary
and fiscal data, and is the main source of
economic information. The operations of
public corporations are not compiled into a
consolidated set of public sector accounts,
although their debt is included in the public
debt data.

New export-import price indices for goods and
major services were developed with technical
assistance from CARTAC. Procedures for
systematic re-sampling and re-weighting were
modified in order to keep the market basket
representative of what is being measured.

During 2009 and 2010, the main focus of the
Department of Statistics (DoS) was the
preparation and execution of the 2010 census
(carried out every 10 years). It also embarked
on a series of initiatives to improve the
national accounts, including rebasing GDP.

The Bahamas began participating in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in
2003. Its metadata were posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
February 14, 2003.

Looking ahead, the main activities of the DoS
in the coming years will include producing and
disseminating comprehensive census data and
implementing bi-annual labor force surveys.

The DoS updated the CPI methodology with
technical assistance from CARTAC. The base
year was moved to 2010 from 1995, and
additional categories were introduced, with
higher weights for some items, including for
transport and communication. At the same
time, the coverage was expanded to include
the island of Abaco, in addition to the two
islands already covered by the CPI (New
Providence and Grand Bahama).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas
On November 2, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with The Bahamas.1
Background
The Bahamian economy began a tepid recovery in 2010, following a sharp recession in 2008 and
2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by about
1 percent. The rebound was driven by the trade, hospitality, transport, and government services
sectors, while the construction and offshore financial services sectors continued to contract. Inflation
remained subdued at 1.5 percent, despite higher fuel and transportation prices, reflecting their
relatively low share in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket. The external current account deficit
remained broadly stable at 11.5 percent of GDP. Exports rebounded, and growth of non-oil imports
remained subdued in line with economic activity. At the same time, rising foreign direct investment
and other private capital inflows boosted international reserves to US$860 million at end-2010 (about
2.5 months of next year’s imports of goods and services).
Staff estimates that the deficit of the central government deteriorated in Fiscal Year 2010/11 (July to
June). Total revenues increased, owing to large one-off transactions, but expenditure—especially
current spending—increased more than proportionately. As a result, the central government deficit
rose to 4.7 percent of GDP (from 4.4 percent in 2010). The sale of 51 percent of the shares of the
Bahamas Telecommunications Company (about 2.5 percent of GDP) eased financing pressures. The
ratio of government debt to GDP continued rising and exceeded 48 percent of GDP by mid-2011. The
bulk of the debt is held domestically by commercial banks, public corporations, and pension funds.
Financial soundness indicators remained strong. Banks have maintained high overall capitaladequacy ratios (well above the minimum requirement) and prudent levels of provisioning. Banks’
loan portfolio, however, continued to show signs of weakness, as the severe economic downturn
pushed up the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans above 10 percent.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The outlook is for stronger growth, but weaker fiscal and debt positions. Real GDP growth is expected
to hover around 2.5-3 percent per year, but the central government deficit is projected to remain at
about 4.5 percent of GDP over the medium term under current policies. Increased economic activity
and ongoing improvements to the regulatory and supervisory frameworks are expected to contain
financial sector risks. The risks to the outlook, however, are tilted to the downside, given the
uncertainties about the pace of the global recovery and world commodity prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the gradual recovery of The Bahamas economy, but noted that
unemployment remains high. While large investment projects will support growth, downside risks arise
from a slower-than-expected U.S. recovery, elevated international food and fuel prices, and the
vulnerability to natural disasters. Directors called for steadfast implementation of reforms to place
public debt on a sustainable path, build fiscal buffers, and enhance medium-term growth prospects.
Directors underscored that the key policy challenge is to ensure sustainable public finances. They
encouraged the authorities to strengthen revenue mobilization by improving tax administration and
reducing tax expenditures. Directors noted that revenue reforms, such as a broad-based consumption
tax, would improve debt dynamics. They also advised the authorities to exercise expenditure restraint,
strengthen the financial position of public enterprises, and enhance fiscal transparency.
Directors viewed the authorities’ growth strategy as broadly appropriate. They agreed that measures
to enhance the business environment, improve infrastructure, and develop high value-added
downstream tourism products are key to achieving higher growth.
Directors agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime serves the country well. They noted the staff’s
assessment that the level of the exchange rate remains broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. Directors called for close monitoring of the current account position. They welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to strengthen the country’s external position by continuing to build up
foreign exchange reserves.
Directors commended the authorities’ measures to strengthen financial sector supervision, including
the adoption of macro-prudential policies and steps to enhance supervision across sectors and at the
regional level. They also welcomed the strengthening of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. Directors looked forward to timely implementation of
plans to establish a credit bureau and bring credit unions under the supervisory oversight of the
central bank. Noting the high level of non-performing loans and limited provisioning, Directors called
on the authorities to further intensify the monitoring of financial institutions. They supported the
authorities’ request for a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post
assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
particular case.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director for The Bahamas
and John Andrew Rolle, Advisor
November 2, 2011

Our Bahamian authorities continue to value the policy dialogue with the Fund. They are
especially grateful for the outreach by staff in the lesser developed regions of the
archipelago (the family Islands), as successive missions broadened their appreciation for
the high-cost infrastructural development challenges facing The Bahamas.
The staff assessment rightly outlines the medium-term challenges facing the authorities,
namely to safeguard fiscal sustainability and financial sector stability, while cultivating a
more accommodating growth environment. The report outlines a credible menu of policy
options, which are mostly in tune with initiatives already in train or envisioned by the
authorities. The major point of departure is on the timing of, and the resolve to undertake
more deep-seated taxation reform. Ongoing public financial management reforms will
nevertheless position the government to take such steps in the medium term.
The Economic Environment
As staff notes, the Bahamian economy continues to be impacted by the weak global
environment. The recovery, which began mildly in 2010, strengthened during 2011. Soft
growth in tourism has been buttressed by a steady strengthening in FDI flows primarily
into the tourism plant, and by significant public infrastructure investments that are
expected to support more robust private-sector driven expansion over the medium term.
Recent contribution from financial services, another important pillar of the economy, has
been slightly negative, given the weak external climate and the very conservative
domestic credit environment. The economy also faces headwinds from high external fuel
prices.
FDI activity is expected to be strong through 2013, both underpinning and financing the
bulk of the projected widening in the current account deficit. Conditions should support a
gradual reduction in unemployment, with inflation staying in line with trends in the major
trading partners. At a lag, growth is also expected to produce a steady improvement in
asset quality within the banking system.
However, fiscal strains are expected to persist longer, despite a continued commitment to
discipline, as the taxable base of economic activities will only increase more notably once
large scale tourism developments transition into operations mode. That said, neither the
lifting of the wage freeze nor the pending resolution of CLICO poses significant spending
pressures. The resumption of promotions and payment of salary increments will add less

2
than 0.1 percent of GDP to expenditures. Meanwhile, potential contingent liabilities from
the CLICO resolution are already capped at less than 0.4 percent of GDP.
Fiscal Policies
The medium-term fiscal objective is still squarely focused on rebuilding the buffers used
up during the recession. The authorities are careful not to set specific targets or timelines
for reducing the debt ratio in the near term that could undermine the flexibility of fiscal
operations, given an external environment that is still uncertain. However, eventual return
to a Government sector debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent is desirable, and a combination
of sustained economic growth and primary surpluses will be needed to achieve this.
Improved revenue yields have to contribute substantially to consolidation, albeit within
an environment of further enhanced tax administration. Such reforms will prepare The
Bahamas for more fundamental structural changes in the tax system over the medium
term, once a political decision is taken in this direction. However, either the realization of
heightened downside global risk or delayed savings from revenue and expenditure
reforms could exacerbate near-term fiscal strains. If this were to occur, the authorities are
prepared to take additional measures to contain recurrent spending and postpone low
priority investments.
Revenue enhancements are targeting broad base reforms to strengthen both compliance
and enforcement. The e-government portal, just launched in July this year, is also
increasing the scope for efficient interaction with tax payers. As to initiatives to improve
customs collection, the largest single revenue component, the revised 2011 Customs
Management Act lays the foundation for modernization that will position the
organization at the centre of any deep rooted reform to the tax system. Key non-customs
revenue collections will be managed through the new Tax Administration Division
(TAD) within the Ministry of Finance, which will employ more risk-based and nondiscretionary frameworks to strengthen collections. The government plans to have the
TAD evolve into a more autonomous body over the medium to longer term, in keeping
with best international practices. In the meantime, one important undertaking is to
achieve significantly strengthened real property tax compliance. Similarly, the officials
are cognizant of the need to further streamline tax concessions and will explore how best
to achieve this, guided by IMF and IDB TA, albeit at a pace that does not undermine the
country’s relative appeal to FDI.
The authorities concur on the importance of improving the efficiency and transparency of
the operations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This is essential both to manage
contingent risks that could undermine budgetary consolidation efforts, and to lower the
cost of inputs for private businesses. In this vein, direct subsidies to loss making
enterprises have been capped at reduced levels in both of the last two budgets. In the case
of potable water supply, public private partnerships have become central to more efficient
production in the context of a multi-year fundamental reform of the Water and Sewerage

3
Corporation to make it financially viable. For energy, the government is supporting
heightened exploitation of competitive renewable sources (wind, solar and geothermal)
that would also reduce external exposure to oil price fluctuations. It should be
emphasized that current operations of SOEs are already fully monitored and subject to
independent external audits. Under the new amended Financial Administration and Audit
Act, every public sector entity must prepare an annual report with audited financial
statements for tabling in Parliament. Nevertheless, instituting more frequent and
consolidated monitoring would further strengthen the public financial management
framework, especially for the non-financial enterprises. With this mind, a push is also
underway to encourage more frequent reporting, using the 2001 GFS compilation
methodology.
Strengthening the debt management framework is also a fiscal priority. The authorities
have therefore established a Debt Management Committee, comprised of representatives
of the central bank, the Ministry Finance, and the Public Treasury to propose strategic
policies for the debt and to comprehensively monitor debt operations. The establishment
of the committee, with dedicated technical resources, represents a more pragmatic
startup, relative to the immediate alternative of a fully functioning debt management
unit—although this is the medium-term goal. Both the Fund and IDB will provide TA to
strengthen the functioning of the committee.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
On monetary policy, the key objective is still to ensure that domestic credit trends are
sustainable, given the fixed exchange rate and the extremely open current account of the
balance of payments. In view of the very narrow economic base and very limited room
for expenditure substitution between imports and domestic alternatives, policies may at
times be implemented in a procyclical fashion. This explains the June 2011 decision by
the central bank (CBOB) to reduce the discount rate by 75 basis points, as a signaling
device to permit more broad base private sector participation in the recovery. Even with
this more relaxed posture, credit expansion is not projected to pick up considerably in the
near term given both supply and demand side weaknesses. That said, the central bank
also continues to rely on macro-prudential measures to manage credit expansion, and will
maintain these suitably tuned to manage a recovery in asset quality within the banking
system. The CBOB will also ensure that credit trends support a favorable evolution of the
external reserves over the medium term. In this regard, efforts will continue to develop
appropriate and more formal targets for the reserves.
Meanwhile, progress continues in strengthening The Bahamas’ financial sector regulatory
infrastructure, with the dual objectives of enhancing the stability of the domestic sector
while boosting the competiveness of international operations, which are an important
contributor to growth and employment. The authorities have requested an FSAP for 2012,

4
which will provide a further basis for improvements to the policy and regulatory
framework.
Preparations are ongoing to consolidate the supervision of non-bank financial institutions.
The central bank is on track to assume oversight for credit unions in the coming months,
while supervision of other non-bank activities, including insurance and securities
operations, will soon be merged into a second regulator. In the meantime, capacity is
being further strengthened in insurance supervision. With the supporting regulations now
in place, the revamped 2010 legislation came into force in September 2011, imposing
more rigorous capital and solvency requirements on operations as well as mandating
enhanced standards for corporate governance. Concurrently for the securities industry,
the revised 2011 legislation strengthens provisions for international supervisory
cooperation and provides stronger enforcement powers for the Securities Commission.
In the banking sector, the CBOB is enhancing both the capacity and frameworks to
monitor credit quality and capital buffers. Under the evolving risk-based framework, a
systemic risk surveillance committee has been established in the CBOB for heightened
monitoring of systemically important institutions. The quality and depth of information
provided to the supervisor on credit exposures has also become more fine-tuned and
comparable across institutions. Commercial banks are now subjected to more rigorous
and frequent stress testing, while the heightened vigilance has ensured that average
provisioning rates have recovered since 2009. This has improved the standing of
Bahamian banks relative to regional comparisons on provisioning rates (see trends in
Figure 5 of the staff report), and it is supported by a more favorable capital position that
continued to strengthen during the recession period. In the meantime, the pending
establishment of a domestic credit bureau within the next 18 months will significantly
enhance risk management practices and improve the pricing of private credit.
Growth Strategies
Official policies in The Bahamas are broadly focused on boosting the medium-term
growth potential while developing a more resilient and diversified economic base that
exploits the range of opportunities presented by an archipelagic geography. The objective
is to improve the business climate and stimulate increases in both domestic and FDI
financed activities. The modernization of the service delivery platform for government
services, intensive investments in public infrastructure and education, and continued
emphasis on boosting labor force productivity are critical planks in this strategy. A
number of other targeted initiatives are also in train. In April 2011, the government
successfully privatized a majority of the ownership in the state-owned
telecommunications company, which is expected to lead to significant efficiencies in a
vital input to exports such as tourism and financial services. A framework also continues
to be developed, with the IDB’s assistance, to provide enhanced and more targeted

5
support for SMEs, placing more emphasis on entrepreneurial and business management
skills as opposed to providing subsidized financing. On a transitional basis, the
government has also committed resources in the current fiscal year for an extensive on
the jobs skills enhancement project in the private sector to prepare unemployed persons
for accelerated absorption into the workforce as the economy recovers. Direct financing
resources were also provided to support startup micro-enterprises. Together, these
transitional programs will cost about 0.3% of GDP.
Conclusion
To conclude, our Bahamian authorities will remain alert to the changing external
environment and will maintain appropriately tailored and disciplined fiscal policies, as
more lasting reforms to public financial management are pursued. They are confident that
their efforts will strengthen the base for more fundamental reforms to enhance fiscal
sustainability. In the meantime, they will sustain the broad policy thrust on diversifying
and strengthening the economy’s growth potential. Initiatives to bolster the stability of
the financial sector will also be upheld. In these regards, our authorities are grateful for
the ongoing TA from the Fund and other IFIs as well as for the constructive policy
dialogue.
