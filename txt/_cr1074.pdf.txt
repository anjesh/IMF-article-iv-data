EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook
Iran’s economic performance was strong in recent years, supported by high oil prices and
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. However, real GDP growth has slowed following
the recent decline in oil prices, the non-oil fiscal position has become tighter, and the banks’
financial situation has weakened. The recent approval of an ambitious energy price reform by
Parliament could bring significant medium- and long-term benefits by increasing economic
efficiency, and would help improve the macroeconomic outlook.
The 2009/10 budget envisages an increase in non-oil revenue, but the overall fiscal deficit will
need to be financed by resorting to Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) resources. Gross official
reserves remained at a comfortable level at end-September 2009. Over the medium term, based
on the current WEO oil price projections, government spending will need to be adjusted
significantly, in the absence of economic reforms, to achieve a sustainable fiscal position.
Authorities’ views
The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s assessment and recommendations.
On fiscal policy, further consolidation is envisaged by broadening the base of the newly
implemented VAT and implementing other tax policy and administration measures, and by
reducing fuel and nonfuel subsidies.
On monetary policy, the main objectives are to consolidate the recent gains in reducing
inflation to low single digit levels, while ensuring adequate liquidity growth to support
economic recovery; contain the commercial banks’ access to Central Bank of Iran’s (CBI)
lending; and improve the banking system’s regulatory and supervisory framework.
Structural reforms have focused on the proposed energy price reform. The authorities also plan
to strengthen the soundness of the banking system.
Staff recommendations
A reduction of energy subsidies and a significant increase of non-oil revenue are needed to
improve economic efficiency and achieve a more sustainable medium-term fiscal position.
Monetary policy should aim at consolidating the recent gains in reducing inflation and encouraging
financial intermediation. The CBI should limit banks’ access to its lending facilities, and gradually
liberalize interest rates. The steady deterioration of banks’ soundness indicators needs to be
addressed upfront by restructuring loan portfolios and recapitalizing banks.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to support the ongoing external adjustment.

4
I. IRAN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
1.
In the last three years, Iran’s economic growth has been robust and its external
position has strengthened on the back of rising international oil prices and procyclical
policies. Real GDP growth averaged an estimated 5.6 percent a year during 2005/06–2008/09, 1
while gross official reserves reached $80.5 billion (about 12 months of imports) by endSeptember 2009. Income per capita increased, unemployment declined to about 10 percent, and
reportedly general welfare indicators improved. High oil revenues financed an increase in
public spending, and boosted liquidity growth. Easy access by banks to the CBI’s lending
facilities and negative real interest rates fuelled a credit boom. Higher government spending
and subsidized credit contributed to the economic expansion.
2.
Although the Iranian economy is relatively insulated from the recent turmoil in
international financial markets, it has been severely affected by the slowdown in global
demand and the associated drop in oil prices. Given the limited scope for capital inflows
due to international sanctions, the decline in fiscal and export oil revenues has recently led to a
reduction in government spending and imports as a percentage of GDP. Although negative
spillovers from the U.S. and European banking systems have been limited by the absence of
exposure to international assets and the small foreign exposure of Iranian banks, the banking
sector’s soundness indicators have deteriorated. Iran’s stock market index has recently
rebounded after dropping sharply in the second half of 2008 and early 2009, in line with other
global and regional markets.
3.
Iran has the third largest proven oil and gas reserves, and is one of the world’s largest
oil producers. Nevertheless, its oil production has declined in recent years and medium term
production capacity depends on the resources available for investment in the sector. The prospects
for oil investment are uncertain because of Iran’s limited access to external and domestic financing
and artificially low domestic energy prices.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The sharp decline in the oil price and rising inflation led the authorities to tighten
fiscal and monetary policies in the second half of 2008/09. As a result, both economic
growth and inflation fell.
•

2

Real GDP growth is estimated by staff to have declined to 2-2½ percent in 2008/09
from almost 7 percent in 2007/08. 2 This reflects a reduction in oil production and a
weakening of non-oil real GDP growth. Domestic activity and demand growth slowed
significantly due to the global economic slowdown and lower credit growth (Figure 1).
The fiscal Iranian year starts on March 21.

There is a significant margin of error for these estimates as a result of the lack of information on the
performance of large enterprises since September 2008.

•

Tight monetary policy and
continued real exchange rate
appreciation succeeded in sharply
reducing twelve-month end-ofperiod CPI inflation from almost 30
percent in October 2008 to about
7½ percent in October 2009. The
drop in international commodity
prices and good harvest in 2009
have also contributed to the decline
in inflation (Figure 2).

5.
In line with Iran’s procyclical
fiscal stance 3 and the drop in oil prices,
the non-oil fiscal deficit is estimated to
have declined by one percentage point of
GDP, to about 18 percent GDP, in
2008/09 (Figure 3). This was mainly due to
a reduction in expenditure. A VAT with a
three percent rate was successfully
implemented across Iran in September 2008
to replace the system of integrated levies. 4

CBI’s measures to reduce liquidity growth helped contain credit expansion in
2008/09 (Figure 4). While the growth of broad money (M2) and credit was above 20 percent
a year over the last three years, in the second half of 2008/09, to bring down liquidity growth,
the CBI restructured its lending facilities and issued high denomination CBI notes to replace
commercial bank checks. 5 Base money contracted in the first half of 2009/10 as banks repaid
credit lines opened by the central bank to facilitate the substitution of bank checks in
2008/09. Credit growth declined from 22½ percent in September 2008 to 11 percent in
September 2009 as real lending rates increased sharply and banks were reluctant to extend
new loans in light of the steady deterioration of their portfolios.

The recent data from the banking sector shows a steady weakening of soundness
indicators as a result of distorted credit policies and slower domestic demand growth
(Figure 5). It also shows an increase in the market share of private banks, which have become

government and the municipalities. Initially, all importers, exporters, and incorporated businesses with annual
turnover in excess of three billion rials (about $300,000) are subject to VAT. The VAT law was approved by
the Expediency Council rather than the whole Parliament; the Council’s decisions are valid for a period of
five years. At that time, the VAT law will need to be submitted to the entire Parliament for approval.

Commercial bank endorsable checks were effectively circulating in lieu of high-denomination bills. They were
issued directly by commercial banks, undermining the CBI’s ability to earn seignorage.
6

Participatory lending is based on profit sharing between bank and customer on the proceeds of the loan. It
includes Mosharekat Madani, a joint venture, and Mozarebeh, a contract wherein the bank undertakes to
provide the cash capital and other party undertakes to use it for commercial purposes and divide the profit at a
specified ratio between the two parties at the end of the term of the contract.

7
•

The use of the banking sector to provide direct financing to mostly private
beneficiaries through central bank credit, and limited tools to monitor credit risk and
credit quality, have led to strong balance sheet growth, a decline in capital adequacy
ratios, and a significant increase in nonperforming assets.

•

The decline in the spread between lending and deposit rates has hampered banks’
profitability.

•

The deterioration of the banks’ loan portfolios has been broad-based. Despite a
decline in real estate prices, the share of NPLs related to housing and construction has
been relatively small in comparison to other countries in the region.

The current account surplus remained strong in 2008/09, reflecting mainly a
decline in imports as domestic demand weakened (Figure 7). The current account surplus
is estimated to have declined from 12 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 7 percent in 2008/09.
Gross official reserves, including the OSF foreign assets, fell slightly from $83 billion at end2007/08 to about $80 billion at end-2008/09, and stood at $80.5 billion at end-September
2009. Large debt amortizations have further lowered the outstanding external debt to an
estimated $20 billion (about 6½ percent of GDP) in 2008/09. The rial depreciated in nominal
terms by 9 percent against the U.S. dollar between March 2008 and September 2009. The
mission’s preliminary assessment indicates some overvaluation of the real effective exchange
rate (Box 1).

model (AR-MGARCH) show significant spillover from the Saudi to the Tehran stock market, both in the return
and volatility equations in the period.

9
Box 1. Islamic Republic of Iran: Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff’s econometric estimates suggest that the rial was slightly overvalued at end-2008. A CGER-type
assessment using the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests that the rial was
undervalued during the late 1990s up to 2003/04.1 Starting in 2005/06, the terms of trade gains owing to higher
oil prices appreciated the equilibrium REER. At the same time, Iran’s high inflation relative to its trading
partners appreciated the actual REER considerably, ultimately reversing the estimated undervaluation.
In 2008/09, the rial became slightly overvalued with the worsening of the terms of trade and the increase in
domestic inflation relative to partner countries. Panel mean estimates for oil producing countries suggest
some overvaluation as of end-2008/09.
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach also indicates a small overvaluation of the rial in 2008.
Based on a panel regression for oil-exporting countries, the current account norm for Iran would be a surplus
of about eight percent of GDP. This compares with a projected surplus of about 1½ percent over the medium
term. As for other oil-producing countries, these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

III. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC
DOWNTURN AND THE RECENT DROP IN OIL PRICES
10.
The authorities’ main medium-term macroeconomic challenges are to support
non-oil GDP growth, further reduce inflation, and lessen Iran’s fiscal dependency on
oil. As part of Iran’s reform efforts, the Parliament has recently approved an important
energy price reform to be implemented in the context of the 2010/11 budget. The reform
aims at reducing/eliminating price subsidies on domestic energy consumption and other
commodities in order to remove a major economic distortion, enhance economic efficiency,
and improve the fiscal position in the medium term. The authorities also intend to strengthen
the banking sector to ensure that it continues to support growth.

10
11.
In response to Iran’s deteriorating external environment, the authorities plan
some increase in spending in 2009/10. With limited access to external financing, the
authorities are addressing the decline in oil receipts by strengthening non-oil revenues (which
account for only one-third of current expenditures) and using OSF financing.
A. Short- and Medium-Term Outlook
12.
The authorities are responding to their macroeconomic challenges through the
2009/10 budget and the recent establishment of a high-level interministerial working
group. The main objective of this group is to prepare reforms, including in the areas of tax
and customs policy, and administration and financial and capital markets to improve
monetary policy implementation and bank soundness.
13.
The economy is projected to continue growing in 2009/10, albeit at a slower pace,
and inflation is expected to decline further. An increase in public consumption would help
mitigate the impact of weaker domestic and external demand on non-oil GDP growth, which
is projected by the staff at 2½-3 percent. Oil production has declined in line with the
reduction in OPEC quotas, which would result in real GDP growth of 1½-2 percent. Average
CPI inflation is projected to drop to about 10 percent, consistent with the CBI’s policies to
continue limiting liquidity growth. The external current account balance is expected to
decline further to 2½ percent of GDP in 2009/10 on account of lower oil exports and despite
a significant reduction in imports. With the capital and financial account remaining in deficit,
international reserves (including OSF resources) are projected to increase slightly to about
$84 billion by end-2009/10.
14.
The staff prepared a medium-term baseline scenario through 2014/15 reflecting
the authorities’ current policy intentions (Text Table 1), but excluding the energy price
reform of which implementation details have not yet been worked out (see Section E).
Consistent with the latest WEO oil projection, this scenario assumes Iranian crude oil prices
to increase gradually to about $80 per barrel over the medium term. Real GDP growth is
projected to average about 3 percent a year, reflecting constant oil production after 2009/10
and moderate non-oil growth owing to limited progress on key structural reforms to support
private sector activity. Under this scenario, a continued prudent monetary policy would keep
inflation in the single/low double digits. The non-oil primary deficit will decline somewhat,
while the external current account surplus would fall over time, reflecting lower export
revenues.

B. Fiscal Policy
15.
The overall fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) is projected to widen moderately to 2.7
percent in 2009/10 from 0.7 percent in 2008/09, owing mainly to lower oil revenues. The
2009/10 budget envisages a decline in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit to about 16 percent
of GDP, from 18 percent in 2008/09, mainly as a result of a further strengthening of tax
administration and larger VAT registration that more than offsets a planned increase in
spending. There is no scope of fiscal stimulus due to the lack of access to external financing
and limited OSF resources. The authorities are accelerating their privatization program to
help finance the non-oil deficit.
16.
The system of indirect taxes is being modernized with the introduction of the
VAT, and the authorities are considering other measures to improve tax policy and
administration. The VAT net is to be broadened by widening registration to smaller and
unincorporated businesses, closely monitoring the processing of VAT refunds, and
strengthening the audit function. Over the medium term, the authorities intend to study the
benefits of increasing the standard VAT rate and broadening the tax base by including real
estate and fee-based financial services. They will also assess the benefits of reducing the
dispersion in import tariff rates and broadening the import base.
17.
Looking forward, the authorities plan to modernize the income tax and customs
duty systems to support a diversification away from oil. In particular, they are focusing on

12
ways to develop self-assessment procedures for corporate income taxes. They are also
considering simplifying capital income regulations, introducing general tax incentives such
as accelerated depreciation provisions in the business income tax, and reforming taxes on
assets.
18.
The authorities believe that there is also a need to reduce nonfuel subsidies and
are considering phasing out agricultural and food subsidies over the medium term.
Substituting targeted transfers to households for these subsidies would result in fiscal savings
and would help rationalize consumption.
C. Monetary and Financial Policies
19.
Consistent with one of its main policy objectives, the CBI has been implementing
measures to reduce inflation. Starting in July 2008, the CBI has taken steps to consolidate
its overdraft facility into credit lines. As noted above, it has also regained control over
monetary policy by replacing banks’ checks with CBI issued high-denomination bills. These
bills are issued at the request of banks, provided they are fully covered by their deposits at
the CBI. The CBI also established an interbank market in July 2008 to reduce the banks’
demand for central bank facilities and help improve liquidity management.
20.
As a first step toward the gradual liberalization of rates of return, state-owned
banks were allowed to equalize the rates of return on term deposits with those of private
banks. Moreover, the CBI has proposed to continue adjusting rates of returns in line with
trends in consumer price inflation.
21.
The authorities have also been taking measures to strengthen banks’ risk
management. In particular, they have improved bank supervision by implementing a new
banking supervision framework, including a new loan classification system. The CBI has
also established a credit rating institute to enhance the transparency of banks’ information on
customer credit risk.
22.
The authorities intend to recapitalize the banking sector ahead of their full
privatization. To this end, a company for the resolution of nonperforming loans was recently
created.
23.
The authorities adopted implementing regulations for the Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) law on December 5, 2009 which incorporate advice provided by
staff and reflect progress towards establishing a more comprehensive AML
framework. The authorities have prepared a draft law on combating the financing of
terrorism (CFT) and have requested further technical assistance to bring Iran’s CFT
framework more in line with the international standard. Staff provided preliminary comments
on the draft CFT Law and is planning a follow up TA mission in 2010 focusing on CFT and
on the various aspects of Iran's developing AML framework.

13
D. External Current Account and Exchange Rate Policy
24.
The authorities intend to manage the exchange rate flexibly vis-à-vis a basket of
currencies, while preserving an adequate level of international reserves. The staff noted
that in the current global economic environment greater exchange rate flexibility would help
adjust the external current account and preserve external competitiveness, particularly if
consumer prices were to increase significantly after the implementation of the proposed
energy price reform.
25.
The staff also suggested gradually liberalizing the trade regime, improving
customs procedures, and pursuing preparatory work toward WTO accession. The
authorities believe in the advantages of a simplified customs tariff schedule and are
considering changes as part of their review of tax policy and administration.
E. Energy Price Reform 8
26.
To reduce the negative impact on the economy of high energy subsidies (Box 2),
the Parliament has approved a bill to increase domestic energy prices and phase out
subsidies on several other commodities and services. 9 While details on the implementation
of the energy bill still need to be worked out, the reform bill envisages a gradual price
increase over a period of 5 years towards Iran border f.o.b. prices, with a significant upfront
price adjustment. To offset the short-term negative impact on wealth and consumption, the
bill also contemplates compensatory measures for households and enterprises, including cash
transfers and incentives to support the adoption of more energy-efficient technologies. To
facilitate the implementation of the proposed reform, the authorities have initiated a media
campaign to make the public aware of the need to adjust fuel prices.
27.
The proposed energy price reform could bring significant medium- and longterm benefits by increasing economic efficiency, and would help address the risks to the
macroeconomic outlook. The reform would strengthen the fiscal and external positions by
reducing implicit energy subsidies and gasoline imports. It would also facilitate higher
investment in oil production capacity and electricity generation. The authorities are aware
that, in the short-run, the reform could trigger major changes in the economy
by (i) increasing the cost of energy and non-energy products made in Iran, which would
result in a one-off-increase in production costs and output prices, and would affect the
external competitiveness of some Iranian producers; and (ii) changing the demand pattern of
goods and services.

8

See selected issues paper on “The Economics of Energy Price Reform in the Islamic Republic of Iran”.
The bill targets subsidies on gasoline, diesel, natural gas, LNG, CNG, electricity, water, wheat, flour, rice
milk, sugar, edible oils, and aviation, rail, and postal services.

14
Box 2. Impact of High Energy Subsidies on Iran’s Economy
At a price of 10 cents per liter of gasoline, Iran’s energy products are amongst the most
heavily subsidized in the world. This has encouraged excessive use of energy (both in per
capita terms and per unit of GDP), as reflected by Iran’s move from being one of the lowest
energy intensity users in the world in 1980 to one of the highest in 2009 (Figure 8). Low
energy prices have encouraged the development of energy intensive industries and excessive
consumption, causing pollution and environmentally related damage. Low energy prices have
also resulted in insufficient resources for adequate investment in oil production and refineries.
Excessive gasoline consumption has turned Iran into a net gasoline importer, with a negative
impact on the external current account and the fiscal balance.

28.
To illustrate the potential impact of the energy price reform, the staff
formulated an alternative macroeconomic scenario assuming a gradual energy price
increase starting in 2010/11, with significant frontloading in the first three years
(Figure 8). Under this scenario, consumer prices would initially jump as domestic energy
prices increase, but inflation would gradually subside thereafter with the appropriate mix of
fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. The adjustment of domestic energy prices to
international levels would remove a major price distortion in the economy, thereby
increasing energy efficiency and improving resource allocation. The reform would also help
strengthen the fiscal position by increasing the revenues accruing to the government and
energy producers from domestic sales of fuel products, and would provide resources for
investment in production capacity. As a result, real non-oil GDP growth is expected to
increase gradually to 6½–7½ percent a year over the medium term. The external position
would also strengthen because of higher oil export volumes and lower gasoline imports, and
official reserves would rise significantly.
F. Risks to the Macroeconomic Outlook
29.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is subject to considerable downside
risks.
•

Delays in adopting the appropriate measures to strengthen the banking sector could
jeopardize public confidence and banks’ capacity to provide the credit necessary to
support higher real GDP growth.

•

The upside risk of the planned domestic energy price reform could be more than offset by
a lack of social consensus on the appropriate policy mix to accompany the increase in
domestic energy prices. This could potentially derail the adjustment process and
encourage excessive recourse to CBI financing for on-lending by banks, further
weakening the banks’ credit portfolios.

•

A decline in oil prices below current WEO projections would put Iran’s economy under
serious stress, particularly in the absence of domestic energy price reform. To illustrate
this risk, the staff has produced a macroeconomic scenario with international oil prices at
$40 per barrel over the next five years (Box 3 and Figure 9).
Box 3. Impact of Oil Price at $40 per Barrel on the Macroeconomic Outlook
The staff assessed the macroeconomic impact of a drop in crude oil prices to $40 per barrel over 2009/10–2014/15. Under
this scenario, real GDP growth would decline to about 2½ percent a year, reflecting lower oil production and slower
growth in the non-oil sectors owing to reduced public spending and limited credit growth. Revenues of the oil company
would be insufficient to ensure the investment necessary to sustain production. Public spending, particularly capital
expenditure, would have to contract substantially by 2010/11, given the limited resources available in the OSF. Over the
medium term, the projected 11 percent contraction in public spending required in the absence of domestic energy price
reform is unlikely to be sustainable. Because of Iran’s relatively high international reserves, the immediate impact of
lower export revenues on imports would be limited in the first two years.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Iran’s economic performance was strong in recent years, supported by high oil
prices and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Real GDP growth was above
five percent a year, the external position strengthened, and welfare indicators improved. The
authorities’ response to the deterioration in the external economic environment, particularly
to the sharp decline in oil prices, has been broadly adequate. The non-oil primary deficit was
reduced, inflation dropped markedly in the second half of 2008/09 and the first half of
2009/10, and the external position remains strong.
31.
However, there are significant risks to the macroeconomic outlook. These include
delays in adopting the measures necessary to strengthen the banking sector; possible
difficulties in reaching a consensus on the appropriate policy mix to accompany the planned
energy price reform; and a significant decline in oil prices.
32.
Looking forward, fiscal policy should aim at addressing the impact of the decline
in oil revenues in order to contain the need for OSF resources. In this regard, the staff
welcomes the non-oil revenue effort envisaged in 2009/10, which is expected to help reduce
the non-oil fiscal deficit while allowing for some increase in spending relative to the level of
the previous fiscal year. Achieving the projected increase in non-oil revenues will require
broadening the VAT registration net, strengthening tax administration to collect arrears from
large state-owned enterprises, and simplifying the import tariff schedule to increase the
effective tariff rate on imports.
33.
The proposed domestic energy price reform is a major step towards improving
Iran’s medium-term macroeconomic outlook and fiscal position. This reform will help
strengthen the fiscal and external balances, allow for higher investment in the energy sector,
and support higher real GDP growth over the medium-term. The success of the reform will
depend critically on the effective and timely implementation of a well-targeted mechanism of
cash transfers to the poor and steps to facilitate the adoption of energy efficient technologies
by the corporate sector. To anchor expectations, it will be important to outline clear
macroeconomic policies in support of the reform, including avoiding quasi-fiscal financing
through the banking sector and the accumulation of energy-related payment arrears, ensuring
adequate tightening of monetary policy to limit the secondary effects of the price increase on
the aggregate price level while maintaining sufficient liquidity in the banking sector, and
preserving an adequate level of external competitiveness.
34.
The recent high volatility of oil prices and the worsened global economic outlook
also highlight the need to put in place a rolling medium-term fiscal framework. Such
framework should integrate the operations of the central government budget and the OSF in
order to reduce macroeconomic volatility and domestic and external vulnerabilities. At the
same time, further measures are needed to improve the business climate and encourage the
participation of domestic and foreign investors in the privatization and restructuring of public
enterprises. In this regard, a close dialogue with World Bank staff on improving the
privatization process and implementing other macro-critical reforms would be very helpful.

19
35.
The CBI has been successful in regaining control over monetary policy and
reducing liquidity to lower inflation. In this regard, the restructuring of overdraft lending
into a short-term liquidity facility is a step in the right direction. Going forward, access to the
liquidity facility should require the use of collateral, possibly in the form of government
participation paper or CBI paper. This would also help develop a secondary market. The staff
also welcomes the recent establishment of an interbank market, which constitutes another
important step to help improve liquidity management. Going forward, CBI lending to
commercial banks for on-lending to the private sector should be discouraged, and the cost
of providing assistance to enterprises should be borne by the government through direct
budgetary subsidies.
36.
The staff welcomes the steps taken thus far to equalize the rates of return on
term deposits between different categories of banks and recommends a gradual
liberalization of rates of returns, particularly on the lending side. This reform is
particularly important in view of the planned domestic energy price reform. The
liberalization of rates of return would eliminate distortions, allow for a transparent
transmission of the CBI’s monetary policy, restore credit market fluidity, and improve the
banking system’s soundness indicators. More generally, the CBI’s independence to
implement monetary policy should be strengthened in order to enable it to achieve its price
and financial stability objectives.
37.
Although Iran’s banking sector has remained relatively insulated from the
ongoing international financial crisis, the steady increase in nonperforming loans needs
to be addressed upfront, particularly in view of the planned energy price reform.
Banks’ balance sheets are likely to be affected by the impact of the increase in energy prices
on corporate profits, and the recapitalization of the banking sector is essential to strengthen
solvency and liquidity. Equally critical are further efforts to improve data collection on
banking facilities and assessment of customer credit risk, and to enhance the regulatory
framework on asset and liability management.
38.
Recent estimates suggest that the rial is broadly in line with fundamentals.
However, in light of the high oil price volatility, greater exchange rate flexibility would help
adjust the external current account and maintain a strong reserve position.
39.
The authorities should persevere with their efforts to bring Iran’s AML/CFT
framework in line with the international standard, with the continued cooperation of
international organizations.
40.
Although data is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, the staff
recommends improving the timeliness of macroeconomic data provision. High frequency
indicators on real sector activity will be especially important to tailor monetary policy during
the implementation of the planned domestic energy price reform.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Islamic
Republic of Iran be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange System

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The Islamic
Republic of Iran maintains a de jure managed floating arrangement against a basket. The rial
gradually depreciated against a composite of currencies, including the Euro, the U.S. dollar,
and the Japanese yen. Effective January 4, 2008, the classification of the de facto exchange
rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a crawling peg,
and later in 2008, in view of further increase in exchange rate flexibility, the arrangement was
reclassified to other managed arrangement. With effect from September 6, 2004, the Islamic
Republic of Iran accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Iran maintains one exchange restriction and two multiple
currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.

3
a.
The exchange restriction arises from limitations on the transferability of rial profits
from certain investments under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act and
from limitations on other investment-related current international payments under this act.
b.

The multiple currency practices arise from the following:

1.
Budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of
certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple exchange
rate system; and
2.
Obligations of entities that had received allocations of foreign exchange at subsidized
“allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused
allocations to the Central Bank of Iran at the allocation rate.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 14, 2008.

APPENDIX III. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for effective surveillance; however, the data
are reported with significant delays. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) disseminates key
statistical aggregates in its quarterly Economic Trends, also available at
<http://www.cbi.ir/e/>. Since 2002, the Fund’s Statistics Department has assisted the
authorities in their efforts to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
The progress, however, has been slow and gaps in meeting SDDS requirements for data
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness remain.
Real sector statistics
•

National accounts statistics are reasonably sound. Improvements have been made in
the coverage of the informal economy. However, there is scope for further progress,
especially in the coverage of small-scale industries and services. Also, the CBI and
the Statistical Council of Iran (SCI) have undertaken to review and unify their
respective GDP estimates.

•

Price statistics are sound and released in a timely manner. The official labor market
statistics are released by the SCI, and are based on the definitions recommended by
the International Labor Organization (ILO). The data are based on an urban and rural
population sample of about 100,000 households, and the threshold for considering a
person employed is two days a week. Labor market statistics, however, could benefit
from further improvement, particularly with regard to employment and wage data.

Government finance statistics
•

The data are compiled in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual,
2001 (GFSM 2001) for the core central government operations. Starting 2003/04, the
fiscal data include implicit energy subsidies.

•

Data on central government operations cover the general budget, the special purpose
funds, and certain transactions with the Social Security Organization. These data are
not consolidated. There is a need to expand the coverage of central government to
include the complete transactions of the Social Security Organization, four pension
funds, five procurement and distribution centers, and the OSF.

•

The submission for the 2006 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook included for
the first time data for general and local governments.

•

The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded to enable
recording of expenditures at the pre-payment stage.

•

Financing data in the GFS are not broken down by residency of debt holders or by
type of debt instruments. The discrepancy between fiscal and monetary data on deficit
financing has often been relatively large, partly due to foreign currency valuation

6
problems. There is a need to develop a comprehensive database on domestic public
debt, with a breakdown by domestic creditor.
•

The Bonyad-e-Mostazafan va Janbazan (BMJ, Foundation of the Oppressed and
Injured) could be considered a holding company and classified in the nonfinancial
public corporations sector.

Monetary statistics
•

Monthly monetary data are reported to STA for publication in IFS, but periodicity has
been lagging.

•

Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the
application of the residency criterion and in sectorization and classification of
accounts. The authorities are undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line
with the recommendations of STA missions.

•

The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of
public nonfinancial corporations, local governments, or foreign-currency deposits
of residents.

External sector data
•

The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and
banks is being implemented in line with the methodological guidelines of the Fund’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). This will allow compilation of
balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis. Annual balance of payments data
up to 2000 have been reported to STA for publication in BOPSY and IFS.

•

Data on the international investment position are compiled, but not disseminated.
Only data on public and publicly guaranteed debt are disseminated, but classifications
do not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide. The data template
on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not compiled.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with the
Islamic Republic of Iran
On February 3, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 1
Background
Iran’s economic performance was strong in recent years, supported by high oil prices and
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Real GDP growth was above 5 percent a year, the
external position strengthened, and welfare indicators improved. The recent drop in oil prices
and rising inflation, however, led the authorities to tighten fiscal and monetary policies since the
second half of 2008/09. Real GDP growth is estimated by staff to have decelerated to 2–
2½ percent in 2008/09, from almost 7 percent in 2007/08, owing to a reduction in oil production
and slower growth in the non-oil sector. At the same time, inflation has declined significantly.
The current account surplus is estimated to have remained strong in 2008/09 despite the drop
in oil prices, reflecting a good performance of non-oil exports. Preliminary estimates suggest
that the surplus narrowed from 12 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 7 percent in 2008/09. Gross
official reserves, including the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) foreign assets, declined slightly from
$83 billion at end-2007/08 to $80.5 billion at end-September 2009. Large debt amortizations
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussions, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

have further lowered the outstanding external debt to an estimated $20 billion (6½ percent of
GDP) in 2008/09. The rial depreciated in nominal terms by 9 percent against the U.S. dollar in
the period March 2008-September 2009.
Twelve-month CPI inflation dropped to 7½ percent in October 2009, from almost 30 percent in
October 2008, as money (M1) growth slowed, reversing the increasing trend of recent years.
The drop in international commodity prices contributed to the decline in inflation. In 2008/09, the
non-oil fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined by one percentage point of GDP, to about 18
percent of GDP. This was mainly achieved through a reduction in government expenditure. In
addition, a VAT with a three percent rate was successfully implemented across Iran in
September 2008 to replace the system of integrated levies. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) also
introduced measures to tighten monetary policy, in particular, in the second half of 2008/09 it
restructured its lending facilities and issued high-denominated notes to replace commercial
bank checks.
The recent performance of the banking sector shows a steady increase in the market share of
private banks, which have become leaders in the provision of participatory facilities, and a
weakening of soundness indicators because of credit policies and slower domestic demand
growth.
In the structural area, the approval of an ambitious energy price reform by the Parliament in
December 2009 is expected to bring about an improvement in both the fiscal and external
positions, facilitate higher investment in the energy sector, and support higher real GDP growth.
In the financial area, the CBI established an interbank market in July 2008 to reduce the banks’
demand for central bank facilities and help improve liquidity management. The authorities have
also improved bank supervision by implementing a new banking supervision framework,
including a new loan classification system. In addition, the CBI has put in place a credit rating
agency to enhance transparency regarding customer credit risk. The authorities have also
adopted implementing regulations for the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law as another step
toward establishing a more comprehensive AML framework. The authorities have requested
additional technical assistance with the drafting of a law on combating the financing of terrorism
and to bring Iran’s AML/CFT more in line with international standards.
Looking forward, the authorities’ main macroeconomic challenges are to support non-oil GDP
growth, further reduce inflation, and lessen Iran’s fiscal dependency on oil by expanding
domestic sources of revenue. The 2009/10 budget envisages a reduction in the non-oil fiscal
deficit to be achieved through an increase in non-oil revenue. Gross official reserves are
projected to remain at a comfortable level at end-2009/10, and inflation is expected to decline
further. Over the medium term, based on current WEO oil price projections, measures will be
needed to further reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit. Against this background, the implementation
of the proposed energy price reform is a critical step to improve the medium-term fiscal outlook
and increase economic efficiency.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that Iran’s economy had performed strongly in recent years supported by high
oil prices and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. However, declining oil prices have had
an adverse effect on output and external fiscal balances. In light of this, Directors supported the
authorities’ plans to increase non-oil revenue and reduce subsidies, and stressed the need to
address forcefully the soundness of the banking system.
Directors emphasized the positive medium-term impact of the planned domestic energy price
reform on the macroeconomic outlook. This reform would help strengthen the fiscal and external
accounts, enable higher investment in the energy sector, and support stronger and more
sustainable growth.
Directors stressed that the success of the planned energy price reform will depend importantly
on the effective and timely implementation of a well-targeted mechanism of cash transfers to the
poor as well as the transition to using energy efficient technologies. Anchoring expectations
through prudent macroeconomic policies will be important for limiting the secondary effects of
the energy price increases on the general price level. Directors particularly stressed the need to
avoid quasi-fiscal operations through the banking sector. This will also require a sufficiently tight
monetary policy, while providing adequate liquidity to the banking sector.
Directors encouraged the implementation of a rolling medium-term fiscal framework which
integrates the operations of the central government budget and the Oil Stabilization Fund to
help reduce domestic and external vulnerabilities.
Directors complimented the authorities for sharply bringing down inflation by tightening fiscal
policies and liquidity conditions. They recommended that access to the CBI’s liquidity facility be
made subject to the use of collateral. Directors welcomed the steps taken to equalize the rates
of return on term deposits between public and private banks, and stressed the need to gradually
liberalize rates of return, particularly on the lending side. Many Directors called for strengthening
the independence of the central bank.
Directors emphasized the importance of addressing the increase in banks’ nonperforming loans
and welcomed the authorities’ intention to take additional measures as necessary. They noted
that balance sheets of banks were likely to be affected by the impact of the increase in energy
prices on corporate profits and encouraged the authorities to recapitalize the banking system.
Directors observed that recent estimates suggested that the rial was broadly in line with
fundamentals. However, they were broadly of the view that in light of the high oil price volatility,
greater exchange rate flexibility would help adjust the external current account and preserve a
strong international reserves position.

4

Directors noted the progress made towards establishing a more comprehensive AML/CFT
framework and urged the authorities to strengthen this effort so as to bring their AML/CFT
framework in line with international standards.
Directors considered that economic data were broadly adequate for surveillance purposes but
recommended that its timeliness be improved.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for the Islamic Republic of Iran
February 3, 2010
My authorities thank staff for their hard work and the constructive discussions and useful
analysis, including the high-quality selected issues paper. They continue to value the
professional work of staff on Iran, as well as Fund’s policy advice. They are also grateful
for the technical assistance provided by FAD and LEG, and look forward to further close
collaboration with Fund TA departments in the period ahead.
Overview
Since the last Article IV consultation, economic developments in Iran have been marked
by the global economic turmoil, which led to a sharp drop in oil prices, and a decline in
demand for exports and foreign financing, in particular in the oil sector. These factors
have impacted economic activity, albeit less than expected.
Notwithstanding these unfavorable developments, the authorities have remained focused
on implementing their reform agenda, and the achievements in this regard are
satisfactory. As highlighted in the staff report, real GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent
during 2005/06–2008 /09, which translated into a significant increase in per capita
income, inflation was brought down to a single digit level, and unemployment declined to
about 10 percent. The external position is strong and there are no immediate risks to its
viability. Despite the sharp contraction in oil export receipts, the current account
remained in surplus, albeit less than in previous years, and gross official reserves at a
comfortable level equivalent to 12 months of imports. Iran’s external debt has continued
to decline, reaching 5 percent of GDP. The managed floating exchange rate regime has
continued to serve the economy well, and we note staff assessment that the exchange rate
is broadly in line with fundamentals.
My authorities are fully aware of the remaining challenges ahead, which will be
addressed in the forthcoming five-year development plan. These include sustaining high
growth rates to provide employment opportunities for a growing labor force, maintaining
a low inflation rate, diversifying the economy away from the hydrocarbon sector,
enhancing non-oil revenue performance and base, fostering efficiency and private sector
development, and reducing regional and social disparities.
Reducing inflation
The authorities have given priority to addressing the issue of high inflation, a major
concern during previous Article IV consultations. Notwithstanding the fallout from the
global economic slowdown and lower oil prices, the authorities tightened fiscal and
monetary policies in 2008/09 and 2009/10 to reduce inflation. Consequently, as
highlighted in the staff report, inflation was brought down to 7½ percent in October 2009,
from 30 percent a year earlier and 19 percent on average over the last three years.
Nonetheless, the tighter fiscal and monetary policies, combined with lower oil output,

2
have inevitably affected real GDP growth, which is estimated at 2.3 percent in 2008/09
and 2 percent in 2009/10, even though growth in the non-oil sector has shown signs of
resilience.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy was tightened in 2008/09 and 2009/10, in a departure from past years’
stance. The non-oil fiscal balance, which was reduced by 1 percentage point of GDP
in 2008/09, is estimated to decline further by 2 percentage points to 16 percent of GDP
in 2009/10, one of the lowest non-oil fiscal deficits among the oil producing countries in
the MENA region, as shown in the October 2009 Regional Economic Outlook. This has
been achieved mainly through improvement in non-oil revenue mobilization, including
the successful implementation of a VAT and further strengthening of tax administration.
On the expenditure side, the authorities have kept the lid on total spending, which is
estimated to decline by 6½ percent in real terms in 2009/10 (assuming an average
inflation rate of 10 percent). Privatization receipts continue to contribute to financing the
non-oil deficit. Continued efforts in enhancing the non-oil revenue performance should
bring Iran close to insulating the budget from the volatility of oil prices.
The draft budget law for fiscal year 2010/11 was submitted to Parliament on
January 23, 2010. While detailed information will be available in the coming weeks,
there are indications that fiscal policy will remain prudent to help address temporary
effects of the energy price reform, which will be introduced in 2010/11 (see below).
Monetary policy
Monetary policy was aimed at containing the growth of domestic liquidity and keeping
credit growth under control. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has continued to reduce its
lending to banks, while directing banks to the interbank money market to meet their
liquidity needs. Moreover, the CBI has replaced banks’ checks in circulation with CBIissued high denomination bills, thereby regaining control of monetary growth. In recent
years, commercial banks were allowed to issue endorsable checks backed by client
deposits to facilitate cash transactions in large denominations. However, these quasimonetary instruments had grown to the point of complicating the task of controlling
money growth.
Monetary policy in 2010/11 will be attentive to the need to support economic activity,
while helping smooth the impact of the energy price reform and preserving the gains
achieved in reducing inflation.
Financial sector
The financial sector has been insulated from the global turmoil, and bank intermediation
has continued to grow, reflecting in part the expansion of private banks, which have
increased their market share. To foster competition and efficiency in the delivery of

3
financial services, the authorities have allowed public banks to match the rates of return
on term deposit facilities offered by private banks.
The CBI has stepped up its efforts to preserve bank soundness and strengthen supervisory
standards. A new banking supervision framework, including a new loan classification
system, has been implemented. In addition, the CBI has established a credit rating entity
to help improve information on customer credit risk. Other steps include the
establishment of a bank-owned company for the resolution of nonperforming loans and
the planned recapitalization of certain banks before their privatization. My authorities are
of the view that the rise in nonperforming loans is essentially due to the slowdown in
economic activity and the depressed external demand, as happened in many other
countries. They intend to continue to monitor the situation closely and take additional
measures as needed to ensure that financial institutions remain solvent and profitable.
Medium-term outlook and reforms
Iran’s medium-term economic prospects will be shaped by the ambitious reforms of the
next five-year development plan. The draft plan law, which is being debated by
Parliament, sets ambitious, but achievable targets for growth, unemployment, inflation,
and improvement in the living conditions. My authorities are convinced that with
sustained implementation of wide-ranging reforms, Iran will be able to fully tap its
economic potential, given the country’s endowment in energy resources, its abundant and
skilled labor force, and its entrepreneurial business community. As such, they are
confident that the medium-term outlook is favorable.
The energy price reform, which has been under preparation for several years, was
approved by Parliament on January 05, 2010, and implementation is expected to start in
April of this year, once the related regulations are approved. This reform will be a major
step toward enhancing energy efficiency, improving resource allocation, and targeting
and reducing the high cost of subsidies on energy. My authorities are aware of the
challenges of implementing such an important, but complex reform, as outlined in the
useful SIP, including in particular its economic and social impact in the short and long
run. Preparations are underway to work out detailed implementation steps, including
active communication to keep the public well informed. The authorities agree with staff
that the energy price reform will bring about significant benefits in the medium and long
term, and stand ready to address any short-term adverse effects.
Efforts will continue to focus also on improving the business environment by
streamlining procedures, facilitating access to credit by SMEs, encouraging technological
innovation, and fostering job training and employment. In the fiscal area, the authorities
will continue to enhance non-oil revenue by broadening the tax base, reviewing income
and trade taxes, and strengthening tax administration. Efforts will also be made to
streamline public administration and enhance the efficiency of government spending,
including reducing the subsidies and improving their targeting. In the financial sector, the
authorities intend to improve the performance and financial strength of public banks,
while further encouraging the development of private banks.

4

Conclusion
The Iranian economy has continued to exhibit strong performance, despite adverse
external developments. High rates of growth and employment creation have been
achieved, and the external position has strengthened. The authorities have shown
determination in bringing inflation down to a low level, and will seek to preserve this
achievement. They are also embarking on more ambitious and wide-ranging reforms in
the context of the forthcoming five-year development plan, including the far-reaching
energy price reform. My authorities highly appreciate the technical assistance and policy
advice provided by the IMF as they set to tackle challenging tasks in the period ahead.
