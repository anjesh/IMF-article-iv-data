STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 7, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. Tonga is expected to revert to a moderate growth path in the coming years,
after a contraction in 2012/13. Reconstruction works in the aftermath of Cyclone Ian in 2014 and
the preparation for the 2019 Sixteenth South Pacific Games (the Pacific Games) should support
growth over the medium term. Inflation is expected to remain low, reflecting weak global
commodity prices. International reserves reached a record level in 2013/14, thanks to continued
inflows of grants and remittances. The fiscal position has improved, but near-term spending
pressures remain high. The main risks arise from a protracted period of slower growth in advanced
and emerging economies, potential cost-overrun of the Games, and natural disasters.
Challenges. Medium-term challenges center on raising Tonga’s growth potential through
improving the business climate to support private sector development. Ensuring external and price
stability and fostering financial soundness are also important to reduce vulnerabilities.
Key policy advice. Key policy recommendations are to: (i) gradually improve the primary fiscal
balance to ensure fiscal sustainability; (ii) maintain international reserves at the current level to
bolster resilience to shocks; (iii) replace the current inflation reference range with a lower reference
rate in line with the medium-term inflation trend; (iv) address macro-financial risks by preparing
tools to manage excess liquidity and avoid rapid credit growth in the future; and (v) implement
business-enabling structural reforms and improve public sector performance to enhance potential
growth.

CONTEXT
1.
Setting. Tonga is a small agriculture-based open economy in the South Pacific with a narrow
production base and low connectivity, resulting in high transportation costs, limited economies of
scale, and low diversification (Figure 1). Tonga’s high dependence on remittances, foreign aid and
imported energy poses challenges as it increases the economy’s sensitivity to exogenous shocks.
Other exogenous vulnerabilities stem from natural disasters (e.g., severe cyclones affected Tonga in
1982, 1991 and 2014).

Political developments. The second general election for the Legislative Assembly was held
in November, 2014. A new prime minister was elected in December and took office in January 2015.
The previous finance minister and the central bank governor remain in office. King Tupou VI’s official
coronation is scheduled for July 2015, following his accession to the throne in March 2012.
3.
Traction. The authorities have made progress on key policy advice outlined in the last Article
IV consultation. In the 2014 staff report, staff emphasized the importance of preserving a prudent
fiscal policy stance and continuing to expedite financial sector reform. The authorities have
continued to apply the No New Loan policy (no external borrowing) while amending it to allow for
concessional budget support provided by development partners. They adopted the Public Financial
Management Reform Roadmap in 2014. The authorities also strengthened risk-based supervision,
including through PFTAC technical assistance. They are also expected to enact the Receivership bill
this year, although progress in business-friendly legal issues (e.g., a bankruptcy law) remains partial.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Recent developments. Economic growth is estimated to have recovered to around
2 percent in 2013/14, following a sharp contraction in 2012/13 induced by the completion of a large
capital project.1 2 Inflation has remained subdued in recent years, ranging between 0 to 3 percent per

annum, mainly reflecting low global food prices and, more recently, dramatically weaker global oil
prices. This is significantly lower than the current CPI inflation reference range of 6 to 8 percent set
by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) in 2011 (Figure 2). The external position has been
strengthened, owing largely to increased grant inflows, which have raised international reserves to
around 6½ months of prospective imports, well in excess of the NRBT’s target range of 3–4 months
of imports (Figure 3).

commodity prices.
6.
Risks. The overall balance of risks is tilted to the downside (Appendix I). On external risks,
spillovers from a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies could
weigh on Tonga, mainly due to its close ties with Australia and New Zealand through aid,
remittances, trade and tourism. On the upside, Tonga would benefit as a net commodity importer if
oil and food prices remain low for an extended period of time (Box 1). On domestic risks, slippages
in delivering on policy reforms could affect the level of development partners’ budget support,
leading to lower aid inflows. Any potential cost overruns relating to the Pacific Games could make it
necessary to mobilize additional resources. Natural disasters similar to recent cyclones could also
take a toll on the economy (with average annual damage of around 4 percent of GDP—see Figure
1—indicating the level of risk).

Authorities’ Views
7.
The authorities broadly concurred with the overall economic assessment, while stating
that they expected higher growth over the medium term. They considered that the expected
investment in a major hotel, the government’s reform efforts, and private sector development
accompanied by accelerated credit growth would provide more impetus to economic activity. They
forecast that near-term inflation could be temporarily negative, depending on energy price
developments and offsetting effects from higher domestic food prices. On external risks, they agreed
that spillovers could be expected through the remittance and trade channels, and are of the view
that remittances will probably rise, albeit at a weaker growth rate of remittances, reflecting the
favorable growth outlook of the U.S.

Box 1. Tonga: The Macroeconomic Impact of Lower Oil Prices 1/
As a net oil importer, Tonga is expected to benefit from the recent decline in oil prices in the short
term, with a favorable impact on growth, inflation, the trade balance and the fiscal balance. As
a second round effect, remittances could also be positively affected as key host countries for expatriate
Tongans are also net oil importers. However, if the price drops are sustained, prospective investment in
renewable energies could be discouraged.
Growth. Lower fuel prices would stimulate domestic demand via a rise in private disposable income
and corporate profitability. This would boost several activities, especially in the service sectors (e.g.,
distribution, transport), which could prop up the near-term growth rates.
Inflation. The lower import price of oil will ease inflationary pressures, mainly through driving down
domestic costs of transportation. Electricity prices are also adjusted in line with the change in the
import price of oil. This price effect would dominate the impact of higher domestic demand on
inflation. The CPI inflation rate is expected to fall by 0.3 percentage point in 2014/15 and 0.2 in
2015/16.
Trade. Fuel imports account for almost
30 percent of total imports in Tonga. The
value of fuel imports should fall since the
effect of lower import costs should exceed
the impact of possible increases in fuel
demand. The lower fuel costs could also
lower transportation costs deemed to be
a significant portion of costs of imports, given
the remoteness of Tonga. As a result, the
current account is expected to improve in the
near term.
Fiscal. Revenues from import tariffs and VAT
would be reduced through lower imports,
while higher domestic demand may increase tax revenue. On the spending side, the authorities could
save some fuel-related expenditure on the margin, while there is no fuel subsidy in Tonga. Overall, the
fiscal balance could improve slightly by 0.1 percentage points both in 2014/15 and 2015/16.
Remittances. Key source countries for the remittances to Tonga are net oil importers including the
U.S. and New Zealand. A boost to activity in these countries would favorably affect the inflow of
remittances to Tonga, and thus help stimulate domestic demand.
Investment in mineral exploration and renewable energies. A prolonged period of low energy
prices, however, could discourage future investment in deep-water mining as well as renewable
energies.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: NAVIGATING A STABLE COURSE
Policy discussions centered on navigating a stable macroeconomic course in terms of fiscal, external,
price and financial stability and on raising potential growth over the medium term.

A. Building a Sound Fiscal Position
8.
Tonga’s fiscal position has improved, supported by large grant inflows, but spending
pressures will remain high in the near term. The overall balance improved to a surplus of around
1 percent of GDP in 2013/14, partly due to grant inflows, but is expected to revert to a deficit in
2014/15. Spending pressures in the near-term include: i) cyclone-related reconstruction work;
ii) wage pressures from the civil servants association; and iii) preparations for the 2019 South Pacific
Games. Most of the reconstruction work, which contributes to the ramp up in capital expenditure in
2014/15, has so far been met by strong grant inflows mainly from World Bank and Asian
Development Bank, but strong projected tax revenue performance in 2014/15 is also expected to
play a funding role (text table).

Medium-term fiscal challenges center on maintaining prudent debt management and
implementing public financial management reforms. Tonga’s public debt currently stands at
around 50 percent of GDP, and given its vulnerability to external shocks, it is important to maintain
a prudent debt policy. The staff welcomes the government’s conservative borrowing policy (that is,
no external commercial borrowing and only limited concessional borrowing) and the agreement with
China EXIM Bank to defer repayment of principal on previous loans for a period of five years. As
a result, the mission’s debt sustainability analysis indicates that Tonga remains at moderate risk of
debt distress. The authorities’ plan to finance the Pacific Games using non-debt creating funds (for
example, the Pacific Games revenue, franchises, and donations) is fiscally prudent. Cost overruns
could, however, necessitate borrowing, which could jeopardize fiscal sustainability. Tonga introduced
a three-year budget framework in 2013 and adopted a roadmap for public financial management
reform in 2014, but has not yet set a clear fiscal target for the medium-term.

Against this backdrop, it is imperative to

excluding grants as a key performance indicator.
Measures to create such a primary surplus include: i) improving tax administration on consumption
tax (for example, reducing the number of zero ratings and exemptions, undertaking a regular review
of tax incentives); ii) restraining the wage bill in line with the authorities’ target (e.g., continuation of
hire freeze, more efficient staffing); and iii) improving the quality and efficiency of spending through
ongoing public financial management reforms (Appendix II). The Fund stands ready to provide
technical assistance to support these fiscal reforms through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Center (PFTAC). Finalizing the debt management strategy, with technical assistance by the World
Bank is also critical to lay a solid foundation for prudent debt management.
11.
The spending program for the Pacific Games needs to be carefully managed. Staff
recommend that the authorities enhance controls on the spending program for the Pacific Games,
and caution that the current proposal by the South Pacific Games Committee to raise funds by
imposing a levy on foreign exchange transactions could give rise to exchange restrictions subject to
Fund approval. Staff have requested further information from the authorities regarding the proposed
levy in order to assess its jurisdictional implications. Another proposal to raise funds by imposing an
additional departure tax should be carefully studied, in order to determine how much of an adverse
effect such a tax would have on tourist arrivals. Against this backdrop, staff also stresses the
importance of maintaining a prudent fiscal stance and building sound fiscal positions to bolster
resilience to shocks.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views including the need for a mediumterm fiscal anchor. They noted that the adoption of a roadmap for public financial management
reform and the Debt Management Strategy could form the basis for a medium-term fiscal
framework. The authorities aim to further broaden the tax base and strengthen administration, and
plan to undertake an expenditure review of all government programs to improve the quality of
public spending. They also concurred with the need to restrain the public sector wage bill, and noted
that they would like to review technical issues (e.g., coverage of wages) before establishing an
explicit monitoring benchmark. They also highlighted that more efficient inter-ministerial staff
allocations would be helpful in this regard.
13.
The authorities are aware of the potential cost overruns of the Pacific Games. They plan
to control cost, for instance, by utilizing existing facilities for the Pacific Games (e.g., using school as
8

TONGA

accommodation facilities). The authorities confirmed their prudent stance of not using debt-creating
flows to finance the Pacific Games, and that they would consult with the Fund on the possible
introduction of foreign exchange levy and increasing the departure tax for overseas travel.

B. Safeguarding External Stability
14.
Large grants and remittances in recent years have helped Tonga build up adequate
international reserve buffers. The current account deficit is projected to be around 5 percent of
GDP in 2014/15, and to move around 2-5 percent of GDP in the medium term, while international
reserves are expected to remain above the NRBT’s comfort zone of 3–4 months of imports. The
increase in foreign assets, largely due to grant inflows, has also contributed to the rise in domestic
liquidity. Grant inflows have been relatively stable, reflecting Tonga’s favorable performance in policy
reforms, and the remittance inflows have also been stable, reflecting diversified sources (e.g., the U.S.,
New Zealand and Australia).
15.
Maintaining international reserves at the current level will help safeguard external
stability. Overall, staff’s assessment indicates that reserve holdings (in months of imports) are
adequate in light of the need to absorb frequent external shocks and the low opportunity cost of
holding reserves in Tonga (Box 2). The pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands has served the
country well. Staff’s exchange rate assessment suggests that the current level of the exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3). In addition, other indicators (for example, tourist arrivals)
continue to show no significant loss of competitiveness for Tonga.

Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities concurred with staff’s exchange rate assessments. On the foreign reserve
adequacy, the authorities recognized the merit of the staff’s policy recommendation to safeguard
external stability, but they believed that 3–4 months of import cover is a more realistic target for
Tonga, partly because the high level of reserves in recent years was due to delays in implementation
of donor-funded projects and hence may not be sustainable.

C. Ensuring Price Stability
17.
Tonga has adopted an informal inflation reference range. Pursuing an inflation range in
the context of a fixed exchange rate regime is challenging, although limited capital flows and the
wide bands around the exchange rate target give the NRBT some room for maneuver. A weak
transmission mechanism of monetary policy, the current accommodative monetary conditions, and
Tonga’s sensitivity to external price shocks also complicate the task of controlling inflation. In fact,
inflation has consistently been below the reference range (currently at 6 to 8 percent), raising
questions about the usefulness of the band.
18.
The authorities should consider replacing the current inflation reference range with a
lower reference rate. Setting it in line with Tonga’s medium term inflation forecast (e.g., using the
IMF staff’s forecast of 3.5 percent) would help better clarify what would informally guide monetary
policy. The new reference rate would need to be clearly communicated to the public, but should be
reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with economic fundamentals (Appendix III).

Box 2. Tonga: Assessing Reserve Adequacy 1/
Tonga’s international reserves have grown rapidly since the global financial crisis, mainly due to grants
and remittance inflows. In 2013/14 reserve holdings peaked at US$153 million. This corresponds to
more than 7 months of goods and service
imports and is well in excess of the NRBT’s lower
bound of 3 to 4 months of import cover
(Figure 1). Tonga’s reserve position also exceeds
levels recommended by standard “rules of
thumb” such as coverage of 3 months of imports
of goods and services, 100 percent of short-term
debt and 20 percent of broad money in the
economy (Table 1). The standard IMF formula for
assessing reserve adequacy (IMF, 2011) yields
minimum adequate reserves for Tonga of US$61
million or 14 percent of GDP, less than half of the
NRBT’s actual reserve holdings in 2012/13.2 A
comparison between actual reserves and
benchmark metrics thus raises the question of
whether reserve holdings in Tonga might be
excessive.
A cost-benefit analysis developed by DablaNorris et al. (2011) allows for the determination of
optimal levels of reserves specifically for low
income countries.3 This framework maximizes the
net benefit of holding international reserves by
balancing the cost of reserves and the benefits of
precautionary reserve holdings as insurance
against adverse external shocks. Calibrating the
model for Tonga yields optimal levels of reserves
in the range of 5 to 10 months of import cover
depending on assumptions about the cost of
holding reserves (Figure 2). The opportunity cost
of holding reserves can be approximated by the
difference between real returns on short-term
foreign currency assets and alternative domestic investments. For Tonga, the interest differential for
government bonds and 3-month U.S. government treasury bills could be a proxy for the cost of
holding reserves. The differential of roughly 3 percent implies optimal reserve holdings equivalent to
6 to 7 months of imports coverage.
Overall, reserve holdings are adequate in light of the large benefits of absorbing frequent external
shocks and the low cost of holding reserves for Tonga.

Box 3. Tonga: Exchange Rate and Competitiveness 1/
Tonga’s real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. Other
indicators suggest that the economy remains competitive.
Exchange rate
 Tonga’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is
broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. The purchasing power parity
approach suggests an undervaluation by
around 6 percent, while the equilibrium real
exchange rate approach indicates an
overvaluation by 15 percent.
Other indicators
 Reserves. Gross international reserves are
adequate and rising, and reached a level of
7 months of prospective imports in 2013/14.
 Exports. Exports recovered quickly from a temporary slump during the global financial crisis,
and have grown moderately in recent years. In the medium term, exports are projected to
grow at an annual rate of 9 percent.
 Number of tourists. The number of tourists has increased steadily as Tonga is becoming a
more attractive tourist destination.
 Costs of doing business. Tonga remains competitive compared with other PICs, according to
the World Bank’s Doing Business 2015 report. Relative strengths include access to credit,
contract enforcements and the low administrative burden involved in paying taxes and starting
a business. There is room for improvement in terms of protecting investors and registering
property.

range. They indicated that the range should be lowered and replaced by a rate, however, they would
need to analyze the appropriate level over the medium term, partly because Tonga is a price taker
and its inflation is susceptible to external shocks. They also noted that a lower reference rate would
necessitate frequent revisions of the reference rate, should inflation rebound in the future due to an
unexpected external shock. They emphasized the difficulty of having monetary policy influence the
inflation rate, which is why the NRBT is not targeting inflation. The authorities expressed their
interest in further developing their monetary policy framework and operational tools, with technical
assistance from the Fund.

D. Fostering Financial Stability
20.
Tangible progress has been made in repairing banks’ balance sheets and strengthening
the legal framework, but challenges to financial stability remain. At present the financial system
is bank-centered, comprising one government-owned bank (the Tonga Development Bank) and four
commercial banks, one of which has only recently been established. Non-bank financial institutions
(for example, provident funds, credit unions, microfinance institutions) are relatively small, and have
been expanding only gradually. Key issues include:


Improvements in banks’ capital and credit quality. Asset quality in the banking system was
deteriorated (e.g., higher non-performing loans (NPL)) during the global financial crisis, but most
of Tonga’s banks subsequently improved their capital positions. While NPL ratios have declined
to less than 13 percent in 2013/14 down from around 20 percent in 2008/09 (Table 6), the level
remains high.



Excess reserves. Excess reserves have been
large in recent years, hovering around 25
percent of total bank assets. The increase in
international reserves and limited sterilization
has led to a large injection of liquidity to the
banking system.

PICs: Excess Reserves

TONGA

21.
Banks’ excess reserves mirror weak private credit growth. Despite the authorities’ efforts
to stimulate lending through accommodative monetary policies, credit growth has been sluggish
due to constraints from both the supply and demand side (e.g., limited collateral, lack of investment
opportunities) (Appendix IV). The authorities have embarked on different initiatives to support credit
growth, through, for instance, an on-lending scheme administered by Tonga Development Bank
designed to channel funds at favorable terms to selected sectors of the economy (e.g., agriculture,
manufacturing). It is important that the authorities carefully examine the effectiveness of this onlending scheme before scaling up its size. In addition, the establishment of Tonga Business
Enterprise Center (TBEC) to assist private businesses with the development of business plans and
loan applications is a welcome development.
22.
Financial risks can be mitigated through active liquidity management, the introduction
of macro-prudential tools, and improved bank supervision.


Managing macro-financial risks. Current high levels of excess liquidity do not pose an immediate
risk to financial sector stability, but better tools to manage liquidity are needed to help avoid
excessive credit growth in the future. Possible measures to absorb excess reserves include selling
treasury bills and raising reserve requirements. Macro-prudential measures (e.g., loan-to-value
ratios) could also play a role in safeguarding financial stability.



Improving banking supervision. Enhanced monitoring of banks’ asset quality (e.g., through riskbased on-site inspection to make sure that loan loss provisions are adequate) is important to
ensure financial stability. This work could be strengthened in coordination with the PFTAC
advisor on banking supervision.

Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agreed on the need to absorb excess liquidity to help manage macrofinancial risks. They recognized the importance of structural reforms to create an environment
conducive to more investment opportunities. They were also mindful that higher statutory reserve
deposit (SRD) requirements might increase lending rates and/or fees and charges, and reduce credit
supply to the private sector, particularly small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, they
plan to learn from other Pacific countries’ experiences (e.g., Fiji and Samoa) as to how to stimulate
lending to the private sector especially for SMEs. The effectiveness of the government’s Managed
Funds (e.g., Economic Growth Facility in the Tonga Development Bank) in stimulating credit growth
will be assessed in conjunction with any other measures that may be introduced. The NRBT agreed
to use macro-prudential tools to manage macro-financial risks, and noted that they will continue to
closely monitor credit growth and examine its impact on monetary policy targets and financial
stability.
24.
The authorities committed to further strengthen banking supervision. This activity is
currently assisted by the IMF PFTAC expert. They indicated that the supervision of non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) (e.g., retirement fund, credit union, micro-credit institution) is a new challenge,
and requested continued technical assistance support to help develop the legislative and regulatory
framework for NBFIs.

E. Raising Tonga’s Growth Potential
25.
Raising potential growth remains a key challenge. Tonga’s per capita GNP growth over
the past two decades was favorable when
compared with other non-resource rich Pacific
Islands peers, lifting Tonga to the ranks of
middle-income countries. Tonga also compares
favorably with other PICs in terms of living
standards (e.g., high life expectancy at birth) and
its business climate. Nevertheless, private sector
activity and FDI remain relatively small. In the
absence of reform measures over the medium
term, longer-term growth would revert to its
historical average of around 1¾ percent, once
cyclone reconstruction work and Pacific Gamesrelated activities are complete.

26.
There are several government initiatives to raise Tonga’s growth potential. Tonga’s
Strategic Development Framework (TSDF), which is currently under the revision to TSDF II, aims to
further develop the primary sector (agriculture, forestry and fishery) and tourism as key sources of
growth. The Tonga Energy Road Map 2010-2020 aims to reduce Tonga’s vulnerability to oil price
shocks and to improve the cost-effectiveness of

to external markets (Appendix V).

27.
Business-enabling structural reforms to promote private sector development remain
crucial. Promoting private sector development through further improvements in the business
climate, together with more business-friendly laws and regulations (for example, revising the Foreign
Investment Act, introducing new legislation on receivership bankruptcy) is critical. As in most small
states, the contribution of the public sector to the economy will remain relatively large in Tonga.
Therefore, enhancing public financial management with an appropriate medium-term fiscal
framework would improve growth potential. Prioritizing expenditure toward growth enhancing and
social spending categories (health, education, and infrastructure) would also promote greater
inclusiveness.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities agreed that structural reforms are critical to raise growth potential.
They noted that the revamped Tongan Strategic Development Framework has identified strategies
for lifting potential growth rate to around 3 percent in the next 10 years. The authorities continued
to see growth potential in the agricultural and tourism sector, and also indicated that new activities,
such as call centers could be promising. The authorities expect to make significant progress in
revising the Foreign Direct Investment Act and enacting the Receivership Bill to create more
transparent business transactions later this year. They also intend to continue their efforts to make
SOEs more efficient, including via commercialization of Tonga Development Bank (TDB).

OTHER ISSUES
29.
Data issues. In staff’s view, Tonga’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, but improvements in data quality and data dissemination are needed (see the
Statistical Issues in the Informational Annex). Better-quality statistics will be imperative to strengthen
decision making by investors and policy makers. It is also important to implement previous TA
recommendations, including the ones recently provided on national account statistics and external
sector statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Tonga’s economy has rebounded and the outlook is favorable, while risks remain tilted
to the downside. Growth is recovering and is expected to average 2–3 percent during the next five
years, mainly supported by construction and tourism on the back of several large events (the
coronation and the Pacific Games). Inflation is projected to remain low, reflecting the weak outlook
for global commodity prices. International reserves are expected to stay comfortable at around
6 months of prospective imports largely, thanks to grants and remittances. The balance of risks is
tilted to the downside. External risks involve spillovers from a protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies, which could weigh on Tonga, mainly through its close economic
ties with Australia and New Zealand. On the domestic side, potential cost overruns related to the
Pacific Games continue to pose downside risks.
31.
The authorities should contain fiscal spending pressures in the near-term and build a
sound fiscal position to bolster resilience to shocks over the medium term. Near-term fiscal
pressures stem mostly from potentially large wage increases for civil servants, which can be
contained by more efficient staff allocation in order to moderate the share of the wage bill in
recurrent spending over the medium term. Controlling the spending program for the Pacific Games
is also important to avoid cost overruns. The adoption of a roadmap for public financial
management reform and the debt management strategy would lay the groundwork for a mediumterm fiscal framework. Continued efforts to increase tax revenue by broadening the tax base and
strengthening tax administration could create more room for priority social spending and public
investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

TONGA

32.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate in view of the weak
economy and low inflation, while large excess liquidity calls for better liquidity management
to mitigate macro-financial risk. Preserving the current level of international reserves would help
ensure external stability, and lowering the inflation reference rate would better anchor inflation
expectations over the medium term. Although the presence of excess liquidity does not pose an
imminent risk to financial sector soundness in the near term, the authorities should prepare to
manage macro-financial risks by improving liquidity management and adopting macro-prudential
tools. The progress in improving banks’ balance sheets and strengthening the legal framework in the
financial sector is welcome.
33.
Structural reforms remain imperative to raising Tonga’s potential growth. Progress in
updating Tonga’s strategic development framework (TSDF II) is welcome. Steadfast implementation
of the authorities’ reform plan is crucial to make growth more sustainable and inclusive.
Implementing key initiatives, such as revising the Foreign Investment Act, would help improve the
business climate and promote private sector development.
34.
Implementing TA recommendations are important for successful reforms. Improving
the quality of data statistics will also help policy formulation and facilitate private sector decisions. In
view of limited resources, better coordination and prioritization of Tonga’s prospective TA program
is needed. The IMF/PFTAC would continue to provide the bulk of technical assistance, in
coordination with other development partners.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard 12month cycle.

Preserve fiscal and external policy
space to cope with adverse shocks in
the short term. In the longer term,
boost public investment, and pursue
structural reforms to improve the

DOMESTIC RISKS
Slippages in the execution of policy reform
Slippages in the reform process could derail
critical reforms agreed with development partners.
Such an outcome could affect grant flows for
budget support, resulting in a significantly larger
gross financing gap.
Cost overrun relating to the 2019 South Pacific Games
Underestimating the true cost of construction
works could make it necessary to mobilize
additional resources and might necessitate
corrective fiscal consolidation in the long run.
Natural disaters (regional)
Natural disasters similar to the recent cyclone
could take significant toll on Tonga, such as
damages to infrastructure and production base.

and streamlining the Games, to redress
impaired confidence and re-energize
support by the donors.

Prepare for future disaster by: (i)
building fiscal space and international
reserve buffers, (ii) designing a

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially after the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and "high" a probability of
30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with
the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Public Financial Management Reform1
A well-functioning Public Financial Management (PFM) system contributes to economic stability and
growth by improving the use of public resources and strengthening governance. In the case of
Tonga, where foreign aid plays an important role in economic development, effective PFM also
provides assurance to donor countries that aid is used in a transparent and efficient manner.
PFM in Tonga has improved in the past decade, but considerable weakness still exists. In the 2007
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, Tonga received 7 ratings of “A/B”
of the 27 applicable performance indicators. This

time, areas including oversight of fiscal risks from
public enterprises, composition of expenditure out-turn compared to budget, and quality and
timeliness of in-year budget reports have been improved from ratings of “C/D” to “A/B”.
Nonetheless, some PFM areas continue to be weak, such as the implementation of the three-year
rolling medium-term budgeting framework, effectiveness of tax collection, and internal and external
audit. In particular, performance in two areas has deteriorated since the 2010 assessment. They are
processes for public procurement (from “C” to “D”) and effectiveness of payroll controls (from “B+”
to ‘C+”).
The government of Tonga attaches high importance to PFM reform, which is considered critical to
long-term growth. In October 2014, the Cabinet endorsed the PFM reform Roadmap which aims to
improve critical PFM areas based on the 2014 assessment. The Roadmap proposes a total of
77 phased actions to be completed before 2019 and emphasizes the following priority areas:
 strengthening the effectiveness of tax collection and internal audit;
 enhancing and upgrading the Government Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS);
 better integrating planning, budgeting, and aid management functions; and

 ensuring adequate staff capacity in all PFM units in line ministries and public agencies,
through new recruitment or strengthening capacity of existing staff.
The Roadmap recognizes the importance of effective communication with stakeholders and proper
sequencing of the reform actions. However, potential areas of weakness exist:
 the timing for the IFMIS upgrade is ambitious, and the Roadmap appears more focused on
equipment updates than on business process redesign to improve internal management;
 actions may not be adequate to address the effectiveness of payroll controls, a PFM area which
has deteriorated in the 2014 assessment; and
 the discussion of devolution of PFM responsibilities needs to be managed carefully to avoid
unintended consequences (for example, less coordinated budgeting and lack of consistency)

Appendix III. Moving to Inflation Point Reference System1
The NRBT uses an inflation reference range of 6 to 8 percent, which has remained unchanged since
2011, despite a fall in Tongan inflation after the global financial crisis. Actual inflation has been
consistently below the reference range since then, raising questions about the usefulness of the
range. The NRBT could introduce an inflation reference rate along the following lines:


Introducing an inflation
reference rate. A benchmark for
inflation would be useful for
facilitating internal policy
discussions and coordination,
including with the Ministry of
Finance and National Planning
(MOFNP). A reference rate rather
than range would be more suitable
for this purpose. The rate could be
set equal to the medium-term
inflation forecast (e.g., use IMF
staff’s forecast of 3.5 percent),
which should be reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with economic fundamentals.



Policy coordination and discussion. The central bank could use the reference rate in their
assessment of economic developments and outlook during their periodic review of monetary
policy setting. The central bank should share their assessment with the Ministry of Finance
and National Planning (MOFNP) and discuss policy coordination.



Improve communication. The rationale for choosing an inflation reference rate and the use
of it should be clearly communicated to the public. The NRBT could also mention that the
inflation reference rate reflects what the NRBT sees as consistent with medium-term
fundamentals of the Tongan economy. The NRBT’s Monetary Policy Statement could also
explain deviation from the reference rate, as well as the authorities’ intended policy reaction.

Appendix IV. Impediments to Credit Growth1
Despite accommodative monetary policy and ample liquidity in the banking sector, credit to the private
sector has declined since the global financial crisis and remained weak in recent years. To implement
effective policies for reviving credit growth, it is important to identify whether banks are reluctant to lend
(supply-side constraint) or whether firms and households are unwilling to borrow (demand-side
constraint). In Tonga, both demand- and supply-side constraints seem to limit credit growth, but supplyside constraints might be easier to address by policymakers.



Demand-Side Constraints. A moderate growth outlook, limited investment opportunities and
low expected returns are important constraints to credit demand in Tonga. High interest rates
and unattractive lending conditions also reduce borrowing. Although lending rates for both
households and businesses have gradually fallen in recent years, they remain elevated at roughly
8 percent. The requirement to pledge land as collateral entails risks that small borrowers are
unwilling to take. Furthermore, many businesses and households still struggle to service past debt
obligations. The availability of alternative funding sources might also have reduced the demand
for bank credit. While Tonga does not have a corporate bond market, lending by micro-finance
institutions, retirement funds, credit cooperatives and money lenders has gained in importance in
recent years.



Supply-Side Constraints. Several commercial banks in Tonga experienced large loan losses
during the global financial crisis, and focused on repairing their balance sheets in the following
years, thus limiting their ability to expand lending. Partially as a result of this experience, lending
practices by banks have become more conservative after the crisis. Banks typically require
borrowers to pledge collateral or to make an equity contribution to the business project. Small
borrowers often lack the means to contribute equity to the project. Land tends to be the only
asset that could qualify as collateral, but a lengthy land registration process and a limited
secondary market for land reduce the value of land as collateral to banks. Furthermore,
information provided by Tonga’s credit bureau is perceived as incomplete, complicating the
process of screening borrowers. As a result, banks tend to concentrate on extending credit to
larger established businesses, and shy away from lending to SMEs.

Appendix V. Challenges to Growth1
Tonga faces considerable challenges to achieving higher economic growth, many of which are shared
with its Pacific island neighbors. Nations that move up from Tonga’s level of income most often do so by
exporting competitive manufactures or building industries to serve large domestic markets.2 Neither are
viable growth strategies for Tonga. The South Pacific islands countries, including Tonga, are the most
distant in the world from markets (on a GDP-weighted basis).3 This, on its own, heightens frictional trade
costs. With scale, such costs could be lowered but Tonga is also unable to exploit the economies of scale
required to bring down production costs because of its small size—a population of 100,000. Small size
and economic remoteness combine to produce more formidable barriers to growth than either would on
its own. For example, it is hard to service Tonga by large container vessels, which are the standard in
international shipping, thus increasing the cost of long-distance logistics.4
Despite the considerable challenges of size and location, there are viable growth strategies that countries
such as Tonga can and have successfully pursued to support growth and shared prosperity. Industries that
trade on the natural assets of the country, such as sustainable tourism, fisheries, agriculture and possibly
seabed mining are areas of potential. Tourism in particular offers the prospect of growth in supporting
industries including better use of domestic production base (e.g., agriculture), substituting for costly
imported products. Tonga has already taken significant steps towards creating a conducive environment
for growth. The figure below shows that Tonga performs better than the East Asia Pacific (EAP) average in
7 of the 10 measured areas, but significant constraints persist in registering property, investor protection
and insolvecy resolution.5
Tonga has made considerable infrastructure investments, including a new national fiber-optic cable,
renewable energy capacity and road network in the capital island. At the same time, the most often-cited
constraints to private sector development in Tonga remain, namely: i) risk and uncertainty; ii) high cost of
doing business; and iii) lack of access to markets. Growth-enhancing initiatives include:



First, there is scope to improve the predictability and certainty for business to support long-term
planning by reducing ambiguity, discretion and gaps in law and regulation, by putting in place clear,
unambiguous and appropriate legislation built on consultation and which is clearly communicated to
the public. Areas of importance are in labor market regulation, trade taxation, discretionary tax
exemptions and foundational law for formal credit markets to function properly. Work underway on
the Foreign Investment Act and supporting legislative revisions will also be important.



Second, using a combination of development partner-supported infrastructure investment, targeted
policy reforms and effective regulation could reduce business costs such as energy and logistics.



Third, Tonga could seek to strengthen external partnerships that support improved market access and
promote collective (regional) solutions to public goods provision and facilitate cross-border economic
activity. Pro-development relationships with donor countries need to prioritize the economic benefit
for Tonga by facilitating and lowering the barriers to much larger markets. Regional partnerships
could aim to solve collective action problems by fostering strong cooperative action, which will yield
greater benefits for all.

system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. Since February 11, 1991, the value of the pa’anga is determined based on a weighted
basket of currencies comprising the United States, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, with the
U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2014, the Fijian dollar was added to the basket
replacing the Japanese yen, and, in July 2010, the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised to
5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed since March 1998, when the allowance for adjustment
was introduced.

Technical Assistance
The Legal Department (LEG) provided assistance on AML/CFT issues for the Pacific islands countries,
including Tonga, from 2002 through 2005. LEG also provided assistance on the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga Act and Financial Institutions Act from 2013 to 2014. PFTAC has, on an on-going
basis, provided assistance on budgetary management; tax administration; banking legislation and
supervision; and balance of payments and national accounts statistics.

PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(PFTAC) COUNTRY STRATEGY 2015–161
Background
Tonga continues to face a difficult macroeconomic environment. The global economic crisis has
led to a sustained period of slow growth, undermining both fiscal and financial stability. Nonperforming loans in the banking system remain high, while fiscal policy options are tightly
constrained by the high level of public external debt.
This has been particularly so in the public financial management (PFM) area where PFTAC and the
Asian Development Bank (AsDB) have worked with the authorities to design and implement
a realistic reform roadmap. The Roadmap was recently endorsed by the Cabinet. TA has also been
provided in the compilation of National Accounts in collaboration with an AusAID (now DFAT)
funded resident statistics advisor and in Balance of Payments Statistics. Support has also been
provided to the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) in off-site and on-site banking supervision.
Strategy 2015–16
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy and is planned within the results
framework for current PFTAC funding cycle.2
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and to
improve the macroeconomic environment. PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader
development partner groups to ensure coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions
in the development partners’ budget support reform matrix. Inputs are expected in all sectors,
primarily at the strategic level in the fiscal and statistics sectors with detailed training and capacity
building in bank supervision and macroeconomics.
In the public financial management area, the focus will primarily be to assist the authorities to
implement high priority reforms identified in the Roadmap, including Treasury business process
improvements (1.7); and planning for upgrading the government’s FMIS (1.7). PFTAC will also
support ADB projects aimed at developing an effective medium-term budget framework
(1.6) including producing more accurate macroeconomic analysis; (5.1) and more rigorous cash/debt
management (1.7). In the medium term, PFTAC would look to assist the authorities implement
a follow-up PEFA assessment, probably in 2015 (1.1).
In the revenue area, the main focus remains on assisting the authorities to continue with
implementation of the recommendations of the October 2011 PFTAC strategic revenue review.
A PFTAC revenue administration mission conducted in October 2014 evaluated progress on these
recommendations, the majority of which have now been implemented. Further PFTAC assistance

was provided to: (a) facilitate implementation of the new Small Business Tax which came into force
on August 1, 2014 (2.2, 2.3) ; (b) provide advice on the management of consumption tax credits
(2.4); and (c) prepare the Income Tax Amendment Bill for a new deep sea mining regime (2.2 2.3)–
this legislation was recently passed. The existing corporate strategy has been updated and sets the
foundation for the design of enhanced strategies and operational plans (2.8).
A number of additional PFTAC tax administration recommendations have been accepted by the
authorities and a technical assistance plan agreed to – this will include the development of a
compliance improvement strategy and the establishment of a risk management unit (2.4 2.5). Two
new AusDFAT revenue advisors are in place and have made a significant contribution to improving
core tax functions. The ADB, with the assistance of the Australian Government, is providing
assistance in the upgrade of current IT systems (2.6) which will further streamline operations and
reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Tonga remains one of the regional leaders in implementing
modern revenue administration practices confirmed by an upward shift reflected in the PFTAC
baseline assessment tool.
In statistics, Tonga is relatively well advanced against the overall results framework; based on
PFTAC advice, it produces National Accounts on two independent measures (4.1) with production of
a range of income indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics are now being developed
according to BPM6 standards (4.9). However, the quality of statistics and source data need to be
strengthened. The Tonga Bureau of Statistics was assisted during 2011 and 2012 by an AusAID (now
DFAT) funded resident advisor, with the result that direct PFTAC assistance was minimal during this
period. PFTAC continued to coordinate with and be a resource for the resident advisor and to
provide focused technical inputs in particular areas. Limited re-engagement with Tonga resumed
during 2014 and will continue in 2015. Balance of payments and Government Finance Statistics
support have been provided by IMF HQ.
In financial sector supervision, IMF/PFTAC over the past few years assisted the NRBT in with the
deployment of standard prudential returns (3.1) and with establishing enhanced off-site analysis
(3.3). These currently enable the NRBT to prepare regular off-site analysis and monitoring reports
from the sector. Intensive support is being provided in FY2015/16 to develop on-site supervision
techniques by providing technical advisory mentorship in performing the actual on-site examination
of a number of commercial banks (3.4, 3.5) which includes examination preparedness, scoping,
planning, execution, and report writing. The year 2015/16 will further see the introduction of a
comprehensive credit union program aimed at overhauling the oversight of credit unions (3.9).
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC continues to assist the Ministry of Finance and National
Planning (MOFNP) to strengthen its capacity in macroeconomic monitoring and forecasting (5.1) in
coordination with a resident macroeconomic adviser funded by the ADB. Staffs of National Reserve
Bank of Tonga (NRBT) and MOFNP participated in a regional fiscal analysis and forecasting
workshop held jointly by PFTAC and the Singapore Regional Training Institute in March 2014 (5.2);
NRBT staff attended a regional seminar on monetary policy management, analysis and operation
held jointly by the Bank of England’s Centre for Central Bank Studies and PTAC in March 2014 (5.1)
and also a regional workshop on long-term fiscal planning held jointly by the ADB and PFTAC in
December 2014 (5.2).

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION1
The IMF team led by Mr. Yasuhisa Ojima (mission chief to Tonga) has a close working relationship
with the Bank team led by Mr. Robert Utz (lead economist, East Asia and the Pacific region). The
teams have an ongoing dialog on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues. The level of
cooperation and coordination is good and includes the following:


Article IV Consultation. The World Bank participated in the 2009–15 Article IV missions, as well
as joining several consultations and providing various analytical inputs to the Article IV Reports.
This participation facilitated the discussions, especially in areas of mutual interest such as fiscal
policy and structural reform. In addition, Bank and Fund staffs prepared jointly the Debt
Sustainability Analysis appendix to the staff reports.



Economic Updates. IMF analysis continues to provide a vital framework to the ongoing budget
support program, with IMF assessments used as the basis for decisions regarding the
appropriateness of the overall macroeconomic policy framework.



Structural Fiscal Reforms. Bank and Fund staffs have worked successfully to provide technical
assistance (TA) in public expenditure management and continue to collaborate on the ongoing
analytical work on public expenditure, the medium-term macro-framework, and general
structural issues.

Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and the Fund share a common view about Tonga’s
macroeconomic and structural reform priorities, which mainly aim at mitigating the risks to Tonga’s
external and fiscal sustainability and at promoting long-term growth. These include:


Sustainable fiscal management. Reconstruction financing requirements following the recent
cyclone and pressures for further increases in payroll spending pose challenges to fiscal
sustainability if not carefully managed. A priority for the authorities is to develop a clear policy
framework to guide any new borrowing to ensure that new borrowing supports high priority
investments and remains within sustainable limits. It will also be important to ensure that
renewed borrowing occurs alongside broader progress towards addressing fiscal challenges,
including improved revenue administration and expenditure control, and tighter prioritization of
expenditure, as well as structural reforms. The government’s fiscal efforts will need to be
supplemented by continued provision of grants from donors.



Making use of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement. This
remains critical for safeguarding external stability.



Promoting private drivers of growth. Given fundamental constraints of smallness and
isolation, growth prospects are likely to remain concentrated in areas where premiums can be
generated to cover higher costs of production. Natural resource industries, including tourism,
agriculture, fisheries and mining hold the greatest potential for private sector development. To
facilitate development in these areas there is a need to: (i) improve the efficiency and regulation

1

TONGA

of services such as energy, water and telecommunications in order to reduce costs;
(ii) strengthen the institutional framework for lending—including the enforcement of creditor
rights to collateral—as a means to increase access to finance and lower the cost of borrowing;
(iii) improve vital tourism infrastructure, including through the commercialization of Tonga
Communication Corporation; and (iv) lower regulatory barriers to foreign investment.
World Bank Group cooperation with Tonga is set out in a Country Assistance Strategy presented to
the Board in October 2010. Given the current depth of policy dialogue and Tonga’s difficult position,
the Bank is significantly scaling up both analytical and financial support for Tonga. Total IDA and
Trust Fund commitments to Tonga over the past five years amount to US$87 million, compared to
US$30 million between 1985–when Tonga became a member–and FY10.
A key focus of engagement has been around budget support operations. There have been annual
World Bank budget support operations for each of the five years FY2011 to FY2015 to provide
a total of US$25.8 million to support fiscal, business-environment improving, public financial
management and energy sector reforms as part of a World Bank-led multi-donor process.
Other World Bank investments are focused around connectivity for sustainable economic
development, and include: (i) a broadband cable, cofinanced with AsDB (US$17.2 million);
(ii) transport sector reform, with PRIF and AusAID financing (US$14.7 million); and (iii) aviation sector
support (US$27.2 million).
The World Bank Group provided TA to the Ministry of Revenue and Ministry of Finance and National
Planning during FY2015 to prepare a new Medium Term Debt Strategy. The World Bank Group is
also providing ongoing assistance to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning to support the
privatization of the International Dateline Hotel and to commercialize the operations of the Tonga
Development Bank and support in the development of a new central procurement database.
The Bank and Fund teams will continue their close cooperation going forward, particularly in
supporting the current program of budget support and to assist the Government in responding to
ongoing economic difficulties. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country
teams over the February 2015–January 2017 period. It was also agreed that further details on
collaboration, as necessary, will be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The goal of the Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) Pacific Approach 2010–2014 of a sustained and
resilient, improved standard of living aligns with the vision of the Tonga Strategic Development
Framework 2009/2010-2014/2015 (TSDF) to create a society in which all Tongans enjoy higher living
standards and a better quality of life. Similarly, the Pacific Approach, which serves as AsDB’s country
partnership strategy, aims to achieve its goal through inclusive and environmentally sustainable
growth, which is consistent with the TSDF vision of equitable and environmentally sustainable
private sector-led economic growth. AsDB’s Country Operations Business Plan 2015-2017 for Tonga
shares the same focus as the Pacific Approach and the TSDF.
The Pacific Approach focuses on the need to mitigate environmental impact and strengthen climate
change resilience through development of renewable energy options; enhancing connectivity via
multimodal networks and new technologies; and supporting urban development. Two key drivers of
change to promote the focus of the Pacific Approach include improved private sector environment
and public sector management. The priority outcome objectives of the TSDF supported by AsDB are:
(i) a dynamic public and private sector partnership as the main engine of growth; (ii) appropriate,
well-planned, and well-maintained infrastructure that improves the everyday lives of the people and
lowers the cost of doing business; and (iii) integration of environmental sustainability, disaster-risk
management, and climate change adaptation into planning and program implementation.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and 11 grants totaling US$140.32 million from the Asian Development
Fund (ADF) and other sources to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Sixty eight technical assistance
(TA) projects (including supplementary financing) with a value of US$22.12 million were also
provided to improve capacity and strengthen institutional development in various sectors. Past
AsDB investments have focused on finance and public sector development, and infrastructure
development in transport, power, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include five grant-financed projects and one TA project in the country portfolio. The
grant-financed projects support connectivity through the Tonga-Fiji Submarine Cable project;
service delivery through the Nuku'alofa Urban Sector Development project (with cofinancing from
Australia) and the Outer Island Renewable Energy project (with cofinancing from Australia); and
climate resilience through the Climate Resilience Sector project financed by the Strategic Climate
Fund. The Cyclone Ian Recovery project (with cofinancing from New Zealand) approved in 2014
reconstructs education and energy infrastructure on the Ha’apai Island group damaged by cyclone
Ian in January 2014. The ongoing TA project, with supplementary financing approved in 2014,
focuses on corporate planning and establishing a medium-term budget framework. Tonga also
benefits from a number of regional TA projects in private sector development, economic
management, energy efficiency, and public financial management. The AsDB is active in the joint
policy reform discourse with the Government of Tonga and other development partners.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
TONGA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

(As of March 26, 2015)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics Department (SD) and
the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP) have received, on a regular basis, technical assistance
(TA) in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments (BOP) statistics from the Fund’s
Statistics department (STA) as well as the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). Nevertheless,
data provision to the Fund continues with long delays.
National Accounts: The coverage of the national accounts data has widened in the past few years as a result
of enhanced TA, but there is still room for improvement With assistance from the AusAID (now DFAT)-funded
resident advisor, the 2009-10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) results were partially
incorporated in national accounts statistics. Customs data were supplemented with quarantine office data in
merchandize exports and in-kind donor-funded capital projects as well as loan financed projects. Labor market
statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003, although population census
2011 and HIES 2009 provide point-in-time data; and average earnings statistics are not available.
Price Statistics: The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2009 HIES. TA
was provided in 2008 on the development of an import price index, but trade data was not of sufficient quality
to produce indexes. The compilation of detailed international merchandise trade data is currently hampered by
technical problems.
Government Finance Statistics: The FY2002/03 Central Government Budget Statement introduced a
presentation of fiscal data compiled according to the methodology of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics
Manual. The budget presentation was migrated to GFSM 2001 with the FY 2014/15 budget. Improvements are
still needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Timeliness and ease and efficiency in reporting remain
an issue. Source data are often available with a significant time lag and in-year sub-annual reporting requires
considerable manual intervention. The financial accounting system has not been upgraded in some time and
as a result is not capable of capturing all transactions with much of the government’s financial business
processes and data collection completed on a manual basis. For example, the budget is compiled manually;
debt management is conducted outside of the financial accounts; aid revenue data is not included in the
financial accounts; and payments and receipts are both processed and recorded on a manual basis.
Reconciliation with monetary and balance of payments data requires enhancement and published data are
often subject to significant revisions. Consolidated financial statistics for the general government are not
published due to lack of source data and capacity and up until now, no data are reported for publication in the
GFS Yearbook (GFSY). Tonga is participating in the three-year GFS-IMF project for the Asia-Pacific region
funded by the government of Japan, and is committed to commence reporting for the GFSY.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Currently Tonga does not report FSIs to the Fund.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: NRBT reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and
monetary aggregates using the standardized report forms (SRFs). These data were published for the first time
in the March 2008 issue of IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics. Beginning with January
2012 data, the NRBT updated the data collection forms for other depository corporations. The new forms are
fully aligned with the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual with minor exceptions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

TONGA

External Sector Statistics: There are several issues with the external sector statistics that need to be improved
(in particular the coverage and timeliness), where the SD could play a more proactive role. The SD compiles
balance of payments (BOP) statistics on a quarterly basis, which are published on its website in BPM6 format. It
submits BOP statistics to the Fund annually. Monthly trade figures, derived from customs data, are available
with a three-month lag. The NRBT compiles monthly foreign exchange transactions statistics based on the
Overseas Exchange Transactions Reporting System (OET) with a six-week lag.
OET have presented shortcomings in its classification. Large net errors and omissions have remained in the
balance of payments due to under-reporting of components such as current and capital transfers and direct
investment. To address those issues, new OET codes consistent with BPM6 have been implemented by the
NBRT since May 2014 and the International Investment Survey (IIS) has been carried out by the SD since 2014.
The challenges to improve external sector statistics faced with the SD and the NRBT are 1) to improve coverage
of items in financial account by enhancing IIS response rate and gathering more accurate banks’ financial
transactions data, 2) to obtain not captured data e.g. compensation of employees, remittances and acquisition
of goods and services by overseas workers and incorporate them into BOP statistics, 3) to capture capital
transfers accompanied by main construction projects and incorporate them into BOP statistics, and 4) to
maintain adequate staff resources for compiling and disseminating balance of payments and IIP in accordance
with the international standards.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has been participating in the GDDS since
May 30, 2006.

STAFF REPORT OF THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS UPDATE
Approved By
Paul Cashin and Mark Flanagan (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)
Risk of external debt distress

Prepared by
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association
Moderate

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the 2014 DSA conducted jointly by the IMF and
the World Bank.1 The results indicate that Tonga remains at a moderate risk of debt distress, and
that its external debt sustainability continues to be susceptible to external shocks. The latter is
illustrated by the finding that a significant depreciation or slowdown in exports generates the
highest debt ratios among different stress tests.

A. Underlying Assumptions
Compared with the previous DSA, the underlying assumptions remain stable with marginal
change (Table 1).2 The following highlights the main assumptions:


Real GDP growth for FY2012/13 is revised down to -2.7 percent, from last year’s estimate
of 0.3 percent. This reflects mostly a significant winding down of construction and related
activities. The growth is estimated to have picked up in FY2013/14 to about 2 percent and
2½ percent in FY2014/15, in part driven by the reconstruction needs after Cyclone Ian that
hit Tonga in January 2014. In the long term, real growth is expected to converge to the
historical trend of 1½–2 percent, driven mostly by agriculture, construction, and tourism.



The current account deficit is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP in FY2013/14 and projected
to remain about 7 percent between FY2015/16—2016/17, driven mostly by higher imports
to support the construction for the South Pacific Games. In the long term, exports of

The last full DSA was prepared in June 2014 (SM/14/173, Sup.2). In line with the Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292),
a full DSA is expected to be prepared every three years, or whenever circumstances have changed significantly
since the previous DSA, such as a change in the external risk rating or overall risk assessment. Light updates
should be prepared in intervening years.
2

The public sector comprises the central government and there is no local government in Tonga. The Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for Tonga remains at a medium level with a three-year
average score of 3.45. The Tonga fiscal year starts in July. For example, FY2014/15 is from July 2014 to
June 2015.

TONGA

goods and tourism receipts are projected to increase gradually reflecting the authorities’
continuous efforts in developing exports and tourism sector.



The repayments of two large external loans from China EXIM bank contracted in 2007 and
2010 have recently been rescheduled with an additional 5-year grace period. These loans
account for about 60 percent of the outstanding external debt and bear 2 percent interest
rate, and 20-year maturity with a total of 10-year grace period.

B. External DSA
Under the baseline scenario, Tonga’s external debt and debt service indicators remain below
the thresholds (Figure 1). The humps in debt services from 2019 to 2029 reflect mostly
repayments of the two external loans from China EXIM bank.

C. Public Sector DSA
The present value of public debt is projected to remain below the benchmark, and steadily
decreases to about 20 percent of nominal GDP throughout the projection period (Figure 2).

D. Sensitivity Analysis
Stress tests show that the risk of external debt distress is sensitive to a slowdown in exports or
a large one-time currency depreciation. This reflects the small but open nature of Tonga’s
economy, where imports account for about 60 percent of GDP and remittances account for
over 25 percent. Under the most extreme shock scenarios, almost all indicators of external
debt remain below the thresholds, except the debt service-to-revenue ratio that breaches
slightly the threshold in FY2018/19. This breach is considered a borderline case, where the

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

probability approach is applied to assess the risk. 3 The results show several breaches of the
thresholds (Figure 3), indicating a moderate risk of debt distress. While a large one-time
depreciation also causes of the most extreme shock in public debt DSA, the present value of
public debt in this scenario also decreases gradually to about 20 percent of nominal GDP in
the long term.

E. Conclusion
There is no major change to the stock of debt, borrowing prospect, or the macroeconomic
framework from the July 2014 DSA. The debt sustainability assessment remains broadly
unchanged and the risk of external and public debt distress continues to be classified as
moderate.

F. Authorities’ Views
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment. They recognized the importance of prudent
debt management in safeguarding debt sustainability and building sound fiscal positions in
bolstering resilience to shocks. The authorities are in the process of finalizing the Debt
Management Strategy.4

3

The probability approach is applied to a borderline case, which is defined as one where the largest breach or
near breach falls within a 10-percent band around the threshold. It incorporates a country’s individual CPIA
score and average GDP growth rate, whereas the traditional approaches uses one of the three discrete CPIA
values (3.25 for weak performers, 3.50 for medium performers, and 3.75 for strong performers), and an
average growth rate across LICs (for details see the Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint BankFund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292)).
4
The objective of this strategy is to maintain sovereign debt within levels that are sustainable over time, while
also ensuring that financing requirements are met at low cost with an acceptable degree of risk in the medium
term.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the base
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the sh
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Appendix for the DSA update
The 2019 South Pacific Games: High-Cost Scenario
While the authorities’ original plan is fiscally prudent, international experience suggests that cost
overrun often occurs. To illustrate the impact of a cost overrun risk associated with hosting the 2019
South Pacific Games, staff simulated a DSA assuming a cost overrun financed by external debt
amounts of US$170 million, with 90 percent of the loan disbursed in the construction period from
2016 to 2018 and the remaining disbursed in the game year.1 The hypothetical external loans are
assumed to be provided on terms and conditions similar to the loans by China’s EXIM bank in recent
years (2 percent interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5-year grace period). Two ratios—the present
value of external debt to GDP plus remittances and debt service-to-revenue—would exceed their
respective thresholds for 3-4 years under the baseline (Figure A1). Under stress tests of this
customized scenario, four out of five debt and debt service indicators would exceed the relevant
thresholds. In addition, the PV of public debt to GDP also exceeds the threshold under the most
extreme shock scenario (Figure A2).

1

The authorities estimate the cost of hosting the Games at US$70 million, among which the operating cost (US$20
million) is envisaged to be covered by the Games revenue and the capital cost (US$50 million) by donations and
franchises. The baseline scenario of the DSA uses the authorities’ official costing and financing plan. However,
historical experience suggests that cost overruns are common, and could create larger financing need.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 27, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded the Article IV
consultation1 with Tonga and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on
April 24, on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Tonga’s economy is estimated to have grown by around 2 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2013/14
(year ending June), driven by agriculture and construction, following a contraction in 2012/13
mainly caused by the completion of a large capital project. Inflation has remained moderate at
around 0-3 percent in recent years, reflecting low global food prices and, more recently, a
sharp decline in oil prices. The external position has strengthened, following large grants and
remittance inflows, which have bolstered international reserves.
Real GDP growth is expected to average 2–3 percent in FY2014/15–FY2019/20. Although the
progress of reconstruction in the aftermath of 2014 Cyclone Ian is slower than expected, the
coronation scheduled for July 2015 and preparations for the 2019 South Pacific Games will
support economic activity over the next few years. Meanwhile, inflation is projected to remain
low, reflecting the weak outlook for global commodity prices.
The balance of risks remains weighted to the downside. Spillovers from a protracted period of
slower growth in advanced and emerging economies could weigh on Tonga, mainly due to its
close economic ties with Australia and New Zealand. On the domestic side, potential cost
overruns relating to the Pacific Games could make it necessary to mobilize additional fiscal
resources.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with Tonga, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
Tonga’s economy has rebounded and the outlook is favorable, while risks remain tilted to the
downside. Growth is recovering and is expected to average 2–3 percent during the next five
years, mainly supported by construction and tourism on the back of several large events (the
coronation and the Pacific Games). Inflation is projected to remain low, reflecting the weak
outlook for global commodity prices. International reserves are expected to stay comfortable at
around 6 months of prospective imports largely, thanks to grants and remittances. The balance of
risks is tilted to the downside. External risks involve spillovers from a protracted period of
slower growth in advanced and emerging economies, which could weigh on Tonga, mainly
through its close economic ties with Australia and New Zealand. On the domestic side, potential
cost overruns related to the Pacific Games continue to pose downside risks.
The authorities should contain fiscal spending pressures in the near-term and build a sound fiscal
position to bolster resilience to shocks over the medium term. Near-term fiscal pressures stem
mostly from potentially large wage increases for civil servants, which can be contained by more
efficient staff allocation in order to moderate the share of the wage bill in recurrent spending
over the medium term. Controlling the spending program for the Pacific Games is also important
to avoid cost overruns. The adoption of a roadmap for public financial management reform and
the debt management strategy would lay the groundwork for a medium-term fiscal framework.
Continued efforts to increase tax revenue by broadening the tax base and strengthening tax
administration could create more room for priority social spending and public investment.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate in view of the weak economy
and low inflation, while large excess liquidity calls for better liquidity management to mitigate
macro-financial risk. Preserving the current level of international reserves would help ensure
external stability, and lowering the inflation reference rate would better anchor inflation
expectations over the medium term. Although the presence of excess liquidity does not pose an
imminent risk to financial sector soundness in the near term, the authorities should prepare to
manage macro-financial risks by improving liquidity management and adopting macroprudential tools. The progress in improving banks’ balance sheets and strengthening the legal
framework in the financial sector is welcome.
Structural reforms remain imperative to raising Tonga’s potential growth. Progress in updating
Tonga’s strategic development framework (TSDF II) is welcome. Steadfast implementation of
the authorities’ reform plan is crucial to make growth more sustainable and inclusive.
Implementing key initiatives, such as revising the Foreign Investment Act, would help improve
the business climate and promote private sector development.

Implementing TA recommendations are important for successful reforms. Improving the quality

needed. The IMF/Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) would continue to
provide the bulk of technical assistance, in coordination with other development partners.
