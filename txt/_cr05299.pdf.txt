Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation and First Review
Under the Staff-Monitored Program
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Ambroise Fayolle
July 1, 2005

•

The discussions on the 2005 Article IV consultation and first review under the Staff
Monitored Program (SMP) were conducted during April 26-May 10, 2005, in parallel with a
World Bank mission. The staff team consisted of Mr. van den Boogaerde (head), Mr. Yao,
Mr. Haacker, and Ms. Duggar (all AFR).

•

The Comoros representatives included Mr. Ahamadi Abdoulbastoi, Minister of Finance and
the Budget of the Union, Mr. Ibrahim Ben Ali, Governor of the Central Bank of the Comoros, the
Ministers of Finance of the three island governments, and other Ministers and senior officials.
The mission was received by the President of the Union and the Presidents of the three island
governments, and met with private sector representatives and civil society, donors, and the media.

•

Comoros has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement and its exchange system remains free of restrictions for current
international transactions.

•

At the conclusion of the previous Article IV consultation on April 30, 2004 (Country Report
No. 04/259), Executive Directors underscored the urgency of pursuing a coherent economic
reform strategy, and hoped this would be facilitated soon by the resolution of the political
difficulties. They called on the authorities to pursue fiscal policies compatible with debt
sustainability, and to ensure that decentralization is consistent with sound economic management
at the national level.

•

A SMP was approved in early February 2005 (Country Report No. 05/77). It covers 2005 and
aims at restoring the credibility of economic management, putting public finances on a sound
footing, improving financial intermediation, and accelerating structural reforms. Satisfactory
performance under the SMP would provide a track record of policy implementation that could
lead to a PRGF arrangement in early 2006 and, eventually, to debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC initiative. Relations with the IMF and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and
II, respectively, and statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III.

•

The political situation has improved reflecting the enhanced cooperation between the
island governments. Following the adoption of the organic laws on the delineation of
responsibilities and revenue sharing, the Union parliament is examining the relevant
implementing legislation.

•

Economic growth remained lackluster in 2004 due to a depressed world demand for
vanilla and crop and cattle diseases. Government revenue stagnated, while wage outlays
rose significantly on account of hirings associated with the new constitutional
arrangements. Monetary policy remained prudent, but inflation increased slightly. The
external current account improved, with a sharp increase in private remittances more than
offsetting a worsening of the trade deficit.

•

The authorities and staff expected growth to pick up in 2005 with the successful
treatment of agricultural diseases and a rebound in tourism. Staff cautioned that the
country’s immediate challenge will be to reach an agreement on financing the losses
incurred in the vanilla sector during the last two years and on the price structure for the
2005 vanilla crop, in order to remain competitive in the face of depressed world demand.

•

The authorities and the staff agreed that the medium-term challenge is to set the
country on a path of sustainable growth and poverty reduction, in the context of high
transport and energy costs, exports prone to price fluctuations, and eroding external
competitiveness. This would require continued political cooperation and macroeconomic
stability, efficiency improvements in agriculture, the expansion of growth-enhancing
sectors such as tourism and fishing, improved financial intermediation, and further
development of the private sector. However, significant risks remain to achieving strong
medium-term growth, including renewed political infighting and exogenous trade shocks.

•

The staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the poverty reduction
strategy articulated in the 2003 draft I-PRSP, with a view to making progress towards
the Millennium Development Goals. The staff called for more involvement of the island
administrations and stressed the importance of closely linking the medium-term
investment program with the I-PRSP.

•

Performance under the SMP in the first quarter of 2005 was mixed. Several
indicative targets were breached owing to a shortfall in domestic revenue and an overrun
in wage outlays. However, the mechanism for the payment and redistribution of shared
revenue was adhered to, the authorities kept a tight lid on other spending, the cooperation
between the island and the Union governments has improved, and the political will to see
the program succeed remains strong. Achieving the end-2005 program targets would
require the authorities’ constant and unwavering determination.

-5I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After nearly a decade of political turmoil, significant progress has been achieved with
national reconciliation and inter-island cooperation. Following the adoption of the organic laws on
the delineation of responsibilities and revenue sharing rules, the Union parliament is examining the
relevant implementation legislation. This includes recently adopted legislation detailing the
mechanisms for the rotating presidency envisaged in the constitution.
2.
The authorities’ response to past Fund advice was severely hampered by political
tension and civil strife. Over the past decade, these factors have largely prevented the implementation
of coherent policy reforms. More recently, the authorities have adopted the Fund’s recommendations
on implementing policies conducive to the restoration of confidence, including the revenue-sharing
formula, the joint administration of the customs office, and the transfer of spending competencies to
the island governments. However, progress in civil service reform, the budget process, and domestic
and external arrears reductions has been very limited. This reflected weaknesses in the fiscal
framework, as well as limited institutional capacity and low donor support.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Real GDP growth remained lackluster while inflation rose slightly in 2004. The weak
GDP growth (around 2 percent) implies a further reduction in GDP per capita of 0.8 percent and was
primarily due to crop and cattle diseases and to a decline in vanilla production as a result of the
collapse in world prices. The increase in inflation to 4½ percent, as measured by the CPI, was due
primarily to higher prices for petroleum products and to buoyant domestic demand fueled by a surge in
private transfers from abroad.
4.
The fiscal outcome was mixed in 2004. The

substantially lower foreign-financed investment spending.
The deficit was essentially financed by a further accumulation of domestic and external arrears.

Revenues are collected by the Union and the three island governments, with the Union accounting for
about three quarters of all revenue collected in 2004 (Table 3). Taxes are assigned either to the
collecting government or to a common pool for redistribution (48 percent of all revenues in 2004). The
shared revenues were allocated according to the following key: debt service and international
contributions (17.5 percent), pensions (5.5 percent), outside services (2.6 percent), and to the
governments of the Union (27.9 percent), Ngazidja (20.4 percent), Anjouan (19.1 percent), and Mwali
(7.0 percent), respectively.

-65.
Fiscal developments in the first quarter of 2005 have been characterized by continued
low revenues and wage pressures. Concerning the revenue shortfall, the discussions revealed major
seasonality patterns that had not been available to the previous mission and that suggest that revenue
performance in the first quarter has historically been weak. These seasonality factors were the main
reason behind the revenue shortfall in the first quarter. Moreover, delays in adopting the 2005 Finance
law (only in late January) and in implementing the revenue measures, and lower customs receipts
because of a delay in the arrival of a rice shipment and shortages of cement also contributed. Delays
were also encountered in putting in place the civil service reform, causing wage outlays to be about
10 percent higher than targeted. However, non-wage current expenditures were lower than anticipated,
so that total primary current expenditure was below program target. The primary balance, while well
below the program target, was positive.
6.
In 2004, monetary developments reflected
reduced lending to the vanilla sector. Since the mid1990s, broad money has closely mirrored
developments in net foreign assets (Figure 2). Despite
the sharp increase in remittances, net foreign assets
fell, reflecting lower vanilla export receipts and a
decline in foreign assistance. In addition, the banking
sector reduced its credit to the economy (Figure 3). As
a result, broad money fell by about 5 percent.
However, net claims on the government increased
slightly. These trends of declining net foreign assets
and broad money continued during the first quarter of
2005. Because of a lack of lending opportunities, the
sole commercial bank held excess reserves equivalent
to twice the required level. In a context of difficult
access to financial intermediation, microfinance
institutions have increased and broadened their
activity (Box 1).
7.
The external current account improved in
2004, as a sharp increase in private remittances more
than offset a worsening of the trade deficit. The surge
in remittances was due to an increase in emigrant
visits as a result of the availability of direct flights to
Europe during the summer of 2004.

-7Box 1. Comoros: Microfinance Institutions
The Comoros’ financial sector is underdeveloped and highly concentrated with only one (foreign-owned)
commercial bank (Banque pour l’Industrie et le Commerce-Comores—BIC). As a result, a large segment of
the population is excluded from the financial market. In an attempt to broaden financial intermediation, the
government, with the financial support of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the
French Development Agency (AFD) set up two microfinance networks in 1997—the Meck and Sanduck.
These microfinance institutions (MFIs) have expanded rapidly. After some initial difficulties due to the
country’s political instability, they grew in size and diversified their activity. During 2002-2004, both deposits
and lending expanded at an average annual rate of 26 percent and 38 percent respectively, while BIC’s
deposits declined by around 6 percent and its lending stagnated. In addition, lending became more diversified,
and small business loans have become a prominent part of the MFIs activity. As a result, the share of MFIs in
domestic financial sector deposits grew from 13 percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2004, and in domestic credit
from 16.5 percent to 27.4 percent over the same period. Membership has increased from 30,632 in 2002 to
47,451 in 2004, in both rural and urban areas of all three islands. Loans have covered a range of activities from
smoothing consumption to agriculture, including vanilla growing, fishing and commerce.
The MFIs follow the model of financial cooperatives. They rely only on their deposits to fund lending
operations. So far, grants from donors have been allocated to training, acquisition of equipment, and operating
costs. As a result, emphasis has been placed on protecting depositors. Loan size is limited to FC 5 million
(approximately US$12,500) and twice that amount for the vanilla sector. Loan recovery is reportedly high.
Collaterals are set at about 40 percent of the loan amount, which is relatively high given the low per-capita
income and has constituted barriers to access to financial services provided for the very poor. MFIs have until
recently operated with scant supervision. Since June 2005, the Meck is subject to regulatory oversight by the
central bank. The Sanduck will be subject to central bank oversight after completing an overhaul of its
accounting framework.

The deterioration of the trade deficit was essentially linked to the substantial reversal of the large terms
of trade gains recorded in 2003, as vanilla prices collapsed to less than a quarter of their former levels
and fuel import prices increased in line with world market developments. The overall deficit was
financed by a further accumulation of external arrears and a drawdown in international reserves, which
nonetheless remained at about 11 months of imports of goods and services.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Immediate Policy Challenges and Outlook for 2005
8.
The authorities expected a moderate rebound in economic growth in 2005. This would
reflect the successful treatment of the diseases that affected certain crops and cattle in 2004, and a
projected recovery in tourism with the reopening of a major hotel. On inflation, the authorities agreed
that price pressures should remain subdued in line with the fixed currency peg.
9.
Staff stressed that this outlook is subject to significant downside risk. Without an
agreement (within the confines of the SMP program) on the financing of the losses incurred by the
vanilla sector during the last two crop years and on lowering the domestic pricing structure for 2005
to at least break even in the face of depressed world prices, no credit would be available for the new
crop.2 If so, the 2005 vanilla crop might not be harvested, with dire consequences for growth, rural
incomes, and the solvency of the microfinance sector. The authorities stressed that a crisis committee
2

The banking system is unwilling to finance the new crop unless overdue credits are repaid. Also,
exporters would be unwilling to buy the crop if the new domestic price structure entails a loss. For
more details on developments in the vanilla sector, see Country Report No. 05/77, p.7.

-8has been set up to resolve these issues. It is exploring the possibility of obtaining foreign financing for
onlending to the farmers, with the repayments subsequently used to restructure the sector.3 Staff urged
that pricing be differentiated according to quality from 2005 onward in order to promote an
improvement in quality, to which the authorities concurred.
10.
The mission agreed with the authorities that the transition to a decentralized fiscal
system had been reasonably successful so far. Recognizing that the shortfall in revenues in the first
quarter was primarily due to adverse seasonal patterns that should not prevent achieving the end-2005
targets, the mission revised the quarterly targets for June, leaving the end-September targets virtually
unchanged. To reverse the overruns on the wage bill, staff and the authorities agreed on the urgency to
implement the programmed measures to reduce wage outlays. As an immediate measure, the
government of Moheli introduced a salary cut of 20 percent for all supervisory staff. The mission
urged the Union and the other island governments to follow suit. Also, staff pointed out that budget
implementation remains weak and is hampered by a lack of timely fiscal data. The authorities
indicated that an inter-island committee had been set up and was meeting monthly to prepare the fiscal
accounts.
B. Medium-Term Prospects and Challenges
11.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the principal medium-term challenge facing the
Comoros is to set the country on a path of sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The
Comoros is a small, insular, and essentially dual economy comprised primarily of agriculture and
services, with a limited industrial sector. Exports are concentrated in light-weight vanilla, cloves and
ylang-ylang perfume essence, which are prone to significant world price volatility. Against the
background of years of political instability, waves of emigration of skilled labor, deterioration of
infrastructure, high energy and transport costs, and, more recently, low international prices for vanilla,
the staff emphasized the need for a coherent strategy for development, and improved coordination and
cooperation at the sectoral level.
12.
Primarily due to political instability and lower levels of foreign assistance, investment
has fallen over time. As shown in Box 2, the contribution of physical capital to growth has fallen
from about half of GDP growth in the post-independence period (1977-1986) to a negative
contribution in recent years. Staff indicated that reaching the medium-term goal of accelerating real
growth to 5 percent per year by 2008 would require increasing investment and significantly boosting
total factor productivity.

3

The government has no legal obligation to settle the losses from previous years. Moreover, since
2005 it is not intervening anymore in the price setting mechanism. It is trying to intermediate in
obtaining foreign financing to avoid a collapse in this vital sector for the Comorian economy, but the
authorities insisted that a solution should not involve budgetary resources.

-9Box 2. Comoros: Sources of Growth
A standard growth accounting framework is used for the analysis of the sources of growth, namely the
Cobb-Douglas production function Y = AL0.6 K0.4, where Y is real GDP, A is total factor productivity (TFP), L is
labor, and K is physical capital. The capital stock series was constructed by using the perpetual inventory
accumulation method, and assuming a constant depreciation of 6 percent and a capital-output ratio of 1.5 in
1975 (the technical assumptions are in line with those used for African economies, see Akitoby, Ghura, Tahari,
and Brou Aka, “Sources of Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa,” IMF Working Paper No. 04/176). Population
growth was used as a proxy for labor force growth before 1984. The results are fairly robust to small variations
in the coefficients underlying the production function, but should be viewed as indicative because of
shortcomings in the national accounts.

Sources: Comorian authorities and staff projections.
The main result is that, since 1977, about two-thirds of the average real GDP growth of 2.4 percent can be
attributed to the contribution of labor and about one-third to capital. The contribution of TFP is slightly
negative. However, the findings differ over selected sub-periods:
•

The early period after independence, 1977-1986, was characterized by high investment levels fueled by
foreign assistance. Labor and capital contributed about equally and the contribution of TFP was slightly
positive, resulting in a relatively high real GDP growth rate.

•

In the period of severe political instability, 1987-1996, average real GDP growth declined to 0.3 percent
per year. As investment levels fell, the contribution of capital fell significantly from the previous decade.
The political instability resulted in emigration, leading not only to decline in the contribution of labor, but
also to a significant loss of human capital, reflected in the decline in total factor productivity.

•

In the secession and reconciliation period, 1997-2004, average real GDP growth improved to 2.3 percent
per year. The lingering political instability continued to impair new investment and the contribution of
capital to growth continued to decline and became negative. At the same time, the normalization of the
economic environment, the slowing down of skilled labor emigration, and the positive supply response to
the temporary jump in international vanilla prices led to an increase in total factor productivity.

•

Gradually lifting real GDP growth to about 5 percent per year by 2008 would require either an
increase in investment or total factor productivity of about 2 percent per year. To increase investment,
the government would face a trade-off between financing domestic public investment and repaying wage
arrears to consolidate social stability and boost private sector investment. To improve total factor
productivity could prove even more challenging as it would require ensuring political and macroeconomic
stability; implementing efficiency improvements in agriculture; developing strategies to promote new
sources of growth (such as tourism and fishing); reducing the role of the government in the economy;
improving the business environment (including reforming the judiciary); privatizing public enterprises;
expanding financial intermediation; and enhancing human capital by increasing labor force participation
and attracting emigrants back to the Comoros.

- 10 -

13.
The authorities and the staff discussed measures to improve the economy’s supply
response. The competitiveness of the Comorian vanilla sector has deteriorated as the real effective
exchange rate has appreciated, while international vanilla prices have experienced a secular decline
with the advent of artificial vanilla flavoring and increased competition. The authorities should aim to
take advantage of the Comoros’ relatively high-quality vanilla, creating a niche market.
14.
The authorities considered the tourism
sector as a potentially important source of higher
economic growth. Tourism in the region has
generally increased in recent years, except in the
Comoros where it has declined (Figure 4). Reestablishing air links, simplifying visa procedures,
and promoting the Comoros as a destination for
specialized tourism (as it has been done in Reunion or
Madagascar) could elicit a recovery in tourist arrivals
and revive the mothballed hotel infrastructure. In this
vein, the authorities pointed to the re-opening of a
major hotel in Ngazidja and the opening of vacation
complexes operated by village cooperatives on the
island of Moheli.
15.
Fishing potential in the Comoros is
significant as catch in its territorial waters
significantly falls short of that in neighboring
countries4 (Figure 5). A recent fishing license
agreement with the European Union was an important
step in this direction and the authorities envisaged
expanding into fish processing and farming.

Staff and the authorities agreed that the

40
competitiveness of the economy has been eroded
1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003
over recent years (Box 3). The competitiveness gains
brought about by the 1994 devaluation of the
Comorian franc were essentially preserved until 2000. But with the subsequent appreciation of the
euro, most of the gains have been lost. In addition, an increase in the price of non-tradable goods,
brought about by a buoyant demand from record-high vanilla prices in 2002-2003 and a surge in
private remittances in 2004 has further hampered competitiveness. The authorities agreed that the loss
in competitiveness would likely impair international reserves and had weakened the prospects for the
tradable sector, including tourism. However, they stressed that the exchange rate regime had served the
Comoros well overall, by preserving monetary stability and low inflation. The staff concurred with the
authorities, but emphasized the need to implement macroeconomic and structural policies to enhance
competitiveness.

Fishing volume in the Comoros is only 40 percent of the fishing volume in the Seychelles, and only
15 and 4 percent respectively of the fishing volumes of Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, countries with
much smaller territorial waters.

Box 3. Comoros: Competitiveness
Comoros is a member of the Franc zone and the Comorian franc is fixed to the euro. Membership in the Franc
zone circumscribes monetary policy and imposes a firm and coherent framework for the operations and
management of the Central Bank, including a strict limit on lending to the government. In 1994, Comoros
devalued the Comorian franc by 33 percent (versus the 50 percent devaluation in the CFA franc zone countries).
A preliminary analysis of external competitiveness was performed, using two traditional indicators of
competitiveness (see chart): the external real effective exchange rate (REER, CPI based), and the internal real
effective exchange rate (IRER), which measures the
Internal Real Exchange Rate vs.
relative price ratio of non-tradable to tradable goods. An
Real Effective Exchange Rate, 1993-2004
analysis of the REER rate suggests that the 1994
devaluation substantially strengthened the
120
competitiveness position of the Comoros and that
Internal real exchange rate
110
competitiveness gains were preserved until 2000.
However, after 2001, most of the competitiveness gains
100
appear to have been lost, primarily due to the
90
appreciation of the euro. By 2004, the Comorian REER
80
was about 95 percent of its pre-devaluation level.

the price of non-tradable goods, and where the price of imports is determined in the world market. As shown
below, the fluctuation in the IRER followed that of the REER, but with wider amplitude. In particular, after
2001, real incomes rose significantly due to the temporary surge in world vanilla prices and in private
remittances, which led to an increase in the prices of non-tradable goods, while the increase in prices of tradable
goods was countered by the appreciation of the euro.

17.
The authorities concurred that significant risks to achieving strong medium-term
growth remained. On the domestic front, given the lingering mistrust between the island
governments, a relapse into political infighting remains a distinct possibility. A renewed power
struggle would depress growth, fiscal consolidation, domestic savings and investment, and foreign
financing for investment (as illustrated in the low-case scenario of the text table). Risks also lie in the
external environment, given the Comoros’ vulnerability to terms of trade shocks and its dependence on
a narrow export base and on concessional external assistance.

Fiscal policy
18.
The authorities stressed their firm determination to implement fiscal policies geared to
supporting domestic and external sustainability. The overriding goal of the 2005 budget is a
primary domestic surplus equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP, entailing a domestic fiscal adjustment of
2.3 percent of GDP, to be achieved about evenly by revenue and expenditure measures.5 A financing
gap equivalent to US dollar 1.5 million remains that is expected to be covered by a bilateral grant.
Staff and the authorities agreed on a medium-term fiscal path that leads to a gradual reduction in the
overall deficit after 2006. Compared with previous projections, it accommodates the authorities’
projections for somewhat higher foreign financed investment spending, and complementing this,
somewhat higher primary current expenditure financed by slightly higher bank credit.
19.
The conduct of fiscal policy is constrained by limited access to domestic or external
credit and weaknesses in budget implementation. As monetary policy is geared towards maintaining
the fixed peg, access to domestic credit for the central government is limited. The island governments
cannot borrow and operate essentially under a cash constraint. Owing to weaknesses in budget
implementation, a lack of timely fiscal data, and an erratic profile of key components of customs
revenue, shortfalls in funds cannot adequately be accommodated. This means that fiscal policy is

5

For more details, see Country Report No. 05/77, paragraph 9.

- 13 largely procyclical, and that shortfalls in domestic revenue immediately translate into a build-up of
domestic arrears.
20.
The authorities intended to move forward with the reform of customs services, tax
policy, and budget management. Ahead of the planned outsourcing of customs services, all
temporary personnel at the customs has been let go and an ambitious and time-bound reform program
has been initiated with the assistance of the World Bank. Separately, the authorities have prepared a
revised schedule of tariff rates to be adopted in the 2006 Finance law, after review by the FAD tax
policy mission scheduled for July. The authorities were also considering concrete steps in view of
staff’s advice to strengthen budget preparation, implementation, and monitoring to improve
expenditure control and achieve greater transparency and accountability.
21.
Looking ahead, the mission advised the authorities to seek ways to diversify fiscal
revenues away from customs duties, which average 35 percent and account for almost half of fiscal
revenue. With a limited number of merchandise shipments, the timing of fiscal receipts is highly
volatile and the very high tariff levels encourage fraud and hinder trade and competition. Against this
background, the authorities agreed that, as the economy recovers, policy efforts should be directed
toward gradually lowering customs duties, in line with the Comoros’ regional commitments under
COMESA, and favoring internal taxation, notably a broad-based consumption tax. They indicated that
the proposed tariff reform would generally lower tariffs, and the ensuing loss in revenue would be
made up by domestic taxation measures to be agreed on with the FAD technical assistance mission.
22.
The mission expressed concern about the continuing high level of the wage bill. Boosted
by the staffing of the new political institutions, the wage bill reached 56 percent of current expenditure
in 2004, well above international levels.6 Staff and the authorities agreed on the urgency of forcefully
pursuing the implementation of the planned reform to streamline the civil service and lower the wage
bill.
Monetary and financial policies
23.
The authorities agreed that membership in the Franc zone had provided a firm nominal
anchor and limited inflation, but wished to explore ways to increase budgetary financing by the
central bank. They noted that this could help accelerate the settlement of domestic arrears. The
mission stressed that the independence of the central bank should be strictly respected, preserving the
tight limits on monetary financing of fiscal deficits and low inflation. Staff noted that this is especially
necessary since foreign exchange in circulation may be underestimated due to the large share of
remittances being channeled through the informal sector, and domestic monetary aggregates may
constitute a poor predictor of inflationary pressures. In this respect, the authorities indicated a number
of actions being envisaged to lower the cost of transfers through official banking channels.
24.
The authorities underscored that the underdeveloped and uncompetitive financial sector
is a major constraint to economic growth. They indicated that the single commercial bank appears
sound and complies with international prudential ratios. In 2004, its level of nonperforming loans was
17.6 percent of total loans, compared with 25.1 percent in 2002, and most of these nonperforming
loans have been provisioned. They stressed, however, that it offers a limited range of services, and
excludes many economic operators from the financial market. The authorities took comfort that the
6

By comparison, this ratio in the West African Economic and Monetary Union countries averaged
45 percent in the 1999-2004 period.

- 14 two microfinance networks have been stepping up their lending to small businesses and households,
but admitted that they might have overextended themselves, notably in their exposure to the vanilla
sector, and have so far operated with scant supervision. The staff welcomed the recent submission of
the Meck to central bank regulatory oversight, and urged that the Sanduck follow suit as soon as its
accounting framework has been overhauled.
25.
The authorities and the staff agreed on the need for restructuring the remainder of the
financial sector. The authorities indicated that the financial situation of the Comoros Development
Bank (BDC) remained weak as key measures related to the reduction of its operating costs have yet to
be implemented. However, the BDC has limited its lending and contained its operating cost in 2004.
Staff urged the authorities to take resolute actions for its restructuring before allowing it to expand its
lending operations. The authorities pointed out that the postal financial services company has started
collecting demand deposits and requested a banking license, following the break-up in 2004 of the Post
and Telecommunication Company. The authorities took note of staff’s call for separating its financial
services from its postal activity and providing banking training to the staff before granting a banking
license. Also, staff indicated that, while the measures taken by the authorities to prevent money
laundering appear to be appropriate, they should be implemented decisively.
External sector policies and debt
26.
The Comoros external current account is expected to weaken in 2005–06. The
deterioration would reflect continued depressed conditions for vanilla exports, weak competitiveness
(as discussed above), and higher-than-projected donor-financed imports. The authorities pointed out
that this deterioration in the trade account would be partly offset by expatriates’ remittances, that have
been a fairly stable source of income and would continue to sustain domestic absorption (Box 4). Staff
cautioned, however, that over the medium-term remittances might diminish with a third generation of
Comorians overseas having looser ties with the homeland, and with emigration having been limited
since the 1990s.
27.
The authorities pointed to their efforts to gradually reduce tariffs and liberalize trade,
noting also their commitments to that end under COMESA. Staff welcomed the elimination of export
taxes on cash crops and the harmonization of import duties among the island governments in the 2005
Budget law. However, it indicated that tariff levels remain high by international standards. The
authorities explained that these high tariffs were solely for revenue purposes and had no protectionist
character, in the absence of local production of most goods concerned. They also pointed out that the
proposed new tariff structure, to be adopted at the time of the 2006 Finance law, would lower the
average tariff rate. Comoros has applied for membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and
the Integrated Framework Working Group decided in April 2005 that the World Bank will be
undertaking a technical review for the Comoros.

Box 4. Comoros: Workers’ Remittances
The Comoros is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of dependence on workers’ remittances. Over
the period 1995-2004, workers’ remittances (mainly from Comorian expatriates in France, Madagascar and
Tanzania) grew at a fast pace and constituted the major source of foreign exchange earnings. At 9 percent of
GDP, they represented about twice average exports earnings, and are larger than foreign aid inflows.

A recent World Bank study1/ indicates that the flow of remittances has been driven by: (i) the large size of the
Comorian expatriate community, estimated at about 25 percent of the population, (ii) the higher earning capacity
of the Diaspora in recent years, and (iii) family ties, altruism, and the desire to acquire real estate in the
homeland. The study also reveals that remittances are primarily used to finance consumption. Remittances have
helped smooth consumption in the face of volatile export earnings and government salary arrears, thereby
contributing to alleviate poverty.
Reflecting the high cost of formal transfers through the financial system, an estimated 80 percent of remittances
are sent through informal channels (cash carried by family or acquaintances) or in kind. Although these forms of
remittances are not entirely captured by official data, they influence consumer prices, which have been
increasing in recent years despite the decline in money supply.
In the long run, the dependence on workers’ remittances as a major income source poses risks. The Comorians
born overseas are likely to respond differently to family ties than previous generations. In addition, the
opportunities for new emigration to Europe have been limited since the 1990s.

and Implications”, African Region Working paper Series No.75.

- 16 28.
The Comoros’ external debt burden is unsustainable and has resulted in a continued
accumulation of external payments arrears. A preliminary debt sustainability analysis7 based on
end-2004 data suggests that the net present value (NPV) of external debt in percent of exports reached
406 percent at end-2004. Under an optimistic baseline scenario, the ratio of debt to exports is expected
to remain above the HIPC Initiative indicative threshold of 150 percent until 2022. Similarly, the NPV
of debt-to-revenue ratio, at 398 percent in 2004, remains above the HIPC threshold of 250 percent in
the long term (Appendix IV, Tables 1 and 2). In this context, staff emphasized the importance of
adopting policies which would allow reaching the HIPC Decision and Completion Points quickly. The
staff urged the authorities to service current debt obligations to multilateral creditors8 as provided for
in the budget, and encouraged them to seek a rescheduling of existing bilateral debt9 as an interim step
to a comprehensive solution under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
Structural reforms
29.
The authorities emphasized the importance of reforming the judiciary and improving
governance. A number of implementation laws and decrees are under preparation to streamline the
judiciary and strengthen the power of the courts so as to promote the rule of law and its impartial
enforcement. The fight against corruption includes a number of actions to combat corruption at
customs.
30.
The authorities indicated that they intend to implement their program for public
enterprise reform and privatization. The assistance of IFC has been requested in the preparatory
work for the privatization of the Comoros Hydrocarbons Company and Comore Télécom, and the
authorities were confident that the agreed timetable will be adhered to. Also, steps have been taken to
abolish the ONICOR monopoly on rice imports and to restructure the national pharmacy in an effort to
reduce the price of generic drugs. Staff reiterated its call for policies to facilitate private sector
development. In particular, the poor performance of public utilities continues to slow economic
development. Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to accelerate the restructuring of the
electricity company and reinforce the collection of electricity bills.
IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
31.
Significant problems remain in the areas of statistics (Appendix III). Notably, the areas of
public finances, the real sector, and balance of payments suffer major weaknesses. Some of the
weaknesses in the fiscal area should be alleviated through the inter-island monitoring committee and
three advisors to the finance ministry to be provided by the World Bank. Staff urged the authorities to
redouble effort to address weaknesses in real sector statistics relating to data quality and coverage,
notably by strengthening the statistical unit in the Planning Ministry.
7

A fully updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA), prepared jointly with the Bank, is expected to be
carried out before the next Article IV consultation, as Comoros falls in the transition period under the
guidelines for the presentation of jointly agreed Fund/Bank DSAs.
8

Comoros has accumulated significant arrears to some of the multilateral creditors (for details see
Country Report No. 05/77, Table 6). Since February 2005, for the first time in many years, the
Comoros have started to reduce arrears to the African Development Bank.

Essentially ODA debt owed to China, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.

- 17 V. THE INTERIM POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY PAPER (I-PRSP)
32.
The mission discussed progress in preparing the I-PRSP and in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals. The staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the poverty
reduction strategy articulated in the 2003 draft I-PRSP, in light of a recently completed poverty survey.
However, staff from the Fund and the World Bank suggested that the poverty reduction strategy should
be better targeted to the specific needs of the islands, now that the responsibility for the social sectors
has been transferred to them, and that the island administrations become more deeply involved in the
preparation of the I-PRSP. Staff also stressed the importance of I-PRSP with a consistent
macroeconomic framework, linked, inter alias, to the medium-term investment program. The
authorities and the mission underscored the importance of appropriately managing the macroeconomic
impact of higher aid flows that are critical in achieving the Comoros’ poverty reduction targets.
VI. STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM REVIEW
33.
Performance under the SMP in the first quarter of 2005 was mixed, but year-end targets
remain achievable. Essentially owing to the shortfall in domestic revenues and the overrun in wage
outlays, the end-March 2005 indicative targets for the domestic primary balance, net accumulation of
new domestic arrears, and accumulation of multilateral debt service arrears were missed. However, the
mechanism introduced with the 2005 Finance law for the payment and redistribution of shared revenue
among the islands has been adhered to, and the authorities kept a tight lid on nonwage spending.
Reflecting significantly improved treasury management, the ceiling on expenditures made by cash
advances was met. Also, the structural indicative target for end-February 2005 on the adoption of the
final version of the organic law on the delineation of responsibilities was met. Underpinning this
progress, there has been a noticeable improvement in the cooperation between the island and the Union
governments, and in the political will to see the program succeed.
34.
The mission emphasized that achieving the overall program objectives would require
strengthened policy implementation. As the end-March outcome was heavily influenced by seasonal
developments, staff and the authorities agreed on rephased quarterly targets for end-June and endSeptember 2005, while preserving the annual targets for December 2005 (Appendix V and Table 7).
Agreement was also reached on a set of supplementary measures to secure revenues;10 on the
immediate implementation of the programmed measures to reduce wage outlays, including cutting
wages for supervisory personnel and initiating the civil service reform with the assistance of donors in
order to achieve the original year-end programmed targets; on a reduction of overseas missions; on the
immediate implementation of the action plan to streamline customs; and on the opening of an office of
the customs pre-inspection contractor also on the island of Anjouan. To secure the program’s zero
limit on domestic bank financing, the mission insisted on the need to safeguard the independence of
the central bank. It also urged the authorities to initiate the preparatory measures, with the help of the
IFC, for the planned privatizations later on in the year (Table 8). Staff indicated that any major
slippages from the revised indicative targets would prevent initiating PRGF discussions based on endSeptember performance, and that satisfactory full-year performance would be needed for Board
presentation of the PRGF.
10

Including closing all the accounts outside of the shared revenue redistribution mechanism;
application of stamp taxes to all administrative acts; audits of the parastatal entities to ensure that the
fees collected are transferred to the treasury; and reinforcement of the cooperation between various tax
authorities.

- 18 VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The Comoros faces major challenges to achieve sustained economic growth and poverty
reduction, following years of political turmoil. Per capita income has declined continuously for over
a decade and social indicators have deteriorated. In a context of depressed vanilla prices, a loss in
external competitiveness, adoption of a decentralized fiscal management, and inefficient financial
intermediation, progress will require continued cooperation between the Union and the island
governments, significant efforts to improve the supply response and competitiveness of the economy,
implementation of fiscal policies geared toward fostering macroeconomic stability, and steadfast
commitment to reform.
36.
The risks to faster growth and successful policy reform are significant. They include
renewed political infighting, lack of diversification of the economy and vulnerability to trade shocks,
and shortfalls in donors’ support. In the important vanilla sector, the immediate urgency is to lower
this year’s cost structure to remain competitive in the face of depressed world prices, and to
differentiate pricing according to quality to improve farmers’ production incentives.
37.
The cornerstone for improving macroeconomic performance is continued inter-island
cooperation on fiscal policies. For the medium-term, achieving a sound fiscal policy will depend
critically on optimizing the decentralized fiscal arrangement, as institutional weaknesses remain
particularly in the island governments, on lessening the dependency on external trade taxation, and on
lowering salary outlays to free up resources to bolster domestically-financed investment and social
outlays. The government needs to steadfastly pursue the fundamental reform of the customs
administration with the assistance of the World Bank, to gradually lower customs duties and replace
them by a broad-based consumption tax, and to implement the planned reform to streamline the civil
service. Strengthening efforts at budget preparation, implementation, and monitoring are also crucial to
improve expenditure control and achieve greater transparency and accountability.
38.
Membership of the Comoros in the Franc zone has provided a firm monetary anchor
and contributed to low inflation. However, competitiveness has weakened considerably and more
efforts are needed to strengthen the prospects for the tradable sector. Moreover, sustaining the currency
peg requires tight limits on the monetary financing of fiscal deficits, and preserving the independence
of the central bank. The monetary authorities should endeavor to lower the cost of transfers of workers
remittances so as to promote the use of banking channels, which would also help to better measure
monetary aggregates and limit the risk of money laundering.
39.
Further steps are needed to strengthen the financial sector. Microfinance institutions have
grown rapidly over the years in response to the dearth in financial intermediation, but might have
overextended themselves, notably in the vanilla sector. Both microfinance networks need to be subject
to supervisory oversight as soon as possible. Moreover, the development bank needs to be restructured,
and the postal financial services company has to reform its accounting framework and its officers need
to undergo training before being granted a banking license.
40.
Strengthening the external accounts will require diversifying the export base and
increasing service incomes. External income based on a more diversified mix of agricultural product
exports, tourism receipts, and fishing exports would help limit the effects of exogenous shocks and the
possible decline over time in workers remittances. The external debt remains unsustainable, and it will
be important for the government to steadfastly pursue reforms so as to gain access to Enhanced HIPC
Initiative relief. The authorities should endeavor to service current debt obligations to multilateral
creditors and to seek a rescheduling of existing bilateral debt.

- 19 41.
The authorities’ efforts to update the 2003 I-PRSP are commendable. The insular
dimension ought to be given greater prominence in the document given that island administrations are
now responsible for social sector development. Also, greater coordination between islands is needed to
remove bottlenecks and avoid redundancy in social investments.
42.
Statistical data remain very weak, hampering surveillance and effective policy making.
The authorities should redouble effort in this area, notably by strengthening the statistical unit in the
Planning Ministry, and draw on technical assistance from STA and donor agencies.
43.
The objectives of the Staff Monitored Program for end-2005 remain achievable.
However, this would require strengthened policy implementation, notably decisive action on the
agreed set of supplementary measures to secure revenues and on the programmed measures to reduce
wage outlays.

APPENDIX II

Comoros: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 31, 2005)
1. The World Bank Executive Board has approved 19 IDA credits totaling
US$132.5 million to support Comoros since the World Bank became active in the country
in 1976. The active portfolio consists of one project, which became effective on September
29, 2004. This community-based Social Services Project (SSP) seeks to maintain basic
service delivery and addresses most urgent health and water sector needs. The SSP is a fouryear operation in the amount of US$13.3 million. The Bank presented a Transitional Support
Strategy Update (TSSU) to the Board of Directors in March 2004. This Strategy Update for
the following 18 to 24 months has two key objectives: (i) maintaining basic social services;
and (ii) supporting the process of national reconciliation and facilitating the transition to a
viable institutional structure.
2. Together with the IMF and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the
World Bank assisted the government of Comoros in launching the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) process in March 2002. A first draft of the interim PRSP was
completed in July 2002 and validated by Comorian stakeholders in all three islands in
May 2003. The process came to a virtual halt for months as the political environment
remained uncertain. Positive developments in recent months, though, including the
agreement on the repartition of competencies and the resumption of the SMP, have resulted
in renewed momentum for the PRSP process. The Comorian authorities have started to
update the I-PRSP and a Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the IPRSP is to take place in FY06
if Comoros successfully implements the Fund’s SMP for 2005 and hereunder established a
track record with a view to HIPC debt relief.
3.
Since the signing of the national reconciliation agreement in December 2003, the
Bank has worked in close collaboration with the Fund to support the transition in Comoros,
focusing notably on improving the overall economic management and strengthening
institutions responsible for revenue collection and budget execution. The Bank will continue
to work closely together with the Fund in these areas.
4. The IFC does not have any activity in Comoros, and the country has not yet joined the
MIGA. The Government of Comoros has recently requested technical advice from the IFC
with respect to the envisaged privatization of the oil and telecom companies.

Comoros: Statistical Issues
Overview
Although the situation has improved somewhat since end-1998, the statistical database in the
Comoros remains seriously deficient in most sectors, complicating the formulation and
monitoring of economic and financial policies. The shortcomings have been compounded in
recent years by disruptions in the civil service and staffing inadequacies. In view of these
difficulties, considerable work is required to improve the statistical base. The authorities
have requested a Statistics Department (STA) multitopic technical assistance mission, which
is under consideration, that could lay the groundwork for a thorough revamping of the
statistical system.
National accounts data and prices
The main aggregates of the national accounts for 1986–89, as well as the accounts for 1990
and rough estimates for 1991–93, were prepared by the World Bank; the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) assisted with the preparation of the national accounts
for 1994 and 1995. Thereafter, the national accounts have been computed using
extrapolations and contain serious methodological handicaps. There is little specific
information on the level of economic activity, which complicates the formulation of sectoral
policies. In addition, no comprehensive consumer price index was compiled during 1990
and 1991. The Statistics Department of the Ministry of Planning resumed price surveys
in 1992. An AFRISTAT mission in 1998 has suggested updating the consumer basket using
a 1995 household survey; however, recent developments in the Comoros have seriously
outdated this survey, and the reference prices used in the price index are largely
unrepresentative.
Fiscal data
In the public finance sector, data are now presented on both a commitment and cash basis,
but the identification and monitoring of domestic arrears remain difficult. The institutional
setup to compile regular, comprehensive overviews of budgetary developments is weak, and
such information is available only on an ad hoc basis and with considerable effort. Data on
the financial operations of public enterprises lack transparency and timeliness. The latest data
provided for publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook are for 1987.
The Comoros International Financial Statistics (IFS) page does not contain government
finance data.
Monetary data
There has been improvement in the timeliness of reporting monetary data for publication in
IFS. The authorities are now reporting data to STA with only a one-month lag. In 1997, an

- 34 -

APPENDIX III

STA mission to the Comoros reviewed the compilation and reporting of money and banking
statistics, and made several recommendations to improve classification, coverage, and
reporting procedures. Due to serious differences and errors in classification, IFS and central
bank data differed significantly for major monetary aggregates prior to 1997.
External sector statistics
The latest balance of payments data available to STA pertain to 1995. Balance of payments
data are prepared by the central bank with considerable delay. Data relating to financial
account inflows are sketchy, and the external debt database has not been maintained
since 1994. An STA mission in April 2005 provided training in the Fund’s Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) methodology, and worked with the authorities in
converting their 2003 balance of payments data to BPM5 format. The Central Bank of
Comoros have undertaken to resume data reporting to STA by July 2005. In reviewing the
data sources, the mission found the need for expanding the coverage of survey respondents.

APPENDIX IV

External Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)11
This appendix assesses the sensitivity of the Comoros’ external debt dynamics under the staff’s
baseline scenario to a number of standardized shocks in the debt sustainability framework developed
for Low-Income Countries (LIC DSA).
Underlying DSA Assumptions
The assumptions underlying the DSA are based on the program’s medium-term macroeconomic
framework and the June World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast. The baseline scenario (Figure 1,
Tables 1 and 2) for the analysis assumes:
Real annual GDP growth of 2.8 percent in 2005, gradually accelerating to 5 percent in the long term,
inflation (GDP deflator) of around 3 percent, exports of goods and services of around 14 percent of
GDP, imports of goods and services of around 25 percent of GDP, and a current account deficit of
about 6 percent of GDP in 2005, gradually improving over time.
A gradual strengthening of the fiscal position, with revenue increasing to about 17 percent of GDP,
and total expenditure slightly decreasing to about 20 percent of GDP. New borrowing is assumed to be
on concessional terms, with a grant element of about 30 percent12. Debt service payments do not
assume debt relief.
The Baseline Scenario
Important downside risks remain to the baseline scenario as assumptions are based on continued
political cooperation, a stable macroeconomic environment, and a favorable export environment.
Under the baseline scenario, the net present value (NPV) of external debt in percent of exports is
projected at 389 percent in 2005, at 318 percent in 2010, and is expected to remain above the HIPC
threshold of 150 percent until 2022. The NPV of external debt relative to GDP is projected at 58
percent in 2005 and declines only to 45 percent in 2010. The debt service as a percentage of export
ratio is projected at 18 percent in 2005 and remains unsustainably high at 13 percent in 2010 (Tables 1
and 2, and Figure 1).

11

In Comoros, domestic public sector and private external debt are marginal. According to the
guidelines on the presentation of DSAs, Table 1 presents all relevant indicators, including NPV of
PPG debt relative to revenues and the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

12

The remaining financing gaps (Table 5) are assumed to be financed by grants.

- 37 -

APPENDIX IV

Similarly, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio is at 398 percent in 2005 and is projected to remain above
the HIPC indicative threshold of 250 percent until 2010. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is at 16
percent in 2005 and remains unsustainably high at 11 percent in 2010.
External Sustainability
The stress testing assesses the country’s vulnerability to alternative macroeconomic assumptions and
exogenous shocks. The DSA results show deterioration in the external debt position if there was a
worsening in borrowing conditions, or if real GDP growth and the external current accounts were
projected at historical averages. Under the stress scenario external debt would remain unsustainable
for the duration of the projected period, until 2025, and debt service-to-exports ratio would remain
high (Table 2 and Figure 1). These results attest to the need for prudent debt management policies and
measures to foster diversification and export growth.

APPENDIX V

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington DC 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato,
Further to our letter dated February 2, 2005, we would like to inform you of developments in
the implementation of Comoros’ Staff Monitored Program (SMP). We share your staff’s
view that the outcomes for the first review, based on quantitative and structural targets for
end-March 2005, were mixed. Notwithstanding significant progress with inter-island revenue
sharing and coordination, the delay in adopting the 2005 Budget law (only in January 2005)
and a non-foreseen seasonality in fiscal revenues, namely with customs revenues that
underscored seasonally low imports of rice and concrete mix, resulted in a shortfall in tax
revenue relative to the end-March 2005 program targets. In addition, wages and salaries were
higher than projected due to the delays in putting in place the intended civil service reform,
and, given a tight liquidity situation, external and domestic arrears accumulated.
To achieve the program objectives, a number of remedial measures have been taken to boost
revenue and reduce the wage bill in the context the civil service reform. In addition, the
government has reduced the budget for official travel during 2005, a World Bank-supported
customs reform program was launched, and the customs pre-inspection company opened
another office in the island of Anjouan.
We believe that these actions demonstrate the government’s determination to successfully
implement the SMP and restore sound macroeconomic conditions, which are a necessary
requirement for sound and sustainable economic growth. However, to compensate the weak
performance at end-March while taking into account the better understanding of the seasonal
factors influencing fiscal revenue, we have agreed with the staff to rephase program targets
(see attached Table 1). Specifically, we have rephased fiscal revenue, salaries, and the
primary balance for end-June and end-September 2005, while keeping the end-December
targets unchanged.
Sincerely Yours

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 18, 2005
1.
This statement contains information on recent political developments that has become
available since the Staff Report was circulated to the Executive Board. The information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
A new Union government was formed on July 4, 2005. It includes the former Director
General of Customs and National Coordinator of the Program Follow-up Committee as the new
Minister of Finance. The new government includes fewer representatives of the small islands and is
more heavily tilted toward representatives of the President’s party. Inter-island cooperation is
progressing normally. The new authorities have confirmed to the staff their commitment to the
Staff-Monitored Program—and this was also reiterated by President Azali in his Independence Day
speech of July 6. At the same time, the President declared that he will step down at the end of his
term in April 2006 and that the presidency will be rotated in favor of the island of Anjouan, as
envisaged under the constitution.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Union of the Comoros
On July 18, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Union of the Comoros.1
Background
Following a number of secessionist moves since independence in 1975, Comoros2
overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in December 2001. The constitution provides for
wide-ranging autonomy to the islands, but relies on the establishment of by-laws for the
definition of specific decentralization arrangements, including on financial autonomy and the
civil service. After a number of failed attempts, on December 20, 2003, a Transition Agreement
on elections and critical arrangements for economic management was reached under the
auspices of the African Union. The agreement was strongly supported by the international
community gave rise to the establishment of a multidonor trust fund for the implementation of
the transitional arrangements. Elections for the island assemblies and the national assembly
were held in March and April 2004.
Significant progress has been achieved with national reconciliation and with inter-island
cooperation. In early 2005, the Union Assembly adopted the organic law on the delineation of
responsibilities and the law containing the revenue-sharing rules, as well as a consolidated

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

budget for 2005. The rotation of the Union Presidency envisaged, in the constitution, is due in
2006.
Economic growth during 2004 remained lackluster, with real GDP per capita declining a further
0.8 percent, due primarily to crop and animal diseases, and to a decline in vanilla production
as a result of the collapse on world prices. Inflation increased to 4.5 percent, from 3.8 percent
in 2003 essentially due to higher prices for petroleum products and to buoyant domestic
demand fueled by a surge in private transfers from abroad. The sharp increase in private
remittances, due to an increase in emigrant visits following the availability of direct flights to
Europe in the summer of 2004, also more than offset a worsening of the trade deficit, and
contributed to an improvement in the external current account in 2004. The deterioration of the
trade deficit was essentially linked to a fall in vanilla exports and the higher fuel import prices.
The Comoros’ foreign reserve position remained at 11 months of imports of goods and
services.
Fiscal policies resulted in a primary deficit for the consolidated Union and island governments
of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2004, a deterioration of one percent of GDP. The non-implementation
of the revenue-sharing agreements between the islands at the beginning of the year, and the
lack of administrative capacity following the devolution of tax collection competencies to the
island governments, contributed to a decline in domestic revenue as a percent of GDP.
Moreover, the wage bill increased significantly due to hirings associated with the new Union
institutions, and outlays for goods and services increased as well. The overall deficit
(commitment basis, excluding grants) improved by 2 percent of GDP, to 4.4 percent of GDP,
on account of substantially lower foreign-financed investment spending. The deficit was
financed by a further accumulation of domestic and external arrears. The external debt, at
more than 400 percent of exports of goods and services in net present value terms, is not
sustainable. It has been accompanied by a continued accumulation of payments arrears.
Monetary policy remained narrowly circumscribed by the Comoros’ membership in the Franc
zone and the related fixed exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro. These arrangements have
provided a firm monetary anchor for the country and imposed a coherent framework on the
management and operations of the central bank, including a strict limit on lending to the
government.
While there are virtually no quantitative trade restrictions, tariff levels on imports in the
Comoros are relatively high by international and African standards. However, given the virtual
absence of local production of most goods concerned, virtually all tariffs serve revenue
purposes and are not an expression of protectionist policies of the government.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They were encouraged by the
consolidation of political stability in the Comoros, and stressed that continued inter-island
cooperation will remain key to improving macroeconomic performance and social conditions, as
envisaged under the staff-monitored program. Directors underscored the importance of a
successful implementation of the program for establishing the conditions for strong economic
growth and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, and laying the basis for a
PRGF-supported program and eventual participation in the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

-3Although the growth outlook has improved, Directors were disappointed at the lackluster
performance of Comoros’ economy in 2004 and early 2005, and the continued low level of most
social indicators. They acknowledged the adverse impact of the plunge in international vanilla
prices, which has resulted in a major terms of trade loss that has been further aggravated by the
rise in prices for imported fuel products and led to a deterioration in the external trade balance.
Directors stressed that addressing the daunting challenges, which the Comoros faces, will
require decisive reform efforts to diversify the economy and take advantage of Comoros’
potential in agriculture, tourism, and fishing, along with sound fiscal policies.
Against this backdrop, Directors observed that implementation of the staff-monitored program
has been mixed so far. They took note of the fiscal requirements of the new constitution as well
as the impact of oil price increases and the decline in the international price of vanilla. While
progress has been made in a number of important areas, Directors expressed concern about
the early fiscal policy slippages, in particular the failure to keep the wage bill within the program
envelope and the accumulation of sizeable arrears. They also noted the seasonally low level of
revenues in the early part of the year. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to take
corrective actions in order to observe the fiscal targets, and urged their full implementation,
including the containment of wage pressures and arrears, to ensure a satisfactory performance
under the program. While recognizing that the program will remain subject to a number of risks,
Directors noted the strengthening of ownership at both the central and island level which should
also help mobilize increasing support of the international community.
Directors welcomed the progress made on fiscal reforms that will help set the public finances on
a sound footing. In particular, they commended the adoption of the revenue sharing mechanism
between the islands. To consolidate the fiscal position, Directors encouraged the authorities to
work toward the early completion of their reforms of customs administration, public
procurement, and strengthening expenditure control. Efforts to strengthen and diversify fiscal
revenue, including the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax, will also need to be
continued.
Directors underscored the importance of faster progress on structural reforms that will be key to
enhancing the supply response and competitiveness of the economy, and supporting economic
diversification. They urged the authorities to step up implementation of their program for public
enterprise reform and privatization, and to enhance efforts to improve the business environment
in order to foster private sector development and investment. Directors supported the priority
accorded by the authorities to reforming the judiciary and improving governance. They looked
forward to close cooperation between island governments to accelerate structural reforms.
Directors commended the authorities on their endeavors to update the 2003 Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), and stressed its importance as a means to consolidate
national dialogue and island cooperation. They noted that the Strategy Paper would benefit from
better coverage of social indicators and tracking of pro-poor public expenditure. Better targeting
to the specific needs of the islands will also be important.
Directors noted that Comoros’ membership in the Franc zone has provided a firm monetary
anchor and contributed to low inflation. At the same time, however, they stressed that the loss
of external competitiveness over recent years underscores the need for consistently prudent

-4macroeconomic policies, as well as progress with structural reforms. Directors also underscored
the importance of preserving the independence of the central bank, including by maintaining
tight limits on monetary financing of the budget.
Directors called for further steps to strengthen and develop the financial sector. The high loan
concentration to the vanilla sector should be monitored carefully, and Directors emphasized, in
this connection, that regulatory supervision should be extended to the two microfinance
institutions. Directors also were of the view that the Postal Company should extend its financial
services only after proper training of its staff. They stressed the need to act expeditiously on
restructuring the Comoros Development Bank. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
ensure implementation of anti-money laundering laws, and to consider steps to facilitate the
transfer of remittance flows through the financial system.
Directors underscored the importance of continued efforts to address the country’s heavy
external debt burden and its vulnerability to external shocks. This will require particular attention
to prudent debt management policies, including a strategy to clear external arrears, and
measures to foster export growth and diversification. Directors urged the authorities to
persevere in their efforts to strengthen their track record of policy implementation with a view to
prospective debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain strong efforts to improve the quality and
timeliness of statistical data, including by drawing on technical assistance.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Union of the Comoros
July 18, 2005

My Comorian authorities welcome the staff report for the Article IV consultation and the first
review under the Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). As Directors are aware, the Comoros
went through a very difficult process of political changes over the past decade. The political
and social situation is now improving, and is marked by a process of national reconciliation
and inter-island cooperation. Taking opportunity of this improvement, my authorities, with
staff’s support, have put in place a set of policies aimed at reestablishing macroeconomic
stability. The SMP has been instrumental in the authorities’ efforts. Significant progress is
being made in the fiscal area, where important changes have occurred, especially as regards
the adoption of organic laws delineating responsibilities and revenue sharing rules among the
islands. Given the same performance tempo my authorities expect further progress during the
year.
Social and economic background
The recent years were characterized by two notable developments:
First, following the national reconciliation materialized by the country’s first parliamentary
elections held in March/April 2004, the political situation has improved leading to enhanced
cooperation between the Union and island governments. The implementation of policies
adopted with the Fund assistance and covering the revenue-sharing formula, the joint
administration of the customs office, and the transfer of spending competencies to the island
governments, were key to the administrative improvement.
Second, the agriculture sector has been experiencing a severe setback, due to crop and cattle
diseases and a decline in vanilla production fueled by the collapse of the international prices.
Recent Economic Developments
Lower vanilla export, combined with the poor performance of the rest of the agricultural
sector, adversely affected real GDP, which grew by about 2 percent. Inflation was about 4.5
percent, due to high oil prices and strong domestic demand fueled by private transfers and
remittances.
In the fiscal sector, despite unfavorable exogenous shocks, the government has taken a
number of revenue enhancing measures through upward revision in customs rates as part of
the inter-land harmonization, higher dividend receipts, fishing royalties, and privatization
receipts. As a result, for 2005 the authorities are expecting to increase a combined revenue
for the three island governments and the Union by about 1 ¼ percent of GDP over the 2004
level to 16.2 percent of GDP. Regarding expenditures, the government is determined to
reverse the rapid growth in primary spending to a level in line with the resources of the
Union. It was agreed that the combined total of primary expenditure be contained to 14.4
percent of GDP compared with 16.3 percent of GDP in 2004. The saving is supposed to

-2come from a cut in the wage bill, notably by not renewing the contracts of temporary
personnel. Also a freeze will apply on new hiring, except for the social sectors. Furthermore,
the government is determined to reform and strengthen fiscal management. Although the
primary balance was reduced from 4.1 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent, mainly on account of
lower foreign financed investment spending, overall my authorities have demonstrated their
strong commitment to the program and are requesting to move without delay to a PRGF
program that will help them to take advantage of the HIPC Initiative.
Monetary policy has remained tight, as the banking sector, consisting of only one foreignowned bank, reduced its credit to the economy, mainly because of reduced lending to the
vanilla sector. Net foreign assets to the economy fell, in spite of the increase in remittances.
However, activity (lending and deposits) at the two microfinance institutions increased
significantly. These institutions also diversified their activity. One of the microfinance
institutions, the Meck, is now subject to regulatory oversight by the central bank. The other
one, the Sanduck, will be subject to central bank oversight once its accounting system has
been revised and made to conform to the required standards.
In the external sector, the collapse of vanilla prices to less than a quarter of their former
prices and high fuel import prices led to a sharp increase in the trade deficit. Due to an
increase in workers’ remittances, the current account recorded an improvement over the level
in 2003. Nevertheless, as I have stressed during previous Board discussions, the current
skyrocketing oil prices are adversely affecting low-income oil importing countries, including
the Comoros. This impact needs to be ascertained and an accommodative instrument put in
place.
Outlook for the year 2005
The authorities expect real output to increase slightly in 2005, with inflation falling to 3
percent. In the fiscal sector, the objective of the government is to achieve a primary
domestic surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP, resulting from the measures being implemented.
My authorities are keen to pursue steadfastly the fiscal decentralization process, in order to
advance speedily the power sharing under the new constitution. Moreover, the authorities are
determined to reduce the wage bill. The process has already begun in Moheli Island, and the
two other Islands are prepared to step up with the reform, so as to make sure that the end2005 targets are met.
The medium-term policies
The main objective of the authorities over the medium term is to raise economic growth to a
higher level, to about 5 percent per year. The country faces a number of challenges, which
they will need to overcome. It is their expectation that with the stabilization of the political
situation, they will receive the full assistance of multilateral institutions and of donors to put
in place a comprehensive program of reforms. They are hopeful that following the SMP, the
Fund will support their ongoing efforts with a PRGF arrangement, which will help them to
address the constraints facing the economy, and put in place the policies necessary to achieve

-3the higher rate of economic growth. The authorities view this as crucial to reduce the high
incidence of poverty prevailing in the islands.
In the fiscal sector, while the government is confident to reduce the overall deficit after
2006, one of the serious handicaps facing the authorities in the conduct of fiscal policy is the
context of limited access to domestic and external credit for the central government. As the
fiscal policy is already tight, shortfalls in domestic revenue lead to a build-up of domestic
arrears. My authorities intend to accelerate the structural reforms in the area of customs
services, tax policy, and budget management. Many actions are being undertaken, with the
assistance of the World Bank. These include the preparation and adoption of tariff rates for
the 2006 Financial law, strengthening expenditure control through better preparation,
implementation and monitoring of the budget. Also very important on the authorities’ agenda
are transparency and accountability aspects of financial management, as well as
diversification of fiscal revenue, which should rely less on customs duties. The high level of
the wage bill will also be addressed.
As regards monetary policy, this will remain prudent. My authorities highly value their
membership in the Franc zone and the benefits it has procured them, namely a firm nominal
anchor and low inflation. The authorities are well aware of the importance of workers’
remittances to the economy, and intend to take measures to lower the cost of transfers
through official channels.
The authorities agree that the limited development of the financial sector acts as major
constraint to the development of the economy. They expect the development of the two
microfinance institutions to help to a certain extent, but more will need to be done. Until
other banks show interest in doing business in the Comoros, the authorities will need to rely
on existing financial institutions. In this regard, following the restructure of the Post and
Telecommunication Company, the postal financial services have requested a banking license
and have started collecting deposits.
In the external sector, it is the intention of the authorities to reduce gradually external tariffs
and liberalize trade, especially in the context of regional trade agreement. However, in view
of limited domestic production and a narrow taxable base, the country has had to rely mostly
on custom tariffs for revenue. The external sector will also continue to depend on
developments in the vanilla sector, and on workers’ remittances, which have been a fairly
stable source of income for the Comoros. Owing to adverse exogenous oil price shocks and
drastic decline in world market prices for vanilla, the external debt situation remains
unsustainable, and the Comoros has continued to accumulate external payments arrears.
Conclusion
The authorities of the Comoros have implemented important structural reforms in key
sectors, notably the fiscal, judiciary and public enterprises, and they have taken steps to
improve governance. The authorities are making progress under the SMP. Already, a number
of targets have been met. These include improvement in treasury management, the ceiling on
expenditures made by cash advances, and the structural indicative target on delineation of

-4responsibilities in line with the organic law. The authorities have also made an important
progress in the preparation of the I-PRSP. However, much more needs to be done to put the
Comoros on the path of sustainable growth. In this regard, given the performance they have
made under difficult circumstances, my Comorian authorities are of the view that they
deserve an immediate move to a PRGF program which would enable them to benefit more
substantial support from the international community. This support is critical to help the
Comoros achieve a sustainable debt situation, and also put in place the policies needed to
achieve a higher level of growth and reduce poverty.
