EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

The rapid economic expansion in the U.A.E. has continued uninterrupted for the
fourth consecutive year, with non-hydrocarbon GDP growth averaging in excess of
10 percent. This has been aided by an outward-oriented development strategy, a
favorable business climate, and sustained high oil prices. The fiscal and external
surpluses remain large, allowing for further accumulation of official foreign assets.

•

Capacity constraints, however, have intensified. Strong demand growth and housing
shortages have led to sharp increases in rents and contributed to upward pressure on other
prices. As a result, consumer price inflation exceeded 9 percent in 2006.

•

The medium-term outlook is very positive with real GDP growth projected to remain
strong in 2007, and decelerating to about 7 percent on average during 2008–12. The
fiscal and external positions are projected to remain in large surplus under current WEO
oil price projections.

Key policy issues and recommendations
•

Inflation is a source of concern. If inflation fails to decline in 2007 as a result of the
expected easing of housing shortages, further fiscal expenditure restraint, including by
public and quasi-public entities, would be needed to slow down aggregate demand
growth. To this end, staff underscored the importance of enhancing fiscal coordination
between the federal and emirate governments and improving the phasing and monitoring
of large investment projects that are carried out by government and quasi-public entities
outside the budget.

•

The FSAP Update found the financial system to be sound, and identified areas for
development. These include the need to strengthen the prudential and regulatory
oversight of the banking system and capital markets; open the banking sector to greater
competition; and strengthen the legal framework for the financial sector.

•

The authorities reiterated their commitment to the U.S. dollar peg in the period
leading up to the establishment of the monetary union among the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) members. Moreover, they remain committed to achieving the monetary
union by 2010. Staff calculations suggest that the real effective exchange rate of the
U.A.E. dirham, which has appreciated by 6 percent over the past two years, is consistent
with the fundamentals.

•

The efforts to upgrade the statistical system are welcome and should continue. A
National Bureau of Statistics is to be established by end-2007, a number of surveys are
being carried out, and work is proceeding to establish a new national consumer price
index (CPI).

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The U.A.E. has continued to benefit from its oil wealth, prudent macroeconomic
policies, and dynamic diversification strategy. As a result, the country has emerged as an
important hub for international trade, finance, and tourism, attracting large inflows of foreign
direct investment (FDI) and expatriate workers, and is increasingly playing an important
regional economic role.1 The rapid economic expansion, which began in 2003, has continued
uninterrupted, with non-oil sectors, such as tourism and construction, delivering double-digit
growth rates. Per capita income has risen to about $38,000 in 2006, and the U.A.E. is now
the second largest economy in the Arab world after Saudi Arabia.
2.
The political situation remains stable. The president of the U.A.E., Sheikh Khalifa
bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, continues to enjoy the support of the rulers of the other emirates. In
December 2006, the U.A.E. held elections for the Federal National Council, a consultative
body which reviews legislation proposed by the Council of Ministers.
3.
The authorities have maintained a close dialogue with the Fund through
Article IV consultations and, beginning in 2006, through mid-year staff visits. In recent
years, the Fund has encouraged the authorities to strengthen fiscal management and
coordination between the federal and emirates governments, to upgrade the financial sector’s
legal framework and improve banking and capital markets’ supervision, as well as strengthen
economic data. Progress is being made in these areas, but further efforts are still needed.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The strong momentum of investment and growth continued in 2006, but supply
bottlenecks have pushed up inflation. Real GDP grew by 9.4 percent in 2006, with oil
production rising by 8 percent, while construction, financial services, and trade services grew
at double-digit rates. Domestic demand remained buoyant, reflecting the rapid population
growth (about 6 percent per year on average) as well as large infrastructure investment
projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. However, strong demand growth and shortages of housing,
have led to sharp rises in rents and put upward pressure on other prices. As a result, inflation
picked up from 6.2 percent in 2005 to 9.3 percent in 2006, but is expected to decelerate
somewhat in 2007.2

1

The seven emirates are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Quaiwain, and Fujairah.
Under the current confederation, each emirate enjoys considerable autonomy.

2

There are, however, considerable weaknesses in the U.A.E.’s CPI data (see Informational Annex III), and
unofficial sources estimate inflation above the official figure.

The fiscal and external positions remain in large surplus. Reflecting record high
oil prices, the overall fiscal surplus (federal and emirate governments, including investment
income) increased by 8.5 percentage points to about 29 percent of GDP in 2006, allowing a
further build up of official foreign assets. Also, the non-oil fiscal deficit (excluding
investment income) narrowed slightly. With high oil prices and strong performance of
non-oil exports, the external current account surplus increased to close to $36 billion, or
22 percent of GDP. Capital account movements continued to mirror the large build up of
official foreign assets by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).3 Gross official
reserves at the central bank increased in 2006 to $27.9 billion, or the equivalent of about
2.8 months of next year’s imports of goods and services (or 4.7 months excluding imports for
re-exports).

In early 2007, Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), a sister institution to ADIA, was established for the
purpose of investing government funds domestically and internationally. The management of official investment
funds will be shared between ADIA and ADIC.

6.
Money and private sector credit continued to grow rapidly in 2006, albeit at a
somewhat slower pace than in 2005. The growth in credit was particularly high for
services, personal business and real estate. Banks increasingly relied on foreign borrowing, at
longer maturities and lower rates than available in the domestic market, to fund the strong
growth of credit. With the U.S. dollar peg and complete capital mobility, nominal interest
rates in the domestic market have tracked corresponding U.S. rates closely. But real interest
rates have become increasingly negative.
7.
The banking sector continues to show comfortable levels of capitalization and
profits. Banks have benefited from the rapid economic expansion in recent years and the
significant reduction in the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans (Table 7). Bank assets
and profits increased by about 35 percent and 11 percent, respectively, in 2006, despite the
fallout of the 2005–06 stock market correction, and banks are rapidly gaining in
sophistication and international exposure.4 Five new banks and a number of new branches
were authorized in 2006. The planned merger of two Dubai-based banks (National Bank of
Dubai and Emirates Bank) would create the largest bank in the U.A.E. and one of the largest
in the GCC.

International ratings of several U.A.E. banks were upgraded in 2006.

8.
Following a spectacular performance in recent years, the U.A.E. capital markets
experienced a sharp correction beginning in late 2005, along with other regional
markets. In 2006, the Abu Dhabi Securities Market and the Dubai Financial Market declined
by 42 percent and 44 percent, respectively. The correction was due to a reversal in investors’
sentiment following the sharp increases in the value of shares in the U.A.E. in the previous
years, which pushed valuation indicators (P/E ratios and price/book values) well beyond their
historical levels and those of other emerging markets. The overall economic impact of the
market correction has, however, been very limited, and stock prices have started to recover
during the second quarter of 2007.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Against the background of favorable medium-term prospects, the policy
discussions focused on: the need to reduce inflation; the role of fiscal policy in demand
management given the constraints on monetary policy; financial sector issues; the U.A.E.’s
monetary and exchange rate policies in the run-up to the GCC monetary union; structural
reforms; regional cooperation; and the progress underway to strengthen the statistical system.
A. Near- and Medium-Term Outlook
10.
Growth is projected to remain high at about 8 percent in 2007, somewhat lower
than in 2006. Real domestic demand growth is expected to remain robust, reflecting the
rapid population growth, sustained private consumption following wage increases in the
public sector, as well as strong investment momentum. On the supply side, crude oil
production is projected to increase by about 3.5 percent to 2.66 million barrels per day
(mbd). While the growth of the non-oil sector is expected to decelerate moderately owing to
existing supply bottlenecks, it is projected to remain relatively high (9 percent). Inflation is
also projected to ease to 8 percent, on the expectation that upward pressure on rents will
diminish gradually with the improvement in the supply of new housing units.

10
11.
The fiscal and the external current account positions will continue to be in
sizable surplus. The overall fiscal surplus is expected to remain at about 28 percent of GDP,
with the non-oil fiscal deficit (excluding investment income) projected to narrow by
one percentage point to about 23 percent of non-oil GDP, mostly reflecting lower budgeted
spending by Abu Dhabi on behalf of the federal government. Under the assumption that oil
export prices would average $63 per barrel, the current account surplus is projected to remain
very large (about $38 billion).
12.
The medium-term prospects are also highly favorable. Growth is projected to
decelerate gradually from its current high level to about 7 percent on average during the
period 2008–12. With further progress in economic diversification, growth will increasingly
depend on non-oil activities, with tourism and other services continuing to expand at
relatively high rates in response to sustained demand. The hydrocarbon sector is projected to
grow by 3.5 percent annually in line with the authorities’ medium-term expansion plans. The
fiscal and external positions are projected to remain in large surplus, even if oil prices were
to decline significantly from their current level.5
13.
The main risks to this outlook are balanced. On the upside, the U.A.E.’s attractive
business climate and its ambitious development strategy, supported by accelerated structural
reforms, could further spur investment and growth in the next few years; moreover, with the
completion of mega projects in infrastructure and tourism, the service industry will expand
rapidly, including in Abu Dhabi and the northern emirates. This scenario assumes that the
current bottlenecks in key infrastructure and housing will be resolved over the next few
years. On the downside, the major risks relate to an acceleration of inflation, a sharp decline
in oil prices, and heightened geopolitical tensions in the Gulf region.
B. Inflation
14.
High inflation has become a major issue. With the rapid growth in recent years,
capacity constraints have intensified, putting upward pressure on asset and consumer prices.
Shortages of housing—which are more severe in Dubai and Abu Dhabi than in the other
emirates—have led to sharp rises in rents which are reflected in the increase in the CPI. The
authorities agreed that inflation was a major source of concern. If allowed to persist at the
current rate, inflation could become entrenched with the attendant risk of undermining
competitiveness and long-term growth. Staff pointed out that upward pressures on wages have
emerged, and production costs in some sectors, such as construction, have risen significantly.
The authorities indicated that they have introduced temporary caps on rent increases on
existing contracts in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and were confident that upward pressure on rents
would start to ease in late 2007, as new housing units come to the market (Box 1).

5

Based on the current medium-term scenario, the fiscal and the current account positions would be in balance at
oil prices of $20 and $32 per barrel, respectively, on average during the period 2008–12.

11
Box 1. Developments in the Real Estate Markets
The real estate market in the U.A.E. has been buoyant in recent years. The rapid population growth
of about 6 percent per year on average, has been a major factor behind the strong demand for housing.
Some 43,000 additional residential units will be needed annually to accommodate the growing demand in
2006–10.
The supply-demand imbalance has increased pressure on rents. Rent increases have been officially
estimated at 9 percent in 2005 and 15 percent in 2006, although market estimates have been higher. The
authorities introduced temporary caps of 7 percent on rent increases in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in late 2006
and early 2007, respectively.
Rent increases are expected to ease in late 2007 as new housing units come to the market. Around
120,000 residential units are expected to be completed over the next three years. Although capacity
constraints have delayed some large real estate projects, especially in Dubai, there are indications that
many of these projects will be completed shortly. However, pressures on rents and prices in the
Abu Dhabi market are expected to continue during 2007, with less than 8,000 residential units to be
completed over the course of the year. Given the continued strong demand in the medium term, a sharp
price correction in the real estate market is not expected.

C. Fiscal Policy
15.
Fiscal policy at both the federal and emirate levels has remained prudent as
evidenced by the decline in the non-oil fiscal deficit (excluding investment income). The
authorities indicated that current spending has been kept under control at all government
levels. While wages were increased for government employees in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in
2006 and early 2007, no such increase was granted to federal government employees. More
important, the overall number of civil servants in Abu Dhabi has been reduced significantly
in connection with the outsourcing of certain activities. As a result, the consolidated wage
bill grew moderately in 2006 and is expected to increase by only 9 percent in 2007. Capital
expenditure at the federal and emirate levels remained broadly stable.
16.
Substantial progress has been made in implementing fiscal management reforms
at the federal level. A single treasury account has been established and the government
intends to close all commercial bank accounts soon; the budget classification and the chart of
account have been revised; and a government financial management information system has
been developed. The authorities are also making efforts to prepare for the introduction of a
value added tax in the U.A.E. ahead of the GCC countries’ target of 2012.

12
17.
The authorities recognized the importance of enhancing the effectiveness of
fiscal policy. Fiscal coordination between the federal and the emirate governments needs to
be improved, as well as monitoring and planning of the large investment projects that are
carried out by government and quasi-public entities outside the budget to ensure that overall
public investment is consistent with the economy’s absorptive capacity (Box 2). Currently,
the data needed to consolidate public sector spending, including by government and
quasi-public entities, are not available and need to be compiled as a matter of priority. The
authorities indicated that these objectives were part of their strategic reform plan, and
expressed interest in receiving Fund technical assistance for the establishment of a macrofiscal unit that would coordinate fiscal spending.
Box 2. Investment Projects in the U.A.E.
A large number of infrastructure and oil-related projects are currently being undertaken, or
planned, by the government. Others are being carried out by private and quasi-public entities mainly in
real estate. Selected projects planned over the next ten years are estimated at $227 billion.

D. The Financial Sector
18.
Against the backdrop of continued strong performance of the financial system
coupled with rapid growth of credit, efforts are being made to further strengthen the
financial sector. As discussed in the FSAP Update, these reforms are aimed at strengthening
the prudential and regulatory oversight of the banking system and the capital markets;
opening the banking sector to greater competition; and strengthening the legal framework for
the financial sector.6 The authorities agreed on the need to step up their efforts toward
updating the banking law and the company law, which would address, among other issues,
the removal of barriers to foreign participation in U.A.E. markets and the protection of
shareholder rights. Moreover, the development of the DIFC continues to support the
diversification and international standing of the U.A.E.’s financial sector.7
19.
Banking supervision faces new challenges. Stress test results in the FSAP Update
indicate that while banks would be resilient to various exogenous shocks, a few banks
(accounting for one-fourth of bank assets) would be vulnerable to a severe correction in real
estate markets. The authorities indicated that exposure to the real estate sector was difficult
to monitor and agreed to review their loan classifications. Staff expressed reservation
regarding a proposal that would allow banks to increase their exposure to the real estate
sector through subsidiary companies. At the same time, as part of efforts to strengthen bank
supervision, the authorities intend to establish a federal credit bureau. A basic AML/CFT
framework is in place, but the legal framework for anti-money laundering needs
strengthening as recommended by the March 2007 AML/CFT mission.
20.
The supervision of U.A.E. capital markets is being strengthened. The
responsibility for oversight of Initial Public Offerings in the stock market had been
transferred from the Ministry of Economy to the Emirates Securities and Commodities
Authority as of January 2007, and a corporate governance code has been issued. Staff
underscored the need for the authorities to move ahead with the enactment of the draft
securities law, which will improve securities market oversight and strengthen capital
markets’ supervision. In addition, eliminating restrictions on foreign ownership, encouraging
the listing of large quasi-public enterprises, and increasing the role of institutional investors
would help strengthen investor confidence, reduce market volatility, and deepen capital
markets.

The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report will be discussed by the Board in conjunction with
this staff report.

See accompanying FSSA report for details on the DIFC’s supervisory and regulatory framework.

21.
External borrowing by financial institutions and large corporations to finance
investment and credit growth has picked up significantly and would need to be
monitored. While comprehensive information on the U.A.E.’s total external liabilities
(including the nonfinancial private sector) is not available, data from the central bank and the
Bank for International Settlements indicate that the U.A.E.’s foreign liabilities have almost
tripled over the last two years to reach close to $80 billion at end-2006. There are presently
no signs of vulnerability associated with such borrowing given the U.A.E.’s large net creditor
position. The authorities are monitoring these developments, and indicated that Dubai will be
establishing a debt management unit.
E. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
Monetary policy is determined by the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar and a
completely open capital market. Interest rates closely track U.S. dollar rates and liquidity
management operations through the issuance of central bank certificates of deposit have
aimed only at smoothing changes in liquidity conditions. The authorities intend to develop
additional instruments for liquidity management, including Shariah-compliant instruments
that would help Islamic financial institutions manage their liquidity.
23.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the U.S. dollar peg in the period
leading up to the GCC monetary union in 2010.8 They indicated that moving the peg to a
basket of currencies might entail sizable financial losses, not to mention the risk of loss of
credibility if the market were to expect some instability in exchange rate policy during the
transition to the monetary union. They also stressed that a nominal revaluation of the current
exchange rate was neither needed, nor would it be beneficial for the U.A.E. economy, given
that most U.A.E. exports and imports were denominated in U.S. dollars and a large share of
the country’s sizable official foreign assets was invested in U.S. dollar instruments. The
authorities further indicated that much of the increase in inflation in recent years was due to
factors unrelated to the euro/dollar exchange rate, especially housing shortages that have
caused sharp increases in rents as highlighted above.
24.
Both traditional competitiveness indicators and an analysis of the U.A.E.’s real
exchange rate based on Consultative Group for Exchange Rate Issues (CGER)-type
methodology suggest that there is no misalignment of the dirham (Box 3). While there is
some evidence of modest undervaluation of the currency, it cannot be concluded that the
exchange rate is misaligned, particularly given the uncertainties in estimating equilibrium
exchange rates in oil producing countries. The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis and
assessment of the level of the exchange rate.
8

At the time of the consultation discussions, Kuwait had not yet announced its decision to switch from a dollar
peg to a peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies. Very soon after this announcement, the U.A.E. authorities
(along with the other members of the GCC) reaffirmed their commitment to the dollar peg.

15
Box 3. U.A.E.’s Real Effective Exchange Rate
1. Following a short period of depreciation, the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the U.A.E.
dirham has appreciated by about
6 percent in the past two years. During the

United Arab Emirates: Actual and Equilibrium
2. The equilibrium real exchange rate
approach suggests that there is no
misalignment of the U.A.E. dirham. An
estimation of the long-run equilibrium real
exchange rate derived from key
macroeconomic fundamentals, such as the
overall fiscal balance and the TOT, shows
that, in 2006, the U.A.E. dirham was
undervalued by only about 2 percent with
respect to its estimated equilibrium level,
well within the margins of error in this type
of analysis.

Source: Fund staff estimates.

3. The application of the macroeconomic balance approach also points to no misalignment of the
dirham currently or in the medium term. The equilibrium current account (or “norm”) for the U.A.E.,
as derived from projections of medium-term fundamentals that determine the U.A.E.’s saving and
investment, is estimated at 21.1 percent of GDP in 2012, compared to a projected surplus of 15.0 percent
of GDP.1 Thus, under this approach, there is no evidence that the dirham is undervalued. Based on
projected outcomes, the current account balance would also be expected to remain below the norm over
the medium term, with both declining over time in response to strong domestic demand. It should be
noted, however, that the estimates of the current account norms are subject to wide margins of errors,
especially in oil producing countries, which calls for caution in interpreting the results. Moreover, the
estimates are sensitive to prospective developments in oil prices and other variables, and the norm can
change significantly over time as a result.
4. Competitiveness of the non-oil sector does not seem to have been significantly affected by the real
exchange rate appreciation, given the productivity gains from the improvement in the business
climate, the modernization of large segments of the economy, and the supply of expatriate labor at
competitive rates. The U.A.E.’s non-oil exports of goods and services have been growing at about
26 percent over the past four years.

The variables used in the estimation of the equilibrium current account include the fiscal balance, net foreign assets,
net oil exports, real per capita GDP growth, and population growth.

16
F. Structural Reforms
25.
The authorities have announced a major reform plan that sets the U.A.E.
government’s strategy for the next three years. The strategic plan addresses key issues
pertaining to social and economic development, public sector reforms, infrastructure and
rural development, as well as justice and safety. Specific action plans for the federal and
emirate governments are still under discussion. The authorities explained that emphasis will
be placed on improving government efficiency and strengthening the cooperation between
the federal and emirate governments.
26.
Efforts to improve the business environment have intensified. The authorities
noted that the U.A.E. ranks high in international business surveys, and pointed to several
initiatives under way to update key laws and regulations, including the corporate law, the
competition laws, and labor market legislation.9 Several initiatives to improve labor markets
regulations were introduced in 2006, including to allow greater flexibility for labor mobility
across sectors, imposing mandatory health insurance schemes, and enforcing safety
regulations.
G. Regional Cooperation
27.
The U.A.E. authorities remain committed to achieving the GCC monetary union
by 2010. Although some countries may encounter difficulties in meeting the convergence
criteria by the agreed deadline, the U.A.E. authorities were confident that these difficulties
would be overcome. As such, the 2010 target date remains unchanged, and the relevant
decisions in this regard will be made by the GCC finance ministers and governors of central
banks at their meeting in October 2007. The U.A.E. authorities remain open to discussing all
options for the common exchange rate regime under the monetary union.10
28.
The high economic growth in the U.A.E. has had significant regional spillover
effects. Government investment funds and public enterprises have become a major source of
FDI in several countries in the Middle East region. For example, in Pakistan and Egypt, FDI
inflows from the U.A.E. amounted to about 40 percent and 20 percent of total FDI inflows in
2006, respectively. U.A.E. companies are also undertaking major investment projects in
other countries, including Jordan, Syria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Dubai is playing an
increasingly important role as a regional financial center. Finally, transfers of remittances by
foreign workers in the U.A.E., estimated to be in excess of $8 billion in 2006 are benefiting
several recipient countries in the Middle East and Asia.

9

The U.A.E. ranks 31 out of 125 countries surveyed by the World Economic Forum’s 2006 Global
Competitiveness Report.

10

These issues are discussed in the forthcoming 2007 Article IV report on Saudi Arabia.

17
H. Statistics
29.
Efforts to upgrade the statistical system have intensified. The authorities
underscored their determination to make major improvements in the U.A.E. statistical
systems in the next few years as highlighted in their strategic plan. A National Bureau of
Statistics will be established by end-2007, and a number of surveys are under preparation.11
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to follow up on the recent IMF technical
assistance mission to improve the quality and timeliness of the consumer price data. The
authorities have also requested further technical assistance in this area, including a multisector statistics mission to advise on further steps to upgrade the statistical system. Finally,
the authorities confirmed their intention to expedite the process toward participating in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), including by appointing a national
coordinator.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The U.A.E. has firmly established itself as a dynamic, well-managed economy.
Strong growth, investment, and job-creation have been aided by an outward-oriented
development strategy, a favorable business climate, and sustained high oil prices. The fiscal
and external positions exhibit large surpluses, and the medium-term prospects look positive
even if oil market conditions were to be significantly less favorable than projected. Staff
expects investment and growth to ease moderately in the near term in light of the existing
capacity constraints, but to expand at relatively strong rates, once the capacity constraints
have been addressed.
31.
A key challenge is to contain inflation. Alleviating capacity constraints, especially
in the housing and transportation sectors, will be essential in avoiding overheating and
reducing inflation. Ongoing projects in these sectors will help in this respect, but a
coordinated phasing of some of the planned large-scale investment projects by public and
quasi-public entities outside the budget is needed, with the priority given to those projects
that help improve the economy’s absorptive capacity. If inflation fails to decelerate
significantly in 2007, further expenditure restraint, including by public and quasi-public
entities, would be necessary to contain domestic demand growth. Caps on rent increases
should be temporary and be eliminated as soon as housing supply improves.
32.
Fiscal policy would need to be geared to playing a more active role in containing
demand growth in view of the limitations of monetary policy under the current pegged
exchange rate regime. The federal and emirate governments are proceeding on a range of
fiscal reforms aimed at modernizing the fiscal system and improving government efficiency.
11

A national Household Expenditure Survey is underway in preparation for a new CPI, in addition to
investment and economic surveys by the Statistics Center of Dubai and the Abu Dhabi Department of Planning.

18
Given the federal structure of the U.A.E. in which the federal government budget is
relatively small, and the emirate governments enjoy a large degree of fiscal autonomy, there
is an urgent need to strengthen fiscal coordination at all government levels. Staff welcomes
the authorities’ intention to give priority to this issue, including by establishing a macrofiscal unit with Fund technical assistance.
33.
The authorities’ policy choice of maintaining the current exchange rate regime
during the run up to the GCC monetary union is appropriate. The peg to the U.S. dollar
has provided the U.A.E. economy a credible nominal anchor and there are no compelling
reasons to change it during the transition to the GCC monetary union. The current peg to the
U.S. dollar remains appropriate for the U.A.E. given its trade pattern and the large share of
dollar-denominated financial assets. Staff supports the authorities’ commitment to work
closely with the other GCC member countries on the preparation of the monetary union,
including reaching consensus among all parties on the appropriate common exchange rate
regime to be adopted in this context.
34.
Real exchange rate developments do not suggest that the dirham is out of line
with fundamentals. Based on current policies, the real effective exchange rate is in line with
its equilibrium level over the medium term. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated,
through higher inflation. However, the normal indicators of competitiveness do not give
reasons for concern at this stage, especially given improvements in the business climate and
the U.A.E.’s access to expatriate labor at competitive wage rates. Going forward, priority
should be to step up structural reforms to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
35.
The banking system is sound, but there are areas in need of development. The
authorities are encouraged to implement the recommendations of the FSAP Update aimed at
further strengthening prudential regulations and supervision. In view of the rapid credit
growth, including in real estate lending, there is a need to enhance central bank surveillance
of bank and finance company risk management practices. Staff cautions against allowing
banks to increase their exposure to the real estate sector through subsidiary companies, and
underscores the need to coordinate and improve supervision of financial services groups
comprising banks, insurance companies, and securities firms. It also welcomes the
authorities’ intention to establish a federal credit bureau to help improve the reporting and
monitoring of credit data. The authorities are encouraged to enact a number of laws aimed at
strengthening the regulations governing the equity markets and their supervision. Finally,
staff calls for improved monitoring of external borrowing by financial institutions and large
corporations and welcomes the planned establishment of a debt management unit by the
Dubai government.

19
36.
Current efforts to improve the statistical system are encouraging. While data
provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes, improvements in the quality,
availability, and timeliness of economic statistics would help policy analysis and
formulation. The authorities are encouraged to follow through with the envisaged steps to
improve consumer price and other economic statistics, including national accounts, balance
of payments, and fiscal data as well as to expedite the process of subscribing to the GDDS.
Consolidating data on public sector spending, including by government and quasi-public
entities outside the budget would allow a better assessment of their contribution to demand
pressures.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

The U.A.E. dirham was officially pegged to the SDR at the rate of AED 4.76190 = SDR 1
from November 1980 to February 2002—albeit, in practice, it was pegged to the dollar at a
fixed parity. Since then, in line with commitments agreed on with other GCC countries
toward the adoption of a common currency in 2010, the U.A.E. dirham has become officially
pegged to the U.S. dollar. The mid-point between the official buying and selling rates for the
dirham has been AED 3.6725 = $1 since November 1997.

Exchange System

The U.A.E.’s exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, other than restrictions maintained for security reasons
pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions, which restrictions should be notified to the
Fund in accordance with Executive Board Dec. No. 144-(52/51).

•

Investment Climate. In response to a request from the advisor to the Crown Prince
of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) for assistance in the area of Foreign Investment and
Economic Development, a World Bank mission visited the emirate in late February
2004. Following discussion in RAK, the Bank team prepared TORs for the first of a
four-phase program, and an agreement was signed in late March. The second phase,
consisting in an assessment of the investment climate in RAK, was followed by an
Investors’ Promotion Conference in May 27–28, 2005 to increase awareness that this
emirate could quickly develop as a serious contender for investment destination.

•

The World Bank jointly with the IMF, conducted an update of the FSAP in
January 07.

•

In response to a request from the federal Ministry of Finance and Industry, a Bank
specialist will visit Abu Dhabi on June 24 to discuss the development of debt
markets.

IFC continues to provide ad hoc support to the UAE at the federal and local levels

ANNEX III: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data provision to the Fund is adequate for overall surveillance purposes, data
shortcomings affect staff’s analysis. Shortcomings in economic and financial data reflect
inadequate compilation techniques, infrequent data reporting, shortage of trained staff,
insufficient resources assigned to data gathering, and poor information flow between federal
and emirate governments and public sector entities. As a result, provision of data to the Fund
between missions remains poor, except for monetary and some trade statistics. In addition,
the frequency of official statistics is inadequate—most data are produced only on an annual
basis.
2.
The U.A.E. has received several STA technical assistance missions over the past
decade. The 2003 STA multi-sector statistics mission concluded that, while the
methodologies used to compile macroeconomic statistics are generally appropriate, serious
deficiencies exist in most sectors.1 These are attributable to the lack of sufficient and regular
data sources in the real sector; inadequate coordination among data compiling agencies; and
constraints from the distribution of personnel and financial resources between the federal
government and the largest emirates. In response to the authorities’ interest in participating in
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), the 2003 mission worked with U.A.E.
officials to prepare draft GDDS metadata. The U.A.E. hosted a GDDS workshop in Abu
Dhabi during February 27–March 9, 2005.
3.
The STA Country Coordinator for the U.A.E. visited Abu Dhabi during March 11–
22, 2007 as part of a consumer price index (CPI) mission. The authorities expected that
follow-up discussions involving the Ministry of Economy (MOE), the U.A.E. Central Bank,
and the Ministry of Finance and Industry would result in the appointment of a GDDS
coordinator.
Real sector

1

•

Only an annual CPI is compiled.

•

Staff resources at the Ministry of Economy (MOE)—which compiles and
disseminates the annual CPI with a three month lag—and coordination among various
federal and emirate data producing agencies need considerable strengthening.

•

The proposal for the creation of an independent National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
submitted to the Council of Ministers in early 2007, was approved in April 2007 as
part of the U.A.E. Government Strategy for the next three years. The NBS will have
general oversight of the national statistical system and will undertake the current
statistical functions and responsibilities of the MOE, including the compilation of
price statistics. The conduct of the new 2007/08 Household Expenditures Survey,

United Arab Emirates: Report of the Multisector Statistics/GDDS mission, December 2003.

6
which was launched in April 2007, will greatly facilitate the adoption of a highfrequency CPI.
•

The annual CPI has several shortcomings. The outdated weights do not adequately
represent all regions; items, outlets and rental units surveyed for prices are not
sufficiently representative; there are no replacement items or imputations for missing
prices, and no quality adjustment procedures.

•

The national accounts compilation system suffers from a number of deficiencies,
including lack of a comprehensive data collection program. The statistical techniques
used in compiling GDP by production and expenditure approaches are not sound.
Basic data remain inadequate for manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail
trade, and most of the other service sectors. Despite their importance in total GDP, oil
and gas sector data are received with a lag from the Abu Dhabi National Oil
Company (ADNOC) and computation of the real value-added for petrochemicals is
not based on the 1993 SNA methodology.

•

Although labor statistics collected through census are broadly in line with ILO
recommendations, there are divergences from ILO definitions, including
inconsistency of some concepts and irregular and incomplete updating of the census
data. Lack of regular household surveys prevents compilation of annual data on basic
national labor force statistics such as wages, unemployment, labor force and
employment.

Fiscal sector
•

Principal deficiencies can be attributed to both the lack of coordination among the
emirates and federal government, and the low frequency in reporting of government
financial operations. The Ministry of Finance and Industry (MOFI) compiles data for
the federal government only. Separate fiscal data on the federal government and three
emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah), which are provided to the annual
Article IV consultation missions, are used by Fund staff to provide a consolidated
fiscal position for the U.A.E. An annual, “consolidated” fiscal statement is published
in the central bank’s Statistical Bulletin, which is different from the Fund staff
presentation, due to the omission of certain budget items, such as investment income.
International standards of economic classification of expenditure and revenue are not
fully followed.

•

The last data reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook were for 1999 and covered only the federal government. No financing
information is provided by either the federal authorities or any of the emirates. No
sub-annual data are reported for publication to the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS). Information on pension fund activities administered by the authorities

7
through the federal-level General Pension and Social Security Authority (GPSSA) has
been available since the 2002 consultation mission.2
Monetary sector
•

Monetary and financial sector statistics are reported with a considerable lag and do
not include information on the activities of non-bank finance companies.

•

As in the case of other GCC countries, the 2006 STA workshop on the harmonization
of monetary and financial statistics found that the U.A.E.’s Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs) suffer from a number of weaknesses.

External sector
•

Balance of payments (BOP) statistics suffer from a lack of primary data sources for
most transactions. Staffing for BOP compilation is insufficient, and cooperation from
other government agencies remains inadequate. Many entries are estimates based on
incomplete information and some important transactions, such as foreign direct
investment (FDI), are not covered at all and are estimated by Fund’s staff. There are
major gaps in official and private transfers, oil companies’ service payments, private
and official investment income, and financial transactions for all sectors except
banks. The U.A.E. does not report BOP data for publication in the IMF’s IFS (with
the exception of trade statistics, which have been irregular), or the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).

•

The authorities do not compile or publish the International Investment Position (IIP)
statement, despite ready availability of certain potential sources, such as banking and
government statistics.

Socio-demographic statistics
•

The U.A.E. follows the practice of many other countries, with the MOE taking the
lead in conducting the population census and large surveys, while line ministries
collect data through their administrative reporting systems. A population census was
completed in 2005. At present, no data exist on measures of income distribution,
poverty, and access to basic services.3

2

The GPSSA was established in January 1999 to provide pension and social security insurance benefits to all
nationals working in the government and the private sectors (except Abu Dhabi government employees which
have their own separate pension fund).

3

It should be noted that the Statistics Center of Dubai has made substantial progress regarding the provision of
socio-demographic statistics for the emirate of Dubai.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 21, 2007

1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in the United Arab
Emirates that has become available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive
Board on August 21, 2007. This information does not change the staff appraisal.
2.
In August , the WEO oil price projections for 2007 were revised upward by 3 percent
on average compared to their June 2007 baseline. The impact of this revision on the projected
current account and fiscal balances for 2007 is modest (about 0.6 percentage point of GDP
each) and does not materially change the staff’s medium-term scenario.
3.
In July 2007, Moody’s upgraded the government of Abu Dhabi’s long-term foreign
and local currency bond rating to Aa2. This was followed by a rating upgrade for several
U.A.E.-based banks. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi announced plans to issue its first bond in the
international capital markets, which would serve as a benchmark for the pricing of corporate
debt instruments.
4.
The merger of two of the largest banks in Dubai–Emirates Bank International and the
National Bank of Dubai—is underway following the approval by the shareholders in
September. The new consolidated bank, to be named Emirates NBD, will have an asset base
of about $45 billion, the largest in the U.A.E. The merger is expected to lead to further
consolidation in the U.A.E. banking sector.
5.
The U.A.E.’s capital markets seem to be slowly recovering from the sharp correction
that started in 2005. As of September 13, 2007, the Abu Dhabi Securities Market (ADSM)
and the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) had posted positive returns for the year, with gains of
about 14 percent and 2 percent, respectively. A new exchange, the Dubai Mercantile
Exchange, started operations on June 1, with the introduction of the first Oman crude oil
futures contract. The recent turmoil in international financial markets has had a relatively
minor effect on U.A.E. capital markets.
6.
Collaboration between the authorities and the IMF Statistics Department for the
development of a new consumer price index has continued. In addition, a multi-sector
statistics mission is expected to take place in the next few months with the aim of helping the
authorities upgrade their statistical system and subscribe to the GDDS.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
United Arab Emirates
On September 21, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates.1
Background
The U.A.E.’s economic performance remains very strong. Real GDP growth was in excess of
9 percent in 2006, with oil production rising by 8 percent and non-oil sectors growing at doubledigit growth rates. The rapid expansion is supported by an outward-oriented development
strategy, a favorable business climate, and sustained high oil prices. Strong domestic demand
and housing shortages have led to sharp increases in rents and contributed to upward pressure
on other prices. As a result, the consumer price index inflation exceeded 9 percent in 2006.
Reflecting record high oil prices, the overall fiscal and external current account surpluses
remained large in 2006, and have allowed further accumulation of official foreign assets.
The medium-term outlook is very positive with real GDP growth projected to remain strong in
2007, and slightly decelerating thereafter due to temporary capacity constraints. The fiscal and
external accounts are projected to remain in large surplus.
Prudent government spending at the federal and emirate levels has led to a decline in the nonoil fiscal deficit (excluding investment income). At the same time, however, a number of large
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
investment projects are being undertaken by public and quasi-public entities outside the budget,
including in the hydrocarbon sector, infrastructure, real estate, and tourism. External borrowing
to finance these investment projects has also picked up significantly.
The financial system is sound and has not been affected by the correction of the U.A.E. stock
markets in 2005-06. The growth of private sector credit remains high and banks’ exposure to
the real estate sector has increased recently. Reforms are underway to strengthen the
prudential and regulatory oversight of the banking system and the capital markets; open the
banking sector to greater competition; and strengthen the legal framework for the financial
sector.
The authorities are committed to the U.S. dollar peg in the period leading up to the
establishment of the monetary union among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC). They also remain committed to achieving the monetary union by 2010. On the back of
higher inflation in the U.A.E. than in partner countries, the exchange rate of the dirham has
appreciated in real effective terms by about 6 percent since 2004.
The authorities announced a major reform plan that sets the U.A.E.’s strategy for the next three
years. A key focus of the strategy will be to improve government efficiency and strengthen the
cooperation between the federal and emirate governments. Progress is also being made to
improve the business climate, through updates of key legislation, such as the labor, company,
and competition laws.
Efforts to address the weaknesses of economic statistics at the national level have intensified.
Work is underway to improve consumer price data, including with Fund technical assistance,
and to establish a National Bureau of Statistics by end-2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the U.A.E’s impressive growth performance over the past few
years, stemming from the authorities’ successful outward-oriented development strategy, the
use of oil resources to achieve economic diversification, and the pursuit of prudent
macroeconomic policies. The medium-term prospects look bright, supported by a continued
favorable outlook for energy prices given sustained global demand, a strong investment
momentum, and an improved domestic business climate. Directors agreed that the key
challenges will be to ensure sustained noninflationary growth and further diversification of the
economy.
Directors observed that although the assessment of inflation is complicated by data
weaknesses, the rate of price increases, driven mainly by strong demand for housing, is too
high. They acknowledged, however, that the anticipated reduction of capacity constraints––
especially in the housing market––is likely to reduce inflation pressures over the medium term.
Directors considered that fiscal policy could play a greater role in regulating domestic demand.
In particular, expenditure increases—including by public and quasi-public entities—should be
consistent with the country’s absorptive capacity. This, together with efforts to alleviate capacity

3
constraints, would help subdue inflation and support a continued economic expansion with
macroeconomic stability.
Directors supported the authorities’ prudent fiscal policy, with the non-oil deficit declining
substantially as a proportion of non-oil GDP, and the overall fiscal position expected to remain
in surplus over the medium term. They commended the authorities’ fiscal reforms, which are
aimed at modernizing the fiscal system and improving efficiency. They welcomed the
preparations to introduce a Value Added Tax system at the federal level. Directors called for
greater fiscal coordination between the emirates and the federal government. They therefore
welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish a macro-fiscal unit at the federal government
level. The phasing and monitoring of large investment projects carried out by government and
quasi-public entities outside the budget should also be intensified.
Directors agreed that the current peg of the dirham to the U.S. dollar has served the U.A.E. well.
They considered that the exchange rate of the dirham is in line with fundamentals, and noted
that further structural reforms would help to sustain the U.A.E.’s competitiveness. Directors
noted the authorities’ commitment to work closely with other GCC member countries to reach
consensus on the appropriate future exchange rate regime to be adopted as part of the GCC
currency union. Looking forward, a few Directors saw value in some flexibility.
Directors noted the strength and resiliency of the U.A.E. financial system, as evidenced by the
high capitalization and profitability of financial institutions. They encouraged the authorities to
further strengthen prudential regulations and bank supervision, especially in the context of the
current rapid credit growth and buoyant real estate market. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to establish a federal credit bureau to help improve the reporting and monitoring of
credit data. At the same time, they called for a strengthening of the supervision of financial
services groups comprising banks, insurance companies, and securities firms.
Directors welcomed steps to enhance the supervision of capital markets and efforts to update
the banking law and the company law, consistent with the recent Financial Sector Assessment
Program update proposals. These steps would, inter alia, remove barriers to foreign
participation in U.A.E. markets and help protect shareholder rights. Directors called on the
authorities to move ahead to enact the draft securities law, encourage the listing on the equity
market of large quasi-public enterprises, and promote an increased role for institutional
investors in the markets. Such measures would strengthen investor confidence, reduce market
volatility, and deepen the U.A.E.’s capital markets.
Directors welcomed the important steps taken to improve the U.A.E.’s statistical systems in the
next few years. They looked forward to the establishment of a National Bureau of Statistics, and
the launching of several statistical surveys currently under preparation. They encouraged the
authorities to follow up on the Fund’s technical assistance recommendations to improve the
quality and timeliness of consumer price data, and fiscal data at the federal and emirates levels.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to expedite the U.A.E.’s participation in the Fund’s
General Data Dissemination Standard.

September 21, 2007

1.
At the outset, I would like to convey the appreciation of the United Arab Emirates
(U.A.E.) authorities to staff and management for the constructive engagement with the Fund.
They are in broad agreement with the thrust of the staff appraisal and look forward to
continued dialogue on the policy priorities in the period ahead.
Recent Developments
2.
For the fourth consecutive year, the economic expansion in the U.A.E. continued at a
brisk pace, against the background of buoyant oil prices, strengthened fundamentals, and an
improved outward-oriented policy environment. At 9.4 percent in 2006, GDP growth was
among the highest in the world, generating over 220 thousand jobs. The expansion was
broad-based, driven by sustained momentum in non-oil activity at over 10 percent—
particularly in the construction, trade, and tourism sectors—as well as an acceleration in
hydrocarbon output. The fiscal and external accounts continued to post record surpluses.
Moreover, the economy has weathered the fallout from the equity market correction in 2006
and the recent financial turbulence induced by the U.S. subprime mortgage sector. These
positive developments reflect the authorities’ steadfast commitment to the judicious use of
hydrocarbon revenues to intensify the diversification drive and further reinforce the
economy’s fundamentals and resilience. Not surprisingly, however, with the sustained
dynamism of the economy outpacing supply-side response, tightening capacity constraints
have stoked inflationary pressures. The rise in inflation in 2006 was largely driven by the
sharp increase in rental prices—particularly in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Nonetheless,
inflationary pressures are expected to abate in 2007 onwards, with the coming on market of
several property and housing projects.
Prospects and Policies
3.
The authorities share staff’s assessment regarding the strength of the macroeconomic
outlook. In the near-term, the authorities are cognizant that inflation is a major concern,
given the risk of entrenching higher expectations if inflation is allowed to persist at its
current rate. To mitigate this risk, a number of measures have already been initiated. These
include the introduction of a temporary cap on rent increases in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which
will be lifted once housing pressures ease in response to the completion of large real estate
projects.

Over the medium-term, the authorities’ development strategy continues to deepen the
diversification process along each emirate’s competitive advantage, with the services
industry likely to become a key driver of non-oil growth. A comprehensive reform plan
setting out the government’s agenda for the coming three years has been announced. The
plan addresses economic development and social issues, with federal and emirate-specific
proposals still under deliberation. Furthermore, an ambitious investment program is currently
underway to expand capacity in the tourism, transportation, manufacturing, and hydrocarbon
sectors. These investments are expected to set the stage for a structurally higher productivity
growth and output potential. To safeguard price stability, execution of this strategy will take
into account absorptive capacity and implementation considerations in the economy.
Additionally, and while the economic transformation should temper any potential
weaknesses stemming from the hydrocarbon sector, it is important to note that public
finances remain resilient to slides in oil prices as low as US$32 per barrel—a highly unlikely
scenario given the structural shift in oil prices.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
5.
In view of the volatility in oil prices and uncertainty about the permanence of the
price increase, fiscal policy in the U.A.E. continues to aim at achieving a balance between
saving the oil revenues and the need for increased spending to expand the economy’s
absorptive capacity. Against this backdrop, and notwithstanding a sharp increase in
hydrocarbon-based revenues, a prudent expenditure policy has been maintained at all levels
of government. Indeed, while the overall budget balance registered a record surplus of
29 percent of GDP in 2006, the non-oil deficit as a proportion of non-oil GDP further
narrowed to about 15 percent—half its value just three years ago. Such a remarkable fiscal
stance is attuned to efforts to contain inflation at the current juncture.
6.
On the expenditure side, current expenditure in relation to GDP registered a modest
decline, underpinned by a diminished share of the wage bill. This largely reflects ongoing
efforts by Abu Dhabi to outsource non-core budget activities, with the significant
retrenchment of the size of its government partly offsetting the effect of the wage increase on
the budget. On the revenue side, non-oil revenues as a share of non-oil GDP continued on an
upward trend, picking up by 3 percentage points in 2006 to 19.2 percent. The prospective
introduction of a value added tax (VAT) in advance of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
target date should further broaden the revenue base, and provide the federal government with
more instruments to calibrate fiscal policy.
7.
Complementing the disciplined fiscal stance has been the substantial progress on
important structural reforms to enhance the budget structure and improve its effectiveness. At
the federal level, key achievements include the establishment of a treasury single account, the
revision of the budget classification and chart of accounts, and the development of a
government financial management information system. At the same time, the authorities
have devised a strategic reform plan aimed at enhancing fiscal coordination between the
federal and emirate levels, including by better capturing of off-budget investment spending
by government and quasi-public entities. To this end, the authorities are working toward
setting up a macro-fiscal unit at the federal level.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Given the full convertibility of the capital account, monetary policy in the U.A.E. is
primarily geared toward maintaining credibility of the currency peg. Although growth in
money aggregates was robust in 2006, it decelerated markedly compared to 2005. The
Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) has stepped up its issuance of certificates of deposits,
which helped ease the growth in liquidity. The deceleration in money growth in large part
reflects the decline in net foreign assets by commercial banks. Taking advantage of the
favorable external environment and successive ratings upgrades, banks have increased their
foreign borrowing to finance the strong growth in credit in support of investment. The
authorities are aware of the importance of monitoring external borrowing by financial
institutions and corporations. To this end, a debt management unit will be established in
Dubai.
9.
The authorities are reconfirming their commitment to the U.S. dollar peg in the
transition to the GCC monetary union in 2010. The peg has served the economy well by
enhancing the credibility of the policy framework. The authorities are also of the view that
the current exchange level is appropriate, and agree with staff’s assessment outlined in Box
3. While on the subject of the exchange rate, it is well to assert that there are inherent
difficulties in the application of the 2007 Surveillance Decision to oil producing countries.
Consistent with the broader GCC strategy, the authorities remain open to discussing all
options for the common exchange rate regime under the monetary union.
Financial Sector Issues
10.
The Financial Sector Stability Update (FSSA) has confirmed the soundness and
increased sophistication of the U.A.E. financial system. Benefiting from the rapid expansion
in the economy, the banking sector is enjoying comfortable levels of profits and
capitalization. The sector is being opened up to foreign competition, with the granting of
licenses to three GCC banks and two Islamic banks in 2006. Islamic banks are becoming an
increasingly important part of the banking system. To assist them in better managing their
liquidity, the CBU is contemplating the issuance of Shariah-compliant instruments. Good
progress has been made in strengthening banking sector supervision and regulation, notably
the introduction by the CBU of a comprehensive risk assessment approach, the preparation
for full implementation of Basel II principles by end-2007, and the approval of several key
pieces of AML/CFT legislation.
11.
Stress testing has also established the resilience of the banking system to a variety of
shocks, including to deterioration in asset quality, as well as interest rate and foreign
exchange risks. Although a few banks could be affected by a severe correction in the real
estate market, the authorities are of the view that the related risks are relatively muted. Two
important considerations bear on this view. First, banking sector exposure to the real estate
sector (mortgage and construction) is relatively limited and concentrated within some
institutions and geographic areas. This should help contain any spillover effect from a
potential correction in the real estate sector. Second, staff’s own assessment is for the strong
demand in housing and property to continue over the medium term. If correct, this would
substantially diminish the risk of a sharp price correction in the real estate sector.

4
Nevertheless, the CBU is reviewing its classification of bank exposure to the real estate
sector, and is further contemplating more appropriate prudential oversight. The planned
establishment of a federal credit bureau should also help strengthen banking supervision
more generally.
12.
The U.A.E. capital markets are further gaining in depth and sophistication, and their
supervision is being strengthened. In connection with the latter, important measures include
the transfer of responsibility for oversight of Initial Public Offerings (IPO) from the Ministry
of Economy to the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority (ESCA) in early 2007,
with the pricing of IPOs undertaken in collaboration with the private sector. In addition, a
new code of good governance has been issued, envisaging the enhancement of governance
practices and disclosure of listed companies.
13.
Building on Dubai’s aggressive diversification drive, the Dubai International
Financial Center (DIFC) is increasingly promoting the U.A.E. as a regional financial hub.
Activities in the DIFC are supported by an impressive physical infrastructure and sound legal
framework aligned with best international practices. While banking activities remain
relatively limited, the stock exchange, DIFX, is competing successfully with other U.A.E.
and GCC markets.
Structural Policies and Other Issues
14.
The authorities’ outward oriented and private sector friendly strategy is reflected in
highly open and flexible labor markets. Notwithstanding the favorable ranking in
international business surveys, the authorities are intensifying their efforts to strengthen the
business climate and safeguard private sector competitiveness. Key initiatives in this regard
include the ongoing revision of the corporate and competition laws, as well as the updating of
labor market legislation to allow greater labor mobility across sectors.
15.
Significant steps have been taken to upgrade the statistical database. As part of the
government’s three-year strategy to overhaul federal government statistics, a National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) will be established by end-2007. In this connection, the 1974
Statistics Law is being revised to grant the NBS the professional independence and the
authority to undertake its designated activities. Progress is also being made to improve the
timeliness and quality of consumer price data, with the assistance of the Fund. In
March 2007, a technical assistance mission prepared a report which included a work plan for
the development of a monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI), compiled in accordance with
international standards. The plan takes into account several requirements for the construction
of the CPI, most notably the implementation of a new Household Expenditure Survey (HES)
launched in April 2007. The authorities are also working on finalizing their participation in
the IMF General Data Dissemination System.
