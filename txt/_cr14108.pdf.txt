STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. As the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Qatar has turned
into an important global financial investor, donor, and labor importer. Growth averaged
14 percent over the past decade and GDP per capita has reached $100,000, the highest
in the world. Qatar remains insulated from sluggish global growth thanks to high
hydrocarbon prices and a large public investment program to support economic
diversification and prepare for the FIFA 2022 Championship.
Outlook and risks. Macroeconomic performance is expected to remain strong, driven
by the non-hydrocarbon sector which accounts for almost one-half of the economy.
Potential challenges include the risk of over-heating in the near term and over-capacity
in the medium term as a result of the large public investment program. The possibility of
a sharp decline in oil and gas prices remains the main medium-term risk; however, the
authorities have ample fiscal and external buffers to deal with contingencies.
Risks from public investments. Policymakers need to remain vigilant about
overheating risks. Capital spending should be smoothed if signs of overheating emerge,
and liquidity withdrawal operations and further macroprudential measures deployed in
case of excessive credit growth or risk-taking. A comprehensive public investment
management framework would increase the efficiency of public spending and reduce
the risk of overinvestment.
Fiscal reforms. The authorities have appropriately been saving the large fiscal surpluses,
and have started introducing a medium-term focus into the budget process by
implementing a three-year budget framework and establishing performance measures.
The framework should be accompanied by realistic hydrocarbon price assumptions and
a more detailed multi-year expenditure plan.
Financial sector. The authorities are implementing an ambitious financial regulatory
agenda, including establishing an umbrella advisory committee and issuing a final
Basel III circular. Banks remain well capitalized and liquid, but the authorities should
continue carefully monitoring vulnerabilities through an enhanced early warning system.
Diversification. The authorities are also supporting economic diversification through
measures to further financial deepening and private sector development.

CONTEXT
1.
As the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Qatar plays a systemic
role in the global natural gas market. Qatar accounts for about 1/3 of global LNG trade and has
become the key supplier for Japan, South Korea, India, and the United Kingdom. In addition to

2.
Having successfully completed a strategy to develop natural gas resources, the
authorities have embarked on a large public investment program to advance economic
diversification and prepare for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. Under the new Emir, the authorities
continue pursuing development and diversification strategy guided by the Qatar National Vision
2030 and National Development Strategy, 2011–16.1 While a further expansion of LNG production is
possible, Qatar will maintain a moratorium on development of new hydrocarbon projects until at
least 2015 to give itself time to assess its production performance and carry out a comprehensive
study of its North Field. Meanwhile, diversification is supported through budget-financed
investment projects worth an estimated $160 billion (80 percent of last year’s GDP) over
2014–21, supplemented by some $50 billion from public enterprises. Alongside, the macroeconomic
policy framework is being strengthened by a number of ambitious reforms in the area of fiscal policy
and institutions, financial regulation, macroprudential policies, liquidity management, and
development of the local debt market, consistent with IMF staff advice.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Qatar’s macroeconomic
performance has remained strong (Figure
1). GDP growth slowed from 13 percent in
2011 to 6.2 percent in 2012, largely as a
result of the self-imposed moratorium on
new hydrocarbon investments in the North
Field. Growth is estimated to have remained
around 6 percent in 2013, driven by a
10 percent expansion in the
nonhydrocarbon sector, particularly
construction, transport, communications,
and finance. The nonhydrocarbon sector
now accounts for almost one-half of the
economy.

4.
The negative spillovers from sluggish global growth and financial market volatility
have been limited. The tight LNG market and supply disruptions among other oil producers have
kept hydrocarbon prices high. Announcements regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset purchases
modestly raised the cost of external funding and contributed to money market volatility, but have
had no discernible effect on the local lending rates so far. The recent emerging market turmoil has
not affected local financial markets given strong fundamentals and modest financial linkages.
5.
Inflation increased early last year due to increased housing demand, but has fallen
since then. With rents and related components constituting over 30 percent of the CPI basket, a

6.
The central government budget continues to post large surpluses (Figure 2). The
FY2012/13 budget surplus increased to 9 percent of GDP on the back of strong growth in revenues
(especially from the nonhydrocarbon sector), despite a substantial overrun in current expenditures.
Spending on infrastructure and other capital projects was broadly unchanged, but capital
expenditures have picked up during the current fiscal year. The underlying non-hydrocarbon fiscal
balance as a share of non-hydrocarbon GDP has been improving since the global financial crisis,
from -54 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in FY2010/11 to an estimated -46 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in FY2013/14 (ending March 2014). Gross government debt as of March 2014 is
projected at 34 percent of GDP, with the authorities issuing T-bills and T-bonds for financial market
development and liquidity management purposes. Net debt remains negative considering the QIA’s
large assets.
7.
The current account recorded a surplus of 32 percent of GDP in 2012 and another high
surplus can also be expected in 2013, reflecting sustained high prices of LNG, crude oil, and
condensates exports. LNG prices in Qatar’s main export markets in Asia have so far remained largely
unaffected by the rapid growth in the U.S. unconventional gas and oil production. The real effective
exchange rate remained roughly unchanged during 2013.

8.
Monetary and credit conditions remain accommodative, but public sector credit
growth has slowed substantially (Figure 3). Accommodative U.S. monetary policy has been
mirrored by low policy rates in Qatar. Broad money and private sector credit have continued to grow
robustly, while the share of real estate lending has somewhat moderated. However, public sector
credit growth has slowed substantially, partly reflecting previous strong growth and delays with
infrastructure investments. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) started requiring an approval for new
borrowing by public sector enterprises since October 2013.
9.
The banking sector is profitable and liquid. Tier 1 capital stood at 15 percent of riskweighted assets at end-2013 and NPLs remain below 2 percent despite a recent slight increase.
Banks remain highly profitable with a return on assets at 2 percent. Liquidity buffers are strong, with
liquid assets around 50 percent of total assets. Foreign funding of commercial banks—which
increased substantially in recent years—has been pared back from 30 percent of total liabilities at its
peak in early 2012 to about 23 percent at present, and its maturity structure has improved, with
short-term loans gradually replaced by longer-term securities.2 The aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio
has fallen from 1.2 to 1.0 over the past year, partly due to rising public sector deposits.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.


The short- and medium-term macroeconomic outlook is positive under the baseline.
GDP growth could stay around
6 percent in 2014 as the pickup in public
investments is offset by a modest
decline in hydrocarbon output. The new
gas-to-liquids Barzan plant could help
push growth above 7 percent in 2015.
Public investments are expected to keep
growth at roughly 6-7 percent over the
medium term, with nonhydrocarbon
growth remaining about 10 percent.



Inflation is projected to stay benign at
3 to 4 percent going forward—a modest increase from recent years due to accelerating capital
expenditures. The anticipated gradual decline in commodity prices, including for food, should
reduce price pressures from strong economic activity in the context of the exchange rate peg.



Fiscal and external balances are projected to taper down significantly over time due to flat LNG
production, falling crude oil output from mature fields, expected lower hydrocarbon prices (the
World Economic Outlook assumptions see the Brent oil price falling from $110 a barrel at present
to about $90 a barrel by 2019), and growing nominal expenditures. The public debt ratio is

expected to fall, but the headline budget balance could—according to IMF staff projections—
turn into deficit by 2019, while the current account surplus could drop to 6½ percent of GDP.
11.
Domestic risks to the above baseline are mostly related to the ongoing public
investment program (see Risk Assessment Matrix). The investment projects are essential to
propel nonhydrocarbon sector growth and facilitate economic diversification. However, the program
entails the possibility of overheating in the near term, and low return and overcapacity in the
medium term. In particular, the extent to which public investment will durably boost private sector
productivity remains uncertain. An unsuccessful design and implementation of the investment
program would also increase the level of nonperforming loans in the banking system. That said,
productivity could as well surprise on the upside, if major investments such as the forthcoming
opening of a new airport boost broader economic activity.
12.

Meanwhile, Qatar remains exposed to several global risks (Risk Assessment Matrix).



In the short-term, a global slowdown or financial turbulence could yet have adverse
repercussions for Qatar. Generally, revenue losses from lower oil and natural gas exports
would likely be the most significant spillover channel for Qatar given the high share of
hydrocarbons in budget revenues and exports. This would particularly apply to a scenario
with the protracted emerging market slowdown. However, the financial channel could
become important given Qatari banks’ remaining wholesale funding exposures abroad, their
MENA linkages, and external financing needs for the infrastructure program. For example,
global financial market volatility due to the exit from unconventional monetary policies in
advanced economies or a renewed crisis in the Euro area could raise borrowing rates, while
reducing credit availability. A global financial shock would also reduce the value of Qatar’s
sizeable foreign assets. The recent experience with financial market spillovers is discussed in
Box 1.



The main medium-term risk remains the possibility of a sharp decline in oil and gas prices in
light of growing unconventional oil and natural gas supplies, sluggish global growth, and
rising energy efficiency. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that while the U.S. shale gas
boom has not meaningfully affected

public expenditures, less financing available for the investment program, and
lower non-hydrocarbon growth. Qatar could draw on its large financial cushions
while accelerating economic diversification. Low-cost LNG production, long-term
gas contracts, and built-in diversion clauses in gas contracts could partially reduce
risks. In case of higher hydrocarbon prices, effects would be the opposite.

A temporary land border closure would raise prices of certain items, including
some foodstuffs and building materials. A temporary blockage of the Strait of

disruptions could be partly mitigated by releasing the strategic stockpiles of food
and building materials, and using the Qatar's large financial cushions.
Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Given its geographic location, Qatar is susceptible to the tail risk of transport disruptions. For
instance, should the recent foreign policy dispute with its three GCC neighbors (Saudi
Arabia, U.A.E., Bahrain) lead to temporary sanctions on Qatar—a tail risk scenario—Qatar
would face logistical challenges as certain food items and construction materials are
imported from these immediate neighbors and some imports from other countries are also
channeled through the Dubai port or over the Saudi Arabia land border. The direct trade
and financial exposures are, however, limited.

13.
Qatar has ample policy space to deal with unexpected circumstances in the short
term. Fiscal buffers and remaining natural resources are sizeable3 and spending is unlikely to be
affected by a drop in hydrocarbon prices or market volatility in the near term. The QCB can inject
liquidity into the financial system through its lending window and repo operations, and the
government could achieve the same goal by managing portfolio allocations of the QIA and public
sector enterprises. The government also aided the banking system with equity injections and
purchases of impaired assets during the global financial crisis. The tail risk of transport disruptions is
managed by building strategic stocks of food and construction materials.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Managing Risks from the Public Investment Program
14.
The authorities and staff agreed on
the importance of managing risks from the
Qatar’s large public investment program.
The projects include basic infrastructure (e.g.,
airport, port, metro, railway, and roads), real
estate (including the new Lusail City), schools,
hospitals, and stadiums for the 2022 FIFA
Championship.

the moment, policymakers need to remain
vigilant. The authorities—mindful of Qatar’s 2006-08 experience with double-digit inflation—intend
to phase in the investment projects gradually and various high-level committees are tasked with
identification and removal of supply-chain bottlenecks. However, the mission recommended
smoothing capital spending if signs of overheating emerge, and deploying liquidity withdrawal
operations and further macroprudential measures in case of excessive credit growth or risk-taking.

Qatar can continue hydrocarbon production at current rates for at least another 100 years.

16.
The mission also saw scope for improving the investment management process to
achieve optimal allocation of resources and high return on investment (Box 2 and Selected
Issues Paper). The authorities have made some progress in developing the relevant institutional
structures, such as establishing the Central Planning Office overseeing infrastructure investments.
Certain big-ticket projects such as the metro, port, and airport have been scaled down or divided
into phases to reduce the risk of overcapacity. However, the large-scale nature of the program has
led to implementation delays and cost overruns. The authorities noted that additional re-profiling
and cuts may be necessary to make the planned investments logistically feasible, and are preparing
a short list of critical projects. The staff reiterated its call for an integrated approach to public
investment management, including rigorous procedures for selection and appraisal of projects, and
encouraged comprehensive and transparent treatment of public programs in the budget, requiring
substantial capacity building and deeper cooperation among various stakeholders. The MoF is
planning to set up a public investment management unit, and have expressed interest in technical
assistance regarding the draft Public Financial Management law.

B. Enhancing the Institutional Framework for Fiscal Policy
17.
The authorities have started introducing a medium-term focus into the budget
process. The FY2014/15 budget circular requires ministries and agencies to provide indicative
budget estimates until FY2016/17 and to share performance information about their programs.
Once fully effective, the medium-term budget framework (MTBF) will help ensure that government
spending is shielded from revenue volatility and expenditure targets are not exceeded, while
providing a platform for assessing the

Information System (GFMIS), which will,
among others, facilitate compilation of the GFSM2001 budget data. The team welcomed these
structural budget reforms and stressed that the MTBF should be accompanied by credible annual
budgets based on realistic hydrocarbon price assumptions (now $65 a barrel) and a more detailed
multi-year expenditure framework backed up by a fully-consistent macroeconomic forecast.
18.
The authorities plan to make the recently established macro-fiscal unit operational as
soon as possible, in line with IMF advice. The unit would prepare macroeconomic forecasts,
revenue and expenditure projections (including compilation of detailed forward-looking information

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

about investment projects), and public debt forecasts. The IMF is ready to field a diagnostic mission
and help find a resident advisor for the unit.
19.
The mission noted that the fiscal policy stance remains consistent with
intergenerational equity. Both the existing and projected fiscal deficits (measured by the
nonhydrocarbon deficit excluding investment income in percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP) appear on
current policies somewhat lower than, but close to, the deficits consistent with a constant real per
capita annuity. This means that the government saves sufficiently for future generations, but does
not over-save.4 Should hydrocarbon prices surprise on the downside, additional measures to contain
current expenditures and prioritize capital spending would need to be considered. The underlying
non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance as a share of non-hydrocarbon GDP is expected by staff to continue

Any net-present-value calculation is subject to caveats about sensitivity to assumptions such as interest rates and
the assumed rate of return. The budget breakeven price estimated by staff is roughly $70 a barrel at present, but the
effective State-level breakeven price including all State hydrocarbon profits could be substantially lower, in the
ballpark of $50 a barrel (Figure 2).

Strengthening Financial Regulation and Monetary Operations to

Maintain Financial Stability
20.
The team welcomed the considerable progress made on the financial sector regulatory
agenda. The QCB Governor has become the head of the Financial Stability and Risk Committee
established by the 2012 Central Bank Law and serves as a chairman of all three regulatory agencies.5
The QCB has taken over responsibility for the previously lightly-regulated insurance industry, and
work is underway to produce joint risk-based analysis of the entire financial system. In December
2013, the three main regulatory agencies published their Strategic Plan for Financial Sector
Regulation until 2016, laying out an ambitious agenda for moving to risk-based regulation,
expanding macro-prudential oversight, strengthening market infrastructure, and consumer and
investor protection. The financial system generally meets comfortably the final Basel III circular for
capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios issued in January 2014. The authorities continue to implement a
number of macro-prudential measures,6 and plan to further enhance their risk-based approach to
AML/CFT that has substantially been bolstered as a result of the 2010 legislation and ongoing IMF
technical assistance. Qatar has been granted emerging market status by MSCI, effective May 2014.

These include the Qatar Central Bank, the Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority, and the Qatar Financial
Markets Authority. The Financial Stability and Risk Committee is tasked with identifying emerging risks in all
segments of the financial sector, coordinating among regulators, and recommending solutions for approval by the
QCB Board.

Currently employed tools include loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, and limits on real estate exposures,
lending concentration, FX lending, and open FX positions.

21.
Banks remain well capitalized and liquid, but the authorities should continue carefully
monitoring vulnerabilities through an enhanced early warning system. Stress tests by the QCB
show resilience to plausible shocks due to high capital and liquidity buffers.7 That said, deposits and
credit are substantially concentrated, and asset quality is exposed to risks from high single party
exposures. The authorities are considering a reduction of the loan-to-deposit ratio which would
further improve the strong liquidity profile of the banking system and its asset quality. Despite
reduced reliance on international wholesale funding, a drying up of external liquidity could adversely
impact the banking system; however, policymakers would have ample room to respond in this
scenario, as noted above. Meanwhile, regional expansion of the largest Qatari banks could stretch
their risk management capacity given the turbulent macroeconomic developments in many MENA
countries,8 and the reliance on foreign funding could increase again when infrastructure projects
pick up. While the current situation does not seem to warrant policy action, policymakers should
continue to closely monitor lending standards, concentration risks, and cross-border activities of
banks. Staff suggested that the QCB’s early warning system should be enhanced to identify risks and
links across all sectors of the economy (Box 3 and Selected Issues Paper). The authorities plan to
incorporate some of the technical recommendations into the next Financial Stability Review and
requested a follow up during the next staff visit.
22.
There is scope to further increase transparency and improve the functioning of the
QCB’s liquidity management framework. The QCB has taken several steps to alter its liquidity
management operations including capping commercial banks’ interest bearing deposits with the
central bank and facilitating issues of T-bills and T-bonds. The issuance has so far proceeded at fixed
nominal allotments, with the short-term T-bill rates continuing to exhibit some volatility. The money
market tightened during summer and fall of 2013, partly as a result of international events such as
the Syrian crisis and negotiations related to the U.S. budget and debt ceiling. The money market
tightening was mostly reversed using a large liquidity injection in January 2014.9 These
developments underscore the need for sending clear signals to markets through a transparent and
well structured liquidity management framework. The scope for QCB open-market operations is
limited due to low secondary-market liquidity. Consideration should, therefore, be given to some
flexibility in setting T-bill and T-bond issuance volumes to reduce the volatility of yields. The
authorities saw some merit in this recommendation but did not see it as a short-term priority. In
staff’s view, close coordination between the MoF and the QCB would enhance liquidity forecasting.

7

The QCB monitors credit, market, liquidity, concentration, exchange rate and systemic risks; see Selected Issues
Paper for a more detailed description of the stress tests. According to the QCB’s Financial Stability Report (2013), the
NPLs would need to increase to 35 percent before the banking system breaches the required capital minimum, and
most banks would withstand liquidity shocks owing partly to availability of the QCB repo facility.
8

The Qatar National Bank, the largest commercial bank which is 50 percent-owned by the government, has 30
percent of its assets in foreign activities, largely in the MENA region.
9

Liquidity fell by QAR 13 billion between May and August 2013, then increased but remained below the previous
levels throughout fall 2013, before sharply rebounding in January 2014—see Box 1.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

23.
The authorities and staff agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime remains
appropriate for Qatar. The peg to the U.S. dollar has anchored prices of tradables and provided
stability to income flows and financial wealth given the dominance of dollar denominated
hydrocarbon exports. Staff analysis suggests that the global share of Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon
exports and the share of Qatar’s imports in GDP have remained broadly stable in recent years. On
the basis of incomplete data, the composition of financial flows appears to have been relatively
stable as well. The real effective exchange rate is stronger than the long-term average, consistent
with high hydrocarbon prices. Staff estimates of three alternative CGER-type models produce
widely-dispersed exchange rate assessments (Appendix 2), but on balance, the overall evidence
does not point to a systematic exchange rate misalignment.

D. Deepening Financial Markets
24.
The authorities and staff concurred that developing deep and liquid domestic debt
markets can bring important benefits. These include funding for the large infrastructure
investment program, enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism, and facilitating liquidity
management. Indeed, the government has been issuing Riyal-denominated securities with the
stated objective of debt market development despite running large fiscal surpluses. Going forward,
the authorities will continue issuing Riyal-denominated government securities, while trimming
foreign borrowing and domestic loans.
25.
The authorities noted additional measures aimed at financial deepening. The
forthcoming creation of the domestic credit rating agency will support corporate bond issuance,
while the public investment program provides an opportunity to issue corporate bonds for revenuegenerating projects. The expanded coverage of the credit bureau is facilitating easier access to
credit. Additional initiatives to improve consumer and investor protection and strengthen market
infrastructure are envisaged in the Strategic Plan for Financial Regulation, as outlined in the text
table above.

E. Structural and Data Issues
26.
Qatar ranks 13th in the Global
Competitiveness Index, the highest in the
GCC region, but it lags behind in terms of
SME development and educational quality
(Figures 4 and 5). The SME sector
contributes only 10 percent of GDP,
compared with almost 30 percent in the
entire MENA region. The authorities have
stepped up their diversification efforts via the
Qatar Development Bank and Enterprise
Qatar, for example, through loan guarantees
and SME feasibility studies. The MoF has

started outsourcing some activities and privatizing selected assets. According to Doing Business,
procedures for registering a business could be simplified further. Efforts are being made to improve
the quality of educational curricula, including via activities of the Qatar Foundation, and to align
them with the labor market needs, while expanding study-abroad programs to increase foreign
language proficiency and acquire specialized skills. The authorities also envisage a gradual rotation
of employment from low productivity industries (such as construction) into higher productivity
knowledge-based sectors as the private sector reaps the benefits of public investments. Success of
these reform efforts will be critical for raising total factor productivity growth—which was negative
in recent years—and securing high return on public investments.
27.
Vast infrastructure spending ahead of the 2022 FIFA Championship has placed a
spotlight on labor market conditions for expatriate workers. Working conditions of some
construction workers and domestic help have made negative headlines and could, among others,
affect the availability and cost of hiring new workers in the future. This would hinder growth since
the success of Qatar’s current development model depends importantly on the ability to rapidly hire
expatriate workers. Committed to improving the situation, the authorities are focusing, for example,
on better enforcement of existing labor laws, and issued a Welfare Charter for workers involved in
FIFA-related projects. Proposals have been submitted to tighten occupation safety rules and
enhance cooperation with the International Labor Organization.
28.
Considerable additional effort is necessary to improve macroeconomic statistics. The
Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics (MDPS) is finalizing the Foreign Investment Survey
which should substantially improve the BoP and IIP statistics. The MDPS also plans to begin
publishing quarterly GDP by expenditure from mid-2014. Further improvements to the real estate
sector statistics and household and corporate balance sheets data would support development of
the QCB’s early warning system. Close collaboration with GCC Stat would help reinforce the
authorities’ efforts to enhance the macroeconomic statistics.10

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Qatar remains insulated from sluggish global growth. GDP could grow by 6 percent this
year, driven by the non-hydrocarbon sector, and modestly accelerate going forward as public
investment disbursements gather pace and the Barzan project comes on stream. Negative spillovers
from the global slowdown have been limited owing to the tight liquefied natural gas market and
supply disruptions among other oil producers. The ongoing emerging market turmoil has not
affected local financial markets given strong fundamentals and modest international financial
linkages. The possible sharp decline in oil and gas prices remains the main medium-term risk,
although oil prices could also stay high if the global supply disruptions persist.

10

GCC Stat—which became operational in June 2013—collects statistical data across the GCC region and facilitates
implementation of the joint statistics projects, including through technical assistance.

30.
Policymakers need to remain vigilant about inflationary pressures. The authorities
should smooth capital spending if signs of overheating emerge, and deploy liquidity withdrawal
operations and further macroprudential measures in case of excessive credit growth or risk-taking.
This strategy can be supplemented by the authorities’ efforts to identify and remove bottlenecks in
the supply chain.
31.
Improving the public investment management process would help achieve better
allocation of resources and high return on investment. An integrated approach to public
investment management, including rigorous procedures for selection and appraisal of projects
would be highly desirable, requiring substantial capacity building and deeper cooperation among
various stakeholders.
32.
The authorities are pursuing ambitious fiscal reforms. The commitment to limiting
spending over-runs, a medium-term focus in the budget process, elements of performance
budgeting, and implementation of GFMIS are very welcome steps in the right direction. Going
forward, the annual budgets should be based on realistic hydrocarbon price assumptions and a
more detailed multi-year expenditure framework. The IMF stands ready to assist with setting up of
the macro-fiscal unit.
33.
Substantial progress has been made on enhancing financial sector regulation. The
authorities have issued the final Basel III circular, and unveiled a three-year Strategic Plan for
Financial Regulation, detailing an ambitious agenda of risk-based regulation, macro-prudential
oversight, and strengthened investor and consumer protection and financial infrastructure. Banks
remain well capitalized, liquid, and profitable, but policymakers need to continue to closely monitor
lending standards, concentration risks, and cross-border activities of banks through an enhanced
early warning system. There is scope to improve liquidity management via more flexible auction
volumes and close cooperation between the QCB and MoF.
34.
Diversification efforts through public investments are being complemented with
measures to support financial deepening and private sector development. The authorities have
stepped up activities of the Qatar Development Bank and Enterprise Qatar, and SME agency. The
MoF has started outsourcing some activities and privatizing selected assets. The Strategic Plan for
Financial Regulation envisages additional measures to strengthen investor and consumer protection.
Efforts are being made to improve the quality of educational curricula. Additional measures to
improve the business environment, for example in the area of business registration, should be
considered.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1: Spillovers from Global Events to Qatari Financial Markets
Qatar’s international financial linkages have been strengthening, supporting the country’s
growth prospects. While recent global financial and geopolitical shocks increased concerns over
possible negative spillovers, Qatar has remained largely insulated so far:


The reaction to U.S. tapering discussions was mixed. After last May’s announcement that
the U.S. may bring forward the end of quantitative easing, yields on Qatar’s USD-denominated
bonds increased, but there was no observable response in domestic short-term rates and
borrowing rates, even as banks’ excess reserves fell. The drop in foreign fund inflows (from
EPFR survey) were small in dollar terms, CDS spread rose modestly, and the stock market
response was muted in sharp contrast with the BRICS. When the U.S. Federal Reserve
surprised by holding off tapering in September, the 10-year yield on the USD-denominated
sovereign bond fell but the Qatari Riyal short-term rates continued their upward drift—the
opposite of what could have been expected. Reaction to the December announcement of
tapering was muted.



The January emerging market turmoil did not affect the local markets. The stock market
remained broadly flat, while the USD-denominated yields fell. The swings in domestic rates
and excess reserves were mostly related to QCB’s liquidity operation.



Negative spillovers were more clearly observed during the August Syria standoff and
U.S. budget and debt ceiling negotiations in the fall. In August, the stock market
temporarily plunged by 10 percent, excess reserves fell, and short-term T-bill yields increased
across the board. Both long-term USD bond yield and CDS spreads increased somewhat.
Confidence improved after the threat of imminent attack subsided, but T-bill yields continued
to drift upward. During and just after the U.S. budget and debt ceiling negotiations, 3-month
T-bill rates rose and excess reserves fell, although the stock market and CDS spreads remained
relatively stable. The November announcement of a temporary agreement between the U.S.
and Iran had no discernible effect on Qatar’s financial markets.

The evidence above suggests that financial spillovers could play an important role under
certain circumstances, especially when the underlying risk has direct implications for the value of
Qatar’s hydrocarbon exports. While the evidence regarding the potential impact of QE exit is
ambiguous, it does point to risks of higher external borrowing costs for Qatar’s banks and
corporations pursuing large-scale investment projects. The January experience also points to the
importance of sound domestic fundamentals and possible role of liquidity operations in
mitigating negative spillovers from global events.

Box 2: Efficiency of Qatar’s Public Investment
Qatar’s public investment efficiency appears
similar to the efficiency of other wealthy
nations, but could be improved further. Qatar
has attained relatively high infrastructure quality,
with total investment similar to (or even lower
than) some other peers. However, Qatar seems
less efficient than advanced countries such as
Canada, Norway, and Singapore.

While Qatar ranks high in a World Bank survey of
government effectiveness, it lags behind
countries in its income group. Putting in place an
integrated public investment management
process for selection, appraisal, and monitoring
of projects could result in greater value for
money. The authorities are planning to set up a
public investment management unit at the MoF.

Cost overruns pose a particular threat. For
example, the planned metro construction costs
appear low in Qatar on a per-kilometer basis.
However, the risk of cost overruns is especially
high for Qatar given the compressed timetable
ahead of FIFA 2022. The experience of Dubai
provides a cautionary tale, with the final costs
exceeding contracted expenditures by 75
percent.

Box 3: Early Warning Exercise
There is scope for enhancing the QCB’s Early Warning System. The current methodology relies
on financial indicators, indices (e.g. for real estate prices and bank stability), and stress tests for
various risk categories (e.g. market, credit, liquidity and funding risks). The framework could be
enhanced along the following dimensions:


Balance Sheet Approach. Cross-sectoral assessments of maturity, currency and capital
structure mismatches would be desirable to identify intersectoral linkages and transmission of
shocks.



External Sector. The framework should formally include assessment of the size and
composition of cross border capital flows (e.g., debt vs. non-debt creating flows, public vs.
private flows), and their impact on financial sector reserves and interest rates.



Asset price and corporate sector. The residential real estate market monitoring can be
enhanced through data on housing vacancies, price-to-rent and price-to-income ratios, a
quantitative model of house prices, and measures of lending standards. Indicators of housing
permit, starts and completions, and more comprehensive data on household and corporate
balance sheets would be desirable as well.



Financial sector. Establishing a credit growth threshold, enhancing the analysis of contagion,
and deeper monitoring of bond market developments would be useful.



Fiscal sector. While less pressing given the strong fiscal buffers, the framework should include
an assessment of longer-term fiscal position, financing risks, and volatility generated by
swings in government spending.

Additional recommendations are detailed in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

and hence a current account norm, that would support intergenerational equity given volatile oil
prices and exhaustible oil reserves—through an appropriate pace of accumulation of net foreign
assets. This calculation suggests the projected current account balance is broadly in line with
fundamentals, but as with any NPV calculation, changing parameter values can have a significant
impact on the estimated current account norm.

The Qatari riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at QR 3.64 = $1.00 since July 2002, following an
unofficial peg that was in effect since June 1980. Qatar has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4(a) and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Qatar maintains
exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 2014)
Cooperation with Qatar began in 2003 with a Public Transport Sector Reform study. A manpower
planning exercise launched in 2003 evolved to a Labor Market Strategy in 2004. In 2005, the World
Bank provided technical assistance on payment systems to the Qatar Central Bank, in the context of
supporting the development of payment and securities clearance and settlement systems in the
Arab region through the Arab Payments and Securities Settlement Initiative, led jointly by the World
Bank, the Arab Monetary Fund and the International Monetary Fund. In 2007, the Bank conducted a
study on the Knowledge Economy (KE) the results of which informed several high-level workshops.
The Government, represented by the Ministry of Finance, signed in 2010 the Framework Agreement
for Advisory Services with the Bank in order to enhance Qatar’s benefit from available services. The
Bank has since provided technical support on a number of strategic issues including strategic
planning, public-private partnerships, and macroeconomic modeling. A recently completed program
with the Ministry of Business and Trade focused on improving the business environment. The
working relationship with Qatar further improved as the Bank helped the authorities prepare for and
deliver the Convention of the Parties (COP 18) to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) that Qatar hosted in December 2012, facilitating dialogue among various
stakeholders on issues of climate change, dry-land agriculture, and food security.
Currently, the Bank is helping the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics prepare the
midterm review of the National Development Strategy 2011-16 by helping report on
implementation progress and possible corrective measures in the domains of institutional
development, human development, and infrastructure. The Bank also provides assistance to the
Ministry of Environment to strengthen environmental policies and procedures under the regional
Gulf Action Plan (GEPAP), and to the General Retirement and Social Insurance Agency to strengthen
its institutional capacity and financial viability. Finally, dialogue started on possible long term
assistance to enhance budget systems and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public
resource utilization in the health and education sectors.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance but there is substantial scope for
improving their frequency, timeliness and coverage. The most affected areas are the real gross
domestic product (GDP), financial accounts of the balance of payments, international investment
position, and external debt statistics.
National Accounts: Qatar publishes quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices.
The accuracy of data in the nonhydrocarbon sector is undermined by the lack of comprehensive
source data. The Ministry for Development Planning and Statistics (MDPS) plans to publish
quarterly GDP by expenditure from summer 2014. Changing the base year (currently 2004) is also
under consideration.
Price statistics: Qatar publishes monthly CPI data based on a basket with a significant share of
rents. However, the rent component has limited geographic coverage and only reflects new
contracts. The authorities are finalizing the household income and expenditure survey 2012-13,
which will be used to update weights estimates for constructing the CPI.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities are implementing the Government Financial
Management Information System (GFMIS) which will enable compilation of accrual fiscal accounts
according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM) guidelines. At the moment,
the GFSM2001 figures are estimated by staff on the basis of modified cash data provided by the
authorities.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data for Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and commercial banks are
generally timely and of high quality. The QCB reports monetary data regularly to STA for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a monthly basis with a lag of about three
weeks. Monthly and quarterly data are also published in the Monthly and Quarterly Statistics
Bulletin.
Financial stability: Qatar Central Bank published and disseminated its fourth Financial Stability
Report in 2013, and plans to prepare a risk-based analysis of the entire financial system in
cooperation with the Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority and Qatar Financial Market
Authority.
Balance of Payments: Since the 2010 technical assistance mission on balance of payments
statistics, as well as the participation of STA staff in the 2011 Article IV Consultation, the
authorities are publishing quarterly BoP data in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The
financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the
Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Exchange. Continuing efforts are needed to
further develop data sources, particularly for the private sector. The 2012 TA mission on CPIS has
facilitated the Foreign Investment Survey for 2010-12 whose completion is expected in coming
months. This data will enable compilation of comprehensive data on the Qatar’s International
Investment Position (IIP). The authorities presented the mission with partial IIP data for mid-2012
and mid-2013.
External debt: Detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are
provided to missions during the Article IV consultation discussions. The debt office at the Ministry
of Finance is collating information about public debt and debt of public sector enterprises. The
authorities are publishing data on public external debt on the QCB website.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Qatar is a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant since December 2005. The
GDDS mission of April 2007 updated the GDDS Summary Table II Data Coverage, Periodicity, and
Timeliness; assessed dissemination practices relative to the requirements of the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness; and identified major
milestones that Qatar would have to reach to graduate from the GDDS to the SDDS. To enhance
data dissemination practices, staff assisted the authorities in developing a National Summary
Data Page (NSDP) and an Advance Release Calendar (ARC).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Qatar
April 18, 2014
1. This note provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. It does not alter the staff appraisal.
2. Recent data releases point to strong macroeconomic performance despite a growth
slowdown in the last quarter of 2013. The economy grew by 6.5 percent in 2013,
almost ½ percentage point more than estimated by staff. The better-than-expected outturn
largely resulted from upward revisions to the historic data on non-hydrocarbon growth.
While GDP growth decelerated to 5.6 percent year-on-year in Q4/2013, the underlying
momentum in the non-hydrocarbon sector appears intact, and staff thus maintains its
2014 growth projection at about 6 percent. In a separate data release, Qatar recorded a
current account surplus of 31 percent of GDP last year, slightly higher than expected by
staff. Consumer price inflation remained subdued at 2.6 percent year-on-year in March.
3. The authorities unveiled the budget blueprint for FY2014/15. Nominal expenditures
are projected to grow by a modest 3¾ percent from the last year’s budget plan, with
priority given to major infrastructure projects (up by 17 percent), health and education.
Current spending and minor capital expenditures are expected to be curtailed. Revenue
projections continue to assume the $65 a barrel oil price, leading to substantial
underestimation of the projected budget surplus. A more detailed assessment of the
budget blueprint is not possible at this time given the lack of comprehensive information;
in particular, the budget results for the fiscal year that has just ended are not yet available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Qatar
On April 18, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Qatar.1
As the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Qatar has turned into an
important global financial investor, labor importer, and donor. Growth averaged 14 percent over
the past decade with per capita GDP reaching $100,000, the highest in the world. Having
successfully completed a strategy to develop natural gas resources, the authorities have
embarked on a large public investment program to advance economic diversification and prepare
for the FIFA 2022 World Cup.
Qatar’s macroeconomic performance has remained strong. GDP growth slowed from 13 percent
in 2011 to 6.2 percent in 2012, mostly due to the self-imposed moratorium on additional
hydrocarbon production from the North Field. Growth was 6.5 percent in 2013, driven by strong
expansion in the nonhydrocarbon sector. The negative spillovers from sluggish global growth
and financial market volatility have been limited. Price pressures are subdued at present, with
March 2014 inflation at 2.6 percent year-on-year. Fiscal and external sector continue to exhibit
large surpluses thanks to high hydrocarbon prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

The baseline macroeconomic outlook is positive. GDP growth could stay around 6 percent in
2014, with public investments keeping growth around 6–7 percent over the medium term.
Inflation is projected to stay benign at 3 to 4 percent going forward, partly owing to the
anticipated decline in commodity prices, including for food, and the fixed exchange rate.
Potential challenges include the risk of over-heating in the near term and over-capacity in the
medium term as a result of the public investment program. The possibility of a sharp decline in
oil and gas prices remains the main medium-term risk; however, the authorities have ample fiscal
and external buffers to deal with contingencies.
The macroeconomic policy framework is being strengthened by a number of ambitious reforms
in the area of fiscal policy and institutions, financial regulation, macroprudential policies,
liquidity management, and development of the local debt market. In particular, the authorities
have been saving the large fiscal surpluses, and have started introducing a medium-term focus
into the budget process. The financial regulatory agenda has centered on establishing an umbrella
regulatory body and issuing a final Basel III circular. The authorities are also supporting
economic diversification through measures to further financial deepening and private sector
development.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Qatar’s continued strong macroeconomic performance,
underpinned by solid non-hydrocarbon growth and stable prices. The large fiscal and external
surpluses have rendered the economy resilient against potential external shocks and the outlook
is favorable. Directors agreed that continued prudent macroeconomic management and efforts to
diversify the economy will help ensure long-term growth and stability.
Directors emphasized the importance of a well-calibrated implementation of the large public
investment program, and encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant about possible
inflationary pressures. If signs of overheating emerge, action should be taken to smooth capital
spending, and deploy liquidity withdrawal operations and further macroprudential measures in
case of excessive credit growth or risk-taking. Directors noted the authorities’ efforts to ease
price pressures by addressing bottlenecks in the supply chain.
Directors advised the authorities to enhance the public investment management framework and
improve the efficiency of public spending. They saw merit in a comprehensive approach,

including rigorous procedures for the selection and appraisal of projects, underpinned by
substantial capacity building and deeper cooperation among various stakeholders. In this regard,
they welcomed the authorities’ plan to set up a Public Investment Management Unit.
Directors commended the authorities for pursuing ambitious fiscal reforms, such as the
commitment to limit spending over-runs, a medium-term focus in the budget process,
performance budgeting, and setting up of the macro-fiscal unit. They encouraged timely
implementation of these reforms, and recommended that, going forward, the annual budgets
should be based on realistic hydrocarbon price assumptions and a more detailed multi-year
expenditure framework.
Directors commended the progress made in enhancing financial sector regulation. They
welcomed issuance of the final Basel III circular and the three-year Strategic Plan for Financial
Regulation. Directors observed that banks remain well capitalized, liquid, and profitable. They
suggested continued close monitoring of lending standards, concentration risks, and cross-border
activities of banks through an enhanced early warning system. Directors also saw further scope
to improve liquidity management.
Directors took note of the authorities’ efforts to enhance diversification by supporting financial
deepening and private sector development. They agreed that priority should be given to further
improving the business environment and the quality of education. Directors looked forward to
continued improvements in the area of macroeconomic statistics.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on Qatar
Executive Board Meeting
April 18, 2014

1.
On behalf of the Qatari authorities, I thank staff for their engagement with Qatar and
the constructive Article IV Consultation discussions.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
Qatar’s macroeconomic performance remained strong in the past year. Growth was
solid, driven by a large expansion in the non-hydrocarbon sector, and the fiscal and external
accounts continued to post large surpluses. Efforts to diversify the economy—guided by the
National Development Strategy 2011-16—resulted in a sharp increase in the nonhydrocarbon sector which is now equal to about half the size of the economy. This sector is
expected to continue to sustain strong growth in the medium-term in spite of the moratorium
on the development of natural gas projects in the North Field.
3.
While Qatar’s prospects are favorable, the authorities are vigilant about potential risks
of over-heating in the near term. The main medium-term risks are over-capacity as a result of
the large public investment program and an expected decline in oil and gas prices. Qatar’s
large fiscal and external buffers provide ample policy space to mitigate these risks, as noted
by staff. To manage risks related to the infrastructure program, the authorities intend to phase
in investment projects. They have also established the Central Planning Office to oversee
infrastructure investments, and are currently setting up the Public Investment Management
unit at the Ministry of Finance.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
4.
The authorities are committed to fiscal efficiency and saving fiscal surpluses to
strengthen buffers against shocks and save for future generations. This is reflected in their
long-term objective to fully finance the budget from non-hydrocarbon revenues.
5.
The overall fiscal surplus is projected to increase to about 11 percent of GDP in
2013/14, mainly due to an increase in public enterprises’ revenue and a slight decline in
expenditures. The authorities intend to eliminate spending overruns and aim to reduce current
expenditures, while prioritizing health, education and capital spending. In this connection,
they started introducing a medium-term focus into the budget process. The 2014/15 draft
budget required ministries and agencies to provide indicative budget estimates for three years
and to share performance information about their programs. The authorities are also setting
up a Government Finance Management Information System, which would significantly
improve the capacity for fiscal management and reporting. In addition, a macro-fiscal unit
was established and will benefit from Fund technical assistance later this month.

2
6.
Qatar’s Public Investment Management Index score is broadly similar to its’ peers, as
detailed in the Selected Issues Paper. The authorities see merit in staff’s recommendation to
adopt an integrated approach to public investment management, and have initiated measures
in this regard. These include setting up a Public Investment Management unit and finalizing
the Public Financial Management Law.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
7.
Price increases accelerated in early 2013 due to increased housing demand but eased
recently as housing supply increased.
8.
The authorities made considerable progress with regards to the financial sector
regulatory agenda. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) Governor has become the head of the
Financial Stability and Risk Committee and serves as a chairman of the three main regulatory
agencies (the QCB, the Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority, and the Qatar Financial
Markets Authority). The QCB has also taken over responsibility for the previously lightlyregulated insurance sector. In December 2013, the three main regulatory agencies published
their Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation—which was aimed to move to risk-based
regulations, expand macro-prudential oversight, and strengthen market infrastructure.
9.
Qatar’s banking sector remains profitable, well capitalized, and resilient to shocks. In
addition, the sector meets the Basel III requirements on capital, liquidity and leverage ratios.
The authorities take note of staff’s view that deposits and credit are concentrated, and asset
quality is exposed to risks from high single party exposures. They are considering a reduction
in the loan-to-deposit ratio which would further improve the strong liquidity profile of the
banking system and its asset quality. QCB appreciates staff’s work on the early warning
system to identify risks and links across all sectors of the economy. It plans to incorporate
some of the Fund’s technical recommendations in its’ next Financial Stability Review.
10.
The authorities recognize that developing deep and liquid domestic debt markets can
bring important benefits by enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism and facilitating
liquidity management. Going forward, they will continue issuing domestic currencydenominated securities, while trimming foreign borrowing. Recent additional measures to
deepen the financial market include the launching of exchange-traded funds by the end of
April, setting-up domestic credit rating agency, and expanding the coverage of the credit
bureau.
Economic Diversification
11.
The authorities attach high priority to economic diversification and private sector
participation in the economy. Qatar National Vision 2030 focuses on enhancing economic
diversification through human development and investment in the non-hydrocarbon sector.
Initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises include loan guarantees and

3
feasibility studies. Additionally, efforts are being made to improve the quality of education
and raise total factor productivity by promoting knowledge-based sectors.
Statistical Issues
12.
The authorities are committed to further improve statistics to assist decision-making
and macroeconomic management. The Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics is
finalizing the Foreign Investment Survey which should substantially improve the balance of
payments and international investment position statistics.
