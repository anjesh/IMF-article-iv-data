IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Azerbaijan
On September 9, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Azerbaijan.
A number of negative shocks have impaired economic performance in Azerbaijan. Lower oil
prices, weak regional growth, currency devaluations in its main trading partners, and a
contraction in hydrocarbon production rapidly erased the large current account surplus that the
country enjoyed during the oil boom years.
Against this backdrop, the authorities have taken a number of actions. With reserves falling and
external shocks intensifying, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) devalued the manat and
shifted to a managed float exchange rate regime. The devaluations helped to improve
competitiveness but worsened bank balance sheets and increased dollarization. The authorities
have started to close problematic banks, restructure the largest state bank, launched a reform of
the financial supervision architecture and added new macro prudential limits on dollar lending.
At the same time, a counter-cyclical stimulus tailored to promote growth and protect vulnerable
populations is being implemented. Public sector wages, overall pensions, and social protection
expenditures have been increased while in train capital expenditure projects will be completed.
Fiscal consolidation is set to resume in 2017. To limit inflationary pressures, the CBA has
tightened the monetary stance in 2016, raising the refinancing rate by 1,200 basis points to 15.0
percent.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Near-term economic prospects remain weak. Under current policies, growth is expected to
contract this year and remain sluggish in the next few years, while inflation is expected to
gradually decrease. Large fiscal surpluses during the oil boom years are projected to turn into
deficits in the next three years. The current account balance should improve as the devaluations
work to limit imports and support non-traditional exports. The authorities plan to utilize a small
amount of assets from the Oil Fund to help finance balance of payments gaps. To ensure
sustainable growth, the authorities are developing a strategy to rapidly diversify the economy by
creating a more business friendly environment and pursuing structural reforms. Risks to the
outlook are tilted to the downside as economic growth is still highly linked to oil shocks and
government spending. The ongoing restructuring of the financial sector is a major risk to
growth.”
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the steps the authorities have taken to adjust to the decline in oil
prices and weaker growth in trading partners. However, they noted that the difficult external
environment could hamper macroeconomic outcomes in the near term. While Azerbaijan’s
policy buffers remain substantial, the balance of payments, fiscal position, and banking system
would likely remain under pressure as the economy continues to adjust. Accordingly, Directors
stressed the need to press ahead with reforms to secure macroeconomic and financial stability
and promote a diversified and private sector-led economy.
Directors supported the authorities’ adjustment efforts. While welcoming the implementation of
a small counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus in 2016 to shore up economic activity and protect
vulnerable segments of the population, they underscored the need to return to a consolidation
path. They recommended placing the weight of the adjustment on spending cuts, while
protecting priority social spending and enhancing the efficiency of capital expenditure. They
took note of the new tax policy aimed at fostering non-oil activity and revenue, but stressed the
need to reduce tax exemptions and strengthen tax administration. Directors considered that a
rule-based fiscal framework supported by institutional arrangements and careful debt
management would help preserve fiscal sustainability. They also encouraged the authorities to
implement their pension reform plans.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ move to a managed float exchange rate regime and recent
interest rate increases aimed at containing inflation. They noted the importance of improving
policy communication to help anchor expectations and reduce uncertainty. They urged the
central bank to stand ready to adjust monetary conditions to reflect changes in the fiscal impulse
and the bank restructuring process. Directors also noted that greater exchange rate flexibility
would help preserve international reserve buffers, pave the way for modernizing the monetary

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

and exchange rate frameworks, and allow adoption of the policy rate as a nominal anchor.
Improving monetary transmission and the functioning of the foreign exchange market will also
be crucial.
Directors highlighted the need to closely monitor the banking system. They were encouraged by
ongoing efforts to close non-viable banks, and recommended further prompt actions to bolster
financial sector resilience. They urged the authorities to move ahead with the restructuring of the
largest state bank with a view to its privatization, and address the problems in the rest of the
banking system. They emphasized the importance of completing the implementation of the
FSAP recommendations including strengthening banking supervision and the macro-prudential
framework.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to diversify the economy away from oil toward
non-traditional sectors. They emphasized that creating a private sector-led, non-oil economy
requires reforms to reduce the costs of doing business and remove barriers to competition. They
also highlighted the need to improve governance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 25, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Azerbaijan built large buffers and invested heavily during the oil boom years,
but efforts to diversify the economy have lagged. The authorities have taken steps to
adjust to slumping oil prices and weaker growth in trading partner countries. In 2015,
the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) undertook two devaluations and switched to a
managed float. Inflation rose while the large current account surplus evaporated and
the budget moved to a deficit. Financial sector soundness deteriorated. Monetary
policy has been tightened to address inflation and support the currency. The non-oil
primary balanced improved in 2015, but is being reversed in 2016 with a revised budget
that boosts capital and current spending. The largest bank is being restructured via a
bad bank-special purpose vehicle (SPV) model, some smaller banks have been closed or
intervened, and a new integrated financial supervisory agency has been created.
Focus of consultation and recommendations: The challenge is to align macro policies
with the new external environment, while modernizing monetary and fiscal frameworks
and accelerating structural reforms to foster diversification through private sector-led
growth. This would require the adoption of an interest rate based monetary policy
operational target and a rule-based fiscal framework. A small fiscal stimulus is helping
to support growth in 2016, but consolidation needs to resume next year to safeguard
medium-term fiscal sustainability. Exchange rate (ER) flexibility should be increased
under the managed float to preserve buffers and absorb shocks. Non-viable banks
should be closed and the banking system restructured, with financial sector supervision
enhanced along the lines of Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and technical
assistance (TA) recommendations. To expand the economy’s potential, the structural
reform agenda needs to be implemented, with governance strengthened, the cost of
doing business reduced, and competition and trade barriers removed.
Progress from previous consultation: During the 2014 Article IV consultation,
directors stressed the importance of tightening the macro-policy stance, strengthening
the financial sector and accelerating structural reforms. Since then, the authorities have
made some progress in fiscal consolidation in 2014-15, and have recently started to
address financial sector vulnerabilities; they have also allowed greater ER flexibility in
2016. The pace of reforms aimed at strengthening the fiscal framework and improving
governance and the business climate remains slow.

CONTEXT
1.
Oil and gas are central to Azerbaijan's economy. During the oil price boom (2006-14)
hydrocarbon (HC) activity accounted for three-quarters of GDP and government income, and
90 percent of exports. Oil production is expected to decline in 2016-19, with oil prices below
historical averages. A pivot toward gas extraction and the building of a new pipeline network should
raise gas output and exports (from 2018 onward). Oil reserves are estimated to be 7 billion barrels,
while gas reserves are 35 trillion cubic feet. The authorities are negotiating a new production sharing
agreement with the consortium of foreign oil companies (AIOC), who together with the state oil
company (SOCAR) extract hydrocarbons in Azerbaijan.
2.
President Aliyev’s New Azerbaijani Party (YAP) dominated 2015 parliamentary
elections. The main opposition parties opted not to participate. Constitutional amendments have
been proposed to lengthen presidential terms from 5 to 7 years. To improve policy discussion and
coordination, a high-level committee on economic policy planning and reforms was established in
late 2015.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
A series of negative shocks have dented economic performance. Plummeting oil prices,
weak regional growth, currency movements and a contraction in HC production quickly erased a
large current account surplus. To preserve reserves, the central bank (CBA) undertook a 25 percent
devaluation in February 2015 and a second 32 percent devaluation in December 2015, with a shift to
a managed floating ER regime. Growth fell to 1.1 percent in 2015 and contracted by 3.4 percent in
first half of 2016, given cuts in public investment, stagnant credit activity and flat oil production.
Inflation averaged 4.1 percent in 2015 and rose to about 11 percent by mid-2016, reflecting
exchange rate pass-through effects (ERPT) (Annex I).
4.
Buffers remain substantial given Oil Fund (SOFAZ) assets. Foreign exchange (FX) sales
have lowered CBA reserves from $13.8 billion at end-2014 to $4.3 billion by end-June (3.5 months of
projected 2016 imports of goods and services). Based on the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy
metric, Azerbaijan should hold about 8.4 months of current imports. SOFAZ assets, which can be
used to support the ER, amounted to some $34 billion (close to 100 percent of 2016 projected GDP;
about 28 months of current imports). Based on the Fund’s EBA-lite methodology, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) remained modestly overvalued as of end-2015 (Annex II).
5.
A counter-cyclical stimulus tailored to promote growth and protect vulnerable
populations is being implemented. Public sector wages, overall pensions, and social protection
expenditures have been increased by 10 percent (3 percent of non-oil GDP) in 2016. With the
issuance of an external Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) bond in March for $1 billion, space was freed
up in the state budget for an additional 3½ percent of non-oil GDP in capital spending to complete

ongoing projects. To ease social tensions, state-owned enterprises and local authorities have hired
35,000 minimum wage workers on temporary contracts.1 Moreover, new non-oil tax measures are
expected to reduce revenues by ¼ percent of GDP (Box 1). Overall, current and capital expenditures
rise by about 2 percent of GDP, while the consolidated government non-oil primary deficit as a
percent of non-oil GDP rises by about 3 percentage points (pps), to 38 percent.2
Box 1. Azerbaijan: Non-Oil Tax Revenue
The authorities aim to raise non-oil tax
revenues without adding new taxes or
raising rates. The plan is focused on
fostering non-oil activity (broadening the
base), simplifying the tax system and
encouraging compliance via accessible eservices. However, it is not clear the extent
to which these measures will improve the
tax intake in the long-run or Azerbaijan’s
low tax yield efficiency.

Corporate
The current tax structure relies on valueincome tax, 2211

personal (PIT) income taxes. The PIT rate
is 14 percent for income up to AzN 2,500
Value-added tax,
per month and 25 percent thereafter. The
3455
CIT rate is 20 percent, but certain firms can
opt to pay a simplified tax (ST) rate (4
percent in Baku, 2 percent elsewhere). ST
payers do not pay property tax or VAT. The
VAT rate is 18 percent, but firms participating in production sharing agreements and joint ventures in the
hydrocarbon sector are exempt.

New tax policy changes focus on adjusting
registration limits. For 2016 the qualifying
income threshold have been raised (from
AzN 200 to 2,500) while the standard
deduction was held constant at AzN 136. The
VAT registration and ST eligibility has been
increased (from AzN 120,000 to 200,000).
Traders or catering firms with turnover
exceeding AzN 200,000 can now opt out of
VAT and pay at the ST rate (albeit at 6 and
8 percent, respectively). Construction firms
can now choose to pay a VAT or an average
of AzN 45 per square meter.

Box 1. Azerbaijan: Non-Oil Tax Revenue (concluded)
Exemptions have been recently introduced to boost private investment. From March 2016, new
investment projects within certain regions and sectors, and a minimum investment amount can qualify for an
“investment certificate.” Required investment amounts range from AzN 200,000 (rural regions) to 10 million
(more urbanized). Among the priorities are industrial parks, manufacturing plants, and research activities.
Valid for seven years, the certificate provides for a 50 percent reduction of income taxes, VAT-free import of
technological equipment, and no property or land tax. A number of SMEs have applied, signaling a positive
effect on investment.
Taxpayer services have been modernized. All formal labor contracts are registered in a database that is
shared between the Ministry of Taxes and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. Business and
individuals can now pay taxes and custom duties via e-services reducing compliance time. These efforts,
together with a reduction in the number of required taxes, have resulted in a marked improvement (from
103rd in 2011 to 34th in 2016) in Azerbaijan’s Ease of Paying Taxes indicator (from the World Bank’s Doing
Business survey).

6.
Fiscal space has declined. More than 70 percent of Azerbaijan's public debt is denominated
in foreign currencies. Given the devaluations and borrowing plans, the debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) indicates that the debt to GDP ratio will move from 11 percent in 2014 to about 38 percent in
2016 (Annex III).
7.
The CBA tightened the monetary policy stance in 2016 to limit inflationary pressures.
In three separate moves (in February, March and August), the CBA increased its refinancing rate by
650 basis points (bps) (to 9.5 percent) and adjusted the interest rate corridor.3 Since mid-2016, the
CBA has held manat deposit auctions to withdraw liquidity. With the move to a managed float and
periodic FX auctions, exchange rate volatility has increased.4 Credit growth has turned negative in
2016 given weak economic activity, mismatches in banks’ currency positions and expectations of
additional devaluations.
8.
The authorities have taken steps to repair the banking system (Annex IV). The
devaluations led to an increase in dollarization, weakened bank balance sheets and deteriorated
financial soundness indicators—raising significant financial stability concerns. In mid-2015, the
government created a bad bank-SPV to manage and collect nonperforming loans (NPLs) from the
largest state bank (IBA), while the CBA closed or merged a number of smaller banks. In March 2016,
banking and insurance supervision was transferred from the CBA and Ministry of Finance (MOF),
respectively, to a new supervisory and regulatory authority, the Financial Market Services Agency
(FMSA). To support confidence, household bank deposits were afforded a blanket guarantee

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Near-term economic prospects are poor—with a recession projected in 2016. Under
current policies, real GDP is expected to contract by -2.4 percent in 2016, and hover around
1-2 percent in the next few years, while inflation is expected to gradually fall under 8 percent. Large
fiscal surpluses during the oil boom years are projected to turn into deficits in 2015-18. The current
account balance should improve as the devaluations work to limit imports and support
non-traditional exports. The authorities plan to utilize about $500 million in SOFAZ assets in 2016 to
help finance balance of payments gaps.
10.

Macro-financial risks to the outlook are substantial (Appendix I).



Given the economy’s HC export structure and public investment framework, oil price
shocks have a strong impact on the real economy, with spillover effects on the ER, bank
profitability, and credit delivery systems (Box 2). Macro-financial linkages have increased
significantly over time, through rapid growth in bank credit during the oil boom years—notably
to the household and construction sectors. (Box 3). Dollarization—which increases
vulnerabilities to liquidity and solvency shocks—has expanded. Weak bank capital and liquidity
positions are also weighing on credit activity.



While the authorities are making progress in cleaning up the banking system at a difficult
juncture, the bank restructuring strategy entails important risks—notably the decision to
inject substantial new resources into IBA—a large systemic public bank with a weak track record
and a continued lending focus on oil-related industrial projects.



Staff projections seek to incorporate these financial sector risks. So far, bank closures have
been handled effectively and have occurred without provoking destabilizing deposit runs.

5

In mid-2016, household deposits amounted to some 14 percent of projected 2016 GDP.

The Board will include representatives of deposit insurance fund (ADIF), CBA, MOF, FMSA, and SOFAZ, and will be
chaired by the Prime Minister.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

Deposit growth, which declined during the devaluations, has rebounded (due in part to the
blanket guarantee), helping to support bank funding. Downgrades by international rating
agencies have had little impact given limited dependence on external credit lines. Negative
financial accelerator effects and increases in dollarization rates experienced in 2015-16, are
assumed to reverse gradually as oil prices are expected to improve over the forecast period and
as banking sector reform progresses. Staff’s growth and private credit forecasts for 2016-2020
average 1.3 and 6.0 percent, respectively, well below historical averages and imply a relatively
slow recovery.
11.
Overall, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Additional oil price declines
associated with a deteriorating global outlook would worsen external balances, increase ER
pressures, expose fiscal vulnerabilities and further dent consumer and business confidence.
Budgetary transfers from SOFAZ would diminish resulting in further spending cuts or larger fiscal
deficits, which may require drawdowns from SOFAZ’s stock of assets. Direct exposure to
international financial markets is concentrated mostly on Oil Fund assets held abroad. As
demonstrated above, complications in the bank restructuring process could also impact growth.
Better than expected oil price developments constitute the main upside risk. The authorities broadly
agreed with staff’s macroeconomic projections and hold similar views on the risk outlook.

Box 3. Azerbaijan: Macro-Financial Linkages7
Oil and ER shocks have led to a rise in dollarization levels. Dollarization in Azerbaijan had fallen from
2002 to 2014, with a minor setback at the start of the financial crisis in 2008. It appears to move in line with
oil prices, a key propagator of the business cycle (BC) in Azerbaijan.
Starting from a very low base, bank credit has expanded rapidly over the last decade. Two separate
growth phases—first from 2005-10, and a second dramatic acceleration in credit activity in 2011-15—appear
to have occurred. The main growth sectors were in trade, construction, households and industry—with trade
credit expanding at a slower rate in the second period and construction, industry and household credit
surging.

Sectoral credit gaps and BCs do not fully co-move
together. The “credit gap”, defined as the difference

trend, reflects a financial cycle (FC). The last 3 BCs
(trough-to-trough) were in 2001-05, 2005-09 and
2009-2016. In comparison, sectoral credit gaps appear
to be more diverse with little movement during the
first BC. Corporate and trade FCs appear to co-move
and lag a bit the second BC. In the last BC, household,
trade and construction FC respond sharply during the
boom.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Implementing a Sustainable Fiscal Consolidation
12.
Staff argued that the composition of the stimulus was less than ideal but agreed an
accommodative fiscal stance in 2016 was appropriate. The authorities acknowledged that fiscal
space had shrunk and the stimulus could put added pressure on the ER. However, buffers were
available to soften the impact of the recession on vulnerable populations and the stimulus only
partially offset the effect of the devaluations. Moreover, the 2016 budget was based on a
conservative $25 a barrel oil price.
13.
Staff recommended targeting an additional 12 pps of adjustment in the non-oil
primary deficit over 2017-20. This would be in line with the permanent income hypothesis (PIH)
fiscal rule for Azerbaijan and bring the non-oil deficit in line with the estimated sustainable level
(Box 4).9
Box 4. Azerbaijan: Recommended Fiscal Rule Targets
Azerbaijan currently uses an ad-hoc fiscal
policy framework. The framework contains
three main elements: (i) an ad-hoc rule to save
½ of oil revenue abroad in a well-managed oil
fund (SOFAZ); (ii) using ¾ of transferred oil-fund
revenue to finance investment; and (iii) broad
coverage of fiscal accounts, underpinned by
rolling non-binding three-year budget plans.
The system is pro-cyclical (tightly linked to oil
prices), lacks focus on long-term non-oil
sustainability and is biased toward excessive
public investment.

A modified permanent income (PIH) model, which relies on a non-resource primary balance (NRPB) target
(as a percentage of non-resource GDP), can be used to guide optimal consumption-savings decisions.10
Under the model, the initial years of scaled-up investment have to be fully reversed by fiscal adjustments.
Between 2008 and 2016, Azerbaijan public investment has averaged about 15 percent of GDP. Based on
expected oil prices, fiscal revenues, and the depletion of natural resource wealth by 2035, the modified PIH
model computes a NRPB target of 26 percent in the long term. The projected 2016 NRPB was 38 percent.

9

The non-oil primary balance as a percent of GDP is projected to be about –38 percent of non-oil GDP in 2016, while
the target based on the PIH fiscal rule (Box 4) is estimated to be -26 percent.

Box 4. Azerbaijan: Recommended Fiscal Rule Targets (concluded)
To supplement the analysis, a “golden
rule” investment rate has also been
estimated. The model of Cherif and
Hasanov (2013) provides an estimated
optimal investment rate under different
assumptions for productivity, planning
horizons and initial buffers.1 With an
assumed 10 percent return on public
investment, 45-year horizon, and initial
wealth-to-revenue ratio of 2, the optimal
investment rate is within the range of 1518 percent of total government revenues.
Recent estimates indicate that public
investment as a percent of total
government revenue could go from 52
percent in 2016 to 23 percent by 2020.



The authorities stressed that fiscal policy would return to a consolidation path and
outlined a number of measures. In particular, they agreed that some parts of past capital
expenditures have been inefficient, and that capital spending levels are high and needed to
decrease. They also indicated that there was room to lower expenditures on goods and services.
Going forward, the 2016 pension, wage and social spending increases would not be repeated,
capital spending reductions would resume, and new pension legislation will lower pension
deficits. Notably, the devaluation effects which automatically raised certain expenditures would
be absent. Moreover, efforts are underway to raise non-oil revenues—not by increasing tax
rates—but by expanding the non-oil tax base over time with investment incentives. In addition,
overall fiscal balances would also improve based on WEO oil price projections and as gas
production commences.



Staff and the authorities reached agreement on the fiscal adjustment path and the
projections which incorporate policy measures. While large and subject to implementation
risks, the adjustment was broadly seen to be feasible given proposed policy measures which
tilted toward spending cuts and new pension reforms. Staff stated that the authorities’ non-oil
tax measures reduce revenues in 2016—and it is premature to gauge their long run effect.
Importantly, the temporary increase in public employments should not be made permanent, and
if these recruits cannot find positions, they should be directed to targeted social assistance
programs. Cash transfer programs to fight poverty could be made more effective by making
them conditional (e.g., education/training).

14.
The government’s plan to implement pension system reform is welcomed. The plan—
expected to be enacted by end-2016—will increase the focus on social-insurance principles, linking
benefits almost entirely to individual retirement accounts. Retirement ages and contribution periods
will increase. The base pension—a flat benefit that accounts for more than half of pension
spending—will be eliminated and replaced by an increase of the current defined-contribution
benefit. A minimum pension will soften the impact on the low wage workers. Annual pension fund
deficits (some 3 percent of GDP) should gradually be eliminated. Staff recommended the full
implementation of the plan without delay.
15.
There was consensus that a rule-based fiscal framework and strong institutional
arrangements would preserve fiscal sustainability over the medium term. The authorities are
aware of the underlying fiscal risks: (i) oil revenue volatility; (ii) an unsustainable level of public
investment; (iii) uncertain recovery of IBA bad assets; (iv) Social Protection Fund (SPF) deficits; and
(v) a growing debt stock. Staff stressed that a rule-based fiscal framework supplemented by a strong
public financial management system, detailed multi-annual budgets, and a public debt strategy
would entrench fiscal discipline and mitigate the volatility of oil revenue while promoting
intergenerational equity. In this context, the authorities plan to request FAD TA on fiscal rules.

B. Modernizing Monetary and ER Policy Frameworks2
16.
The CBA is informally targeting base money growth in 2016, with a desired move to IT
in the long-run. A tighter monetary stance has helped to limit inflationary ERPT effects and
pressure on the currency. However, the CBA is concerned that: (i) requests for financial stability loans
linked to the bank restructuring process could disrupt monetary programming; (ii) liquidity
injections could affect the ER; (iii) credit growth may not easily resume; and (iv) latent deflationary
signals linked to slower growth were hidden by ERPT effects.
17.
Staff indicated that the banking system still holds excess liquidity (concentrated in a
few banks) and doubts about banking system soundness were stifling normal interbank
intermediation. The problems in the interbank market highlight the need to restructure quickly the
banking system and to develop financial markets. CBA interest rates remain negative in real terms
and are below interbank, T-bill and retail deposit rates. This suggests that CBA interest rates may
need to rise further (and informal interest rate caps eliminated) given market expectations.
Consistent with its monetary policy stance, the CBA should stand ready to adjust monetary
conditions to reflect unexpected changes in the fiscal impulse or bank restructuring process that put
the money base and inflation objectives at risk.

intermediate step. However, to meet its monetary targets, the CBA will need to improve liquidity
forecasting and management, and enhance its instrument and analytical toolkit. Importantly, a true
policy rate should be established, around which the CBA would carry out its main liquidity
management operations.3
19.
The authorities are comfortable with the degree of exchange rate volatility
experienced under the new FX regime. ER markets are thin and dominated by SOFAZ oil flows.
While the AzN/US$ rate had been able to move within a wide range, too much variability could still
negatively impact fragile bank and private sector balance sheets. At the same time, the CBA has
been able to make some ad hoc purchase of reserves—without a clear reserve management
strategy. Staff noted that greater ER flexibility would help to preserve buffers, while more clarity on
CBA ER policy objectives and intervention strategy would improve the functioning of the FX market
and guard against policy errors. Once the ER became fully market determined, the CBA should
adopt the policy rate as a nominal anchor.

C. Reducing Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
20.
Financial sector discussions focused on the best way to restructure the banking
system.


The authorities stressed that IBA’s management has been replaced, staffing and operating
costs cut, new lending standards implemented, and the balance sheet gradually cleaned.
Privatization, however, would take time and would require returning the bank to full health
through renewed lending. Staff noted that the SPV exchange of bad assets was at full face value,
and a substantial amount of new financial assistance has been provided to IBA in the form of
fresh SOFAZ dollar deposits, IBA deposits placed at the CBA at preferential rates, and new capital
injections. Downsizing and privatizing IBA would reduce bank concentration, increase
competition and improve efficiency in the system. Losses should be recognized quickly and

existing owners made to bear their fair share of the burden. Any residual shortfalls should be
addressed by a transparent budget transfer-with no impact on the CBA balance sheet.


The FMSA indicated it was ready to remove regulatory forebearance and address
problems in the rest of the system. FMSA staffing and training had geared up, while basic
on-site inspections and asset quality reviews have been completed. Banks have been classified
into three categories (solvent, need capital/liquidity assistance or insolvent) and notifications for
additional capital injections have been made. Staff argued that the process should proceed
quickly and follow guiding principles, which would consist of (i) making sure bank resolution
follows least-cost considerations—i.e., wiping out existing shareholders and bailing in related
party deposits, before government support is contemplated; (ii) providing liquidity assistance
only to economically viable banks on the basis of high quality collateral; and (iii) standing ready
to pay out guaranteed deposits in closed banks.

D. Implementing Reforms to Raise Potential Growth
22.
The government highlighted progress in implementing their “2020 development
strategy”. This included opening new e-government service centers; improving public construction
tenders; simplifying customs clearance; increasing electronic payments; creating regional industrial
zones; moving toward WTO accession and trade diversification; and extending agriculture and
environmental reforms. Efforts have been made to diversify the economy away from oil toward
non-traditional sectors such as agriculture and tourism, create a more business-friendly
environment, and integrate Azerbaijan to the economies of the region through the establishment of
agro and industrial parks. Further progress in these areas would promote sustainable and inclusive
growth (Annex V).
23.
Staff noted that the reversal of positive tail winds—buoyant oil prices and
investment—will slow the economy’s growth potential unless reforms are implemented
(Annex VI). Creating a private sector-led non-oil economy requires reforms to improve governance,
reduce the costs of doing business, and remove barriers to competition. Azerbaijan’s low rank on

World Bank governance-related indicators (lower half globally) suggests that further efforts are
needed to improve government effectiveness, broaden anti-corruption efforts, and strengthen the
rule of law as well as the independence of the judiciary. Efforts to diversify economy toward low
productivity sectors (e.g. agriculture) are unlikely to boost growth unless productivity challenges are
addressed (e.g., through better technology).

STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The lower oil price environment provides an impetus for moving to a new economic
growth model, based on a diversified non-oil private sector. This requires implementing
structural reforms—the most pressing being a rapid and efficient cleanup of the banking system.
Financial sector vulnerabilities currently constitute a major risk to the growth outlook. Once banking
system health is restored, other reforms can take root, strengthening confidence. Improved
communication among economic policymakers and the public would help to reduce uncertainty.
Importantly, pressures to fall back to the old economic model of fixed exchange rates and
unsustainable public investment linked to oil transfers should be resisted.
25.
The 2016 counter-cyclical stimulus is appropriate, but there is a need to return to fiscal
consolidation next year. Fiscal space is contracting and public investment spending remains high.
Reducing the non-oil primary deficit over the medium-term in line with the PIH fiscal rule is key. The
weight of the adjustment should tilt toward spending cuts, with some increase in non-oil tax
revenues. The authorities should stand ready to lower current spending if the cuts in capital
spending do not materialize. New public employments should not be made permanent. Cash
transfer programs could also be made more effective by linking them to behavioral conditionality
(e.g., training and education).
26.
A rule-based fiscal framework would help to preserve fiscal sustainability. The
framework should contain a strong PFM system, detailed multi-annual budgets, and a public debt
strategy to entrench fiscal discipline and mitigate the volatility of oil revenue. Accelerated
implementation of PEFA recommendations would also prove beneficial. In this context, the new
pension reform reduces risks and improves overall fiscal sustainability.
27.
The CBA would benefit from formally introducing monetary targeting and
communicating the primacy of its inflation objective. The monetary stance was appropriately
tightened in early 2016 to limit inflationary pressures and support the ER. However, markets now
seek guidance on the future direction of policy. Policy uncertainty, coupled with slower economic
activity, dollarization, and internal bank weaknesses, has negatively impacted credit activity. This has
resulted in concentration of excess liquidity within a few banks. Given these difficulties, the CBA will
need to modernize its policy substantially to be able to influence money supply and inflation via
interest rates.
28.
Monetary policy should be recalibrated as the CBA gradually moves to an interest
rate-based operational framework. Consistent with its monetary policy stance, the CBA should
stand ready to adjust monetary conditions to reflect changes in the fiscal impulse or bank

restructuring process, which could put the money base and inflation objectives at risk. Greater ER
flexibility will help to preserve buffers and pave the way for modernizing monetary and ER policy
frameworks. Once the ER becomes market determined, the CBA should adopt the policy rate as a
nominal anchor.
29.
Following international best practices would help to ensure the success of the
government’s bank restructuring plans. Consideration should be given to downsizing and
privatizing IBA. The amount of government support remains substantial—as evidenced by the
ongoing bank bailout. While some actions have been taken to reform the bank, it is unclear when it
will be able to return to profitability. Inflating IBA’s loan portfolio—creating an overly large public
bank which dominates the corporate loan market, and which faces the same long-standing political
economy incentives—should be avoided. A detailed plan and preparations are needed to address
the problems in the rest of the banking system. In particular, a sound communication strategy would
help to mitigate the risk that a confidence shock jeopardizes financial stability. Finally, it is important
to ensure the legal framework does provide the bank resolution authority with proper tools and
power to deal with any problematic bank.
30.
Financial vulnerabilities need to be addressed along the lines of FSAP
recommendations. It is important to bolster on-site banking supervision, the macro-prudential
framework, and bank ownership rules. Financial safety nets, including emergency lending assistance
and deposit insurance, should be strengthened to ensure continued and timely provision of liquidity
to viable banks and expeditious payment of deposits. A resolution authority should be established
with wide powers to take corrective measures quickly without seeking shareholder permission or the
need to resort to the court system.
31.
Implementation of the structural reform agenda has become even more critical given
the end of the oil price boom. To expand the economy’s potential, efforts are needed to improve
governance, reduce corruption and the costs of doing business, and remove barriers to competition.
The priority structural reforms contained in the government’s “2020 development strategy” are
appropriate although the issuance of investment certificates needs to be monitored closely to avoid
abuse.
32.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Azerbaijan: Exchange Rate Pass-Through (ERPT) Effects
At first sight, ERPT effects in Azerbaijan appear to have been relatively muted. The AzN/US$ rate
depreciated by some 50 percent in 2015,
however, the headline inflation rate (y/y) as of Azerbaijan: CPI Inflation

The composition and weights of the CPI
basket play a role in ERPT dynamics. The
import content of the CPI basket is estimated to be 34 percent. Tradable good weights in the CPI basket
are high—with food good weights at 58 percent and the non-food goods weight at 22 percent. These
two factors (high import and tradable good weights) would imply a strong ERPT. However, a large part of
food stuffs is produced locally and priced to market in local currency with limited import content. These
are also subject to high local distribution costs which do not move on ER changes. Moreover, during
2015 world food prices fell by some 3 percent, helping to reduce the pressure on food inflation in
Azerbaijan. While non-tradable services only make up some 20 percent of the basket, a sizeable
percentage (13 percent) is administratively controlled. After the devaluations, the authorities did not
allow administrative prices to increase—keeping service inflation in check.

A vector auto-regression (VAR) model indicates that nominal exchange rate shocks impact
inflation, but dissipate quickly. The VAR model included the log first differences of oil prices, nominal
effective exchange rates (NEER), government

40 percent in 2015, the VAR model implies an 18 percent increase in inflation. These estimates are
broadly in line with inflation outcomes in early 2016, particularly when one considers the factors
mentioned above, the low inflationary environment prior to the devaluations, tighter CBA monetary
policy to reduce second round effects, and weaker price pressures emanating from sluggish domestic
demand in a highly dollarized economy.

real effective exchange rate (REER) in
Azerbaijan tend to move in line with oil
prices.1 With the oil prices falling, the CA
position has worsened—shifting from a
surplus of 14 percent of GDP in 2014, to a
small deficit in 2015. However, the non-oil CA
and the share of non-oil exports to total world
exports have remained relatively flat. As of
April 2016, the REER has depreciated by some
45 percent since January 2015 given the 2
step devaluations against the US$.

International reserves at the CBA have fallen sharply. CBA reserves have declined by $9.5 billion
since end-2014, and stood at $4.3 billion (3.5 months of imports) as of end-June, 2016. The
sovereign wealth fund had $34 billion as of end-2015 (close to 100 percent of projected 2016 GDP),
and plans to fill balance of payments financing gaps may reduce the stock by some $500 million in
2016.
Based on the EBA-lite methodology, the REER is viewed as slightly overvalued. The EBA-lite
analysis reflects values for cyclically-adjusted balances consistent with medium-term sustainability,
and other policy variables (cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances, FX intervention, private credit and
capital controls). Given the need to restrict the substantial use of expansionary fiscal policy and CBA
intervention in the FX market, the desired targets

an estimated RER elasticity of -0.21,
the required change in the RER
would be a depreciation of some

use SOFAZ assets to finance fiscal

imply an external unsustainable

Annex III. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Shock to oil prices and consequently the budget deficit and two sharp devaluations of the manat have
all contributed to an increase in Azerbaijan’s public debt and a recent downgrade of its sovereign
bonds. Between 2014 and early 2016, nominal gross public debt, largely denominated in foreign
currencies or held by non-residents, doubled as a share of GDP. However, the majority of Azerbaijan’s
debt has long maturities, which can mitigate financing pressure. While the government could cover its
budget deficit with transfers from the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) in the medium term, such increase
makes debt to GDP ratio more susceptible to various macro and financial shocks.
Baseline Scenarios
Azerbaijan’s debt sustainability indicators worsened during 2015 and remained at similar
levels throughout 2021. As a share of GDP, nominal gross debt for general government increased
from about 11 percent in 2014 to 28 and 38 percent during the next two years. Downward
projection for this ratio starts in 2018 with the return of fiscal surplus. Net debt to GDP ratio
fluctuates depending on the assumed rate of financial asset acquisition by the government.
Financing needs largely depend on projected hydrocarbon revenue and planned fiscal consolidation.
To achieve debt stabilization, primary balance should anchor around 1.9 percent of GDP by 2021.
Exchange rate depreciation and an increase in primary deficit were main causes for the debt
increase. As more than 80 percent of Azerbaijan’s public debt is denominated in foreign currencies
in 2014, the currency depreciation of 60 percent against the US dollar has significantly worsened its
debt outlook. Still slightly over-valued, the exchange rate could depreciate further in 2016 and 2017,
resulting in even higher debt ratios. In the medium term, primary deficit could improve due to an
increase in gas production, the recovery of oil prices, and accelerating fiscal consolidation.
Unrecognized contingent liabilities by the government remain an important debt issue.
Historical debt figures include risk-weighted guarantees by the central government. Explicitly
guaranteed bonds issued by Aqrarkredit to recapitalize IBA (see Annex IV) are also included in the
baseline for 2016. Additional guarantees to the banking sector and other state-owned enterprises
could further complicate the debt sustainability analysis.
Realism of Projections
The realism of staff’s baseline assumptions has improved over time. The median forecast error
for growth over 2007–15 was around -3 percent. Staff tended to be overly optimistic about growth
during the early years of this period. More recent growth forecasts have been closer to the final
outturns. Inflation forecasts have been subject to larger errors, often on the pessimistic side while
forecasts for primary balance have been overly optimistic. Adjustment in Azerbaijan’s cyclicallyadjusted primary balance (CAPB) appears larger than the cross-country median. The fiscal
consolidation plan is mainly through a reduction in public investment. Boom-bust analysis applies to

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

countries with three consecutive years of positive output gap or high credit growth. In the case of
Azerbaijan, 2016 could be the trough of the business cycle with quick recovery.
Risk Assessment
The heat map indicates high risk to the debt profile. Shocks to real GDP growth and to
contingent liabilities could impact the gross financing needs of the government and subsequently
the debt level. The ratios of external debt and debt denominated in foreign currencies are above the
upper threshold of early warning benchmark.
Market perception is another potential risk to the debt profile. Currently, the baseline scenario
assumes the government’s ability to roll over its short term debt every year while slowly amortizing
its long-term debt. The recent downgrades of not only the sovereign bonds but also the guaranteed
notes by state-owned corporations could challenge this assumption.
Stress Tests
The DSA stress tests indicate potentially high ratios of debt to GDP and to revenue, especially
from shocks to real GDP growth and real exchange rate.
Seven scenarios were considered:


Growth shock. Real GDP growth is subjected to a one standard deviation negative shock.
Inflation is assumed to decline in line with lower growth, dropping ¼ percentage point for every
1 percentage point decrease in growth. Reflecting higher risk premiums, nominal interest rates
rise by 25 basis points for every 1 percent of GDP worsening of the primary balance. Under this
scenario, the debt to GDP ratio increases to over 70 percent of GDP in 2018 and remains high
throughout 2021. Gross financing needs peak in 2018 at 20 percent of GDP.



Interest rate shock. Based on the maximum historical level, a 1200 basis point increase in
spreads is applied throughout the projection period. The debt to GDP ratio, however, is
minimally affected.



Real exchange rate shock. A 25 percent real exchange rate devaluation is applied to 2017
coupled with a 25 basis point increase in interest rates for each 1 percent of GDP reduction in
the primary balance. With high level of external debt, the impact is significant with debt to GDP
ratio peaking at above 56 percent in 2017.



Primary balance shock. A 2 percent of GDP decline in revenues is applied over two years,
coupled with a rise in nominal interest rates over the same period. The ratios of debt to GDP and
to revenue both deteriorate moderately.



Combined macro fiscal shock. This scenario combines the shocks to real growth, the interest
rate, the real exchange rate, and the primary balance while eliminating double counting of the
effects of the individual shocks. The debt ratio is on an unsustainable trajectory path throughout
2021.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



40

Contingent liabilities shock. For a standard non-interest expenditure shock of 10 percent of the
size of the banking sector, with interest rates assumed to increase by 25 basis points for every
1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance, the primary balance will deteriorate in 2016
and 2017. The debt level is expected to peak in 2018 at 70 percent of GDP.

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

Annex IV. Azerbaijan: Bank Restructuring, Financial Sector
Reforms and FSAP Recommendations
The banking system in Azerbaijan is relatively underdeveloped and heavily concentrated. At
end-2015, the system consisted of 43 banks, with the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA), a
majority state-owned bank, holding some 40 percent of system wide assets, mostly in industrial
loans. There are eight majority foreign-owned banks and two majority state-owned banks. IBA
profitability has been a persistent problem given a tendency to provide subsidized loans to
government projects.
The reform process has proceeded along 4 integrated tracks. This includes (i) restructuring IBA;
(ii) creating new supervisory institutions; (iii) cleaning up the rest of the banking system; and (iv)
implementing new insurance fund and macro-prudential policies. An FSAP was completed in July
2015. The status of FSAP recommendations is presented in Table 1.
A. IBA
The authorities are restructuring the IBA mainly through the creation of a bad bank-SPV, new
financial support, and implementation of management reforms.


Bad bank creation: A joint CBA-MoF preliminary audit of IBA’s loan portfolio found
approximately AzN 7 billion in bad assets (70 percent of total assets). In mid-2015, Aqrarkredit (a
small state-owned credit agency) was tasked with receiving and managing part of IBA’s bad
assets, and issuing state guaranteed bonds at a 0.15 percent interest rate, 30-year maturity,
5-year grace period, to the CBA. These funds—routed through the SPV—have been paid to the
IBA in exchange for the bad assets, which have been placed in the SPV for debt collection. The
first tranche of IBA’s bad assets (AzN 2.5 billion) was transferred to the SPV in late 2015, and an
additional AzN 4.6 billion has been moved in 2016.



Burden of losses: The NPLs were bought at the full book value. Existing owners who had
borrowed from the IBA to fund previous IBA bank equity purchases were forced to reverse those
transactions and settle other liabilities. The remaining depositors were all protected. As the
bonds sold to the CBA mature and the distressed assets recovery process unfolds, the
government will inject financial resources into Aqrarkredit to service its debt on a timely manner.



Continued financial support: SOFAZ has committed to deposit $2 billion in IBA. SOFAZ
deposits have been used to repay some of IBA’s most expensive foreign currency liabilities
(about $1 billion), with the remaining foreign debt ($3 billion) on a more sustainable path. The
IBA also expects the government to inject AzN 500 million in new capital. In addition, the CBA
has provided 1 billion manat in subordinated loans to IBA. Finally, in order to provide IBA with
an income stream, 3 billion manat was deposited in the CBA at 5 percent interest rate.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN



Greater government control: At end-2014, the MOF and non-state entities owned 51 and
10 percent of IBA shares respectively, while undisclosed individuals account for 39 percent. The
government’s share increased to 85 percent by end-2015. Once an additional capital injection is
finalized in late-2016, the government will own about 95 percent of IBA’s shares. Nevertheless,
the ultimate goal is to completely privatize the bank within five years.



New management: The government has replaced the IBA’s management and board, and is
starting the process of reforming bank operations, investigating allegations of fraud and
malfeasance and examining changes in governance, funding, and bank loan strategy. The new
management is cutting costs with staff reductions of some 20 percent, foreign branch closures
and paying off expensive foreign debt. Bank operations in 2016 indicate that IBA still remains
heavily focused on larger industrial based activities. Current IBA management indicated that
sustained substantial interest income is needed to ensure IBA profitability.

B. Supervision
A new integrated financial supervision agency, the FMSA, was created in March 2016. Its
mandate covers the licensing, supervision and regulation of securities markets, investment funds,
insurance companies, lotteries, banks and non-bank credit institutions (including the postal
operator) and payment systems, including AML/CFT activities. Its main objectives are to (i) ensure
effective operation and stability of financial markets; and (ii) protect creditors' rights, insured
persons, investors and other consumers of financial markets. The management structure includes a
five-person Board of Directors, and a CEO, all appointed by the president with five-year terms.
Banking and financial supervision responsibilities have been removed from the CBA Law. The CBA,
however, will still be directed to provide direct short-term (under 6 months) loan support to banks
on the advice of the FMSA. Supervised institutions will pay a membership fee to the FMSA to fund
its operations.
In line with FSAP recommendations, the authorities created a Financial Stability Board in
mid-2016. The Board will include representatives of ADIF, CBA, MOF, FMSA, and SOFAZ, and will be
chaired by the Prime Minister. The group has been meeting regularly on an informal basis.
C. The Rest of the Banking System


Closing and merging problem banks. The CBA revoked licenses for 2 insolvent banks in 2015,
and moved quickly to close a further 6 banks in January-February 2016, while merging an
additional 2 banks. The closed banks comprised about 6 percent of the total size of the banking
system. The FMSA put provisional administrators in 4 more banks in July 2016—allowing 1 to
become a non-bank finance company. The number of banks now stands at 31 as of end-July
2016, though three of the closed banks are challenging in court CBA’s decision The new

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

regulator has also intervened in a systemically important bank, imposing a deposit moratorium
which was recently lifted.1 Authorities are still considering a number of resolution alternatives.


Restructuring the banking sector. The FMSA has concluded an asset and credit quality
assessment of the banking sector loan portfolio. The diagnostics included a top-down stress test
exercise as well as on-site inspections. The FMSA report groups the banks in three categories:
(i) systemically important banks; (ii) medium-sized banks, some of which have capital and/or
liquidity deficiencies that will need to be addressed by the banks following supervisory actions;
and (iii) small and non-viable banks, which FMSA intends to close by the end of this year.2 The
chart below presents a quick snapshot of the status of problem loans within the system as of
end 2015.3

deposits (about 15 percent of total deposits), the ADIF removed the AzN 30,000 insured deposit

limit in early February 2016, and provided a blanket guarantee on all individual deposits with an
interest rate cap of 12 percent for manat deposits and 3 percent for U.S. dollar deposits. Total
individual deposits amounted some 14 percent of GDP in mid-2016. The blanket guarantee is to be
in place for 3 years from March 2016, after which it will be reviewed. ADIF has signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that allows it to borrow from CBA and the government, if
the liquid assets of the ADIF fall below 1 percent of insured deposits.4 The ADIF is working on a draft
law that will provide it with powers to inspect banks on deposit-related matters, in coordination with
the new regulator. The draft law also foresees a move to a risk-based fee system.
The FMSA passed a decision on Responsible Lending, effective May 6 2016, which sets out the
conditions for granting foreign and local currency loans. Foreign currency mortgage loans are
now prohibited and foreign currency consumer loans are only allowed to individual or entities who
receive foreign currency revenues and who a have a bank account. Existing foreign currency loans
can only be restructured in line with established prudential lending conditions, and new foreign
currency consumer loans are limited by new debt load limits on borrowers. The FMSA is also
working with banks to create a private credit bureau.
E. Epilogue: FSAP issues
Some of the financial reforms are in line with FSAP recommendations, while others are clearly
not. For example, the FSAP had stressed the importance of moving quickly to close weak banks and
to establish a SPV mechanism to handle IBA’s bad loans. However, issuing a blanket deposit
insurance guarantee, creating a new financial system regulator (FMSA) or undertaking full
debt/equity swaps in the IBA were not part of FSAP recommendations.
Recommendations made in the 2015 FSAP still remains relevant. Key recommendations to
enhance the financial safety net included (i) strengthening supervisor resolution powers to allow
swift intervention, if needed, before a bank becomes insolvent and reducing the dependence on the
court system; (ii) MOUs among agencies potentially involved in resolution, to permit efficient
information sharing; (iii) formalize borrowing agreements between the deposit insurance fund and
the CBA and the MOF, allowing resources from the ADIF to be applied for all resolutions and on a
least-cost basis; (iv) set out ELA preconditions and require banks to be prepared for providing high
quality collateral, if ELA is needed; and (v) develop bank-specific contingent plans for banks
considered systemic.

4

Total covered deposits of banks closed in 2015 and 2016 have amounted to AzN 300 million. This has depleted

existing ADIF reserves. ADIF has already borrowed AzN 22 million from CBA, which will be enough to pay deposits in
the 3 litigating banks. If any additional bank is closed, ADIF will need further financial support.

Annex V. Azerbaijan: Inclusive Growth
A 2012 SIP reported on the inclusiveness of Azerbaijan’s growth.1 It noted that the oil boom
and associated rapid non-oil growth contributed to a substantial reduction in poverty and
inequality. However, economic diversification, youth employment, governance reforms, and greater
SME access to financing were seen as essential to keep growth inclusive.
While inclusive growth indicators show gains in poverty reduction, gaps in gender parity,
health, education, and youth employment remain. The percent of the population in poverty in
Azerbaijan in 2014 was 6 percent relative to the CCA average of 26 percent, and the Human
Development Index was also above average. However, youth employment was only 23 percent
relative to the regional average of 42 percent, and average years of schooling are below regional
norms. Moreover, female representation in parliament and in education enrollment remains low. Cell
phone subscriptions per 100 people are also below average—implying that access as well as
availability may limit integration into the economy.

Azerbaijan’s economic structure hinders the absorption of young job seekers—limiting
inclusive growth. In 2015, under 25 (35) year olds constituted 40 (60) percent of the population,
with 70 percent within the range of 15 to 64 years of age. The low-productivity, low-growth
agricultural sector remains Azerbaijan’s largest employer, absorbing 37 percent of the workforce,
but contributing only about 5 percent of GDP. The capital-intensive mining sector contributes
40 percent of GDP, but employs only about 1 percent of the entire workforce.

However, the economy’s growth potential has receded sharply of late given lower investment rates

growth of some 3½ percent, while a reversal of reforms indicate potential growth would fall to
about 1 percent. This analysis suggests that in an environment of low oil prices and reduced
investment, the driver of growth will need to come from stepped up structural reforms.

Policy responses: With potential downside risks, staff will recommend that the authorities rebuild policy buffers.
This would entail strengthening the non-oil fiscal position beyond the levels envisaged in the 2016 approved
budget and allow further depreciation of the manat in line with ER fundamentals. Sustaining efforts to enhance
banking sector performance and banking supervision combined with actions to restructure and privatize the
public bank under a sustainable financial position will also help contain risks in the financial sector.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) was subject to
an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement that was approved on July 06, 2001, and
expired on July 5, 2004. The assessment was completed on March 11, 2002, and it was concluded
that the external audit and financial reporting were adequate. The assessment proposed a set of
measures to strengthen internal control, data reporting to the Fund, and the legal framework. The
majority of the recommendations were implemented, including the establishment of an Audit
Committee. KPMG conducted an independent auditor’s report of the 2015 CBA financial statements
by April 25, 2016. The audited financial statements along with audit opinion has been published on
the central bank’s website as an integral part of 2015 annual report.
Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994. A
bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar had been in place since January 2011, but effective February 16,
2015, the CBA implemented an exchange rate policy based on the currency basket comprising the
U.S. dollar and the euro. On February 21, 2015, the CBA devalued the currency by 25 percent
relative to the U.S. dollar, and on December 21, 2015, by 32 percent. Since then, as a result of
official action, the manat has been allowed to gradually depreciate based upon supply and demand
factors vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. According to Article IV, Section 2(a) of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement, Executive Director Daniel Heller informed to the Secretary that effective December 21,
2015, the CBA changed the de jure exchange regime from “other managed” to “managed floating”.
The de facto regime is “other managed” based on the CBA’s periodic weekly auctions (on Tuesdays
and Thursdays of each week) with a prescribed +/- 1 percentage point corridor. The amount
supplied at the auctions is determined jointly by the CBA and SOFAZ. A ER corridor of +/- 4 percent
is also in effect for transactions between banks and their clients. The CBA also stands ready to
intervene to smooth out an excess volatility in the market. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange
intervention data quarterly.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective November 30, 2004,
and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security reasons
that have been notified to the Fund.
Article IV Consultation
Azerbaijan is on a 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The 2016 Article IV Board date is set for
September 9, 2016. The previous Article IV consultation finalized on May 27, 2014; it was delayed
mainly as a result of the authorities’ request for additional time to respond to economic
developments.

ROSCs
A fiscal transparency ROSC module was prepared by FAD (SM/00/278, 12/12/01) and updated in
April 2003 (SM/03/159, 04/30/03). A fiscal ROSC update mission took place in April 2005. A data
dissemination ROSC module was completed by STA in March 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/86).
The authorities published the fiscal ROSC, and it is available on the IMF web site. Several financial
systems ROSC were conducted in the context of the FSAP (2003–04) but were not published. A CPI
data ROSC completed in July 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/273).
Resident Representative
In October 2009, Mr. Koba Gvenetadze ended his term as IMF Resident Representative in Azerbaijan.
Since November 2009, the IMF no longer has a Resident Representative in Azerbaijan, but the IMF
Office in Baku, located in the building of the Ministry of Finance of Azerbaijan, continues to operate,
headed by Ms. Aghgun Gadirli (office manager).
Resident Advisers
An adviser on the establishment of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Nurcan Aktürk, was
stationed in Baku from December 1994 to September 1996. He was succeeded by Mr. B.K.
Chaturvedi, whose assignment was extended twice, first through August 2000, and then through
May 2001. Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi was replaced by Mr. A. Khan, whose assignment started in May 2001
and ended in August 2002. A technical long-term adviser for tax administration, Mr. Mark Zariski,
was stationed in Baku from April 1995 to April 1996. He was succeeded by Mr. Peter Barrand, who
was stationed in Baku from January 2001 to December 2002. Mr. Isaac Svartsman was resident
advisor in the CBA for bank supervision and restructuring from September 1998 to April 2001.
Ms. Nataliya Ivanik was stationed in Baku as a STA regional external sector statistics advisor from
November 2006 to November 2008.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 2016)
Azerbaijan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
in September 1992 and the International Development Association (IDA) in March 1995 and a
member of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in October 1995. In FY11 Azerbaijan
graduated from IDA and became IBRD country.
On July 2015, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors endorsed the new Country Partnership
Framework (CPF) for Azerbaijan covering FY2016–2020. It is a joint strategy of the World Bank Group
aiming to support Azerbaijan on its path toward sustainable, inclusive, and private sector–led
growth. The CPF proposed three strategic pillars: (i) Effective Public Service Delivery; (ii) Economic
Competitiveness and Growing the Role of the Private Sector; and (iii) Sustainability and Resilience of
the economy. Under the two focus areas— Public Sector Management and Service Delivery and
Economic Competitiveness— the Bank will help the country strengthen public resource
management, facilitate public service delivery, and improve the quality of environmental assets, as
well as improve selected infrastructure networks, increase the country’s financial inclusion, reduce
the regulatory burden on the private sector, and support economic activities in rural areas.
The CPF envisaged the IBRD indicative financing program for FY2016-2017 in the range of US$300500 million per annum. Lending volume and composition of projects for outer years would depend
on country demand, global economic developments, and portfolio performance as well as IBRD’s
lending capacity and demand from other borrowers. The indicative lending program for FY16
included five projects, of which only two – the Third Highway Additional Financing and the IDPs
Livelihood Additional Financing have been approved the Bank’s Board of Directors in FY16. Due to
the impact of the sharp drop of oil prices and deterioration of the overall economic situation, the
originally planned program for FY16-17 has been revisited following to the client’s request.
As of June 2016, the IBRD investment portfolio comprised of fifteen projects under implementation
with a total commitment of US$2.185 million, of which US$1.28 million or 58 percent of total
commitment has been disbursed. By the end of FY16, five projects will exit the portfolio including
the last three IDA projects, leaving the operations entirely with under IBRD going forward. The
transport sector dominates the Bank financing, amounting to 50 percent of net commitments. Along
with investments in the reconstruction of the road network, the Bank supports a major institutional
reform of the motorway operation and maintenance system. Water and sanitation make up 29
percent and 6 percent covers projects focusing on Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and rural
investments. These projects help to improve both the physical and social infrastructure for IDPs and
promote the development of more economic opportunities to contribute to greater economic selfreliance for IDPs. Other sectors include public administration, agriculture, and financial and private
sector development.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

In addition to IDA/IBRD operations, the portfolio consists of one active trust fund project in the
amount of US$2 million – the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) Trust Fund for
Azerbaijan – in support of the Financial Sector Modernization.
Bank lending is complemented by a strong program of advisory and knowledge services to inform
the country growth strategy and policy choices as well as the design of investment operations. The
Bank continues to support education and health sectors through the series of analytical and TA
activities as well as the preparation of the Employment Strategy through another TA activity.
Extensive technical assistance has been provided to the authorities on capital markets reform,
consumer protection, financial inclusion and expansion of services by Azerpost, financial literacy, and
stability. The focus of the Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) is on assessing the constraints to
access to finance for non-oil enterprises in Azerbaijan in support of private sector and economic
growth.
IFC’s current strategy and operations in Azerbaijan, also guided by the CPF for FY2016-2020, is to
support the economic competitiveness agenda and advance economic diversification, particularly in
non-oil sectors. Reflecting these priorities, IFC’s focus is on strengthening the financial sector,
improving investment climate, and promoting good corporate governance. More efforts will be
dedicated to support development of growth-enhancing infrastructure, including through pilot
Public-Private Partnership projects, and to invest in competitive private companies, particularly in
export-oriented sub-sectors, and the success of these efforts will largely be conditional on the
opening of the infrastructure sector to private sector participation and the progress in business
climate reforms to reduce regulatory burden for private businesses and encourage greater corporate
transparency.
Since the beginning of its operations in Azerbaijan in 1995, IFC has provided long-term financing of
about US$460 million, of which about US$70 million was mobilized from partners, to 55 private
sector projects in financial sector, agribusiness, manufacturing, and infrastructure1. In addition, IFC
has provided trade finance guarantees through local financial intermediaries that facilitated over
US$80 million of trade flows. As of June 2016, IFC’s active committed portfolio in Azerbaijan stood at
about US$70 million.
IFC’s investments have been complemented by a range of advisory projects aiming to facilitate
private sector growth, which are aligned with three broad priorities: (i) Improving the business
climate through facilitation of regulatory reforms in the areas of business inspections, licensing,
transfer pricing and investment climate for the agri-business sector. Additional advisory

programs will be developed to deepen the business climate reforms in the areas of trade
facilitation, investment policy and investment promotion. (ii) Expanding access to finance for
businesses and individuals by improving the financial infrastructure and regulatory environment
related to private credit bureaus and secured transactions, increasing financial literacy, and assisting
1

This amount does not include project finance of $500 million provided for the construction of Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
Pipeline, which in addition to Azerbaijan, also covered Georgia and Turkey.

partner banks to improve risk management, develop sustainable SME banking business, and lend to
underserved segments including farmers and women entrepreneurs. Going forward, IFC will also
support the development of agricultural insurance system. (iii) Enhancing corporate
transparency by helping private companies and financial institutions to improve corporate
governance practices, building capacity of local institutions on corporate governance services,
training and reporting, and working with regulatory institutions to improve relevant laws and
regulations.
In addition to investment and advisory services, IFC has been also working with the State Oil Fund of
the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), which has committed US$350 million to three funds managed
by IFC’s Asset Management Company: the IFC Global Infrastructure Fund, which invests alongside
IFC in infrastructure projects in emerging markets; the IFC Catalyst Fund, which invests in funds and
projects focused on low-carbon power generation, energy and water efficiency and the resource
efficiency sector; and the IFC African, Latin American, and Caribbean Fund, which invests alongside
IFC in equity and equity like projects in these regions. This engagement supports SOFAZ’s efforts to
diversify its portfolio into sustainable projects by providing access to IFC's expertise and track record
in private equity as well as access to new markets.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of June 2016)
As at first quarter of 2016, the EBRD has signed a total of 161 projects with cumulative investment
value of €2,459 million since initiating its operations in Azerbaijan in 1993. 44 percent of the EBRD’s
cumulative investments were made in the energy sector, 11 percent in the financial institutions
sector, 36 percent in the infrastructure sector and 8 percent in the corporate sector.
In 2015, the EBRD invested a total of €268.8 million in 9 projects in Azerbaijan, all in the private
sector, a record number for the EBRD in Azerbaijan.
Amid economic challenges in Azerbaijan, the EBRD remains committed to supporting market-driven
diversification of the economy. The EBRD’s focus will be on small and medium enterprises (SME) and
financial sector development. The EBRD continues to support the real private sector and stands
ready to do more if further reforms are implemented.
Demand for local currency lending has risen sharply since devaluation. In order to support the
existing and future clients with local currency loans, the EBRD is working with the authorities on a
possible manat bond issue.
The main challenges for the EBRD’s current strategy period (2014-17) in Azerbaijan are as follows:




promoting market-driven diversification;
developing a sustainable financial sector to support private sector development; and,
improving corporate governance and transparency to promote competition and address
distortions in the non-oil, non-financial sectors.

The pipeline for 2016 is strong, with the potential ABI of around €1 billion in natural resources
(Southern Gas Corridor project), transport sector, municipal and environmental infrastructure and
mainly restructuring projects in agribusiness, manufacturing and services.
Azerbaijan will become an important source of gas for the European Union in the next few years.
EBRD involvement in strategically important hydrocarbons projects such as Shah Deniz helps to
ensure that Azerbaijani SMEs benefit as suppliers and contractors on large projects and that the
economy as a whole gains from improved governance and transparency which such projects require.
The EBRD has provided two loans to Lukoil, a 10 percent consortium member for Shah Deniz phase I
and a syndicated loan for Shah Deniz Phase II, also to Lukoil (EBRD A Loan US$250 million). The
EBRD was approached to finance the Southern Gas Corridor to deliver the gas via Turkey and Greece
to Italy.

The Institutional Investment Partnership Programme is in late stage negotiations with the State Oil
Fund of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOFAZ) to become a limited partner in the EBRD’s first Equity
Participation Fund.
The pipeline for the rest of 2016 is dominated by two large transactions: the second tranche of the
regional roads program and a further loan for phase one of the Shah Deniz off-shore gas field.
Other core transactions are shared equally between industry, commerce and agribusiness (ICA) and
financial institutions (FI) sectors, reflecting a healthy balance of opportunities in the developing
private sector.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
(As of June 2016)
The ADB has provided extensive assistance to Azerbaijan to strengthen its capacity. The ADB helped
improve poverty analyses, prepare a strategic development plan, develop policy frameworks, streamline
the management of public debt, analyze macroeconomic data, and develop medium-term policies for
the rural economy. The ADB also provided advisory assistance to enhance its lending operations in
selected sectors, such as water supply and sanitation, transport, and energy.
Projects supported by the ADB in Azerbaijan have seen 240,000 people protected from the effects of
flooding, while about 350,000 residents of regional and rural towns have received high-quality and
reliable drinking water for the first time. The ADB has helped construct approximately 200 kilometers of
new and upgraded highways and rural roads, benefiting the country’s entire population, and it has
invested in improved power transmission to deliver energy more reliably and reduce power outages.
Other ADB assistance in Azerbaijan has helped raise the living conditions of hundreds internally
displaced families, rehabilitated several schools, and provided small loans to those displaced, many of
whom are women.
ADB’s assistance to improve Azerbaijan’s transport and energy infrastructure will increase the
economy’s efficiency and competitiveness. It will also boost the country’s connectivity within the Central
Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) region and beyond. The ADB continues to assist with the
development of modern urban infrastructure and services across the country, which will provide a
platform for a more diversified economy and improve living conditions. Technical support to improve
solid waste management and develop renewable energy sources will improve the urban environment
and quality of life in Azerbaijan’s regional cities and rural towns. The ADB is also working to further
enhance the country’s power distribution network and ensure stable power supply to households and
industry.
As of June 16 2016, cumulative public sector loan commitments to Azerbaijan amounted to about
US$2.32 billion, of which about US$1.29 billion has been disbursed. Commitments cover 26 public
sector loan operations in agriculture and natural resources, health, finance, transport, energy, and water
supply and sanitation. These loans were complemented with 32 technical assistance (TA) projects
amounting to about US$22.0 million. Since 2014 Azerbaijan is eligible for the ordinary capital resources
(OCR) only.
Non-sovereign operations
As a catalyst for private investments, the ADB provides direct financial assistance to non-sovereign
public sector and private sector transactions in the form of direct loans, equity investments, guarantees,
B loans, and trade finance. Since its inception, the ADB has approved US$738 million in non-sovereign
financing for 10 private sector transactions in Azerbaijan. In 2015, the ADB approved a direct loan of
US$250 million and US$225 million in B loans to construct offshore gas production platforms as well as
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

subsea wells and pipelines, and to expand an onshore gas-processing terminal. Gas extracted from the
second stage development of the Shah Deniz gas field will be delivered to Europe via the Southern Gas
Corridor.
The ADB’s Trade Finance Program (TFP) fills market gaps by providing guarantees and loans through
partner banks in support of trade. In Azerbaijan, the TFP works with one bank and has supported
US$43.8 million in trade for 54 transactions. In addition to filling market gaps, the TFP’s objective is to
mobilize private sector capital and involvement in developing Asia. In Azerbaijan, 9.1 percent of trade
supported through the TFP was co-financed by the private sector.
Co-financing
Co-financing operations enable ADB’s financing partners, governments or their agencies, multilateral
financing institutions, and commercial organizations, to participate in financing ADB projects. The
additional funds are provided in the form of official loans and grants, technical assistance, other
concessional co-financing, and commercial co-financing such as B loans, risk transfer arrangements,
parallel loans and equity, guarantee co-financing, and co-financing for transactions under ADB’s TFP.
By the end of 2015, cumulative direct value-added (DVA) official co-financing for Azerbaijan amounted
to US$2.5 million for one investment project and US$2.7 million for six technical assistance projects.
Cumulative DVA commercial co-financing for Azerbaijan amounted to US$802.3 million for five
investment projects. A summary of projects with co-financing from January 1, 2011 to December 31,
2015 is available at www.adb.org/countries/azerbaijan/cofinancing.
Partnerships
As well as collaborating closely with the Government of Azerbaijan and its agencies, the ADB plays an
important role in fostering the country’s membership in CAREC. The ADB facilitates partnerships and
encourages dialogue between Azerbaijan and other CAREC countries on issues of transport, energy,
trade negotiation, and policy development.
The ADB also collaborates with other multilateral and bilateral development partners, such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, KfW, the Islamic Development Bank, the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, the Korean International Cooperation Agency, the State Secretariat
for Economic Affairs of Switzerland, the United Nations agencies (including UNIDO, UNICEF and the
FAO), and the World Bank.
The ADB works with civil society organizations in Azerbaijan to strengthen the effectiveness, quality, and
sustainability of its assistance, while also providing guest lecturers and specialist spokespeople to the
country’s leading universities and media outlets.

Procurement


Share of ADB’s Procurement Contracts

Each year, the ADB provides loans, grants, and technical assistance to fund projects and activities in its
developing member countries, and several billion dollars in contracts to procure goods, works, and
consulting services. Most contracts were awarded on the basis of international competition, which is
open to firms and individuals from any ADB member, regional or nonregional.
Procurement contracts for goods, works, and related services under loan and grant operations totaled
$8.4 billion in 2014 and US$11.12 billion in 2015. Cumulative procurement, as of December 31 2015,
was US$145.92 billion.
Procurement contracts for consulting services under loan, grant, and technical assistance operations
totaled US$556.05 million in 2014 and US$637.4 million in 2015. Cumulative procurement, as of
December 31 2015, was US$10.64 billion.


Goods, Works, and Related Services

Future direction
Development priorities for Azerbaijan in the short to medium term will include projects in transport,
energy, water and other urban infrastructure services as well as private sector development. The ADB
will support the construction of transport corridors, providing linkages with neighboring countries and
expanding opportunities for rural communities. ADB’s assistance will help expand the electricity
network, and to improve energy efficiency by enhancing power distribution and integrating renewable
energy sources. The ADB will provide financing over construction of Shah Deniz Stage II gas developing
project to expand production and processing and, diversify regional energy sources. Upgrades to urban
infrastructure and services—including public transport, water supply and sanitation, and solid waste
management in regional towns and peri-urban areas—will be a priority. Assistance to education sector
will help increase level of technical and vocation education, increase supply of skilled labor and provide
support to the transition to 12-year education system. The ADB will also leverage in-country expertise
to produce and distribute knowledge products and services in Azerbaijan. The ADB will promote

regional cooperation, governance and capacity development, environmental sustainability, and the
mitigation of climate change. Private sector opportunities will continue to be explored to further
diversify the economy, and to help private enterprise play a greater role in industry, trade, small and
medium-sized enterprises, and infrastructure.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Although the authorities have made significant progress in improving the quality and
timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses should be addressed, particularly
in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, government finance statistics and external sector
statistics. With the exception of government finance statistics, STA has provided extensive technical
assistance and recommendations in these areas.
Azerbaijan has participated in the GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data ROSC mission reviewed
Azerbaijan’s data dissemination practices against GDDS guidelines and conducted an assessment of the
quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), government finance,
monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The data module of the ROSC is available on the IMF’s
external website. Azerbaijan nominated a national SDDS Coordinator in August 2005. An SDDS
assessment mission in April 2007 provided technical assistance on the outstanding issues required for
SDDS subscription. A data ROSC module to reassess the Consumer Price Index (CPI) completed in
July 2008.

A. Real Sector
National accounts
Under STA’s national accounts project, significant technical assistance has been provided to the State
Statistics Committee (SSC) and progress has been made in a number of areas. Methods for compiling
gross national income have been improved and revised estimates disseminated; quarterly national
account estimates at constant prices for 1998–2004 have been compiled; capital investment data have
been revised; estimates of undeclared wages have been made; and a new methodology for calculating
price indices for the construction and transportation sectors is well underway.
The most recent national accounts mission took place in Baku in May 2014 at the request of the State
Statistical Committee (SSC). The mission identified the following problems: (i) the staff of the National
Accounts and Macroeconomic Statistics Department (NAMSD) is not familiar with the Quarterly
National Accounts (QNA) techniques. These techniques are totally different from the procedures used in
the existing monthly system. Unfortunately, there are insufficient staff resources dedicated to national
accounts (handled by the Deputy Head of the division and one other staff member, both of whom are
also engaged in other activities); (ii) there are significant problems with the estimates of agriculture,
manufacturing and energy. In particular, the volumes of agriculture have increased significantly faster
than the existing annual estimates. The SSC has been investigating these industries’ issues, but has not
yet fully resolved the problems; (iii) there are inconsistencies between the annual and quarterly
estimates for public administration and the construction industry. Additionally, the benchmark indicator
ratios for the construction industry are extremely erratic over all years. There is no obvious reason for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

this, so the mission recommended that the NAMSD investigate the figures with the data providers; (iv)
the treatment of oil production in the industrial production index is not in line with that in the national
accounts; (v) the SSC does not have sufficient information to make reliable estimates of remittances
from domestic residents working abroad; and (vi) there are no estimates of informal sector activity.

Price Statistics
In 2010, the CPI was revised to update the consumption basket (561 items) and expenditure weights
that reflect recent consumption patterns. Prices are collected from 54 geographic areas and
disseminated at the national and regional level (nine regional indexes). CPI metadata lack sufficient
detail and should be augmented. There is need to expand CPI coverage to include housing (rentals and
owner occupied) and to develop a residential property price index.
The SSC compiles a number of producer price indices (PPI) covering agriculture, fishing, forestry,
mining, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, postal and communication services, and construction.
Ideally, the SSC should compile and release a total out-put PPI that includes all activities. Finally, export
and import price indices (XMPI) are also compiled and released. Metadata describing PPI and XMPI lack
detail and should be augmented.

B. Fiscal Sector
The Ministry of Finance has worked recently on the delineation of government and built limited
capacity on Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compilation and reporting. This has enabled the
authorities to report annual general government data according to the methodology of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook. However,
the stock positions in assets and liabilities have yet to be reported. The compilation of longer time
series, including sub-annual series, to support surveillance and fiscal analysis and policy making, is also
needed. While further work is required to improve the source data for the compilation of these
statistics, the present level of development of budgetary accounting and reporting system, makes it
possible a preliminary compilation and dissemination of the GFS on a quarterly basis.
To address the fiscal reporting issues, Azerbaijan will participate in a new STA’s three-year regional
project to build capacity and improve GFS reporting to be used for fiscal analysis, policy making, and
Fund surveillance. STA will assist the authorities to move to the updated GFSM 2014 methodology,
strengthen reporting of financial transactions and begin reporting balance sheet positions in assets and
liabilities. It is excepted that by the end of the project, Azerbaijan will make progress on the
requirements to subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and starts
reporting to the World Bank’s Quarterly Public Sector Debt Database (QPSD), which will enhance fiscal
transparency and fiscal risk assessment.

C. Monetary Sector
The CBA compiles monetary statistics according to the methodology of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual. The CBA reports monetary data to STA for the central bank and the other depositary
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

corporations, which includes commercial banks. The authorities report monetary data within three
weeks after the end of the reference month, via Standardized Report Forms. Monetary data have also
been included in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)publication since December 2006.

D. Financial Sector
The authorities do not report financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to STA for the Fund’s publications.
The authorities were encouraged to report FSI data and metadata. Countries participating in the FSI
submission are expected to compile 12 core FSIs on deposit takers and 28 additional indicators on
other financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, households, and real estate markets.

E. External Sector
Azerbaijan’s balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled and disseminated by the CBA and are
broadly in accordance with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). The CBA has
also initiated compilation of International Investment Position (IIP) statistics. The IIP data for 2002–2008
have been published in IFS; however, the authorities have indicated that they have discontinued the
compilation of IIP data effective 2009.
The CBA benefited from the TA provided by a regional advisor in ESS stationed in Baku during
November 2006-November 2008, and by missions conducted in 2009 and 2012. The missions found
that appropriate statistical legislation to assign responsibilities for compilation and dissemination of IIP
and gross external debt had yet to be developed. Also, lack of institutional cooperation and staff
turnover affected the pace of implementation of the strategic framework for the improvement of ESS.
Against that background, Azerbaijan was one of the countries targeted by the 20-month project
(November 2014-June 2016) financed by the Swiss Government (SECO) “Improvement of ESS in three
Central Asian Countries – Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan”. Within the SECO project, three TA
mission have been conducted to Azerbaijan focused on improving the methodological soundness,
expanding the coverage of ESS, and bringing dissemination practices to international standards. The
compilers also participated in three regional workshops which were attended by representatives from
the CBA and of three other public institutions - the main data providers for ESS purposes (the State
Statistical Committee, Ministry of Finance, and Customs). During the third, closing workshop, conducted
in June 2016 the accomplishments of the project have been assessed and the follow-up activities for
achieving a full transfer of ownership on the project’s products to the authorities have been identified.
During the project, the CBA made some progress in improving the system for collecting and compiling
ESS. A resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan, adopted in April 2015,
assigns responsibility to the CBRA for compiling IIP and external debt statistics. Based on the resolution,
the Central Bank Law was amended, which states that the CBRA is responsible for compiling the
country’s external debt statistics (public and private) and IIP. Also a number of recommendations of TA
missions were implemented, in particular: agreements were reached regarding the provision of
information by a number of large enterprises and consortiums from the oil and gas sector; the State

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

Statistical Committee (SSC) implemented a comprehensive survey form on the foreign economic activity
of enterprises; work is being completed on the implementation of closed international transactions
reporting system; and a number of technical issues concerning the ESS have been implemented. In
addition, the first draft of the quarterly IIP and gross external debt statistics for all institutional sectors
have been compiled that are yet to be approved by the authorities and disseminated
The most recent external sector mission visited Baku in April 2016. Despite the progress achieved
during the TA project (comprised of 3 missions: May 2015, November 2015 and April 2016), there are
still many deficiencies in the balance of payments compilation. For instance, significant under-coverage
has been identified in balance of payments components such as trade in goods and services
(specifically in import of goods), investment income (including reinvested earnings), and some financial
account components (like debt liabilities within the direct investment, debt securities in portfolio
investment, and loan liabilities for other sectors). A number of methodological inconsistencies have also
been identified in estimating assets in trade credit and advances; currency and deposits for other
sectors; and reserve assets. These shortcomings affect a number of indicators used for assessing the
country’s performance such as debt sustainability and reserve assets adequacy.
There is need to take decisive measures for compiling and disseminating the IIP and external debt
statistics. The TA missions assisted in compiling the draft IIP and external debt statements but the
methodological inconsistencies mentioned above in estimating some financial account components
lead to the accumulation of unrealistic stocks for those components in the IIP. In order to address the
inconsistencies between balance of payments and the IIP, revising the estimation techniques and
addressing the identified classification issues is required. However, compilers are reluctant to conduct
such revisions and classification changes.
The main challenge in implementing the recommended actions during the project changes to the ESS
includes gaining high-level national officials’ support for implementing the new international standards,
and allowing the use of new data sources and estimation techniques that, in some instances, may result
in the revised ESS indicators portraying trends less favorable than the previous data vintage.
Statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are reported quarterly on a due-for-payment
basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for public and publicly guaranteed
external debt, separately identifying the principal and interest components, is also provided with a one
quarter lag. However, systematic information on nonguaranteed external debt, including a sectoral
breakdown, is lacking. On external debt, the 2005 BOP mission noted that it would be desirable to use
balance sheet data from commercial banks pertaining to banking sector liabilities, which would permit
presentation of information with a breakdown by maturities and instruments.
Monthly data on total official reserve assets are provided within 15 days of the end of each month.
Azerbaijan does not disseminate International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity Template data.
The TA missions advised the authorities on the definition and coverage of gross official reserve assets
and stressed the importance of using the definition that follows the BPM6.
