REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 11, 2014
Estonia’s rapid recovery from the crisis continued at a slower pace in 2013 while fiscal
policy continues the near-balanced budget policies of recent years with a deficit of
0.2 percent of GDP in 2013 and 0.4 percent of GDP expected in 2014. Net debt is near
zero and gross public debt is roughly 10 percent of GDP, so fiscal issues aren’t pressing.
The main domestic risk is from rising labor costs.

KEY ISSUES
Prudent fiscal policies with near-balanced budgets over the cycle have reduced gross
public debt to about 10 percent of GDP. These policies have also led to a pro-cyclical
fiscal stance, with unsustainable increases in spending during the boom and a sharp
contraction during the crisis. However, the new budget framework with a target of a
structural fiscal balance or surplus should prevent excess spending in upturns and allow
full operation of automatic stabilizer in downturns.
Legislation in parliament would establish the Eesti Pank (the central bank) as the
macroprudential authority and provide it with a full toolkit of macroprudential
instruments. However, Nordic banks dominate the system and membership in the
Banking Union, limiting Estonia’s scope for unilateral action. In this context, the
authorities need to strengthen the Nordic-Baltic cross-border supervisory collaboration
and integrate the ECB into them.
Labor costs have been rising since 2012, and recent large increases in minimum wages
and wages in education and health may be putting additional upward pressure on
economy-wide wages and competitiveness. The authorities should refrain from further
large wage increases until it is clear that they aren’t undercutting competitiveness.
Structural unemployment remains high, and the authorities should continue to
implement education, training, and other initiatives to encourage foreign and domestic
investment. Consideration should also be given to policies that reduce the tax wedge,
particularly for lower-wage workers.

CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
1.
Estonia has been governed by coalitions led by the center-right Reform Party since
2005, but a new coalition of center-right and center-left parties was formed on March 26,
2014. On March 4, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip announced his resignation after nine years in office,
and the center-right senior partner in the previous coalition has replaced its more conservative
junior coalition partner with the center-left Social Democrats. There is broad consensus within
Estonia on a conservative fiscal policy stance, and the change in the ruling coalition is not expected
to result in substantial changes to economic policy apart from some changes in social benefits and
employment taxes. New elections are due in March 2015.

Unemployment continued to fall in 2013.
The period average unemployment rate dropped
1.4 points to 8.6 percent in 2013 (based on the
labor force survey) with the number of registered
unemployed persons falling by a similar proportion.
The unemployment rate is now roughly half of the
2010 peak. In contrast to many other advanced
economies, this has taken place against a backdrop
of a rising participation rate since the boom,
encouraged in part by enhanced benefits for the

Estonia’s recovery from the crisis continued in 2013 but at a slower pace. Preliminary
data indicate that growth was 0.8 percent in 2013, with a deceleration during the year (Table 1 and
Figures 1 and 2). Private consumption provided the

unemployed. The Eesti Pank estimates that the unemployment rate would be near 5 percent had the
participation rate remained at 2006–07 levels.
4.
Wage growth accelerated and outstripped productivity growth as labor market
conditions tightened. Nominal wage growth accelerated to 7.6 percent in 2013, resulting in an
increase in real unit labor costs of 2.5 percent relative to 2012.
5.
On balance, the economy seems to be roughly at its potential level. Estimates of
potential using a production function method and official national accounts data show a small
output gap, while evidence from the labor market suggests that the economy may already be below
the NAWRU. However, the conflicting signals between national accounts and other data create more
than the usual amount of uncertainty as to where the economy is relative to the potential output
level, in particular whether it is closer to potential than the measured level or even above potential.
6.
The external sector balances are broadly appropriate and the net international
investment position (IIP) is strengthening (Table 3 and Figure 3). The current account deficit is
small and shrinking and exports and export market shares have been growing steadily. The key
factors influencing exports are moving in different directions; exports based on processing fuels
imported from Russia have declined sharply, although value added is low in fuel processing. Exports
excluding these goods for processing rose, although their growth rate decelerated in 2013. On the
other hand, export market shares and value added in exports are increasing. But the trade balance
deteriorated slightly in 2013 due to weakness in demand from some key export markets, notably
Finland, and rising imports from robust private consumption demand in Estonia. Gross external debt
fell sharply in 2013 and net external debt of the economy is now negative, although the IIP position
remains negative due to the large stock of FDI.
7.
Indicators of competitiveness are generally good, but rising wages and producer
prices are putting pressure on price competitiveness. Real effective exchange rate indices based
on unit labor costs remain well below their pre-crisis peaks (particularly for manufacturing) but they
have been rising in 2012–13 (Figure 4).
8.
The exchange rate is broadly appropriate and in line with macroeconomic conditions
and policies. EBA estimates are not produced for Estonia, but team estimates based on CGER-like
methodology show mixed results with some indicators suggesting an overvalued rate and others
suggesting an undervalued rate. These results, together with the evidence on external sector flows
and stocks, and competitiveness indicators, point to a generally stable and sustainable external
position as well as a broadly appropriate exchange rate.
9.
Fiscal policy has remained conservative throughout the cycle (Tables 2 and 3 and
Figure 4). The deficit never exceeded 3 percent of GDP during crisis, and the budget has been in
near balance from 2010 onwards, with the 2013 deficit at 0.2 percent of GDP. Gross public debt was
largely unchanged at just under 10 percent of GDP while net public debt is near zero. While this
near-balanced budget policy has kept public debt low, it has also added a pro-cyclical bias to fiscal
policy.

The housing market is recovering from a very sharp decline during the crisis, but
prices and household leverage are well below their peak levels. The housing market peaked in
2007 before house prices lost roughly half of their

Estonia generally gets very high scores on cross-country evaluations of structural
reform. For example, the flexibility of the Estonian labor markets cushioned some of the impact of
the crisis and euro area recession on employment through downward flexibility in nominal wages in
2009–10. However, structural unemployment remains high.

Box 1. Estonia: External Stability Assessment
Estonia’s real exchange rate has remained broadly in line with the fundamentals, although with some
vulnerabilities on the horizon. Models based on medium-term equilibrium current account balance
point to undervaluation, while direct assessment of the equilibrium real exchange rate suggests an
overvaluation. An average of these estimates indicates a small overvaluation (about 5 percent). If the
equilibrium real exchange rate estimate is discounted given the view that it might exaggerate
overvaluation, the margin of overvaluation would shrink. However, the wide range of values from
different approaches imply large confidence intervals that would preclude a firm conclusion on overor under-valuation.

Price-and cost-based indicators confirm gentle decrease in competitiveness. Having declined
significantly in 2010–11, the ULC has been climbing again as real wage growth has outpaced
productivity increases. Consequently, both ULC- and inflation-deflated REER have been slowly
appreciating, with REER-CPI increasing by 2.7 percent in 2013.
After running large current account deficits during the boom, Estonia’s current account has been near
balance with a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2013. Exports continue to perform well, although
demand remains weak in some of Estonia’s main trading partners. In 2013, the trade deficit widened
slightly, while the services surplus decreased slightly to 6.7 percent of GDP. Net export of services
dominates trade balance, as Estonia capitalizes on its highly-skilled and competitive wages as well as
well-developed telecommunication network. Estonia gained market share in each of its top export
markets in 2013 (Finland, Sweden, Russia and Latvia).
Net FDI and transfers from the EU cover most of the current account deficit. FDI has been declining,
but remained positive with reinvested earnings accounting for most FDI inflows. EU transfers are
expected to pick up again in late 2014 or early 2015 with the implementation of the new EU budget
for 2014–20.
Gross external liabilities are declining and net debt of the economy became negative in 2013. Net IIP
liabilities were halved from the peak during the crisis years to 46 percent of GDP in 2013.

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

B. Outlook and Risks
14.
Growth should pick up in 2014 and the medium-term. Staff project growth of 2.4 percent
in 2014 supported by both external and domestic demand rising toward expected potential growth
(estimated at 3 to 3.5 percent in the medium term, using a production function approach that
accounts for demographic factors). The downward trend in inflation is expected to continue, toward
2 percent over the medium term, but could be slowed by increased wage pressure. This is above the
euro-area average, but it is consistent with what would be expected for a country converging with
its higher-income partners in the euro area.
15.
Risks are tilted moderately toward the downside and mostly relate to trade. Continued
contraction in Finland, or lower-than-expected growth in Sweden or Latvia could slow Estonia’s
growth through lower exports or FDI. Trade or other shocks from Russia and other CIS countries
could also drag down exports or otherwise depress growth. Trade with Russia is dominated by
energy imports, much of which is fuels that are re-exported after processing and natural gas for
which Russia is the sole supplier, and food exports, some of which are already subject to import
restrictions in Russia. On the upside, higher than expected growth in Nordic-Baltic countries or other
trade partners could also boost Estonia’s growth.
16.
A rise in interest rates from a shock in the Nordic banking system could also adversely
affect Estonia. With household debt dominated by adjustable rate mortgages, such a shock would
pass through quickly into household debt service, and this could lower consumer demand.
Businesses would be less affected as they are increasingly self financed for their investment needs or
able to get funding from foreign parent companies. However, a financial market shock outside the
Nordic region would have only a limited effect on Estonia given the strong financial position of the
Nordic banks and their dominance in the Estonian banking market.
17.
The main domestic risk is labor market overheating. Signs of this are already evident as
real wage growth is exceeding productivity growth, and this could undercut competitiveness and
export growth. With a flexible labor market legal regime and low levels of unionization, these wage
increases represent market outcomes.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

Authorities’ views
18.
While broadly agreeing with the outlook, the authorities were mostly concerned about
rising wage rates in excess of productivity growth. They also expect that growth will rebound in
2014, and that inflation will decline in 2014 and over the medium-term. They agree that excessive
wage growth threatened competitiveness and growth, but they noted the strong influence of much
higher wages elsewhere in the EU, particularly Finland, and the ease and frequency with which
Estonian workers can move to Finland as exogenous factors influencing Estonian wages that are
beyond the control of the authorities. They agreed that potential fallout from events in Russia and
Ukraine could affect trade with Russia, but they had not observed much immediate effect; the wide
margins of uncertainty as to future developments in this conflict rendered any assessment of any
economic impact highly speculative.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Estonia’s policies and policy agenda since the last Article IV consultation have been marked by
continuity in policies (e.g. near-balanced budgets, steady implementation of their own policy agenda,
the EU fiscal compact and the Basel III reforms (Box 2) ). With output near potential and signs of
overheating in labor markets, the consultation focused on the appropriate fiscal stance and labor
market policies, and on changes to fiscal and financial sector frameworks to help Estonia better
manage within the constraints of the euro zone.

A. Fiscal Policies
19.
The fiscal stance in 2014 and medium-term path remain appropriate. With a projected
headline deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP and an estimated structural surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP, the
fiscal stance in 2014 is largely unchanged from 2013. The budget will maintain Estonia’s strong
public finances and keep Estonia well within the limits set by its commitments under EU agreements.
Over the medium-term, the fiscal stance will further reduce public debt and restore the net financial
asset position of the government (see DSA, Figures 7 and 8).
20.
Estonia enacted a new State Budget Law in March 2014 that implements provisions of
the EU Fiscal Compact. The structural surplus target embodied in the new budget Law could help
to address the previous pro-cyclical patterns on fiscal policy. Specifically, the requirement for a
structural surplus can help to prevent increases in expenditure during good times that cannot be
sustained over the longer-term. While adherence to the structural surplus target would not require
counter-cyclical spending during downturns, it provides scope to allow automatic stabilizers to
operate fully. The government’s plans to keep the structural surplus well above the medium-term
objective for the Fiscal Compact. This could keep the government’s balance sheet strong and
provide a margin to accommodate negative fiscal surprises or disagreements as to whether the
target is met based on alternative estimates of the structural balance. Care must be taken to ensure
that the margin relative to the target does not provide a channel through which to reintroduce pro-

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

cyclicality. Legislation was approved in late March 2014 to create an new, independent fiscal council
in line with the Fiscal Compact.
Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities were more cautious than staff on allowing automatic stabilizers to
work fully in downturns. While they accepted the argument for countercyclical fiscal policy, they
felt that this needed to be weighed against the desirability of increasing fiscal reserves in an
economy with a declining and aging population that has been exposed to large shocks in the past.
They also consider fiscal stimulus rather inefficient because much of it leaks out of the country due
to the high import share in the economy. On the fiscal council, the authorities believe that the
formation of new independent institution will further bolster Estonia’s resilience and credibility on
fiscal policy.

B. Financial Sector Policies
22.
Risks to the banking sector remain, but appear contained. The risks on the domestic side
stem from possibly weak output growth which may negatively affect credit quality. However, the
stress test conducted by the authorities suggests that potential impacts from macro shocks would
be largely absorbed by high capitalization. Externally, financial stress in the Nordic banking system,
possibly due to the tensions in global funding markets or a correction in housing prices, could
induce banks to pull funding from Estonia. However, strong deposit growth in Estonia provides a
substantial portion of local funding for now.
23.
The Estonian authorities are implementing the new capital and liquidity provisions
under Basel III. The capital conservation buffer, the systemic risk buffer, and the countercyclical
capital buffer will be implemented shortly after pending legislation is enacted. The capital
conservation buffer (of 2.5 percent EU-wide) is expected to be immediately adopted without a
transitional period. The systemic risk buffer is expected to be set at 2 percent and the countercyclical
buffer is expected to be set at zero initially. The liquidity coverage ratio is to be implemented by
January 1, 2015. These actions are not likely to substantially affect the banking sector which is
already highly capitalized and liquid. They would complete most of the outstanding domestic
agenda on the Basel-III reforms and go a very long way toward ensuring financial sector stability.
24.
Estonia is now well advanced in the process of establishing a more complete and
stronger macroprudential toolkit. The draft amendments to the Eesti Pank Act and the Credit
Institutions Act would establish the Eesti Pank as the macroprudential authority, give it the
macroprudential tools specified in the CRD IV, and provide the authority to set macroprudential
limits such as loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios requirements rather than guidelines.
25.
Implementation of the EU Banking Union will require cooperation between Estonia,
the ECB, the Nordic home country supervisors of Estonia’s major banks, and the Nordic-Baltic
financial structures. With the implementation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in
November 2014, the three subsidiaries (SEB, Swedbank, and DNB) will come under direct supervision

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

of the ECB. The Nordic bank branches (Danske and Nordea) would remain under the supervision of
the Swedish and Danish authorities respectively.3 Then, modalities should be in place for close
consultation between the Estonian authorities, ECB regulators and the Nordic regulators of the
parent banks, both on supervision and on setting regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. The
current framework of Nordic-Baltic cooperation on bank supervision and policy (including NordicBaltic Stability Group and Nordic-Baltic Macroprudential Forum) will need to be adapted to the
Banking Union.
Authorities’ view
26.
The authorities’ view is that the banking system is sound, but they also feel the need
to closely monitor it. The early adoption of the capital conservation buffer reflects the authorities’
confidence on banking sector soundness, while they plan to assess SSM banks (SEB, Swedbank, and
DNB), as well as small local banks with relatively rapid credit growth, through the ECB-led asset
quality review later this year. The authorities value the importance of the more complete and
strengthened macroprudential toolkit for banking supervision. The authorities believe that the
Banking Union will create a positive confidence effect on Estonia’s banking sector and that NordicBaltic cooperation has worked well and needs to be preserved.

C. Labor Markets
27.
The government should be prepared to respond to further evidence of deteriorating
competitiveness from real wage increases. While the first of three roughly 10 percent annual
increases in the minimum wage in 2013–15 probably had minimal effect on average wages, the two
subsequent increases may become more binding on actual wages. Also, while wages are very largely
market determined in Estonia, the minimum wage increases and public health and education wage
increases may have had a demonstration effect beyond their direct impact. Until it is clear that
recent signs of worsening price competitiveness are not undercutting net exports, the government
should refrain from large public sector wage hikes or agree to minimum wage increases after 2015.
28.
Estonia’s high level of structural unemployment needs to be addressed. While there is
considerable evidence that the Estonian economy is now at or near the level of structural
unemployment, the fact that this is taking place with the unemployment rate still above 8 percent
suggests scope for medium-term policies to reduce the structural rate. Estonia has a very flexible
labor market, but still structural unemployment remains higher than in countries with similar labor
market policies. Mismatches in workforce skills and education and the background sought by
employers seem to be keeping unemployment high even in good economic times. Some active
labor market policies to address skills mismatches and keep people in the labor force are already in
place. The authorities are addressing education through several initiatives, including eliminating
university tuition for full-time students. The work of the Unemployment Insurance Fund on training

and counseling to encourage effective labor force participation by youth, the disabled, and the longterm unemployed has been expanded very substantially to integrate these more difficult segments
of the working age population. Specifically, active labor market expenditures per unemployed
person rose sharply between 2010 and 2012 in almost every category, with training expenditures
(the largest category) rising to more than eight times the 2010 per person level by 2012. More
efforts are needed to change the composition of specialization in secondary and tertiary education,
but this is inherently a long-term project.

Labor taxes and contributions may be an obstacle to reducing unemployment,
particularly for low wage workers. The tax wedge is high in Estonia even relative to the Nordics
and much higher than in the “Anglo-Saxon” (i.e., majority Anglophone) OECD countries. Labor taxes

the introduction of property taxes) that preserve the fiscal targets. Lowering the tax wedge would
also contribute to containing unit labor costs and improving competitiveness.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities noted that the active labor market policies that have been gradually
introduced since 2010 have contributed to the sharp decline in unemployment since then. The
Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) has developed various assistance programs to help the
registered unemployed in their job search, including counseling, disability employment services, and
training. They also noted efforts being made by the Ministry of Education and Research to improve
life-long learning at all skill levels for those already employed in order to foster productivity growth,
and increase the number of people coming out of the education system in technical fields (e.g.,
science and engineering), including through cooperation between universities and the private
sector. Finally, the authorities indicated that they are preparing a reform of disability benefits that
would strengthen the possibilities of disabled people for (part-time) work thus increasing

employment and at the same time tighten the eligibility criteria for disability benefits and limit
abuses (the number of people receiving disability benefits is close to one-sixth of the labor force).

D. Other Policy Priorities
31.
Regional efforts to improve infrastructure links to Estonia’s neighbors could also boost
competitiveness. Infrastructure in Estonia is rated highly in international comparisons, but regional
cooperation needs to be enhanced for some critical systems, such as transport and energy. While
progress has been made in linking the electricity grid to Finland, more could be done to build rail
links to the rest of the EU and diversify options for natural gas supply. Particularly as EU funds are
potentially available to finance most of the costs for rail and gas, Estonia should coordinate with its
Baltic and Nordic neighbors to better connect itself to the rest of the EU and diversify infrastructure
links to be able to take advantage of better alternatives. 5
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities agreed on the importance of improving infrastructure links to the rest
of the European Union, but noted the steps already taken or underway. They noted that the
second electricity link had been established with Finland and that there was agreement with Finland
on LNG terminals and a gas pipeline linking the two countries. Discussions on a rail link running
through the Baltics and connecting them to the rest of the EU through Poland are underway.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The near- and medium-term outlook for Estonia is generally positive. While growth
slowed in 2013, there is good reason to expect an acceleration of growth in 2014 and the medium
term. Inflation has been running above the euro area average, but it is trending down toward
2 percent and remains appropriate for a country rapidly converging with its higher-income euro
area partners. Export growth remains strong and competitiveness indicators are generally good,
although rising unit labor costs are a source of concern and need monitoring. External risks are
mostly related to trade and the outlook for growth in major export markets, although problems in
the Nordic banking system could spill over into Estonia and events in Russia and Ukraine could have
a negative impact through other channels.
34.
The 2014 budget continues the Estonian tradition of prudent fiscal policy. The
projected headline deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP is appropriate given cyclical and labor market
conditions, while the structural surplus remains largely unchanged at 0.7 percent. This budget
should meet the requirements of the Fiscal Compact.

5

More extensive discussion of challenges for exports trade and joint policies to that end can be found in the Baltic
Cluster Report and Chapter III of the associated selected Issues paper.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

35.
The structural surplus target embodied in the new Budget Law should help to address
the previous pro-cyclical patterns on fiscal policy. The requirement for a structural surplus can
help prevent unsustainable increases in expenditure during good times and provide scope to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate, as should be done in downturns. The government’s medium-term
plans to keep the structural surplus well above the medium-term objective should keep the
government’s balance sheet strong, but they should not be used to reintroduce a procyclical
dimension to policy. The new law establishing an independent fiscal council is also welcome. These
policies can help to further bolster Estonia’s resilience and credibility on fiscal policy.
36.
The authorities’ commitment to maintain a strong financial system in the face of an
evolving financial architecture is welcome. The planned early implementation of the new capital
and liquidity provisions is appropriate. When credit growth recovers to pre-crisis levels, raising the
countercyclical buffer from zero needs to be considered. Close collaboration among the Estonian
authorities, the ECB, the Nordic-Baltic sector supervisory, central bank, and governmental structures
will be important to smooth Estonia’s transition to the Banking Union.
37.
The government should be prepared to respond to further evidence of deteriorating
competitiveness from real wage increases. In this context it should refrain from additional large
public sector wage hikes or agree to minimum wage increases after 2015, until it is clear that
worsening price competitiveness is not undercutting net exports.
38.
Estonia’s high level of structural unemployment needs to be addressed. Some active
labor market policies to address skills mismatches and keep people in the labor force are already in
place and funding for these policies has been substantially expanded in recent years. Programs to
improve the skills of those already working and increase the number of people with education in
technical fields should address the shortage of highly-skilled workers and help boost productivity.
Lowering the tax wedge on lower-wage workers in a budget-neutral manner should also be given
serious consideration. Lowering the tax wedge would also contribute to containing unit labor costs
and improving competitiveness.
39.
Regional efforts to improve infrastructure links to Estonia’s neighbors could also boost
competitiveness. Estonia should coordinate with its Baltic and Nordic neighbors to be better
connected to the rest of the EU and diversify infrastructure.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Estonia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 2. Actions Taken in Areas Relevant to Previous Policy Advice
Recommendations from
2013 Article IV Consultation

Policy Actions by the Estonian authorities

As budgetary conditions allow, make
room to address Estonia’s mediumterm economic challenges, including
lowering the tax burden.

The personal and corporate income tax rates will be lowered
from 21 to 20 percent effective January 1, [2015].

Adopting a fully fledged medium-term
fiscal framework can help assess policy
tradeoffs and avoid pro-cyclical
policies.

The State Budget Act was enacted in March 2014, which
provides for a medium-term fiscal objective of a structural
fiscal balance or surplus, in line with the EU Fiscal Compact. The
legislation also established a fiscal council and implements a
corrective mechanism not included in the Fiscal Compact that
requires that overruns against the medium-term objective be
offset in subsequent years with a minimum adjustment of
0.5 percent of GDP per year. The medium-term budget strategy
continues to provide guidance to agencies as to their budget
submissions to the Ministry of Finance and medium-term
budget planning.

Strengthen macroprudential policies
including though early implementation
of forthcoming international standards.

The capital conservation buffer, the systemic risk buffer, and
the countercyclical capital buffer will be implemented shortly
after pending legislation is enacted. The capital conservation
buffer (of 2.5 percent EU-wide) is expected to be immediately
adopted without a transitional period. The liquidity coverage
ratio is to be implemented by January 1, 2015.

The authorities should consider
introducing ceilings on loan-to-value
and loan-to-income ratios.

Pending legislation gives the Eesti Pank full authority to set
loan-to-value, loan-to-income, debt-service-to-income, and
other prudential ratios as requirements rather than guidelines.

Strengthen the Eesti Pank’s
macroprudential authority.

The draft amendments to the Eesti Pank Act and the Credit
Institutions Act will establish the Eesti Pank as the
macroprudential authority.

Continue Nordic-Baltic cross-border
supervisory and financial sector
coordination arrangements in tandem
with the Banking Union.

The Nordic-Baltic arrangements are continuing, but progress
has been limited on integrating these arrangements with
Banking Union structures pending greater clarity on the latter.

Continue efforts to improve education
and training to reduce skills
mismatches.

Funding for active labor market policies for the unemployed
has been increased substantially in recent years, and plans are
being developed for increasing the supply of people educated
in technical fields.

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Estonia’s data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. A May 2001
data ROSC mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was generally good. The 2009
fiscal transparency ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly all of the requirements of the
transparency code, and approached best international practice in some areas. Estonia subscribed to
the SDDS on September 30, 1998, with metadata posted on the DSSB on January 27, 1999, and met
SDDS specifications on March 30, 2000. The latest (2010) annual observance report for Estonia for
the SDDS was posted on the Fund’s website in May 2011.
(http://dsbb.imf.org/images/pdfs/AnnualReports/2010/EST_SDDS_AR2010.pdf) (SDDS webpage for
EST) http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/SDDS/CtyCtgList.aspx?ctycode=EST
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Estonia (SE) in accordance with
the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at
current and at constant prices are compiled using the production, income and expenditure
approaches and statistical discrepancies among them have at times been sizable. The annual and
the quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2005. As of
September 2011, data are compiled on the basis of the new version of classification of activities
EMTAK 2008, and using double deflation. National accounts for the first quarter 2009 to first quarter
2013 were revised in September 2013. National accounts data for 2013 are at odds with other data
that suggest somewhat higher real growth and lower inflation than the reported GDP deflator, which
might suggest measurement problems.
Public Finance: Fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), while historical data are
also available on Statistics Estonia’s website. Monthly central government data are disseminated
with a lag of up to 25 days after the end of the month. Quarterly data on foreign loans and
guarantees by the central government are published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The Ministry is
using one of its two allowed SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central
government operations data, and disseminate these data on the National Summary Data page.
Comprehensive annual data on central and general government operations (accrual basis) are
reported in the GFS Yearbook. These data include a statement of operations and the government
balance sheet, including data on financial assets and liabilities, both domestic and foreign. Quarterly
data for the general government are included in the International Finance Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Bank of Estonia (BoE) compiles and reports monetary and
financial statistics consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Aggregate
financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis. The majority of statistics
are disseminated on the Bank of Estonia’s webpage on the 17th banking day after the end of the
reporting period. Data for individual banks are also available on a quarterly basis since 2008Q1 on
the Financial Supervision Authority’s webpage. Estonia also regularly provides requested Financial
Soundness Indicators.

External Sector: Quarterly balance of payments, external debt, and international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled by the BoE consistent with the Balance of Payments Manual fifth
edition (BMP5). Daily exchange rate data are available with a one working day lag. Monthly
import/export data are available with a two month lag. The Data Template on International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and
is hyperlinked to the Fund’s DSBB.
Dissemination of Statistics: The Estonian authorities disseminate a range of economic statistics,
with a significant amount of data are available on the Internet:


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on
the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);



the Bank of Estonia website (http://www.eestipank.info/frontpage/en/)provides data on
monetary statistics, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic indicators;



the Statistics Estonia website (http://www.stat.ee/en) provides information on economic and
social development indicators;



the Ministry of Finance homepage (http://www.fin.ee/?lang=ee) includes information on the
government’s annual multi-year State Budget Strategy, as well as information and data on the
national budget, and government finance statistics (deficit, debt, financial assets).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
On May 05, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Estonia.
In 2013, Estonia’s recovery from the crisis continued but at a slower pace. Real GDP growth was
0.8 percent, with private consumption providing the main support while net exports made a
negative contribution. Inflation declined to about 3½ percent, but stayed above the euro average.
Public finances remained strong, with a fiscal deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP, a gross public debt
of 10 percent of GDP, and a net public debt near zero. Unemployment continued to fall, bringing
the unemployment rate down to 8.6 percent, about half the 2010 peak. Nominal wage growth
accelerated, outstripping productivity growth and putting pressure on price competitiveness. The
current account deficit was small, and the net international investment position improved. Gross
external debt fell sharply in 2013 and net external debt of the economy turned negative.
Economic activity should pick up in 2014 and the medium-term, supported by both external and
domestic demand. Real GDP growth is projected at 2.4 percent in 2014, rising toward expected
potential growth of 3 to 3.5 percent in the medium term. The downward trend in inflation is
expected to continue toward 2 percent over the medium term, but could be slowed by increased
wage pressure. Risks to the outlook are tilted moderately toward the downside and mostly relate
to trade. In particular, less favorable than projected economic conditions in the Nordic Baltic
region and the CIS could slow Estonia’s growth through lower exports or FDI. Also, a rise in
interest rates from a shock in the Nordic banking system could adversely affect Estonia. Finally,
labor market overheating could also undercut competitiveness and export growth.
Estonia’s policy agenda is characterized by continuity in policies. With a projected fiscal deficit
of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014, the fiscal stance will remain appropriate given cyclical
conditions. Over the medium term, the authorities’ structural surplus targets will keep the
government’s balance sheet strong and allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully in case of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
downturns. However, the government should refrain from additional large wage hikes which
could have demonstration effects. In the financial sector, the envisaged early implementation of
the new capital and liquidity provisions under Basel III will further enhance Estonia’s financial
stability. Also, a close collaboration with the ECB and the Nordic -Baltic supervisory structures
will be important to smooth Estonia’s transition to the Banking Union. Estonia’s high level of
structural unemployment needs to be addressed. In addition to the current active labor market
policies to reduce skills mismatches and keep people in the labor force, lowering the tax wedge
on lower-wage workers could further reduce unemployment. Finally, Estonia should coordinate
with its Baltic and Nordic neighbors to diversify infrastructure, which could also boost
competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Estonia’s continued commitment to sound macroeconomic
policies. Directors noted that while the outlook for growth is favorable, risks are tilted to the
downside because of the difficult regional environment. They emphasized the need to maintain
strong macroeconomic policies to preserve competitiveness, address the high unemployment
rate, and enhance long-term growth.
Directors welcomed the 2014 budget, which continues Estonia’s tradition of prudent fiscal policy
characterized by low deficits or surpluses, and low debt. They considered the budget’s
underlying stance to be broadly appropriate and consistent with prevailing economic conditions.
Directors agreed that the creation of the fiscal council and the structural surplus target embodied
in the new Budget Law should help address the previous pro-cyclical patterns of fiscal policy by
preventing unsustainable increases in expenditure during good times, and provide scope to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate in downturns. More broadly, Directors underscored that fiscal
policy should be flexible and growth friendly.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain a strong financial system in the
face of the evolving financial architecture, including the planned early implementation of the
new capital and liquidity provisions. They advised close collaboration among the Estonian
authorities, the ECB, the Nordic-Baltic sector supervisory, and governmental structures to ensure
that Estonia’s transition to the Banking Union is smooth. In the context of a strengthened
macroprudential framework, developments in housing prices should be closely monitored.
Directors emphasized the need to preserve competitiveness in light of recent increases in wages
and unit labor costs. While acknowledging that wages are largely market determined, they
encouraged the authorities to refrain from additional large public sector wage hikes or agree to
minimum wage increases, until it is clear that the wage rates are not undercutting net exports.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors agreed that Estonia’s high level of structural unemployment needs to be addressed.
They noted that some policies to address skills mismatches and maintain labor participation rates
are already in place, and that funding for these programs has been substantially expanded.
Directors agreed that further efforts to improve the skills of those already working and increase
the number of people with education in technical fields should reduce the shortage of highlyskilled workers and boost productivity. They also recommended reducing the tax wedge on
lower-wage workers in a budget-neutral manner, which would contribute to containing unit labor
costs and improving competitiveness.
Directors agreed that regionally-coordinated efforts to improve infrastructure links to Estonia’s
neighbors could help improve competitiveness and better connect with the rest of the European
Union.

Statement by Mr. Audun Groenn, Executive Director for the Republic of Estonia
and by Mr. Martin Lindpere, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 5, 2014
On behalf of the Estonian authorities we thank the IMF mission team for the candid and
productive discussions and for the well-focused Article IV and Baltic cluster reports. The
authorities share staff’s views on the state of the Estonian economy and highly appreciate
their economic policy advice.
Macroeconomic performance and outlook
The Estonian economy has weathered well the recent years’ uncertain external environment.
In 2011––the recovery phase––broad based economic growth reached 9.6 percent, being
followed by 3.9 percent growth in the stabilization phase in 2012. In that period, the Estonian
economy was pushed towards a healthier equilibrium as the imbalances continued to decline
and resilience was improved. 2013 brought along a growth slowdown to 0.8 percent, being
affected by economic challenges in our neighboring countries, especially in Finland and
Russia, and by sector-specific adverse shocks. This has not had a substantial impact on the
strong labor market performance, which is keeping consumer confidence high and supporting
private consumption.
Looking forward, the latest forecast of the Ministry of Finance expects economic growth to
rise to 2 percent in 2014 and to accelerate thereafter to about 3.5 percent. The corporate
sector is ready for a growth take-off with the high amount of retained earnings, and a
leverage ratio being at the lowest level in ten years. However, uncertainties in the external
environment still weigh on investment activity. The evolving geopolitical tension has become
the predominant risk for the Estonian economy, which has not yet been penciled into the
baseline scenario. Estonia’s competitiveness depends not only on domestic factors but also
on the performance of the Nordic economies, being positioned higher in the same global
supply chain. Additionally, there are concerns that a re-emergence of global financial
spillovers may reach Estonia, if liquidity or financing conditions of the Nordic parent banks
are affected. Though, this risk has lessened as bank lending is currently financed by deposits.
Inflation has slowed significantly since mid-2013, reaching 0.2 percent in annual terms in
March, but is expected to accelerate to 1.4 percent in 2014. Restrained price developments in
the external environment have successfully counterbalanced domestic pressures. A noticeable
negative price impulse stems from the energy component. Inflation in Estonia is held back by
temporary factors as well because there is less administrative price increases.
However, signs of tightening have appeared in the labor market, escalating wage growth and
pressing prices in some segments of the consumer basket. Continued wage growth that
erodes competitiveness is the main domestic risk and therefore labor costs need vigilant
monitoring. Although unit labor costs have deteriorated, labor costs have not grown faster

2
than corporate turnover, referring to other costs that have squeezed profit margins. In the
past, the Estonian labor market has repeatedly shown flexibility that has supported necessary
structural adjustment. The unemployment rate has declined by more than 10 percentage
points from its peak in 2010 to the current 8 percent, and recent years have seen an increase
in labor market activity. If the labor market participation rate had remained constant at the
boom years’ level, the unemployment rate would have been now at approximately 5 percent.
Although the actual unemployment rate has fallen, it is worrisome that the structural
unemployment rate is relatively high. The latter cannot be measured with high precision and,
as a sign of measurement uncertainty, staff’s estimate of structural unemployment is
somewhat higher compared to the authorities’, OECD’s, and European Commission’s
estimates. The authorities still fully agree that structural unemployment is too high and
commit to continued policy action.
The assessment of wage pressures should take into account people’s choice of working
abroad as this is a viable option while living in Estonia, especially for some professions. The
main driver of this process is declining but still substantial wage level difference. Working
abroad has many positive consequences, as it fosters skills transfer and accumulation of
human capital. The Estonian authorities highly appreciate the EU common labor market
policy, but they would be grateful for policy advice on how to contain wage pressures from
work migration.
Fiscal Policy
The Estonian authorities have given high priority to a prudent fiscal policy and the recently
formed government has reaffirmed this commitment. In line with the recent amendments to
budget position rules in the State Budget Act, the newly published state budget strategy aims
to have at least a structural budget balance in the medium term and to achieve a small
structural surplus in most years. Estonia has attained structural surpluses since 2009 and prior
to the global financial crisis as well. The forecast for 2014 shows a small structural surplus of
0.1 percent of GDP. Given that high uncertainty surrounds the structural balance estimates in
real time, high attention is paid on the nominal budget outcome as well. The current outlook
prescribes a 0.7 percent nominal deficit for 2014, which is expected to decline over the
forthcoming years. A significant part of this deficit comes from the increased payments into
the second pension pillar, which were temporarily suspended in the crisis years, and the use
of carbon dioxide quota sale revenues, which were received earlier. The authorities consider
the fiscal policy stance appropriate at this juncture, especially against the background of a
swift wage growth and a high degree of monetary accommodation on the domestic side and
fiscal and financial fragilities on the external side. Both the public sector’s current liquid
financial assets and gross debt are at about the 10 percent level of GDP.
The Estonian government aims to maintain the tax burden at the pre-recession level of
around 32 percent of GDP with the intention to reduce further labor taxes. In an EU country

comparison of labor tax burden, Estonia is below average. The planned changes for 2015
include a decrease in the income tax rate from 21 to 20 percent, a reduction in unemployment
insurance tax rate by 0.6 percentage points to 2.4 percent and increases in tax-free income,
being compensated by increases in alcohol, tobacco, and gas excise taxes. The labor tax
burden peaked at almost 37 percent level in 2010 due to the crises measures, but has declined
thereafter and is expected to almost reach the 33 percent level in 2015. This is in line with
staff’s advice in the Baltic cluster report. Public sector capital expenditures will be almost
5 percent of GDP in 2014, but will gradually decline thereafter.
The government has reached an agreement to reduce tax exemptions and improve tax
compliancy with a number of measures. The value added tax incentive will be reduced when
a company’s passenger car is used for private use and the preferential excise duty on fuel
with special marking (except in agriculture and fishing boats) will be abolished. The
introduction of the Annex to the VAT declaration for recording larger transactions is meant
to reduce tax avoidance.
A number of amendments to the State Budget Act were passed in February. Hence, the
establishment of an independent Fiscal Council, which is responsible for the assessment of
the macroeconomic and financial forecasts and for monitoring compliance with the
budgetary rules, is currently being implemented.
Financial Policy
The Estonian banking sector is highly liquid, well capitalized, and profitable and the balance
sheets of the corporate and household sectors have improved, increasing the resilience to the
external shocks. The Estonian banking sector is dominated by the Nordic (Swedish) banking
groups, which own over 90 (80) percent of the market. As the real estate price cycle and
household borrowing in Sweden have increased the risks to financial stability, the Estonian
authorities welcome the steps by the Swedish authorities to further strengthen banks’ capital
and liquidity buffers. While the low interest rate environment has eased loan servicing, a
prolonged period of monetary accommodation may encourage excessive risk-taking in
Estonia, especially in the real estate market.
The strength of the Estonian banking sector is reflected by a high capital adequacy ratio that
exceeded 24 percent in end-2013 and by liquid assets that constituted 24 percent of total
banking sector assets. As a sign of decreased vulnerability, the loan-to-deposit ratio declined
to the 104 percent level in the beginning of this year. Throughout 2013, the level of NPLs has
fallen reaching below 2 percent in 2014.
The contraction in the corporate sector credit stock came to an end in mid-2012. However,
the recovery stalled a year later as uncertainties in the external environment affected credit
demand. The corporate sector balance sheets and bank lending policies are not constraints to
credit growth. The predominant factor for the continuation of credit recovery is the renewed
growth of Estonia’s major trade partners.

Real estate price developments in Estonia constitute an evolving risk that requires close
monitoring. Following a steep decline in the recession years and a vigorous recovery
thereafter, apartment prices were still raising by more than 20 percent annually at the end of
2013. Low interest rates enhance the risk that continued growth in real estate prices leads to
overly optimistic expectations. An encouraging sign is that a relatively high share of real
estate transactions is not credit funded. The planned amendments to the Eesti Pank Act will
give the Bank of Estonia the powers of the macro-prudential authority and the Credit
Institutions Act defines the implementation of macro-prudential instruments. The expectation
is that some of the instruments will come into force over the course of 2014. Given the highly
integrated Estonian and Nordic banking sectors, it is important that the modalities arising
from the implementation of the EU Banking Union will be effectively integrated into the
existing Nordic-Baltic bank supervision and policy cooperation framework.
Structural Policy
Although the income level has considerably increased in Estonia during the last two decades,
the gap with the EU average still exists. The Estonian authorities recognize that continued
convergence prescribes behavioral and structural flexibility, which is not granted.
Against the background of population aging and migration, affecting potentially future
investments, the authorities are concerned about the high level of structural unemployment.
They share the view that policies need to address skill mismatches as a high priority.
Lowering the tax wedge, which they have already implemented, may also help, but this
measure is likely less efficient when skill imbalances between demand and supply are
present. Measures that make vocational training more available, competitive, and adaptive to
the labor market needs, have been put in place. Nevertheless, skilled labor is highly scarce in
some segments of the economy. The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (EUIF) will
continue providing their updated and diversified portfolio of ALMPs. The EUIF’s spending
will increase by 15 percent in 2014, which allows them to provide more services, especially
against the background of a smaller number of unemployed people. Following the draft act of
the disability benefit reform, the mandate of the EUIF will be broadened in 2015 to include
the assessment of work capacity for disabled people. This reform is likely to increase labor
supply as it aims to bring more disabled people to the labor force and to prevent the loss of
their work capacity.
Estonia has made progress in connecting its electric grids with Finland, which has resulted in
a substantial decline in price differentials between two countries. Discussions are ongoing
with Finland to build the Baltic Connector and LNG terminals to connect the gas grids as
well and improve energy security. The Estonian authorities are strongly in favor of fast
progress in the Rail Baltic project, to improve the rail connection of the whole region with
the rest of the EU.
