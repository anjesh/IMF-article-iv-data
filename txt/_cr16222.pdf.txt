IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Italy

On July 6, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Italy.
The Italian economy is recovering gradually from a deep and protracted recession. Buoyed by
exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, favorable commodity prices, supportive fiscal
policy, and improved confidence on the back of the authorities’ wide-ranging reform efforts, the
economy grew by 0.8 percent in 2015 and continued to expand in the first quarter of 2016. Labor
market conditions have been improving gradually, and nonperforming loans (NPLs) appear to be
stabilizing at around 18 percent of total loans. Nonetheless, the structural challenges remain
significant. Productivity and investment growth are low; the unemployment rate remains above
11 percent, with considerably higher levels in some regions and among the youth; bank balance
sheets are strained by very high NPLs and lengthy judicial processes; and public debt has edged
up to close to 133 percent of GDP, a level that limits the fiscal space to respond to shocks.
Against this backdrop, the recovery is likely to be prolonged and subject to risks. Growth is
projected to remain just under 1 percent this year and about 1 percent in 2017. Risks are tilted to
the downside, including from financial market volatility, the refugee surge, and headwinds from
the slowdown in global trade. This growth path would imply a return to pre-crisis (2007) output
levels only by the mid-2020s and a widening of Italy’s income gap with the faster growing euro
area average. It also implies a protracted period of balance sheet repair, and thus of vulnerability.
Cognizant of Italy’s complex challenges, the authorities have embarked on a range of very
important reforms, including institutional, public administration, fiscal, labor market, and
banking sector reforms. It is imperative that these efforts are fully carried out and deepened.
Taking advantage of the start of economic recovery and the current favorable tailwinds of
monetary easing, low commodity prices and fiscal support, the timely implementation of

complementary and mutually reinforcing efforts in the financial and fiscal sectors and structural
measures would help boost growth, lower the upfront cost of reforms, and accelerate the building
of buffers.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Italy is recovering from a protracted recession supported by
accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, favorable commodity prices, and improved
confidence on the back of the authorities’ wide-ranging reform efforts. Nonetheless, Directors
noted that the recovery is likely to be modest against the backdrop of an unsettled external
environment, structural rigidities, strained bank balance sheets, and high public debt. They,
therefore, urged the authorities to fully implement and deepen the reforms to strengthen
near-term growth, further build up buffers, enhance resilience, and bolster economic
performance over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the implementation of the Jobs Act and the approval of a framework law on
public administration reform. They noted the high youth unemployment and low female labor
participation, and supported implementation of active labor market policies. They called for
pressing ahead with ambitious product and service market reforms, including a strengthened
Annual Competition Law; modernizing the wage bargaining system to align wages with
productivity at the firm level; and implementing public administration reforms decisively,
including to lower the cost of doing business and improve the investment climate.
Directors underscored that financial sector reforms are critical to entrench financial stability and
support the recovery. They commended the recent insolvency reforms, the framework for bank
consolidation, and steps to address nonperforming loans (NPLs). To substantially reduce the
stock of NPLs over the medium term, lower the cost of risk, and improve operating efficiency,
Directors supported further measures, including more intensive use of out-of-court debt
restructuring mechanisms; strengthened supervision; and a systematic assessment of asset quality
for banks not already subject to the ECB comprehensive assessment, with follow-up actions in
line with regulatory requirements. Directors considered that effective use of the framework for
the prompt resolution of banks is important. Recognizing the adoption of the Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive (BRRD) framework, they noted that concerns related to the bail-in of retail
investors should be dealt with appropriately.
Highlighting the need to balance efforts to reduce debt with support for growth, Directors noted
that the debt dynamics are expected to decline only gradually in the coming years and remain
vulnerable to shocks. Building on the progress achieved recently, they urged the authorities to
move forward decisively on pro-growth reforms, giving greater priority to lower and more

efficient spending and less distortive taxation, including broadening the tax base and introducing
a modern real estate tax. Many Directors saw the need to place debt on a firmer downward path
as a priority to enhance resilience to shocks, and accordingly recommended an evenly-phased
adjustment over 2017–19, net of any remaining upfront costs from structural reforms, to achieve
a small structural surplus. A number of other Directors, however, saw merit in backloading
adjustment to cushion the impact on growth, while considering a balanced budget as an
appropriate medium-term objective, but called for special attention to managing risks, including
through ambitious privatization efforts.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has started to recover from a prolonged recession. The recovery,
however, is modest and fragile, against the backdrop of long-standing structural
rigidities, strained bank balance sheets, and high public debt that leave very little room
to cope with shocks. On current projections, the economy is not expected to return to its
pre-crisis (2007) output peak until the mid-2020s, implying nearly two lost decades, a
growing income gap with euro zone partners, and a protracted period of balance sheet
vulnerability. The challenge is to turn around productivity performance, facilitate faster
bank balance sheet cleanup, and lower public debt.
Policies. Recognizing Italy’s complex challenges and incomplete efforts to address them
in the past, the government is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to boost potential
output, support the recovery, and restore balance sheet health. This includes
institutional, public administration, fiscal, labor market and banking sector reforms, which
once fully implemented should yield benefits gradually over time. To support the
recovery, it has eased fiscal policy quite markedly this year, and while efforts are made to
start bringing public debt down, structural adjustment has been backloaded to 2019.
Recommendations. While the authorities are seeking to strike a balance between
supporting the recovery and building buffers to improve resilience, some of the
initiatives may not go far enough in bringing about a timely reduction of vulnerabilities.
To enhance the impact of their efforts, consideration could be given to the following:


Deepen structural reforms: more ambitious product and service market reforms to
enhance competition could support near-term growth and facilitate bolder financial
and fiscal efforts. They should be supplemented by a wage bargaining framework to
align wages with productivity and full implementation of public sector reforms.



Accelerate financial sector repair: decisive steps are needed, including through stricter
supervisory oversight, to reduce faster the high nonperforming loans in the coming
years and support the emergence of sound banking groups, and address concerns
about the resolution framework including by tackling mis-selling to retail investors.



Strengthen fiscal buffers: an evenly-phased adjustment over 2017–19, net of any
remaining upfront costs of structural reforms, could support the recovery while
increasing the credibility of adjustment. A small structural surplus over the medium
term would help build buffers faster. Rationalizing spending, rebalancing taxes, and
creating room for notable tax cuts on productive factors would be growth friendly.

2.
At the same time, high public debt left Italy exposed at the eve of the global financial
crisis and limited fiscal space to respond to shocks. Public debt was around 100 percent of GDP
both at the time of euro accession and at the eve of the global financial crisis, and has since climbed
to almost 133 percent of GDP, the second highest in the euro zone. High debt and structural
rigidities exacerbated the impact of the global financial crisis and restricted Italy’s ability to cope
with its fallout. Output contracted sharply by 9 percent during 2007–14, and the recession lasted
longer than Italy’s European peers (Figure 1). The decline was especially severe in manufacturing,
where the crisis appears to have exacerbated a trend decline in a number of subsectors that started
well before 2007 (Figure 2). Although services have assumed a larger share of the economy,
productivity is generally low and has greatly lagged that of manufacturing. The decline in total
output had attendant implications for bank balance sheets and led nonperforming loans to rise to
18 percent of loans, an overhang that is weighing on the recovery and potential growth.
3.
Notwithstanding efforts to kick-start growth, Italy’s income gap is set to grow further.
Under current staff projections, the economy is not expected to return to its pre-crisis (2007) real
output peak until the mid-2020s. Italy is, thus, likely to experience nearly two lost decades, while its
euro zone partners are projected to grow cumulatively by 20–25 percent. The prospect of relatively
low growth within the euro zone has important

4.
Cognizant of Italy’s complex challenges, the government has been pursuing a range of
important reforms. The list of reform initiatives has been impressive, and includes institutional,
public administration, fiscal, labor market, and banking sector reforms. In particular, the
government’s signature labor market legislation, the Jobs Act, is being implemented. Legislation has
been passed on the reform of cooperative and mutual banks. The insolvency system is being
revised. A framework law on public administration has been approved and some implementing
decrees have been issued. A reform of the state budget is underway. A reform of the education
system has been approved by parliament and is being implemented. Legislation has also been
passed and a constitutional referendum is planned for October on institutional reforms aiming to
facilitate decision making and the transfer of competencies from regions to the center.
5.
There is an urgent need to accelerate and deepen reforms, especially before new
headwinds emerge. Within an incomplete economic and monetary union, there is urgency for Italy
to reduce decisively its exposure to risks. This includes, among other things, ambitious product and
service market reforms to enhance competition and investment; a new wage bargaining framework
to align wages with productivity; insolvency reforms to deal with current nonperforming loans; and
making room for notable cuts in the labor tax wedge while achieving medium-term fiscal targets.
Half-way through Prime Minister Renzi’s term, however, the environment has become more
complicated. A constitutional referendum is planned for October, while general elections must be
held no later than May 2018. The global economy remains unsettled, and euro zone policymakers
grapple with a host of complex challenges, not least the surge in refugees, including those coming
through Italy, the risks of Brexit and Grexit, and criticisms of the euro zone’s fiscal and financial
sector policy frameworks.

NEAR-TERM DEVELOPMENTS
6.
In 2015, the economy started to recover after three years of recession. It expanded by
0.8 percent, buoyed by exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, declining commodity prices,
and improved confidence on the back of the authorities’ reform efforts. Private consumption and
inventory re-stocking were key contributors, while external demand weighed on growth (Figure 3).
7.
However, the recovery is not yet robust. Quarterly growth slowed over the course of 2015
to end the year at a seasonally-adjusted 0.2 percent q-o-q (Figure 4) and picked up slightly to
0.3 percent q-o-q in 2016 Q1.


While the economy continues to expand—industrial production, for instance, rose in April—
other recent high frequency indicators suggest some loss of momentum. Business and the
purchasing managers’ indices declined significantly in May.



The recovery in investment is very slow. Although transportation-related investment rebounded
strongly in recent months and there are tentative signs of stabilization in the construction
sector, the investment ratio remains far below that of key euro zone partners, following the
sharp decline in 2010–14.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

ITALY



After several years that net exports contributed positively to growth, net exports are now a drag
on growth as slowing global demand weighs on exports while imports recover. Real exports are
back to their pre-crisis (2008 Q1) peak, but this is a relatively modest performance compared to
large euro area partners that are 15–25 percent above pre-crisis peaks. The current account and
trade balances remain in surplus, including from favorable commodity prices and more
generally import compression in recent years.



Inflation is very low. Headline is back in negative territory since February owing in part to the
decline in oil prices but also subdued demand (as seen in low core inflation). Long-term
inflation expectations are still significantly below the ECB’s objective, despite recent actions.



Labor market indicators have been broadly improving, but labor market conditions are still
challenging. Unemployment declined to 11.7 percent at end 2015 (from a peak of 13.1 percent
in November 2014). However, long-term unemployment remains high at close to 60 percent of
unemployed persons; youth unemployment is above 35 percent; and female labor force
participation remains relatively low. Regional differences are sizable. In a positive development,
job creation picked up recently among those in the 50–64 year age group and the share of
workers in new permanent contracts is up notably.1 Nonetheless, skilled young Italians are
increasingly emigrating abroad, which also weighs on potential growth.

Overall lending conditions are subdued. Credit to households has been growing modestly, but
credit to the corporate sector has continued to decline and is about 11 percent lower than five
years ago, despite the decline in real lending rates to SMEs. Recent bank surveys suggest an
incipient improvement in both the supply of and demand for credit, although more granular
data show that this is the case for larger and healthier firms.

and further capital requirements were imposed on a few specific banks. Nevertheless, reflecting
concerns about the speed of dealing with the NPL overhang and weak profitability in a period
of very low interest rates, Italian banks have come under intense market pressure, losing over
40 percent of their market value this year.

Four small troubled banks, accounting for about 1 percent of system-wide deposits, were
resolved in late November 2015, before the stricter bail-in requirement under the Bank
Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) came into effect at the start of 2016.2 The authorities
implemented a limited bail-in of equity and subordinated debt and spared senior bondholders.
However, in the face of significant social pressures as nearly half of the €0.8 billion of
subordinated debt that was bailed in was held by retail investors, a fund has been set up by
other banks to compensate a large number of retail investors.

Fiscal policy continues to be expansionary to support growth (Figure 6).
The government tightened the fiscal stance considerably during the crisis to register a peak
structural primary surplus of 4.1 percent of GDP in 2013, among the highest in the euro zone.
Since then, fiscal policy has been eased, and is set to ease further in 2016, with the structural
primary surplus projected to decline to 2.6 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the overall deficit is
projected to decline to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2016 (from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2012–13) with
the sizable interest savings of more than 1 percent of GDP largely offset by the fiscal relaxation
(Fund advice had been to use the interest windfall to reduce debt). Debt continued to increase
to 132.7 percent of GDP at end-2015.

unpopular real estate tax on primary residences (home ownership rates are high). Additional
revenues were sought through, e.g., a voluntary disclosure scheme and gaming revenues.

Italy’s competitiveness has suffered from stagnant productivity and rising labor costs.
As detailed in Annex I, Italy’s external position as of 2015 was broadly consistent but likely still
weaker than suggested by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. From an
average deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP in the 2000s, the current account moved into balance in 2013
and, by 2015, registered a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP, driven by a growing trade surplus, helped
by lower commodity prices (Figure 7). Nonetheless, the 2015 cyclically-adjusted current account
surplus was about 0–2 percent of GDP weaker than justified by fundamentals and appropriate
policies. From a savings-investment perspective, the steady rise of the current account since 2010 is
related mainly to the decline in investment as both the corporate and the public sector deleveraged.
Competitiveness has suffered from stagnant productivity and rising labor costs, leading to a gradual
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) since Italy’s joining the euro zone both in
absolute terms and relative to the euro zone average. In 2015, the fall in the value of the euro
contributed to a sizable depreciation of the REER, bringing its value close to 1999 levels. Taking into
account a broad range of indicators and model-based estimates of the REER gap for 2015, staff
considers that a real effective depreciation of 0–10 percent—supported by structural reforms—
would be appropriate to restore competitiveness.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.

Growth is expected to be modest in 2016–17 and over the longer term.



Real GDP growth is projected at 1.1 percent in 2016 and about 1¼ percent in 2017–18,
supported by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and continued low oil prices. The
measures contained in the 2016 budget are estimated to boost growth by about 0.3 percent in
2016 and 2017. Investment is expected to pick up gradually, financed largely by firms’ retained
earnings and modest credit provision by the banking sector. However, bank financing could
become a binding constraint to a further pickup in investment, unless strong progress is made
in restoring corporate and bank balance sheet health. Weak external demand is also expected
to weigh on net exports.



Backloaded fiscal consolidation according to the authorities’ plans would result in a decline in
real GDP growth in 2019–21 to around 0.8 percent. Beyond that, growth of around 0.8 percent
is projected in the steady state, including a dividend on structural reforms of about 0.3 percent
per year over the medium to long term, in line with the authorities’ estimate. Absent reforms,
staff estimates potential growth of around ½ percent, which reflects crisis legacies such as the
collapse in investment as well as unfavorable demographics and slow productivity growth that
predates the crisis.



As the output gap closes, inflation will rise gradually, yet slower than that of Italy’s euro zone
partners owing to a projected productivity differential. Relatively low nominal growth is
expected to slow the pace at which Italy is able to grow out of its crisis legacies and structural
vulnerabilities, leaving it exposed to adverse shocks.

12.
Risks are tilted to the downside. Risks are manifold and interconnected (see Risk
Assessment Matrix).


Upside risks relate to better-than-anticipated effects of monetary and fiscal easing, strong
implementation of structural reforms, larger-than-expected lagged impact of euro depreciation,
and a sustained period of low global energy prices.



Downside risks, on the other hand, arise from delays in addressing bank asset quality;
intensified global financial market volatility, including from Brexit; the global trade slowdown
weighing on exports; and the refugee influx and security threats that could further complicate
policy making. Setbacks in the reform process could weigh on investment and undermine
sentiment, which could result in stagnation.



If downside risks were to materialize, regional and global spillovers could be significant given
Italy’s systemic weight. In this regard, efforts by the Italian authorities to address decisively the
low productivity, high public debt, and bank balance sheet vulnerabilities are of paramount
importance. At the same time, efforts at the European level should continue to strengthen the
euro zone’s architecture (see staff report for the Article IV consultation on euro area policies).

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is
the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” (green) is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” (orange) a probability between 10 and 30 percent,
and “high” (red) a probability between 30 and 50 percent). For the severity if realized, green denotes a positive impact, yellow a negative impact, and red a severe negative impact. The RAM reflects
staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

There is broad agreement with the authorities on the near-term outlook and the longterm challenges facing the Italian economy. Real growth projections in 2016–17 are largely
aligned (text table), although the authorities expect the GDP deflator and thus nominal growth to be
somewhat higher. They consider the resilience of the economy to have improved as a result of the
ongoing reforms. They agreed that a further pickup in investment is critical to a sustained recovery
and, in that regard, viewed the slowdown in external demand and its potential impact on investment
as a key downside risk. Other

noted that, in view of the substantial
output decline during the crisis, the output gap remains large, and considered the common EU
methodology to result in too small of a gap. As discussed in detail in subsequent sections, views
differed on the policies to address some of the underlying challenges.
14.
There is also broad agreement on the external sector assessment. The authorities
emphasized the importance of structural reforms in lifting potential output and improving Italy’s
competitiveness. They consider the price-elasticity of exports to have declined over the past twenty
years—hence, the impact on exports of euro depreciation has been lower than expected—while
sluggish external demand has also weighed on export performance in the near term. They cautioned
against relying on labor-based indicators of competitiveness, which show a wider competitiveness
gap than other price-based measures, as they consider these may underestimate Italian firms’
capacity to compete. Italy has the second largest manufacturing sector in Europe and the seventh
globally, although staff notes that manufacturing has suffered significantly (Figure 2).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The discussions focused on policies to deliver stronger and more inclusive growth
while strengthening buffers. Even with the benefit of exceptionally accommodative monetary
policy, notably easier fiscal policy, relatively low global commodity prices, and the launch of
important reforms, growth is expected to remain relatively modest, public debt very high, and
financial sector vulnerabilities elevated in the near to medium-term.
16.
Substantial progress must therefore be made in addressing these challenges. The
authorities are keen to stay the course, prioritizing growth, including through fiscal accommodation,
and avoiding exacerbating financial deleveraging, not least because a step up in growth could
facilitate bank balance sheet cleanup and lower the debt burden. Yet, unless growth increases
notably, such a strategy could well leave a greater risk of a future procyclical tightening in the event
of adverse shocks. Staff suggested that consideration be given to deeper structural reforms and a
pro-growth fiscal policy mix that can create space for earlier fiscal adjustment and stronger financial
sector policies. This will help build buffers faster, and any impact on near-term growth would be
compensated by stronger resilience to shocks and a higher growth payoff in the medium term.

A. Structural Reforms
17.
Sustained implementation of reforms and broadening of the effort in three priority
areas are key to raising growth. Reform efforts in the past few years have built on a host of earlier
initiatives. In the last two decades, for instance, there have been about five important labor market
reforms, three public administration reforms, three education system reforms, and numerous
justice reforms. However, reforms were generally piecemeal and implementation lagged, with the
overall economic results being less than desired. Thus, sustained and full implementation of the
current reform efforts is critical. In addition, further efforts are needed in three mutually reinforcing
areas: product and service markets, which have the potential to yield near- and longer-term growth
dividends (World Economic Outlook, April 2016); public administration to improve the quality of
services, enhance efficiency, and lower costs to business and investment; and a wage bargaining
system to align wages with productivity, improve competitiveness, and complement the Jobs Act.

Product and Service Market Reforms
18.
Regulatory rigidities and barriers to competition remain significant in certain sectors.
Key problems are concentrated in network industries (e.g., energy and transport), professional
services (e.g., legal, notaries, and pharmaceutical), and the provision of local public services.
Together these services account for about one-third of the total value added in the economy and
about 30 percent of household’s final consumption, and contribute about 40 percent of input to
other sectors’ output. The Monti government introduced several reforms in 2011–12, aimed at
reducing entry barriers in several non-tradable sectors, removing unnecessary regulation of
economic activities, and improving the business environment through administrative simplification.
Although de jure measures of competition improved, business perceptions of de facto barriers to
competition remain considerable. Analysis by staff suggests potentially sizable gains from product
and service market reforms, especially when coupled with public sector reforms (Box 1).
19.
Parliament has been debating the Annual Competition Law for over a year. Although
the government is required to present to parliament a draft law on enhancing competition on an
annual basis since 2009, such a law has not yet been approved. The current draft includes some
recommendations of the competition authority and proposes measures aimed at addressing
regulatory barriers to entry and competition in the insurance, postal, communications,
pharmaceutical, electricity, gas and fuel distribution sectors and further liberalization of professional
services (notaries, lawyers, architects and engineers). However, on the back of pressure from vested
interests, many provisions of the draft law have been weakened during the parliamentary
discussions—in particular, related to the insurance sector and professional services, such as notaries,
lawyers, and pharmacies.
20.
Bold steps to open up professions and services to competition can have immediate
payoff. Strengthening the draft law in line with the recommendations of the competition authority
and ensuring an annual process of adopting pro-competition laws would be critical to their

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ITALY

effectiveness. Going forward, consideration should be given to enhancing competition in other
areas, including:


Provision of local public services. Given the impact of public sector inefficiency on firm
productivity (Box 1), enhancing competition in local public service provision would be critical to
tackling rent seeking and could yield sizable economic benefits. The competition authority has
provided specific proposals, such as liberalizing local transport and waste collection, while past
spending reviews outlined a proposal to significantly rationalize local public companies over
three years, with the goal of improving efficiency and the quality of services offered.



Retail, transport, and permits. Italy’s retail sector remains one of the most regulated in Europe
according to the OECD product market regulation indicators, and even measures legislated to
liberalize certain aspects of this sector have been poorly implemented by regional authorities.
Large-surface retail outlets remain subject to special rules, especially concerning new openings;
incumbents are excessively protected from new entrants; and restrictions on promotions,
discounts, and below-cost sales are very severe. There is also substantial scope for further
liberalization in electricity generation (hydroelectric power plants), radio spectrum frequencies,
local public transport and taxis, ports and airports. Competition in a number of sectors is
hindered by permit schemes, and service providers are given the right to use public
infrastructure for long periods with no competitive procedures. As these are essential inputs to
production, enhancing competition should raise growth.

21.
The authorities agreed with the critical importance of enhancing competition in
product and service markets. They expect the current draft Annual Competition Law to be
adopted by mid-2016, and concurred that there is scope to strengthen the current draft law in a
number of areas, including in legal and professional services. In that regard, the government
submitted the National Plan for Professional Reform in February 2016, with a view to implementing
the European Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications. Other areas such as
communications, healthcare, transport and other public services are expected to be tackled in future
annual competition laws, and be linked to the reform of the public administration.

Box 1. The Impact of Product Market Reforms on Firm Productivity in Italy
While Italy has made some progress in liberalizing its product markets in recent years, business
perception of barriers to competition remains unfavorable. According to the OECD Product Market
Regulation indicators, Italy was the sixth least regulated economy as
Product Market Regulation, 2013
of 2013 among the 31 OECD economies for which this indicator

such as road transportation and retail, it remains heavily regulated.
However, the World Bank’s Doing Business indicator paints a very

firm-level data from Italy over 2003–13 from the Orbis
database by Bureau van Dijk, OECD product market measures of regulation (PMR), and Italy’s input-output
matrix, it tries to address three questions: (1) did the performance of previously regulated sectors improve as
barriers to competition were removed? (2) what was the impact on downstream industries, which use the
output of regulated network industries as inputs in their production function? And (3) how is the response to
liberalization shaped by government efficiency?

Reforms that raise competition in product market can affect the economy in two ways. First,
deregulation is expected to affect firms in the regulated sectors themselves, through the usual effects of
competition on growth. Greater competitive pressures could lead to reallocation of output across
heterogeneous firms, as inefficient firms exit, and/or induce firms to innovate and adopt new technologies,
thereby raising sectoral productivity. This effect by itself could be important as regulated industries account
for close to 30 percent of Italy’s GDP. Second, higher competition, which may lead to lower mark-ups,
greater availability of services and higher quality products and services, could benefit firms that use the
output of regulated industries as inputs. These are the so-called downstream effects. This is another
quantitatively important channel as regulated sectors account for about 30 percent of total inputs in the
Italian economy, according to Italy’s input-output matrix.
There is evidence of a positive association between deregulation in network sectors and value added
and productivity of firms in these sectors. For instance, a one-standard deviation improvement in the
PMR is associated with 3 percent relatively higher growth in sales, 10 percent relatively larger firms (in terms
of output), and 4.7 percent relatively higher value added per worker. Firms using outputs from network
sectors as production inputs also benefit. Upon deregulation of network sectors, those firms that use
regulated inputs more intensely increase their size and productivity relatively more.
There is also evidence of complementarity between better quality of public services and product
market deregulation. In provinces with more efficiently provided public services, the positive association
between deregulation and firm performance in previously regulated sectors is significantly stronger. For
instance, a one-standard-deviation improvement in the PMR is associated with a 0.3 percent increase in
output for a firm in a province in the upper quartile of government efficiency, but only 0.1 percent for a firm
in a province in the lower quartile of government efficiency.

World Bank’s Doing Business indicators for 2016, for instance, it takes 1,120 days to enforce a
contract, 227 days to obtain a construction permit, and 124 days to get an electricity connection,
substantially longer than the OECD average. Weak public sector performance can be attributed to
several factors, notably, excessively long and burdensome bureaucratic procedures, overlapping
competences and intra-institutional conflicts, and the lack of administrative capacity, including an
aging workforce and skill-job mismatches (e.g., the agency for collective bargaining for the public
administration found skills mismatches in one-third of positions studied). The average length of a
tendering procedure is 210 days, compared to an EU average of 77.4 days, while the number of
single-bid contracts that are awarded is close to one third. This adds to a perception of corruption
as a widespread phenomenon. The number of local public enterprises has proliferated to more than
8,000, against the backdrop of a complex framework and direct awarding of service contracts with
no open tender. In many areas, local service provision is dominated by monopolies assigned to
companies owned by or related to local governments. There are also notable regional differences.
23.
An enabling law was approved in August 2015. It foresees reforms to simplify procedures,
streamline and accelerate decision making, rationalize local public enterprises, and improve the
recruitment and management of staff, among others. A set of legislative decrees was proposed for
discussion by the government in January 2016, and is in the process of being implemented. Others
are planned for later this year. A reform of procurement is underway, including through centralizing
purchasing power to about 35 bodies, down from tens of thousands. A new framework aims to
systematically regulate state-owned enterprises in line with the principles of efficient management,
protection of competition and reduced public expenditure, and with an enhanced oversight role for
the Court of Auditors. New provisions clarify that state-owned enterprises are subject to the
bankruptcy legislation. However, state-owned giants such as Eni, Enel, Finmeccanica, Poste Italiane,
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Ferrovie, and Rai are left outside the perimeter of rationalization. The
government plans to implement stricter rules for disciplinary firing of public sector workers.
24.
Timely implementation and follow-up are key, and several challenges would need to
be tackled as part of successfully modernizing the public administration. These include
improving the skill-mix in the public sector, matching positions with skills, and aligning wages with
productivity; accelerating court processes to ensure timely enforcement, including by the public
administration of laws (Box 2); tackling privileges and employment in public enterprises, including
through privatization; ensuring most products at all levels of government are covered under
rationalized procurement procedures; and further strengthening anti-corruption efforts, particularly
by implementing AML/CFT measures on domestic politically exposed persons.
25.
The authorities intend to complete the legislative process by end-2016. While agreeing
that completing the transformation of the public administration will take time and will require full
and timely implementation of the reforms as well as constant monitoring, the authorities expressed
optimism about the efficiency-enhancing impact of the reforms. They noted that, in the context of
the 2016 stability law, a broader range of public administrations and local governments is required
18

ITALY

to purchase through centralized procurement bodies and use benchmark pricing. They broadly
agreed with the assessment and identification of priorities on justice and insolvency reforms.

Box 2. Civil Justice Reforms
Reform of the court system is essential to ensure enforcement in a timely manner, including
implementation of laws. An over-burdened court system is a hindrance to efficient resource allocation.
This includes ensuring the public administration implements legislative decrees. Despite incremental
reforms, Italy has one of the slowest court systems in the adjudication of civil and commercial disputes in the
EU. According to the European Justice Scoreboard 2016, only Malta, Portugal and Cyprus have less efficient
systems for the resolution of civil and commercial cases. Civil or commercial cases are resolved in first
instance on average in more than 500 days from the start of the process. Appeals can multiply that by more
than three times to around six years.
The government is adopting actions to increase the quality of the judicial system and reduce the
backlog of cases. These include promoting alternative dispute resolution techniques, reinforcing the
auxiliary staff of the courts with personnel from other parts of the public sector, and introducing better
information technology. The development of court performance indicators and best practices (Project
Strasbourg 2.0) aims to reduce the gap between the best managed courts and those that are
underperforming, which however represent a majority in certain geographical areas.
The reform of the appeal system needs to be a priority. Consideration should be given to rationalizing
the type of cases that reach the Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione). The enterprise courts should be
further strengthened. The specialization afforded by the enterprise courts should translate into a more
efficient commercial justice in a variety of cases, including corporate litigation and insolvency cases.
Recent reforms to reduce the time for enforcement of secured claims are important steps.1 These
reforms—including the enforcement of commercial secured credit and the introduction of new forms of
security interests over movable assets—should reduce the inflow of NPLs by improving the position of
creditors and the realization of collateral. Effective introduction of the electronic civil procedure (processo
civile telematico) should reduce the time for enforcement of unsecured credit. Reforms of the law of secured
transactions should improve the legal environment of credit, increasing the possibility of creating security
interests over movable assets. However, many important technical details remain to be solved, including the
creation of an efficient, notice-based registry, and the transposition into law of the measures announced in
early May also requires special attention to a number of technical issues in the implementation of the new
contracts and security interests.

contract in which protection rises with tenure. As it affects new workers (current workers are
grandfathered), the Act is expected to have its full impact only over the long term.

Going forward, the authorities are keen to implement active labor market policies
(ALMPs). Effective implementation, including through a new National Employment Agency, will
require significant national-regional cooperation on provision of services, sharing of information
over an under-developed infrastructure, enhancing placement capacity, and instituting regular and
coordinated monitoring of service delivery. At the same time, boosting (female) labor force
participation and ensuring that refugees are integrated into the workforce are topical issues that
would improve labor market and economic outcomes (Box 3).

Box 3. Boosting Female Labor Force Participation and Responding to the Refugee Surge
Female labor force participation. A Selected Issues Paper1 examines the scope for increasing the role of
women in the formal economy and the potential benefits of closing gender gaps in the Italian labor market.
Existing studies and evidence from Italian provinces suggest a substantial role for policies, such as removing
fiscal disincentives (lowering the tax wedge) and enhancing the supply of child- and elderly-care services, to
support women’s decisions to enter the labor market. Having more women in the labor force would increase
potential output and paves the way for increased diversity in senior corporate positions, which could bring
added economic benefits. New evidence reported in the SIP from 300,000 firms in Italy suggests that the
higher presence of women in senior corporate position is tied to stronger corporate profitability, particularly
in sectors with larger shares of women in the labor force and with higher demand for creativity and
innovative capacity.

Refugee surge. The authorities estimate that about 270,000 refugees are expected to reach Italy in 2016,
much higher than last year, and have been considering urgent action, e.g., to establish new asylum centers.
As identified in a recent Staff Discussion Note,2 policies can help open up the refugees’ path to the labor
market, reduce the net fiscal cost, and counter some of the adverse fiscal effects of population aging, e.g.,
minimizing restrictions on taking up work during the asylum application phase; to the extent feasible,
strengthening targeting of ALMPs to refugees, e.g., wage subsidies to private employers; easing avenues to
self employment (including access to credit); facilitating skill recognition; lowering barriers to
entrepreneurship; reducing restrictions on geographical mobility (including those linked to housing); and
improving education policies. Most of these policies have broad application to Italy’s labor market.

The authorities are confident that the Jobs Act will bring about important changes to
the labor market, and concurred on the need for more decentralized bargaining. They pointed
to the positive effect of the Jobs Act that are already reflected in the labor statistics. They remain
committed to strengthening ALMPs to decrease the duration of unemployment, and expect the
National Employment Agency to reach its potential once the forthcoming constitutional reform
shifts responsibility for the management and specific design of ALMPs from regions to the center.
They noted that the 2016 Stability Law incentivizes firm-level bargaining through tax relief on
productivity wage components and non-monetary compensations. While the expiration of several
central contracts is an opportunity for such improvements, they were concerned, however, about the
potential locking in of current low inflation expectations into wage bargaining contracts.

B. Financial Sector Policies
31.
Effectively addressing the enormous financial sector challenges is of paramount
importance, given the ramifications for the financial system and economic activity.


Non-financial corporates account for almost two-thirds of bank NPLs, a large fraction of which
are subject to enforcement. Closing unviable enterprises and rehabilitating viable enterprises
that need a fresh start would unlock capital for lending to healthier firms and sectors. However,
neither is likely to proceed apace, unless long court processes are substantially shortened and
weak bank profitability is addressed. There is also a notable pricing gap between the market
value of NPLs and those on the banks’ books.



Weak profitability, related to high NPLs, compressed interest margins, and elevated operating
costs, hinders a timely repair of balance sheets through retained earnings. Although ECB
actions are helping improve funding conditions, calculations based on publicly available data
for the 15 largest banks suggest that, at current lending rates and funding costs, a number of
smaller banks are likely to face profitability challenges (Box 4) and thus may continue to
deleverage. Measures to lower NPLs and curtail operating expenses, including through bank
consolidation, are critical.



At the same time, as a matter of principle, alongside efforts to strengthen individual banks,
the effective use of the framework for the prompt resolution of failing banks is needed.
Delayed or reactive resolution can exacerbate uncertainty and destroy value for individual
banks and the system as a whole. Indeed, unless asset quality and profitability problems are
addressed in a timely manner, lingering problems of weaker banks can eventually weigh on the
rest of the system.

32.
The authorities are implementing a multi-pronged approach, including legal and
insolvency reforms, a framework for bank consolidation, and other measures.


Legal measures. Recent measures include insolvency reforms to shorten the duration of
procedures and increase both the survival rates of distressed enterprises and creditors’ recovery
values, civil procedure measures to strengthen debt enforcement, an out-of-court mechanism
for the enforcement of secured credit over immovable assets in commercial loans, and flexible
forms of security interests over enterprise assets. These positive changes will require proper
implementation, including adequate judicial infrastructure and registration systems.



Consolidation and governance reform. To spur much needed consolidation in Italy’s highly
fragmented banking system that comprises about 640 banks, the authorities passed legislation
to transform the governance structure of the larger cooperative (popolare) banks (March 2015)
and of the smaller cooperative (mutual) banks (February 2016). The largest popolare banks must
be transformed into joint stock companies by end 2016. So far, one potential merger—between
Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano—has been announced that, once completed,
would create the third largest banking group in Italy. Mutual banks must consolidate under
joint-stock (holding) companies with at least €1 billion in equity in 18 months.

Box 4. Banks’ Profitability Challenge1

Lending Rate (percent)

A bottom-up analysis of the 15 largest Italian banks suggests that—absent strong reforms—a number

high NPLs) and high operating costs. Staff calculated the net

fund sufficient loan loss reserves ex post. Put differently, credit
risk turned out to be underpriced; if credit conditions reflected
subsequent loan performance, the rise of NPLs (and resultant
provisioning needs) would have implied a higher lending rate for
banks to maintain their profitability.
Credit easing would improve overall bank profitability
without materially altering the negative earnings outlook for
a number of smaller banks. In a sensitivity analysis, all Italian
banks are assumed to participate in the ECB’s TLTRO II as of June
2016 and—in an extreme assumption—cease to remunerate
deposits, reducing their average funding cost of currently about
1.5 percent to the ECB’s marginal refinancing rate of zero. At the
same time, their lending rates are considered fully variable and
adjust in response to the recent decline of the marginal policy
rate (i.e., the ECB’s deposit rate) and the historical pass-through
of term premia to NIMs. Under these very favorable funding
terms, overall system profitability would improve, assuming
sufficient loan demand. Even so, one-third of banks in the
sample could still face profitability challenges, which may not be
solved through higher loan growth.

Other initiatives. In early 2016, the authorities set aside previous plans for a system-wide bad
bank following an inability to agree with the EC on addressing state-aid concerns, and instead
launched or supported initiatives to backstop capital issuances of banks and facilitate NPL
securitization. Further, the Bank of Italy is helping create an NPL information center to
encourage private non-bank participation in the market for NPLs.
o

GACS. This mechanism seeks to provide government guarantees for the securitization of
NPLs. Under GACS, banks can move their bad loans at market values into special purpose
vehicles for their eventual sale to markets. They can buy public guarantees for the senior
tranches of securities issued against these bad loans, as long as these tranches are rated as
investment grade. No state aid is expected, since the fees paid by the banks for the public
guarantees should cover expected costs. Staff agrees with the authorities that it will have at
best a marginal impact on the large gap between the price of NPLs on banks’ books and
their market price. Banks expressed cautious optimism, with some indicating they intend to
create vehicles involving GACS, although none has yet been finalized.

o

Atlante. In April 2016, to prevent the failure of capital increases by smaller banks, Italy’s
largest banks together with nonbank financial institutions and banking foundations created
a fund that, so far, has raised €4.25 billion. The aim was to backstop capital increases of
banks and possibly purchase non-investment grade tranches of NPL securitizations (so as
to reduce the pricing gap between what banks are willing to sell at and those sought by
investors). In the event, capital raising by Banco Popolare di Vicenza failed to attract private
investors’ interest in May 2016, and Atlante invested €1.5 billion, taking over 99 percent
stake in the bank. The announced capital increase by Banca Veneto is an important test of
the ability to attract sufficient private sector support in bank recapitalization and avoid the
need for Atlante to invest in these banks.

Resolution framework. With the bail-in provisions of the BRRD taking effect from the start of
2016, retail investors are likely to be impacted if any future resolutions were to occur (Box 5).
Retail holdings in Italy are relatively large compared to other countries, comprising about onethird of about €600 billion worth of bank bonds and half of about €60 billion worth of
subordinated bonds. The authorities are very concerned about social and potential confidence
effects of resolutions, however, particularly given the social backlash that followed the limited
burden sharing in the four small banks resolved in November 2015. Thus, except in the case of
very small banks, it is not clear to staff whether and how the current resolution framework will
be implemented. That said, delaying resolution in cases of unviable banks can be costly.3

Bridge banks were created for the four small banks that were resolved in November 2015, owing to the shortage of
time and concerns related to European state aid rules. However, the creation of bridge banks is nonstandard for nonsystemic institutions and invariably more expensive than the standard purchase and assumption operation.

As an illustration, if a resolution is needed under
current rules, it would likely entail bail-in of junior
and senior creditors. Staff calculations based on publicly
available data from SnL show that, for the majority of the
15 largest Italian banks, the 8 percent minimum
requirement would currently imply bail-in of retail
investors of subordinated debt. For about two-thirds of
the number of banks in the sample, losses would also be
imposed on some senior debt holders. These calculations
are just an example of the current liability structure of the
largest banks and are not an assessment of viability. In a
resolution case, presumably the banks’ own funds
(capital) would have shrunk further, which would mean
that bail in of 8 percent of liabilities would push deeper
into senior debt. This example points to the importance of
proactive measures to ensure banks’ viability.

40

Smallest 5

Italian households hold significant amounts of senior
bank bonds and subordinated debt in their portfolios.
While these holdings have been declining over time as a
result of changes in their tax treatment and the low yield
environment, they are still high. Households hold about
one-third of senior bank debt and almost half of total
subordinated bank debt. According to the Bank of Italy,
about 50 percent of senior retail bonds will mature in 2017
and only a small amount will be left by 2020, assuming
that banks find alternative sources of financing.

The bail-in tool of the BRRD has been operational
in Italy since January 1, 2016. This requires bail-in of
at least 8 percent of total liabilities as a pre-condition
for availing resolution funds. The liabilities subject to
bail in are capital instruments, then subordinated debt,
and subsequently uncovered bank bonds and other
senior liabilities. Deposits can be bailed in only for the
part exceeding €100,000. Italian law goes beyond
BRRD by establishing full depositor preference over
unsecured senior debt from January 1, 2019. Between
January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018, uninsured
deposits rank pari-passu with senior debt, unless the
resolution authorities decide otherwise.

A more ambitious and proactive approach can enhance the authorities’ strategy in
effectively repairing the banking system. The financial sector remains subject to risks, as a
number of banks may continue to find it difficult to generate sufficient profits to bolster capital,
write-off bad debts, and finance new credit. Buffers to cope with shocks are very limited. In this
regard, it is not evident that the banking system is durably ahead of its problems. Thus, the
emphasis needs to be on a comprehensive framework that facilitates and supports strategies for
NPL workouts, procedures for timely bank restructuring and insolvency, and a coordinated approach
to banking system consolidation.




26

Advancing insolvency reforms. Recent reforms to accelerate debt enforcement actions represent
a welcome development, although their impact is only likely to be realized over time as they
gradually improve the legal environment for credit.
o

Distressed enterprises need a streamlined and flexible system of out-of-court and in-court
restructuring options, with fast-track solutions for the existing stock of NPLs. In this regard,
debt restructuring principles for multilateral workouts and adoption of a triage approach
for indebted firms would be important additions to the restructuring toolkit.

o

Enterprise courts with insolvency competences, qualified insolvency administrators, and
adoption of best practices by courts across Italy would notably enhance implementation.

o

The systematization underway (the Rordorf Commission) also offers an opportunity to
address outstanding issues, including integrating recent reforms into a coherent insolvency
and creditor rights framework, incorporating special insolvency procedures for large
companies, introducing effective incentives for early treatment of distressed firms, and
rationalizing creditor priorities.

Accelerating NPL resolution. The Bank of Italy is implementing a new NPL reporting framework
by end 2016.
o

Banks should be required to present comprehensive NPL strategies with ambitious targets
to significantly reduce NPLs over the medium term (including through more effective
internal workout procedures, outsourcing to external servicers, joint ventures, and sales).
Best practice elements of such strategies include separating NPLs from usual credit
management, developing a comprehensive suite of loan restructuring tools, and requiring
enhanced management and board of directors’ focus on the NPL strategy.

o

As NPL management is highly specialized, a dedicated expert team in the Bank of Italy
could critically review banks’ NPL strategies, provide comprehensive feedback on their
implementation, and require urgent mitigation in areas where shortfalls are identified.
Guidance should also be provided on banks’ approaches to provisioning and loan
restructuring practices.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

o

Consideration could also be given to time-bound tax incentives to encourage accelerated
workouts and remove bad debt and real estate assets from balance sheets. Moreover,
private asset management companies could be encouraged to pool NPLs from the smaller
banks that lack the resources or capacity to manage them.



Supervisory encouragement and oversight of consolidation. Given the large number of operating
banks, consolidation can be an important route toward a more efficient banking system,
particularly for weaker banks. The emerging banking groups need to be assessed ex ante as
sound from capital, assets, management, earnings and liquidity perspectives. This would result
in a healthier and more vibrant banking system. In that regard, subjecting banks that are not
under the supervision of the SSM to a process of capital assessment following an asset quality
review would clarify uncertainty, with follow-up actions in line with regulatory requirements.
The supervisor should set clearer expectations of the bank consolidation process including in
terms of viability and time-bound operational cost reductions, while banks’ business models
need to become more efficient through streamlining branch networks and exploiting other
synergies realized through consolidation.



Atlante. Atlante’s recent intervention helped preserve financial stability. It is not a game
changer, particularly given its limited resources, but has bought time for measures to place
weaker banks on a sounder footing. It is important, therefore, that timely and effective progress
is made, as otherwise it would impose a burden on the profitability of participating banks. In
this regard, although Atlante is privately run, supervisors should ensure that banks’ future
investments are based solely on commercial considerations, and the use of funds is tied with
strict governance improvements in the banks they invest in. This is especially so if Atlante is to
be scaled up or if similar initiatives are launched for future capital backstops or investing in
NPLs (the resources currently available are unlikely to notably impact NPL pricing). Foreign
investor participation could be encouraged. There should also be a clear requirement to
dispose assets (bank equity or junior tranches of NPL securities) in a timely manner.



Prompt resolution of unviable banks. The political concern of bailing in retail investors is a
barrier to the application of the resolution framework. To address concerns about bailing in
retail investors, consideration could be given to (i) identifying and dealing firmly with cases of
mis-selling to retail investors—through application of the relevant penalties on the seller and
remediation measures for the buyer (e.g., structured buy-back or debt exchange programs);
(ii) preventing irregular selling practices to retail customers, such as by strengthening legal and
regulatory safeguards, increasing the quality of information, and improving the effectiveness of
controls; and (iii) safeguarding poor households through a means-tested social safety net that
is a more efficient and better targeted instrument.4 Moreover, central bank liquidity backstops
for viable banks remain the quintessential stabilizer and backstop against contagion.

Italian households are wealthy, with strong balance sheets (stronger than the public sector). Net financial wealth is
twice GDP and net total household wealth is 5½ times GDP, one of the highest among advanced countries.

The authorities were fully aware of the scope of the banking system problems but
stressed that their efforts were the most they could do under the current circumstances and
constraints and will bear fruit over time.


They considered NPLs to be at a turning point, with the flow of new bad debts projected to
decline as the economy recovers.



They stressed that the recent insolvency reforms, together with Atlante and GACS, would
reduce the current high stock of NPLs over time. Moreover, any success by Atlante in reducing
the markups on NPL sales would reduce pricing gaps on bank balance sheets. They thus
emphasized the critical importance of implementing the current measures and supporting
(nominal) growth and strongly cautioned against aggressive NPL reduction that would be
procyclical and undercut growth.



There was agreement on the need for swift market-driven bank consolidation, including
addressing governance and profitability issues with the smaller mutual banks. However, the
authorities were cautious about forcing consolidation, in view of the fragile state of confidence.
They considered that onsite supervision and banks’ own due diligence are adequate safeguards
to ensure the emergence of strong banking groups through bank consolidation.



The authorities strongly felt that the bail-in rules of the BRRD exacerbate systemic risk and that
a longer transition period would have been welcome. They stressed the risks of bail-in as too
high, even from being applied to small institutions, and pointed to the social pressures that
were brought to bear following the burden sharing in the four small institutions of
November 2015 (which was the first time that bail-in occurred in Italy in several decades). In
that regard, they noted that banks themselves had internalized the possible systemic risk
associated with the failure of capital raising by banks, and thus had supported the creation of
Atlante. The authorities also emphasized that European state-aid rules are being applied too
restrictively and inhibiting a less costly restoration of banking sector health that, as it is
financed by private resources, would not be borne by the taxpayers.

C. Fiscal Policy
35.
To support the still weak economy, the authorities are notably easing fiscal policy this
year and backloading adjustment.


Adjustment path. For 2016, the authorities are pursuing a very small deficit reduction, implying
a sizable relaxation of about 0.7 percent of GDP in structural terms.5 No adjustment is planned
in the structural primary balance for 2017, a 0.2 percent adjustment is proposed for 2018, and a
backloaded adjustment of ½ percent for 2019. This path postpones the achievement of
structural balance to 2019–20 (against a previously agreed target of 2018). Debt will remain
high but on a downward trend, relying on the achievement of ambitious privatization proceeds,
which the authorities project at ½ percent of GDP per year over the next three years.



Policy mix. The authorities plan to continue lowering taxes, including on corporate income in
2017 and on personal income in 2018, and cancel planned hikes in VAT and excise rates (i.e.,
the safeguard clause in place to achieve the originally-planned fiscal targets). The latter are
planned to be replaced in part by spending review measures, including a review of tax
expenditures, and measures to improve tax compliance. The authorities noted that, following
considerable cumulative savings in recent years (which they estimate around €25 billion), the
spending reviews will now seek qualitative improvements through more efficient budget
processes and procurement reform. They plan a small increase in capital spending. Proposals
are under consideration for easing the path to early retirement, e.g., through actuarially fair cuts
in pension benefits or bank loans to retirees that capitalize part of their future benefit stream.

clauses (0.25 percent) and, on a preliminary basis, for additional spending related to the refugee emergency
(0.04 percent) and exceptional security measures (0.06 percent). On that basis, the EC has pointed to a risk of some
deviation from Italy’s obligations under the SGP.

To strengthen the credibility of the adjustment and bring debt down more decisively
while supporting the economy, staff recommends a more evenly phased consolidation path,
with space for the upfront cost of reforms. The high debt level makes Italy vulnerable to shifts in
market sentiment and changes in interest rates and leaves very little space to adjust to adverse
shocks. Indeed, although debt is expected to decline very gradually under the baseline, the debt
dynamics are fragile and debt could get back on a rising path under moderate scenarios (Annex II).
With growth stabilizing at around 1–1½ percent in the coming years, and declining thereafter,
greater priority should be given to building buffers by reducing the debt burden, which would have
a stronger impact on confidence and, hence, on growth. In the meantime, should adverse shocks
materialize, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate.


Structural surplus and phasing.
o

For 2017–19, an adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP per year (in the structural primary
balance) would allow rebuilding buffers while not overly taxing growth. Although the size of
multipliers is highly uncertain, for a reasonable range of multipliers encompassing those
used by the authorities,6 the proposed adjustment path would lead to a faster decline in
debt beyond the next two years.

o

In case of clearly defined and bolder reforms, this path could be adjusted to accommodate
their temporary upfront costs. However, it should be noted that not all structural reforms
entail direct and measurable budgetary costs. Thus, general reforms should not be used as
a reason to postpone the needed adjustment.

According to the 2016 DEF, revenue multipliers are 0.2 in the first year, 0.6 in the second year and 0.8 beyond, while
spending multipliers are 1 in the first two years, before declining to 0.3 in year 5. The Bank of Italy estimated fiscal
multipliers to be 0.3 in the first year and 0.5 in the second year (Economic Bulletin, January 2013).
6

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

This path would result in a small structural overall surplus of about ½ percent of GDP by
about 2019. This has been long standing Fund advice and remains appropriate to ensure
debt is on a firmly declining trajectory, while providing valuable insurance against shocks.

o

The sizable relaxation in 2016 provides an opportunity to push ahead with decisive reform
implementation this year, including in the fiscal area. However, unless the authorities are
successful in carrying out these reforms to substantially boost potential growth, the
relaxation entails the risk of a future procyclical tightening.

Pro-growth mix. This fiscal path needs to be supported by a growth-friendly policy mix, giving
greater priority to more efficient and reduced levels of spending, broadening the tax base, and
lowering statutory tax rates on labor and capital.
o

With primary spending having been contained in real terms in recent years, largely through
wage restraint and cuts in capital spending, the “low hanging fruit” have been exhausted.
Achieving the fiscal targets and creating space to notably lower the still high labor tax
wedge requires reducing further primary current spending. This will entail difficult political
choices, including possibly on the high levels of social spending. In that regard, it is
important that any discussion of early retirement options does not reverse the gains from
the 2012 pension reforms or undercut pension sustainability.

o

Broadening the tax base—including by rationalizing the relatively large tax expenditures
and reducing the VAT gap (which is among the highest in the euro zone)—would be steps
in the right direction. A modern real estate tax also should be introduced, as it is a relatively
efficient tax instrument.

The authorities agreed that fiscal policy walks a tightrope between supporting growth
and bringing debt on a clear downward path. Given the weak economic environment and
balance of risks, they considered a more restrictive fiscal policy as potentially counterproductive. In
this regard, they favored postponing the consolidation to a time when the economy would be in a
stronger cyclical position to minimize unduly impacting the recovery. In the meantime, they
expected ambitious privatization proceeds to result in a small decline in the debt ratio in 2016 and a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

ITALY

balanced budget over the medium term adequate to bring debt down. More generally, they
questioned the focus on structural fiscal adjustment, given the challenges in measuring the
output gap.
38.
The authorities noted that they plan to continue reducing the tax burden on
households and firms. Having kept spending under control for several years, they intend to
continue doing so. The main goal is to increase spending efficiency and the quality of public
services, with the procurement, public administration, and state budget reforms important in that
regard. They are also seeking to broaden the tax base, including through emphasis on voluntary
compliance and reviewing of tax expenditures. Given its unpopularity, they do not intend to
introduce a real estate tax on primary residences.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The economy continues to emerge from a protracted recession. Buoyed by exceptionally
accommodative monetary policy, supportive fiscal policy, low commodity prices, and improved
confidence on the back of reforms, the economy is projected to grow by 1.1 percent this year. This
outcome is welcome, although insufficient to make a notable dent in accumulated crisis legacies.
Unemployment has started to come down, but remains very high. NPLs appear to be stabilizing, but
are around 18 percent of loans. Public debt has edged up marginally to close to 133 percent of GDP.
40.
The recovery is likely to be fragile and prolonged. Risks are to the downside. With
financial sector and fiscal buffers being very limited, the recovery is vulnerable to shocks and
expected to be modest. Even after adding a growth dividend from the timely implementation of
reforms in line with the authorities’ expectations, growth is projected to rise to 1¼ percent in 2017–
18 and about 0.8 percent per year over the medium term. This growth outlook, alongside prolonged
low inflation, implies a potentially protracted period of balance sheet repair. It also implies that Italy
is expected to return to its pre-crisis output peak only in about a decade; over the same period,
Italy’s euro zone partners are expected to rise by 20–25 percent above their pre-crisis peaks. Within
an incomplete economic and monetary union, Italy would fall further behind, with potential
implications for its competitiveness within the euro zone.
41.
The authorities thus face a monumental challenge. The recovery needs to be
strengthened to reduce the high unemployment faster and buffers need to be built, including by
repairing strained bank balance sheets and decisively lowering the very high public debt. This
requires deep reforms to transform the economy and enable Italy to catch up to two decades of
productivity underperformance, alongside prudent fiscal policy and financial sector reforms. This is a
multi-year effort, and broad and sustained political support for comprehensive reforms—through
multiple electoral cycles—will be critical for success. In this regard, political pressures to dilute or
delay implementation of reforms should be resisted firmly.
42.
Cognizant of Italy’s complex challenges and risks, the authorities have embarked on a
range of very important reforms. Their efforts span institutional, public administration, fiscal, labor

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

market, and banking sector reforms. In particular, the government’s signature labor market
legislation, the Jobs Act, is being implemented; legislation has been passed on the reform of
cooperative and mutual banks; the insolvency system is being revised; a framework law on public
administration has been approved and some implementing decrees have been issued; a reform of
the state budget is underway; and legislation has been passed and a constitutional referendum is
planned to streamline decision making and transfer competencies from regions to the center.
43.
These efforts are welcome and now need to be implemented fully and deepened to
have a decisive impact. Steadfast and full implementation of existing efforts is necessary to break
from past experiences where legislation was approved but implementation lagged. However, current
reform efforts are often the result of numerous constraints and balancing considerations that
diminish their effectiveness. They would reduce vulnerabilities only gradually over the medium term,
implying limited buffers to cope with shocks for a protracted period. It is thus a matter of urgency to
broaden and deepen reforms. This urgency is accentuated by the limited progress in completing the
economic and monetary union. The start of economic recovery and the current favorable tailwinds
of monetary easing, low commodity prices and fiscal support provide scope to front-load financial,
fiscal, and structural measures. These complementary efforts can be mutually-reinforcing: boosting
growth could lower the upfront cost of reforms and create room for more ambitious measures to
build buffers and accelerate growth.
44.
Deeper structural reforms could bear near- to medium-term growth dividends. In
particular, enhancing competition in the product and services markets—by adopting bold reforms in
the context of the annual competition law—has the potential to boost growth and investment in the
near as well as medium terms. The focus in the labor markets should now turn to modernizing the
wage bargaining system—by broadening the scope for firms, specifically smaller enterprises as well
as many in the South, to engage in effective firm-level negotiations that aligns wages with
productivity. This would improve competitiveness, complement the Jobs Act, and help alleviate
regional disparities in labor outcomes and economic performance. Bold implementation of public
administration reform can lower the cost of doing business and improve the investment climate.
Further reforms should seek, among others, to improve the skill-mix in the public sector, simplify
functions and procedures, and tackle privileges and employment in public enterprises, including
through privatization.
45.
Building on recent measures to bolster the stability of the financial sector, further
steps would help advance banks’ balance sheet repair. These should aim to materially reduce the
very high stock of NPLs over the medium term, lower the cost of risk, and improve operating
efficiency, including through: more intensive use of out-of-court debt restructuring mechanisms;
strengthened supervision to facilitate decisive progress in reducing NPLs; and a systematic
assessment of asset quality for those banks not already subject to the ECB comprehensive
assessment, with follow-up actions in line with regulatory requirements. An effective framework for
the timely and orderly resolution of failing banks would prevent the costs of the weaker banks being
borne by the rest of the system and eventually raising stability concerns. Mechanisms such as
Atlante can buy time to move forward with needed reforms, which should be implemented speedily

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

ITALY

and thus contain the costs for the participating banks and the system. Moreover, concerns related to
bail-in of retail investors should be dealt with expeditiously.
46.
Fiscal policy should place greater priority on reducing high public debt, with an
evenly-phased adjustment path. Fiscal policy has been eased gradually since 2013, and most
notably in 2016, while adjustment has been backloaded to 2019. This relaxation increases the risk of
a future procyclical tightening, unless the authorities are successful in significantly boosting
potential growth, which increases the urgency of ambitious pro-growth reforms. Absent significant
privatization proceeds, the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to continue rising this year. While the debt
dynamics are expected to start improving in the coming years, the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio
is expected to be gradual and vulnerable to shocks. An evenly-phased structural adjustment over
2017–19, net of any remaining upfront costs from structural reforms, that achieves a small structural
surplus would send a stronger signal of the authorities’ determination to place public debt on a
firmer downward path and increase Italy’s resilience to shocks.
47.
This recommended adjustment path should be supported by pro-growth policies that
give greater priority to more efficient and lower spending and less distortive taxation. In that regard,
while the reduction in the wage bill and capital spending over the last few years has ensured control
over primary spending, stronger efforts in reducing other current primary spending, including high
social spending, would create room for notably lowering high statutory tax rates on productive
factors. Broadening the tax base and introducing a modern real estate tax are strongly advisable.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held in the usual
12-month cycle.

Overall Assessment:

Assessment. In light of the current account’s shift into a surplus, overall external sustainability is not a major
concern. Nonetheless, further strengthening of balance sheets is desirable, as Italy is vulnerable to financial
contagion given its large stock of government debt.

While there was an
improvement in 2015 on
price-based competitiveness
indicators, the overall
assessment reflects Italy’s
continued weak productivity
growth and need for balance
sheet repair. Stronger
growth, consistent with
reducing high unemployment
and public debt, while
strengthening the external
balance sheet, would require
a modest weakening of the
real effective exchange rate
from average 2015 levels. The
recent small appreciation of
the REER, does not alter the
overall assessment for 2015.

Background. Italy’s current account (CA) averaged a deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP in the decade following the
adoption of the euro. Starting in 2013, it moved into balance and by 2015, it registered a surplus of 2.2
percent of GDP (as compared to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014). The improvement in the current account is
mainly driven by Italy’s growing trade surplus, which reached 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015. In terms of saving
and investment, declining investment accounted for ⅔ of the improvement in the CA since 2010, while higher
public saving contributed most of the rest.
Assessment. Despite the recent improvement in the current account, the EBA model suggests that the
cyclically-adjusted level, which stood at 1.1 percent of GDP in 2015, was about 1.8 percent of GDP below the
norm implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Given these estimates and the
need for stronger growth to reduce public debt and unemployment over the medium term, while improving
the external balance sheet, staff assesses a gap of -2 to 0 percent of GDP for 2015.

Real exchange rate

Background. Stagnant productivity and rising labor costs had led to a gradual appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate (REER) since Italy’s joining the Euro area both in absolute terms and relative to the
Euro area average (by about 0 to 10 percent using price-based REER indices). In 2015, the fall in the value of
the euro contributed to a sizable depreciation of the REER , bringing its value close to 1999 levels.1/ As of May
2016, the REER has appreciated 1¼ percent over its 2015 average.
Assessment. The EBA methodologies provide a relatively wide range of REER gap estimates in 2015. The REER
regression methods suggest an overvaluation of 0.6 percent (EBA Level REER model) and –0.6 percent (EBA
Index REER model) in 2015. The CA regression method yields an overvaluation of about 7 percent. On balance,
and consistent with the staff assessment of the CA in 2015, staff assesses that a modest real effective
depreciation of 0–10 percent would support further adjustment and address economic imbalances over the
medium term.

Capital and financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Portfolio and other-investment inflows typically have financed the current account deficits of
the past, despite a modest net FDI outflow, without much difficulty. Italy’s financial account posted net
outflows of about 3 percent of GDP in 2015, largely reflecting residents’ net purchases of foreign assets, even
as foreign investment in Italian portfolio securities continued. TARGET2 liabilities, accumulated by banks over
2011-12, widened in 2015, reflecting the creation of liquidity by the Bank of Italy within the framework of the
Eurosystem’s asset purchase program.
Assessment. While supported by QE, Italy remains vulnerable to market volatility, owing to the large
refinancing needs of the sovereign and banking sectors, and the potentially tight credit conditions from the
high stock of NPLs in the banking sector.

The external position in 2015
was broadly consistent but
likely still weaker than
suggested by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings.

Potential policy responses:
Continued implementation of
structural reforms as well as
efforts to strengthen bank
balance sheets will be critical
to improving competitiveness
and boosting potential
growth. Further progress in
medium-term fiscal
consolidation will also help
improve competitiveness and
maintain investor confidence.
Combined, these measures
will support growth and
employment over the
medium term.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Current account

Overall Assessment

Background. Italy’s net international investment position (NIIP) has deteriorated significantly since joining the
Euro area, with net liabilities of 24 percent of GDP (December 2015) as compared with 7 percent at end 2000,
reflecting mainly current account deficits and valuation adjustments. Gross assets and liabilities grew steadily
during this period, reaching 144 and 169 percent of GDP respectively, 47 and 64 percentage points higher
than in 2000. External debt represents about ¾ of gross external liabilities. While the level of external debt is
in line with the Euro area as a whole, its composition—half is owed by the public sector—underscores the
vulnerabilities related to the high level of government debt. Looking forward, modest current account
surpluses forecast over the medium term should gradually shrink Italy’s net liability position as a share of GDP.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Italy’s public debt is very high at about 133 percent of GDP and yet to peak. It should start to decline
gradually, once the government delivers the necessary adjustment towards achieving its target of
structural balance and if growth and inflation materialize as currently assumed and accommodative
monetary policy ensures continuing low interest rates. If, however, growth disappoints or contingent
liabilities materialize, debt will keep rising. Debt sustainability is thus subject to significant risks.
Achieving and maintaining for several years a structural surplus of about ½ percent of GDP should
ensure that debt declines steadily.
1.

Public debt in Italy is very high and a source of vulnerability.



Debt increased from about 100 percent of GDP in 2007 to 132.7 percent of GDP in 2015, far
above the SGP target of 60 percent.1 It is yet to peak. In nominal terms, it is the highest in the
euro zone. In percent of GDP, it is the second highest, after Greece. In 2011–12, its high debt
and financing needs were the proximate cause for its spiking spreads and economic troubles.



Gross financing needs are sizable, related to still large rollover needs (14–17 percent of GDP).
The structure of public debt partially mitigates refinancing risks. Average maturity is around
6½ years and about 70 percent of debt is at fixed interest rates, which moderates the passthrough to the budget of falling or rising interest rates. For instance, a 100 basis point increase
in the yield curve is estimated to raise the interest bill by 0.13 percent of GDP in the first year,
about 0.3 percent in the second, 0.4 percent in the third year, and 0.5 percent in the fourth year.
About two-thirds of debt is held by domestic investors.



The ECB’s exceptionally accommodative stance is helping to keep yields down, and its sovereign
bond purchasing program mitigates refinancing risk. During 2015, the ECB’s net purchases of
Italian public debt were about €80 billion, compared with gross financing needs of €450 billion.
The purchases are expected to rise in 2016, given further ECB easing.

2.
In the baseline where the government is assumed to approach structural balance by
2019 and nominal growth exceeds 2 percent annually, public debt is projected to decline.


Real GDP growth is projected at 1.1 percent in 2016, increasing somewhat to 1¼ percent in
2017–18 and declining thereafter to a steady state of 0.8 percent. The long-run growth rate
includes a dividend, in line with the authorities’ estimate, of about 0.3 percent annually that is
assumed to accrue from comprehensive and timely implementation of reforms.

The definition of public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt of the General Government, which
includes the Central Government, Regional Governments, Local Government, and Social Security Funds. EDP debt is a
subset of General Government consolidated debt, excluding items such as certain trade credits and other accounts
payable. Stocks are recorded at their face value and thus usually exclude unpaid accrued interest.

The government is assumed to take the measures necessary to achieve structural balance, which

2019



2017

The GDP deflator is projected to rise above 1 percent in the next few years. Over the medium
term, inflation and the deflator are assumed to remain below the euro area average, reflecting
Italy’s slower (productivity) growth rate relative to the rest of the euro zone. Within the
monetary union, competitiveness is projected to be maintained in slower growing Italy through
relatively lower inflation. This, however, also implies a slower pace of growing out of the debt
overhang and, thus, a longer period of vulnerability.

2015



Important risks are embedded in the baseline assumptions.



Sizable primary surpluses of 3½–4½ percent of GDP will be needed in the baseline to maintain
structural balance for many years. Italy has a history of running primary surpluses. Primary
surpluses averaged 1¼ percent of GDP during 2001–15, while structural primary surpluses have
averaged about 3.4 percent during 2012–15, reflecting the sizable output gap. But running
primary surpluses around 4 percent of GDP for many years through several political cycles,
against the backdrop of low output growth, will test political willingness. Already over 2013–16,
the structural primary surplus is projected to decline from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to
2.6 percent of GDP in 2016. Lower primary surpluses than assumed will have a significant impact
on the path of debt. As the historical scenario illustrates, with a primary balance at around
1 percent of GDP, debt would be 20 percentage points higher by 2021 than in the baseline (see
Figure A2.4).



Stagnation risks are considerable, against the backdrop of a relatively weak global economy,
the overhang of public debt domestically, and long-standing structural rigidities. As such, real

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

ITALY

growth and inflation could fall short of what is assumed in the baseline, complicating efforts
to reduce debt.


On the upside, the impact of the authorities’ policies and of ECB monetary easing, euro
depreciation and low oil prices for longer could have a larger positive impact than currently
expected. Rapid progress on the domestic reform agenda would also boost confidence, thus
spurring a stronger recovery and lowering debt somewhat faster.

4.
Materialization of moderate shocks could put at risk the goal of stabilizing and
reducing debt. For instance:


Standard growth shock. Real output growth rates are assumed to be lower by one standard
deviation for two years starting in 2017, resulting in an average growth of –1.1 percent in 2017–
18. Furthermore, for every 1 percentage point decline in growth, inflation is assumed to decline
by 25 bps. The primary balance improves more slowly than the baseline, reaching only 1 percent
of GDP by 2021. Debt increases rapidly to about 144 percent of GDP and fails to come down
over the projection period.



Interest rate shock. Spreads could increase, from earlier and more rapid exit from
unconventional monetary policies in the United States and euro area or from a re-emergence of
concerns about medium-term debt sustainability. An increase in spreads of 200 bps is assumed,
which is moderate compared to the late 2011–12 episode when spreads increased above
500 bps. Higher borrowing costs are passed on to the real economy, depressing growth by
0.4 p.p. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an implicit average interest rate of
3.6 percent by 2021. Debt declines but only very modestly to around 128 percent by 2021.



Contingent liability shock. Negative surprises, such as from the financial system, could lead to
a standardized one-time increase in non-interest expenditure of about 10 percent of banking
sector assets. This is assumed to depress domestic demand, lower growth for two consecutive
years by –1.2 percentage points, and lower inflation by 0.3 percent. The primary balance is
assumed to worsen by 12 percent of GDP in 2017. Debt rises to 149 percent of GDP, after which
it starts declining very modestly. Gross financing needs would be significantly higher.

5.
The discussion can be reframed in terms of tolerance for risk. Achieving and maintaining
structural balance will lead to a decline in debt only if nominal GDP growth materializes as assumed
and interest rates remain low. Debt will not decline if growth disappoints, interest rates rise, or other
contingent liabilities come onto the public sector balance sheet. Thus, in setting the fiscal target, how
much is the tolerance for risk in regards to ensuring debt is on a firmly declining path? Using the fan
chart analysis below (Figure A2.1), the probability of debt not declining below the current level
(about 133 percent of GDP) by 2021 is relatively low, at about 13 percent, if shocks are distributed
symmetrically. However, with modest asymmetric shocks to growth and to the primary balance, the
probability of debt not falling increases to about 50 percent. Higher primary balances are needed to
stabilize and bring debt down, including when interest rates normalize (text table below).

Public Services

Structural Reforms to Improve the Business Environment
The Annual Competition Law was approved by the Chamber of
Deputies in October 2015 and is currently under discussion in
the Senate. The Constitutional reform, expected to be
completed in 2016, should help strengthen implementation as
some of the responsibilities currently assigned to local
authorities will be brought back to the central government.

Enabling Law on reforming the Public Administration (L
124/2015), approved in August 2015, envisions reform of local
public services and rationalization of local public enterprises.
Some implementing decrees were approved by the Council of
Minister in January 2016.
Advance reforms aimed at improving the skill-mix in the public
sector, matching positions with skills, aligning wages with
productivity, simplifying functions and procedures, rationalizing
procurement, and tackling privileges and employment in public
enterprises, including through privatization.

Increase the autonomy and accountability of public sector
managers; strengthen benchmarking and performance-based
budgeting; and improve mobility of workers and wage
differentiation across agencies and geographical areas.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

An enabling law for public tenders was approved in January
2016, which brings Italy in line with European directives. It
simplifies and rationalizes existing legislation governing public
procurement and introduces a less regulated system. The new
system will provide more soft law instruments (such as standard
contracts and guidelines) and strengthen the power of the AntiCorruption Authority.

Conduct a comprehensive review of court fees, which remain
modest and capped.

After some reforms on court fees, the DL 83/2015 (converted in
law 132/2015), extended the possibility that the losing party in
litigation pays for the court fees.
Strasbourg Program 2.0 under implementation.

There is a reform project on civil procedure that establishes
penalties for frivolous litigation, beyond the payment of the
court fees.
Monitor progress with the program.

Rationalize appeals system and align with international best
practice.

Proposal for legislative delegation on civil procedure, passed
by the Council of Ministers (2/10/2015), and pending approval
by Parliament.

The reform on civil procedure contemplates a single judge in
appeal cases.

Strengthen common market through implementation of the
Services Directive.

In 2014, the infringements procedures have been reduced by
25% and the mechanisms for a swift and sound implementation
of EU law have been further improved.

ITALY

55

Further improve tendering procedures and standardization of
service contracts.

Develop performance indicators and use them for court
management and accountability purposes.

EU-level

Strengthen several provisions of the law in line with the
recommendations of the competition authority, and ensure an
annual process of adopting pro-competition laws.
Consideration should also be given to enhancing competition
in other areas, including in local public service provision,
transport, legal and professional services, as well as to full
implementation of existing legislation (e.g., retail sector).

Reform local public services and rationalize local public
enterprises to improve efficiency.

Rationalize the legal framework related to local public services
with a view of improving competition in services awards.

Judicial System

Next steps

Appendix. Progress Against IMF Recommendations

Product markets Legislate and implement the Annual Competition Law (ACL).
Implement the relevant legislation to eliminate existing
regulatory barriers in sectors outside the ACL (e.g. transport).
Fully implement already legislated reforms by all levels of
government.

action, and judges' interpretation of new legislation.
Implement legislative decree on streamlining of contracts and
monitor use of enhanced flexibility in allocation of labor within

Structural Reforms to Improve the Business Environment
An independent monitoring committee of the implementation
of the Jobs Act was set up by the Prime Minister and the
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and publishes monthly
reports on activations and terminations of various types of
contracts. The handful of cases of termination of new openended contracts were settled within days. A legislative decree,
enacted in September 2015, reviews existing temporary
contracts and allows for more flexible use of labor within the
firm, while promoting the use of the new open ended contract
as the main form of labor contract for employees.

Next steps
Monitor new open-ended contract take up, recourse to legal
action, judges' interpretation of new legislation, and use of
enhanced flexibility in allocation of labor within the firm.

Shift to a more universal support system conditional on job
search and training; finalize and implement legislative decrees
reforming the current wage supplementation scheme.

The introduction of NASPI and two additional schemes on an
experimental basis (Dis-Col and ASI) in May 2015 broadened
the coverage of unemployment insurance. The implementation
of greater conditionality will be done through the National
Employment Agency, thus will be effective once the National
Employment Agency is fully operational. A legislative decree
for reforming the wage supplementation scheme (DL
148/2015) was approved in September 2015.

Improve active labor market policies through better
coordination and information sharing, by establishing the
proposed National Employment Agency.

Monitor effectiveness of National Employment Agency.
The legislative decree on the National Employment Agency
and ALMP (DL 150/2015) was approved in September 2015,
and the National Agency was established in January 2016.
Implementation of ALMP strategies according to regional
agreements and issuance of activation vouchers to unemployed
individuals is expected in 2016.

Boost female labor participation; monitor effectiveness of
measures taken to improve work-life balance

A legislative decree, which reviews parental benefits and
introduces new provisions for more flexible work arrangement,
was adopted in June 2015 as part of the Jobs Act.

Continue to monitor effectiveness of measures taken to raise
female labor force participation. Remove fiscal disincentives
for female employment; enhance provision of childcare and
elderly care services.

Promote the use of firm-level bargaining.

Social partners should come up with a proposal that will
strengthen firm-level bargaining by end 2016.

Modernize the wage bargaining system—by broadening the
scope for firms, specifically smaller enterprises as well as many
in the South, to engage in effective firm-level negotiations.

budget

The 2016 budget reduced the tax burden on labor and firms
further, including by reducing the CIT rate starting in 2017.

Further reduce the labor tax wedge which remains high by
international standards, including through stronger efforts in
lowering current primary spending (such as high social
spending). Introduce a modern real estate tax.

Increase spending efficiency and target spending increases in
areas such as infrastructure and R&D. Identify possible
efficiency gains in areas such as procurement, transfers to
public enterprises, and health.

The 2016 budget envisages some increase in investment
spending. Steps are being taken to streamline procurement
processes, including by cutting the number of expenditure
centers and introducing e-procurement.

Implement the government budget reform that integrates the
spending review process into the budget in a multi-year fiscal
framework. Seek further efficiency and quality improvements in
the delivery of public services.

Fully implement the delega fiscale , including by completing the
review of tax expenditures.

The delega fiscale 's timeframe ended in September 2015; large
part of the law was acted upon. A commission was appointed
to review tax expenditures, submit recommendations for their
reorganization prior to the 2017 budget, and monitor them.

Systematically review and streamline tax expenditures,
including to broaden the tax base.

In 2016, the safeguard clause should be fully offset by spending
cuts and flexibility under the SGP should be used very modestly
(about 0.2 percent of GDP).

The safeguard clause for 2016 was eliminated and partially
offset by spending cuts. Significant flexibility under the SGP
was approved (about 0.85 percent of GDP).

The sizable relaxation in 2016 provides an opportunity to push
ahead with decisive structural reform implementation this year,
including in the fiscal area.

Build a primary surplus buffer over the medium-term by
targeting a 1/2 percent of GDP structural surplus.

The latest medium-term fiscal plans envisage approaching a
structural balance by 2019.

Implement evenly-phased structural adjustment over 2017-19,
net of any remaining upfront costs from structural reforms, that
achieves a structural surplus of about 1/2 percent of GDP to
build buffers against shocks and bring debt down faster.

Public Financial
Management

Enhance policy prioritization with a medium-term expenditure
framework and the institutionalization of spending reviews.

Legislative decrees have been approved to make spending
reviews an integral part of the regular budget process in a
multi-annual planning framework.

Complete the reform of the state budget process and, starting
with the 2017 budget, implement the new framework with
spending targets. Make the budgetary framework more binding
by having enforceable multi-annual expenditure ceilings.

Tax evasion

Stronger efforts to curb tax evasion, including through greater
use of the anti-money laundering framework. Increase
information sharing, e.g., between the Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU) and the “fiscal registry” (anagrafe tributaria).

Information sharing has improved. There is ongoing work in the Implementation and follow-up of improved reporting for

Banking Sector—Repairing Balance Sheets to Revive Lending
Tackling NPLs

Resolve remaining uncertainty about banks’ asset quality by
applying the new EU wide harmonized asset classification
framework to all banks operating in Italy. Strict supervisory
enforcement is essential for ensuring correct classification and
adequate provisioning.

New asset classification framework (Circolare n. 272 del 30
luglio 2008 (Matrice dei conti), 7 Aggiornamento, 20 January
2015), harmonized on the EU level, has been introduced in
January 2015, and is applicable to all banks operating in Italy.

Asset quality should be assessed systematically for those banks
not already subject to the European Central Bank
comprehensive assessment, with follow-up actions in line with
regulatory requirements. Furthermore, guidance should be
provided on banks’ approaches to loan provisioning and loan
restructuring practices.

Increase the tax deductibility of loan losses.

The period has been shortened to a year (DL 83/2015,
converted into law 132/85)

No further action needed.

Expedite judicial process by increasing the effectiveness of
asset sales and reducing litigation within the insolvency
process. Establish qualifications for insolvency practitioners and
expand use of specialized insolvency courts and of on-line
filing.

The Rordorf Commission published extensive reform proposals
in December 2015 (including assigning the competence on
insolvency cases to the enterprise courts and to the larger civil
courts), and the Government has prepared a project for the
design for delegate legislation (February 2016). There have
been reforms of the insolvency framework by the Decree law
n.59 (May 3rd, 2016), including the adoption of on-line tools in
the insolvency process.

Monitor the implementation of the reforms, including the
attribution of competence on insolvency matters to the
enterprise courts, and the implementation of on-line tools in
the insolvency process. Promote the adoption of debt
restructuring principles.

Accelerate write-offs. Introduce supervisory actions that
effectively introduce time limits for write-off of vintage NPLs to
encourage banks to deal faster with the problem.

By end-2016, the supervisor is implementing a new reporting
framework.

Banks should be required to produce comprehensive NPL
strategies, committing to operational targets to reduce NPL
levels markedly over the medium term (via more efficient
internal workout procedures, outsourcing to external servicers,
and sales). Intensified supervisory oversight of banks’ internal
management of NPL resolution should include an additional
regular NPL reporting requirement on progress achieved and
an intensive schedule of on-site monitoring led by collections
and workout experts.

If properly designed, a centralized, system-wide, state-backed
AMC that is consistent with the EU state aid rules and within the
limited available fiscal space could help jumpstart the market
for bad assets.

Two initiatives were introduced instead of a public AMC,
discussions on which had stalled due to state aid concerns: (i)
GACS, which allows transfer of NPLs to external vehicles at
market prices with government guarantee for the senior
tranche of the SPV; (ii) Atlante fund to backstop capital
issuances and which can invest in junior and mezzanine
tranches of securitized bad debts, also leveraging on GACS
guarantee mechanism.

Although Atlante is privately run, supervisors should ensure that
banks' future investments are based solely on commercial
considerations, and the use of funds is tied with strict
governance improvements in the banks they invest in.

SMEs

Ensure that reforms are implemented decisively, and that the
reform of mutual banks results in adequate corporate
governance standards. Regulations of banking foundations'
portfolio management and governance arrangements should
have binding, legally enforceable (instead of intentional)

The supervisor needs to take a lead role in the consolidation of
the smaller banks that are not under the supervision of the SSM.
The supervisor also needs to set clearer bank consolidation
requirements in terms of viability and time-bound operational
cost reductions. The emerging banking groups need to be
assessed ex ante as sound from capital, assets, management,

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ITALY—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of June 6, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic and financial statistics are
comprehensive and of generally high quality. Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner
(Table 1). The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a
calendar of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements of
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), including the timeliness and reporting standards, and it
has adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA2010).
National Accounts: Further improvements should be considered regarding changes in inventories in the
quarterly national accounts, which are currently derived as a residual and lumped together with the
statistical discrepancy.
Price Statistics:
Government Finance Statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics:
Financial Sector Surveillance: Participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS),
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and financial soundness indicators (FSIs) databases.
External Sector Statistics: The Bank of Italy adopted the standards for reporting Balance of Payments
(BOP) and International Investment Position (IIP) data on the basis of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual, 6th edition (BPM6) in the second half of 2014.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
1996 and posts its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In 2015 Italy subscribed to SDDS Plus, together with the first group of
adherents.
Implementing G-20 DGI recommendations: The authorities have implemented
all of the recommendations. Further progress in the near future is likely to be
made on the reporting frequency of Financial Soundness Indicators.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

The European Department

This supplement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report on June 22, 2016. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
The staff report identified a vote by the U.K. electorate to leave the European
Union (Brexit) as a downside risk for the Italian economy. This risk has now materialized.
Since the U.K. referendum, equity prices have been under renewed pressure. Italy's
main stock index, the FTSE MIB, has fallen by 9 percent; bank equity prices declined by
about 25 percent (and are down for the year by over 50 percent). Bank CDS spreads
widened by about 23 bps to 281 bps. Although spreads over Bunds on the 10-year
government bond widened by 5 bps, yields have declined to 1.23 percent. So far, no
major liquidity pressures have been observed.
2.
Staff is revising down slightly the growth outlook, against the backdrop of
heightened uncertainty. While the recovery is expected to continue, increased financial
market volatility and higher general uncertainty could weigh on investment and growth
in the period ahead. Even though direct trade and financial sector exposures vis-à-vis
the U.K. are relatively limited, staff’s preliminary assessment is that growth could remain
just under 1 percent in 2016 and at about 1 percent in 2017, with downside risks having
increased somewhat.
3.
Separately, banks have had mixed success in raising capital recently.
Veneto Banca was unable to attract enough investment from either new or existing
shareholders in its public offering that ended on June 24, 2016. Atlante, the private
sector backstop facility for ongoing banks’ capital increases, purchased about
98 percent of the €1 billion capital increase and is set to become the bank’s controlling
shareholder. In contrast, Banco Popolare completed successfully a €1 billion capital
increase on June 23 that was required by the SSM in advance of the planned merger
with Banca Popolare di Milano.
4.
In the context of final revisions to the External Stability Report, some minor
changes have been made to Italy’s page. A revised page is attached.

ITALY

5.
These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. The advice
presented in the staff appraisal remains valid in the face of heightened downside risks.
Comprehensive pro-growth reforms, including to foster competition in product and
services markets, measures to accelerate bank balance sheet repair, as well as growthfriendly fiscal measures to lower debt are critical to support growth and job creation
while building buffers.

Italy: External Sector Assessment
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Current
account

Real exchange
rate

Background. Stagnant productivity and rising labor costs had led to a gradual appreciation of the real effective exchange
rate (REER) since Italy’s joining the Euro area both in absolute terms and relative to the Euro area average (by about 0 to
10 percent using price-based REER indices). In 2015, the fall in the value of the euro contributed to a sizable depreciation
of the REER, bringing its value close to 1999 levels.1/ As of June 2016, the REER has appreciated 1 percent over its 2015
average.
Assessment. The EBA methodologies provide a relatively wide range of REER gap estimates in 2015. The REER regression
methods suggest an overvaluation of 0.7 percent (EBA Level REER model) and –0.4 percent (EBA Index REER model) in
2015. The CA regression method yields an overvaluation of about 7 percent. On balance, and consistent with the staff
assessment of the CA in 2015, staff assesses that a modest real effective depreciation of 0–10 percent would support
further adjustment and address economic imbalances over the medium term.
Background. Portfolio and other-investment inflows typically have financed the current account deficits of the past,
despite a modest net FDI outflow, without much difficulty. Italy’s financial account posted net outflows of about 2 percent
of GDP in 2015, largely reflecting residents’ net purchases of foreign assets, even as foreign investment in Italian portfolio
securities continued. TARGET2 liabilities, accumulated by banks over 2011-12, widened in 2015, reflecting the creation of
liquidity by the Bank of Italy within the framework of the Eurosystem’s asset purchase program.
Assessment. While supported by QE, Italy remains vulnerable to market volatility, owing to the large refinancing needs of
the sovereign and banking sectors, and the potentially tight credit conditions from the high stock of NPLs in the banking
sector.
Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.

Background
average).
Notes

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 was
broadly consistent but likely still weaker
than suggested by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy
settings.
While there was an improvement in
2015 on price-based competitiveness
indicators, the overall assessment
reflects Italy’s continued weak
productivity growth and need for
balance sheet repair. Stronger growth,
consistent with reducing high
unemployment and public debt, while
strengthening the external balance
sheet, would require a modest
weakening of the real effective
exchange rate from average 2015
levels. The recent small appreciation of
the REER does not alter the overall
assessment for 2015.
Potential policy responses:
Continued implementation of structural
reforms as well as efforts to strengthen
bank balance sheets will be critical to
improving competitiveness and
boosting potential growth. Further
progress in medium-term fiscal
consolidation will also help improve
competitiveness and maintain investor
confidence. Combined, these measures
will support growth and employment
over the medium term.

ITALY

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy measures

Background. Italy’s net international investment position (NIIP) has deteriorated significantly since joining the Euro area,
with net liabilities of 24 percent of GDP (December 2015) as compared with 7 percent at end 2000, reflecting mainly
current account deficits and valuation adjustments. Gross assets and liabilities grew steadily during this period, reaching
144 and 169 percent of GDP respectively, 47 and 64 percentage points higher than in 2000. External debt represents about
¾ of gross external liabilities. While the level of external debt is in line with the Euro area as a whole, its composition—half
is owed by the public sector—underscores the vulnerabilities related to the high level of government debt. Looking
forward, modest current account surpluses forecast over the medium term should gradually shrink Italy’s net liability
position as a share of GDP.
Assessment. In light of the current account’s shift into a surplus, overall external sustainability is not a major concern.
Nonetheless, further strengthening of balance sheets is desirable, as Italy is vulnerable to financial contagion given its large
stock of government debt.
Background. Italy’s current account (CA) averaged a deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP in the decade following the adoption of
the euro. Starting in 2013, it moved into balance and by 2015, it registered a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP (as compared
to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014). The improvement in the current account is mainly driven by Italy’s growing trade surplus,
which reached 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015. In terms of saving and investment, declining investment accounted for ⅔ of the
improvement in the CA since 2010, while higher public saving contributed most of the rest.
Assessment. Despite the recent improvement in the current account, the EBA model suggests that the cyclically-adjusted
level, which stood at 1.1 percent of GDP in 2015, was about 1.8 percent of GDP below the norm implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Given these estimates and the need for stronger growth to reduce public debt
and unemployment over the medium term, while improving the external balance sheet, staff assesses a gap of -2 to 0
percent of GDP for 2015.

Statement by Mr. Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for Italy
July 6, 2016
I thank staff for extensive discussions during the Art. IV Consultation with Italy as well
as for a set of well-focused papers.
The staff report identifies well the key challenges confronting the Italian economy. My
authorities are firmly committed to meet these challenges and the actions undertaken so
far prove it. Perhaps, the staff report could have recognized more what has already been
done and the effect that this will have on economic performance. Staff notes that
implementation will be critical but, as I noted last year, implementation has already
started and indeed has been completed for many policy actions. Not all results of these
actions are yet evident, but this is because it takes time for structural measures (even
when fully implemented) to yield results. The rest of this buff elaborates these points and
provides additional information to complement that provided in the staff report.
1. Real sector
The short term growth outlook
Last year the Italian economy has started recovering, with a GDP growth rate of 0.8
percent. This is obviously not a spectacular rate but is considerably better than what staff
anticipated (the January 2015 WEO update projected a growth rate of 0.4 percent), one of
the few positive surprises we had since then (as we know growth has disappointed for
most countries in the world).
Staff projects a growth rate of 1.1 percent in 2016. The staff report could have usefully
noted that this projected growth rate implies a rapid closing up of the growth rate gap visà-vis the euro area: indeed, while growth would still be below the euro area average, the
2016 gap would be less than half the average gap since 2001. So Italy is catching up at
least in terms of growth rates.
The Italian authorities’ projections for 2016, as well as 2017, are only slightly better than
the staff’s, as pointed out in paragraph 13. There are instead more significant differences
for medium-term growth projections.
The medium-term growth outlook
Despite a recognized “multi-pronged” structural reform strategy, according to staff
potential growth would remain low over the medium term. Absent further reform actions,
staff envisages a medium-term growth of 0.8 percent, including a boost from the impact
of past structural reforms of 0.3 percentage points. My authorities’ long-term growth
projections are more sanguine, while still fairly conservative (1.3-1.4 percent).
My authorities consider reasonable to expect a higher payoff from the substantial reforms
put in place, including those already fully implemented. According to research conducted

at the Bank of Italy, 0.2 percentage points is the estimated contribution from the services
sector reforms already implemented, and this does not take into account the growing
impact of reforms over time.1 On top of that, the implemented reforms in the judicial
sector, public administration, education and labor market should be incorporated. Based
on the official projections, the macroeconomic impact of the already implemented
reforms would amount to 2.2 higher GDP level by 2020, 3.4 percent by 2025 and 8.2
percent in the long-term.2
As to the growth rate in the absence of the recent reforms (0.5 percent in the staff’s
view), before the crisis Italy’s potential growth was estimated by IMF staff at 2 percent.3
In spite of the shocks of the last 8 years, it seems unlikely that the potential growth rate of
the Italian economy dropped from 2 to 0.5 percent, especially in light of the reforms that
were in any case approved and implemented before the most recent round.
Altogether, a less pessimistic medium-term outlook than the one considered by staff
seems fully justified, although further efforts are certainly needed to continue to boost
potential growth in Italy.
Unemployment, social conditions and income distribution
The staff report appropriately notes that labor market conditions have improved, with a
surge in permanent contracts. It is also worth noting the reduction in the unemployment
rate to 11.5 percent last May; among the young the unemployment rate is now lower by
more than 4 percentage points compared with a year ago. Positive signs are also coming
from female employment creation. Regarding income distribution and social conditions,
paragraph 7 of the staff report argues that income inequality has increased (the time
period over which this has supposed to occur is not specified in the staff report but
presumably it refers to developments in the last few years) but analysis conducted by the
Bank of Italy does not seem to confirm this.4 This said, cognizant of the increased
hardship due to the post 2008 recession, the authorities adopted a Social Act to fight
poverty of vulnerable households with children by allocating in the budget law €1 billion
as of 2017, and other specific measures to support education initiatives for children in
poor families together with provisions for disabled persons.
On policy developments affecting the labor market, we would underscore that the Jobs
Act has been implemented, and is not “being implemented” as argued in paragraph 4.
Regarding the wage bargaining system, my authorities agree on the need for reform and
the staff report could have usefully mentioned that in 2016 the authorities plan to focus
on a reform of the second-level bargaining system to make these agreements effective

and able to derogate to the national contract for matters related to production and work
organization5. Additionally, past fiscal incentives for the productivity bonuses agreed at
decentralized level to better align wage and productivity developments have already been
renewed.
2. Fiscal policy
Overall trends
The staff report underscores the fiscal relaxation that took place in 2015 and 2016. This
relaxation has to be put into proper context, as my authorities remain entirely committed
to implement fiscal consolidation within the SGP framework.
First, Italy consolidated very rapidly its fiscal accounts in the aftermath of the crisis, with
the structural primary balance improving from -0.1 in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013.
Starting from 2013, given the persistent weakness of economic activity, my authorities
used the flexibility allowed by the Stability and Growth Pact, and agreed upon with the
European institutions to strike the right balance between consolidating the fiscal accounts
and supporting, to the extent possible, the recovery.
However, the headline deficit continued to decline and, at a targeted 2.3 percent this year,
is at present one of the lowest among the G7(see chart below).

Moreover, staff’s assessment of the magnitude of the fiscal easing this year, based on the
change in the structural balance, is partly misleading, as it relies on very low estimates of
potential output growth in 2016 (implying, for example, that this year a reduction of the
headline deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP corresponds to an increase in the structural deficit
by 0.4 percent of GDP, in the staff’s assessment), an issue that has oftentimes been
mentioned by this chair, and could have at least been mentioned in the staff report.6
Incidentally, the fact that the authorities have reservations on potential growth estimates
is a long standing issue and not just a recent one as argued in paragraph 37 of the staff
report.
Finally, the fiscal consolidation recommended by staff would likely have negative sizable
impact on GDP and debt dynamics, as indicated in the charts in paragraph 36.
Public expenditure restraint
With regard to staff’s views on public expenditure restraint (paragraph 35), the following
points are worth underscoring:
 the reduction in the wage bill should be regarded as structural in nature, not as a stopgap measure. It reflected a decline in public employment by some 250,000 units
which is not going to be reversed, as well as wage restraint that lowered public wages
from an historical peak that was unsustainable: even now the ratio between average
public and private sector wages stands at some 1.22, against an average for advanced
economies of 1.05, suggesting there is room for further savings.
 Significant results have already been achieved on public consumption: public
consumption has stabilized in nominal terms in recent years, after a steady increase in
the 2000-2010 decade; public consumption deflator has considerably moderated to an
average of 0.7 percent in 2010-2015, well below the average inflation rate. The
reform of procurement, which has been already implemented, will make these results
sustainable over time and allow further savings.
 Savings have been achieved in health care spending as well as in pension spending,
owing to the increase in the retirement age.
 As staff notes, investment spending was reduced but, before the cuts, capital
expenditure as a share of GDP was nearly 1 percentage point higher than in Germany,
suggesting that there was room for structural savings in this area, including through
price containment.
 Altogether, Italy’s increase of primary expenditure between 2009 and 2015 was
below 2 percent (for the whole period). This compares to about a rise of 16 percent in
Germany, 22 percent in Finland, 32 percent in UK (see chart).

6

As indicated in Table 1 of the staff report the growth rate of potential GDP in 2016 is just 0.1 percent,
according to staff. With a projected GDP growth rate of 1.1 percent, the output gap is projected to decline
sharply, with a large negative impact on the computed structural deficit, which deteriorates significantly.
The same reasoning explains also the weakening of the structural deficit in 2015, in spite of the 0.4
percentage point improvement in the headline deficit.

Reform of the judicial sector: some positive outcomes
Regarding the efficiency of the judiciary, there are already positive outcomes from past
reforms (legislated and implemented). Here are some figures which could have been
usefully included in the report:
 The number of judicial offices has been rationalized: from a total of 1,398 the
network is now composed of about 650 offices, and 750 units have been closed.
 The backlog of civil trials has been reduced from 6 to 4.5 million since 2009. The
time needed to complete a trial has been on a decreasing trend.
 Breakthrough measures were undertaken, including the processo telematico, which
are powerful and effective. The time to issue telematic cease-and-desist orders hovers
now from 23 to 31 days, depending on the town, down from a range of 42-50 days
compared to a year before.
 22 specialized firms’ tribunals at regional level have been established, 11 of which
are competent for foreign firms; 80 percent of the trials at the firms’ courts has been
settled within a year time in the 2012-2014 period.
Of course much remains to be done, but the improvement is encouraging.
Other fiscal reforms
The staff report appropriately points at the ongoing public administration reform as a
pillar of my authorities’ program (paragraph 25). The legislative path of the reform will

be completed before the summer break. However, some important aspects of the public
administration have been reformed over the last few years: an important outcome that
could have been usefully highlighted in the staff report has been the dramatic reduction in
payment time by the public administration. According to Bank of Italy estimates, in 2015
there has been a further reduction in payment time to 115 days for the whole public sector
(against almost 200 days in 2010).
In paragraph 20, on the provision on local public services, a decree for a rationalization
and reduction in the number of publicly-owned enterprises has just been approved. The
decree spells out the sectors in which such companies may operate and sets minimum
size and performance standards, below which existing ones must be closed down. The
same decree sets criteria for a rationalization and reduction in the number of publicly
owned enterprises.
Regarding paragraph 23 on privatization, Eni, Enel and Finmeccanica are listed
companies subject to market discipline and regulation. Poste Italiane is on the process of
being privatized. The other three companies operate in very different sectors and it is not
clear what kind of “rationalization” they should be subject to.
Finally, regarding long-term sustainability of public finances, Italy is in a much better
shape than most advanced countries as the Fiscal Monitor indicates, reflecting pension
reforms that have been very comprehensive and fully implemented (see chart).

3. Financial sector
The Italian banking system has weathered the impact of the 2008-09 global financial
crisis better than others. However, the deep and prolonged recession that affected the
euro area in 2011-12 has taken a significant toll on the sector, which is now facing
important challenges. Notwithstanding a very difficult economic juncture, important
efforts have been pursued in recent years to enhance the resilience of the system. Capital
has been raised on the market (i.e. with no recourse to public interventions): CET1 was at
12.3 percent at end-2015, higher by around 0.4 percentage points than at end-2014, and
further strengthening is being pursued in 2016, thereby also complying with the ECB
request following the supervisory review and evaluation process of end-2015. The
leverage ratio – calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to total non-risk-weighted assets –
is higher than the European average. Many major reforms – as described by the staff
report and the SIP – have been adopted in a coordinated effort by all involved authorities
and are already in force. They aim at fostering consolidation, enhancing governance,
supporting profitability. Work remains to be done to continue addressing remaining
vulnerabilities. The priorities are clear; the authorities’ determination is firm. At the same
time, in the context of a still fragile – though essential – economic recovery, it is critical
to keep in mind that there is no easy and simple fix to complex problems.
Altogether, we cannot run the risk that supposedly swift solutions may actually
undermine, rather than strengthen, financial stability. A difficult balance has to be struck.
In what follows, I would like to provide some additional information and to clarify the
Italian authorities’ take on some of the issues raised in the report.
Non-Performing Loans
The large volume of non-performing loans (NPLs) – as recalled also by staff – is mostly
the result of the profound recession. The following numbers, here reported for the
convenience of the reader to complement the staff report, can help to put the issue in the
right context (see table).

The table shows that provisioning and collateral represent a strong protection against
losses on NPLs. At end-2015 the stock of gross NPLs amounted to around € 360bn (18.1
percent of total loans; this is the figure reported in the staff report). A large portion of that
stock refers to situations where the borrowers’ difficulty has not led to an insolvency. The

remaining portion relates to loans in an actual state of insolvency (so called ‘bad loans’),
amounting to € 210bn. Net of value adjustments that banks have already made
(provisions), the stock of these bad loans decreases to € 87bn (4.8 percent of total loans).
While considerable, such a burden has to be evaluated against the backdrop of a sizeable
amount of both real estate collateral and personal guarantees (€ 85bn and 37bn,
respectively).7
It is worth considering, more closely than was perhaps possible in the concise staff report,
the measures introduced by the reforms implemented in 2015 and 2016 to increase the
speed and efficiency of insolvency procedures and property foreclosures.
Among others, the new out-of-court mechanism (so called “patto Marciano”) – which can
be agreed upon between firms and financial institutions for corporate loans secured by
real estate collateral – allows the transfer of the property of the collateral to the lender if
the debtor defaults (provided that real estate collateral is not the debtor’s residence). The
“patto Marciano” can be agreed for the new loans contracts and can be included in
existing loan contracts through renegotiation (where bankruptcy procedure is not already
in place). The repossession of the collateral by the lender could take only few months (68 months) instead of more than three years (already reduced from four years by the 2015
reform) as previously estimated. This should reduce the duration of the recovery
procedure accordingly.
Regarding the stock of existing bad loans, the measures adopted could also apply to
younger bad loans (i.e. those recorded in the books for less than two years, for which it
can be assumed that the foreclosure proceedings have not been started or are at an early
stage). Even if the impact of the reform is difficult to quantify (as it depends on different
factors: a) the incentives to renegotiate; b) the share of corporate bad loans potentially
affected by the application of the “patto Marciano”; c) the percentage of these loans that
will actually be renegotiated) assuming that renegotiations take place for around half of
the potentially outstanding contracts, the bid-ask gap (between the value at which these
assets are booked in banks’ balance sheets and the price potential investors would offer to
buy them) would decrease by about 15 per cent.
Against this backdrop, while NPLs-related concerns are justified – and taken very
seriously by the authorities – they should not be overestimated. Moreover, the economic
recovery is helping: in Q1 of 2016 the flow of new NPLs decreased to 2.9 percent of total
loans (as against 3.7 in 2015 and 4.8 in 2014), the lowest level since the second quarter of
2008. In parallel, the stock of NPLs has declined as a ratio of total loans both in Q4 of
2015 and in Q1 of 2016. Therefore, a turning point has now been reached.
This improvement also reflects the measures implemented by the Italian authorities on
several fronts to tackle the issue of NPLs. The disposal of bad debts could be further
facilitated by the state guarantee scheme for securitized bad debts (Gacs), which will help
to raise the sale price by making the senior tranches of securitizations more attractive for
investors. The growth of the market in non-performing assets will also receive a boost
from the investments of Atlante, a private fund that can concentrate on the riskiest
securitization tranches. Even with relatively modest resources for the moment, Atlante
7

can demonstrate that buying bad debts at higher prices than those now offered by
specialized investors can in fact produce attractive returns. All conditions are now in
place for the fund to meet this challenge; the more it succeeds, the more it will become
possible to raise fresh resources, creating a virtuous circle.
These measures are mutually consistent and complement each other. Their number and
breadth speak to the authorities’ determination, clear strategic vision, and right set of
priorities. The authorities maintain high vigilance and stand ready to adopt further
measures, as needed.
At the same time, they stress that – given the constraints posed by the present
circumstances – the reduction of NPLs can only be gradual. While they fully concur that
a high stock of NPLs is the source of significant negative effects, they caution against
conveying the misleading impression – as at times the staff report and SIP do – that a
swift solution would be readily available without running the risk of aggravating, rather
than solving, the problem. For example, in the absence of a liquid market for NPLs,
forcing fast and generalized sales of non-performing exposures would lead to a sale price
much lower than the book value, thereby causing immediate and sizeable losses on
banks’ balance sheets. In turn, this would be conducive to a renewed credit squeeze, with
adverse feedbacks on the modest/fragile recovery and on nominal growth.
Similarly, an excessive acceleration in write-offs would be a drag on the (already
squeezed) profitability, with implications for the ability of banks to access both debt and
equity capital markets and, hence, on their capacity of supporting the economic recovery.
Finally, the high stock of NPLs is not preventing the Italian credit market from
performing its functions in this economic juncture. The evidence points to an
improvement in credit market conditions and, specifically, to a reduction of financial
frictions on the supply side of the market in line with the other euro area economies.
Loans to households have been growing. For nonfinancial firms the contraction of credit
has almost fully receded and bank loans have expanded in sectors with positive economic
performance, for example manufacturing. Problems in terms of credit availability are
limited to microenterprises, or to sectors where the economic climate is less favorable,
e.g. construction and real estate services.
Profitability and banking structure
Like other European banking systems, also the Italian one is suffering from weak
profitability. The average cost-to-income ratio for Italian banks is only slightly above the
EU average (in line with the UK, and below the values for Germany and France).
However, efficiency gains, cost containments, diversification of income sources,
adjustments to the business models are all of the essence and are being pursued.
Improvements in bank profitability are emerging, also thanks to the cyclical recovery: in
2015 Italian banks’ ROE was 3.1 percent (up from -0.3 percent in 2014). To better
evaluate this result, it should be taken into account that the outcome was curtailed by the
4.8 percent increase in operating expenses due to the extraordinary contributions paid by
banks into the National Resolution Fund in December (€ 2.3bn) for the resolution of four
banks.

Staff argues in favor of much needed consolidation in the Italian banking system,
highlighting the presence of around 640 banks. My authorities agree on the need to
pursue this objective. The recent major reforms of the cooperative and mutual banks go
in this direction. Going forward, further adjustment might take place, in the number of
both banks and their branches, leveraging also on a greater use of technology and
digitization.
However, some more information about context and dynamics can be useful to assess the
situation. In particular, while at 640, the number of banks is on a declining trend (they
were almost 800 at end 2008). The same holds true for the number of branches, which
last year declined to around 30,000 or 11 percent less than in 2008. The latest ECB
banking structure report shows that the ratio of branches to population in Italy is close to
the European average (higher than in Germany, but lower than in France and Spain).
Resolution framework
Several parts of the report refer to the need for an effective framework for the prompt
resolution of failing banks and highlight the relevant damages potentially borne by a
delayed or reactive resolution, both for individual banks and the system as a whole (e.g.
pages 22, 24, 27, 33). These statements might suggest that the European resolution
framework has not been fully implemented in Italy and that the authorities are reluctant to
implement it. The reality is that the Italian legal framework is fully compliant with the
BRRD and fully operational. As to implementation, the Governor of the Bank of Italy has
recently reiterated the need to promptly address problematic situations in order to prevent
irreversible deterioration in a banks’ balance sheet from persisting too long and
worsening the effects of its collapse. Adjustments may be suggested to make the crisis
resolution procedures more effective and less likely to generate instability, not to prolong
irreparable situations but to resolve them in an orderly manner.8
Moreover, responsibility for resolution matters for significant banks are within the remit
of the Single Resolution Board, that takes resolution decisions upon the ascertainment of
the failure/likely failure situation by ECB, thus leaving very small room for discretion for
national Authorities.
My authorities’ full commitment in applying the resolution framework (as shown in the
resolution of the four banks) does not prevent us from highlighting the weaknesses of the
framework. We have not been alone in advocating them. The need to assess the degree of
flexibility of the BRRD during the review of the directive scheduled to take place by June
2018 was recalled, among others, by the IMF itself in its last GFSR. Indeed, the GFSR
highlighted the necessity of applying the new rules (including those on state aid) with
flexibility and caution during the changeover to the new regime, when public intervention
is no longer admissible but the banks have not yet put in place sufficient buffers to absorb
losses without undesired effects on systemic stability.

4. Additional information on OECD and World Bank Competitiveness Indicators
In Box 1 of the report staff notes that while Italy is the sixth least regulated economy
among the 31 OECD economies according to the OECD product market regulation
(PMR) indicator, the World Bank Doing Business Indicators based on a de facto rather
than the jure measure would paint a different picture, with Italy at 29th place in 2015. The
OECD ranking is routinely used by staff (see for example UK 2016 Art. IV papers).
Instead, once more, we reiterate our concerns on using the Doing Business Indicators. In
last year’s Buff we noted that those “indicators refer to central Italy, whose efficiency is
not representative of the national average weighted by regional GDP”. In this respect, it is
indeed frustrating that the staff report highlights again one particular indicator that is
particularly misleading, the one that would imply that it takes 124 days to get an
electricity connection in Italy. To raise doubts on the soundness of this indicator last year
in my buff I noted that the figure was not that different from the one available for Los
Angeles (now 134 days), Canada (now 137), Netherlands (now 110) or Japan (now 97).
According to the OECD indicators, the overall Italy competition framework in product
and service markets is in line with the OECD average. In network services
as a whole (which include transport, energy and communications) between 2008 and
2013 Italy improved its ranking in these areas by 4 positions respectively, rising
to an intermediate position among the OECD countries considered. Italy is among the
best performers as regard the regulation of energy sectors (Electricity and Gas), as also
acknowledged in Box 1. In professional services between 2008 and
2013 Italy improved its ranking by 12 positions.
5. Conclusions
Altogether, we thank staff for all the work done during the course of this Article IV
consultation and hope the above information will be regarded by the Board as useful in
understanding better the changing situation of the Italian economy and the ongoing
reform implementation process.
