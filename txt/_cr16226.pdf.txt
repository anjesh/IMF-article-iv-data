IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with United States

On July 8, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
The U.S. is in its seventh consecutive year of expansion. The unemployment rate has fallen to
4.9 percent and household net worth is close to pre-crisis peaks. Nonetheless, the economy has
gone through a temporary growth dip in the last two quarters. Lower oil prices led to a further
contraction in energy sector investment and a strong dollar and weak global demand have
weighed on net exports. On the upside, real household disposable income is growing at
3 percent, the housing market is growing at a healthy clip, and the current fiscal and monetary
policy mix is supporting the economy.
With activity indicators for the second quarter of this year rebounding, the economy is expected
to grow at 2.2 percent and 2.5 percent in 2016 and 2017, which is above potential. Over this
period, the remaining labor market gap should close before growth begins to steadily decline to
2 percent over the medium term. Inflation has remained subdued and wage indicators on the
whole have shown only modest acceleration. As the output gap closes, personal consumer
expenditure (PCE) inflation is expected to slowly and moderately rise above 2 percent in 2017–
19, before returning to the Federal Reserve’s medium-term target of 2 percent.
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside. Given uncertainty surrounding the
implications of the U.K. referendum, continued financial market volatility or a further
appreciation of the U.S. dollar are possible. There are, however, upside risks from oil—both in
terms of a delayed effect on consumption and a lessening drag from oil-related investment. A
more complex and harmful downside risk is the possibility that potential growth rate is lower
than estimated and a smaller output gap than previously estimated. If true, this would mean the
U.S. economy could soon bump up against capacity constraints that would slow growth and
generate domestic inflationary pressures with negative global spillovers.
Over the longer term and despite the ongoing expansion, the U.S. faces a confluence of forces

that may weigh on the prospects for continued gains in economic well being. A rising share of
the US labor force is shifting into retirement, basic infrastructure is aging, productivity gains are
scanty, and labor markets and businesses appear less adept at reallocating human and physical
capital. These growing headwinds are overlaid by pernicious secular trends in income: labor’s
share of income is around 5 percent lower today than it was 15 years ago, the middle class has
shrunk to its smallest size in the last 30 years, the income and wealth distribution are
increasingly polarized, and poverty has risen. If left unchecked, these forces will continue to drag
down both potential and actual growth, diminish gains in living standards, and worsen poverty.
The consultation focused on the medium-term challenges of an increasingly polarized income
distribution, high levels of poverty, falling labor force participation, and weak productivity
growth, and policies to combat these trends.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the continued recovery of the U.S. economy, on the back of
strong fundamentals and supportive macroeconomic policies. Directors noted that, while the
outlook remains broadly favorable, there are important downside risks and uncertainties, in
particular slower potential growth, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar further away from levels
justified by medium-term fundamentals, and sustained investor risk aversion following the
outcome of the referendum in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, longstanding issues on the
supply side continue to weigh on economic prospects, including low productivity growth, falling
labor force participation, and rising poverty and wealth inequality.
Directors agreed that the pace of interest rate normalization should remain data-dependent,
proceeding cautiously along a gradual upward path. While there may be some merits in
accepting a temporary overshooting of the medium-term inflation target until the economic
expansion is solidly established, many Directors were concerned over the risks of de-anchoring
inflation expectations and eroding monetary policy credibility. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to monitor closely economic and financial developments, both domestic
and global, and their implications for the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment
and price stability. They also underscored the importance of maintaining clear, effective
communication of the approach to interest rate adjustment.
Directors noted that near-term fiscal policy remains appropriately geared toward supporting
growth and job creation. However, lasting institutional solutions are still needed to enhance the
budget process and minimize fiscal uncertainties. Directors also highlighted the urgency of
addressing the challenges posed by demographic trends, entitlement spending, and deteriorating
infrastructure. In this context, they saw value in calibrating a credible medium-term
consolidation plan to help guide the path of fiscal policy toward debt sustainability.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed the need to take a broad range of measures to tackle longer-term challenges.
Priorities include boosting federal infrastructure spending; further reforming the health care and
pension systems; and reaching agreement on skill-based immigration reform. Directors called for
concerted efforts to advance pro-poor policies, particularly expanding tax credits to low-income
households, raising the federal minimum wage, and expanding paid-family leave and childcare
assistance. Complementary measures to boost long-term growth include a comprehensive reform
of the U.S. corporate income taxation, and further progress on trade integration.
Directors noted that recent regulatory reforms and improved capital positions have strengthened
the U.S. banking system. Nevertheless, there remain pockets of vulnerabilities that warrant
continued vigilance, particularly in the asset management and insurance industries, although at
the current juncture risks are unlikely to be systemic. To preserve hard-won gains on financial
stability, Directors called on the authorities to continue implementing the recommendations of
the 2015 Financial Sector Assessment Program. It will be particularly important to complete the
regulatory reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act. Directors also recommended close monitoring and
placing the insurance sector under consolidated national regulation and supervision. They
supported efforts to improve data collection and reporting in the nonbank sector, strengthen
requirements on beneficial ownership, and maintain dialogue and support capacity building in
countries affected by the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships.

UNITED STATES
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 24, 2016

Backdrop and theme for the consultation. The United States economy is, overall, in
good shape. A total of 2.4 million new jobs were created over the past year and
unemployment has fallen to 4.7 percent, its lowest level since the eve of the “Great
Recession.” Inflation remains contained, and the U.S. economy has repeatedly
demonstrated its resilience in the face of financial market volatility, a strengthening dollar,
and subdued global demand. Despite these important achievements, the U.S. faces
potentially significant longer-term challenges to strong and sustained growth. Concerted
policy actions are warranted, sooner rather than later. The 2016 Article IV Consultation
explores these policy challenges, focusing on the causes and consequences of falling labor
force participation, an increasingly polarized income distribution, high levels of poverty,
and weak productivity. Finding solutions to mitigate these secular trends will be key to the
health of the global economy given the importance of the U.S. and the multiple channels
for interlinkages and spillovers. The main policy messages underscore the range of actions
needed to alleviate these long-running supply-side issues.
Policies to bolster growth and tackle poverty. In recent years, a divided political system
has obstructed progress in tackling the longstanding supply-side issues facing the U.S.
economy. It will be important, therefore, to build a broad consensus around reforms that
will increase state and federal infrastructure investments; institute a comprehensive, skillsbased immigration reform; further expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and raise the
federal minimum wage; upgrade social programs for the nonworking poor; deepen and
improve family-friendly benefits; and comprehensively reform the corporate income tax.
Monetary policy. The Federal Reserve should remain data dependent. There is a clear case
to proceed along a very gradual upward path for the fed funds rate, conscious of global
disinflationary trends and confirming along the way that wage and price inflation are
indeed maintaining their steady upward momentum. Given the likelihood and severity of
downside risks to inflation, the potential for a drift down in inflation expectations, the
Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and the
asymmetries posed by the effective lower bound, the path for policy rates should accept
some modest, temporary overshooting of the Federal Reserve’s inflation goal to allow
inflation to approach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent medium-term target from above.
Doing so will provide valuable insurance against the risks of disinflation, policy reversal,
and ending back at a zero fed funds rate.
Fiscal policy. Near-term fiscal policy has been well-calibrated to the prevailing economic
circumstances but demographic trends and rising interest rates will lead to larger deficits

UNITED STATES

over the medium-term. The U.S. continues to need a detailed medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan to prevent a renewed rise in the public debt. Such a plan would need to
target a medium-term federal government primary surplus of about 1 percent of GDP (a
general government primary surplus of about ¾ percent of GDP) and address rising health
and social security costs, raise revenues, and improve the structure of the tax system.
Insofar as the measures needed to boost growth and tackle poverty require additional
fiscal resources, they should be funded from new revenues or a reallocation of spending
priorities and fit within a path for the fiscal deficit that ensures a steady decline in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio. It will be important also to find institutional mechanisms to avoid
self-inflicted wounds such as those created by political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling
and the threat of government shutdown.
Financial reforms. Action is needed to institute the range of improvements in the financial
regulatory framework that were outlined in the 2015 Financial System Stability Assessment.
Perhaps most pressing, though, is the need to oppose any wholesale or broad-based
efforts to dilute some or all of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
1.
The past few quarters have seen a temporary growth setback. The U.S. is entering its
seventh consecutive year of expansion. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent, household
net worth is close to pre-crisis peaks, and inflation remains contained. Nonetheless, the past few
quarters have been characterized by a deceleration that is attributable to a continued contraction in
energy sector investment; weak non-energy, non-residential investment; and a persistent drag from
net exports (linked to weaker global growth and

the strength of the U.S. dollar). Although it is more
difficult to find proximate causal factors, consumer
demand has also slowed. The recent disappointing

Labor market. Since the beginning of this year,
nonfarm payroll increases have averaged
150 thousand per month and real household
disposable income is growing at around
3 percent. The unemployment rate has
declined to 4.7 percent, although the cyclical
rebound in labor force participation earlier this
year appears to have been reversed. Despite
the impressive record of job creation, various
indicators still point to remaining (albeit
diminishing) labor market slack from those that
have become detached from the labor force or
are involuntarily working part-time.
Housing. Most of the stock of foreclosed homes
has been reabsorbed and household formation
has picked up (although millennials remain
constrained by affordability and high debt).
Residential investment is expected to continue
to rise as a share of GDP and recovering house
prices should support household wealth gains.

Household balance sheets. So far, lower energy
prices have not provided the expected boost to
private consumption that was expected (see
Box 1). Nevertheless, the oil dividend and
strong growth in disposable incomes have
allowed households to increase saving and
strengthen their balance sheets. Conditioning
on the recovery in household net worth, the
personal saving rate is now well above levels
that would have been predicted by historical
patterns.

Weighing these various forces, growth is forecast to be 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017.
The output gap, which was estimated at 1 percent of potential GDP in 2015, is expected to close by
end-2017 and PCE inflation is expected to slowly rise above 2 percent in 2017–19 before returning
to the Federal Reserve’s medium-term target.

Box 1. Consumption and the Oil Dividend
This time is different? Since November 2014, the
drop in oil prices has provided a 1 percent of GDP
windfall to U.S. households. Prior to the financial crisis,
there was an empirically robust “excessive” reaction of
consumption to energy price changes (i.e., spending
increased by more than the oil price gains1). However,
in the most recent episode the consumption response
appears small. Post-financial crisis, the elasticity of
consumption to energy price changes has fallen from
around 3 to 0.4.2 This decline has been observed
across all subcomponents of consumption but it has
been particularly pronounced for goods consumption
(which historically has driven the overall response but
now appears insensitive to energy price changes).
Why? Multiple factors are clearly at play, including the
shift of the U.S. to being more energy self-sufficient in
recent years. It is premature to have a conclusive view
on the drivers but some stylized facts may be
indicative:


There no longer appears to be the same
positive impact of lower oil prices on
consumer confidence—a leading indicator of
durable goods purchases—as in the pre-crisis
era. Indeed, the near-term effects on
confidence now appear, if anything, to be
negative.



The correlation between equity prices and oil
prices has shifted from -0.3 percent pre-crisis
to +0.6 percent in 2010–15. As a result, the
associated wealth and confidence effects on
consumption from rising equity valuations is
now working in the opposite direction.
The impact of oil prices on the interest rates
on consumer credit are more muted than they
have been in earlier historical episodes (i.e. in
the 1970–80s). Indeed, it has been hard to
detect any reduction in credit costs from lower
oil prices since the early-1990s.

2.
Lower oil prices and increasing energy independence have combined to contain the
U.S. current account deficit over the past year. This has been despite the cyclical growth
divergence with respect to trading partners and the rapid rise in the U.S. dollar. However, over the
medium term, at current levels of the real exchange rate, the current account deficit is expected to
rise above 4 percent of GDP. Net financial inflows were about 2 percent of GDP in 2015 with rising
portfolio inflows being offset by weakness in direct investment and other inflows. The net
international investment position (NIIP) fell to -39 percent of GDP in 2015 and, under staff’s baseline
outlook, the NIIP would deteriorate by a further 10 percent of GDP over the next five years (largely
due to the projected current account deficits).
3.


Risks to the growth outlook are balanced:
The path of the U.S. dollar. The 13 percent real
appreciation of the U.S. dollar since the summer
of 2014 has taken its toll on manufacturing
investment and net exports. Looking forward,
the future path of the dollar represents a
symmetric risk to the U.S. outlook:

diverging growth prospects) would eat into
growth (Box 2). The current level of the U.S. dollar is assessed to be overvalued by 10–20
percent and the current account deficit is around 1.5–2 percent of GDP larger than the level
implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (see Annex IV). As such, a
strengthening in the dollar would serve to push the external position further away from levels
justified by medium term fundamentals.

 Conversely, a continuation of the depreciation that occurred since the beginning of the year
would represent an important upside to both growth and inflation.


Energy sector investment and output. The
decline in crude prices has caused oil
companies to curtail investment by about
40 percent in 2015 (subtracting 0.4 percent
from GDP growth). In 2016, energy investment
is expected to fall by another 30 percent,
subtracting 0.2 percent from growth. The risks
to growth associated with the future path of oil
prices are asymmetric.



On the downside, the compression of capital spending that has already occurred implies that
even at lower oil prices, larger-than-expected falls in investment will be small as a share of
GDP and have only a minor impact on growth.



However, if oil prices sustain their current levels and tight financing conditions for the sector
begin to normalize, oil-related investment could resume, with a modest upside risk to activity
(Box 3).



Non-oil investment. A shrinking output gap and decent prospects for future domestic demand
growth should support investment in non-oil, non-residential sectors. However, recent data has
shown such investment moving in the opposite direction. This could be reflective of the strength
of the U.S. dollar or perhaps broader industrial spillovers from the downturn in the energy sector.
It could also reflect a more structural trend at work as U.S. output becomes less intensive in
physical capital and more reliant on human and informational capital. If true, this would pose a
downside risk to aggregate demand as the economy adjusts to the new equilibrium.



Finally, a consumption effect? To date, there has been little apparent consumption stimulus from
lower oil prices (the personal savings ratio stands at 5.4 percent, up ½ percent since mid-2014).
Nonetheless, lower oil prices are helping to strengthen household balance sheets, particularly for
lower income households. This should, at a minimum, increase the resilience of the economy to
negative shocks and could mean a belated reaction of consumption. As such, this offers an
unambiguous upside to the growth forecast.



U.K. exit from European Union. Staff estimates suggest the impact on U.S. growth of a disruptive
U.K. exit from the European Union are likely to be modest. The principal channels would come
through a sustained rise in global risk aversion that would lead to a compression of U.S.
sovereign yields, a rise in the U.S. dollar and a sell-off in risk assets. However, given the
unprecedented nature of the event, the broader effects-including on the U.S. economy and its
large financial system-are highly uncertain and could evolve in unpredictable and more negative
ways than indicated by macro models.



A misjudgment about potential growth. There is a
risk that staff’s outlook has over-estimated both
the historical path of potential growth and the
degree of slack that currently exists. If true, this
could mean that the economy is now starting to
bump up against capacity constraints (including
in the labor market). As such, growth for the
coming years could settle at well below
2 percent. Perhaps more problematic, a lower
path of potential could give rise to an
unexpected acceleration in inflationary
pressures in the near-term, leading the Federal

Reserve to more assertively raise the policy rate. This would cause the dollar to appreciate and
increase asset price volatility (as market participants find themselves wrong-footed).


Spillover implications. Such a scenario would have important negative spillovers, particularly
given that the global economy currently appears ill-prepared for a rapid rise in U.S. policy
rates, for capital to flow back to the U.S., for risk premia to rise, and for the dollar to
accelerate upwards. Such near-term negative spillovers would be further exacerbated by the
real transmission effects of a path for medium-term U.S. growth that is well below current
expectations.

4.
Risks are skewed toward lower inflation. Further dollar strength would present a drag to
imported inflation. However, even in the event of a stable currency, the significant global excess
capacity seen across a range of tradable goods may lead to a protracted decline in tradable goods
prices. This would be further exacerbated if the recent pattern of downgrades to global growth
prospects continues. Finally, changing dynamics in the U.S. labor market, that are at this point not
fully understood, may mean that the expected pick up in nominal wages could prove elusive, further
weighing on inflation.
5.
Authorities’ views. Tepid growth over the last few quarters was viewed as likely to be
transitory, especially when contrasted with the strong labor market data through April. Given the
maturation of the cycle, the pace of job gains is expected to slow but, in May, job growth slowed
substantially more than expected and that abruptness seems inconsistent with other more positive
activity indicators. In the coming quarters, it was expected that sequential growth rates would pick
up and moderately exceed potential growth. Near-term risks to the growth outlook were considered
to be broadly balanced but there was some modest downside potential to inflation outcomes,
particularly given weak global trends and the impact of residual seasonality on data in the first half of
the year. Concern was expressed about the continued widening of the U.S. current account deficit,
particularly as a symptom of weak global demand. Counterparts emphasized the importance that
countries, including the U.S., use all available policy tools to boost demand. Officials also highlighted
a number of advanced and emerging market economies with large external surpluses (including
China, Germany, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan Province of China) which could usefully bolster domestic
demand and, in so doing, contribute to stronger global growth and a more balanced world
economy.

Empirical findings. A VAR framework that adds variables to proxy global and country-specific shocks (VIX,
WTI, expected inflation differentials, expected growth differentials, and short-term interest rates), reveals:
1



FX risk premia and the 10-year interest rate differentials have a significant and persistent effect on
exchange rates.



A global uncertainty shock (proxied by a higher VIX) induces an appreciation of safe haven
currencies and the U.S. dollar rises against all other major bilaterals except the Yen.



Commodity currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, are sensitive to oil price movements including
through a knock-on effect on the foreign currency risk premium.

Box 3. U.S. Shale Oil and Global Spillovers
The shale oil “revolution”. The U.S. oil industry experienced one of its most dramatic shifts in 2010–15
when the combination of high prices and technological change (notably horizontal drilling) allowed a
doubling of U.S. crude production. Both the number and productivity of rigs increased with important
implications for the oil market and global economy more broadly.
Scenarios. Forecasts of future production face tremendous uncertainty but scenarios can help identify the
range of possible future outcomes. Specifically, we

examine three scenarios:

Baseline. Draws on the prediction of the

productivity (i.e. uses a concave trend) and lowers the estimated impact of WTI price on the rig

The differential impact on production from these modest changes in assumptions is large. By 2020, U.S.
production could range from 3.5 to 8.4 million barrels per day depending on the scenario (the baseline
scenario is very similar to the EIA’s latest forecast).

Near-term fiscal policy has been well-calibrated to the prevailing economic
circumstances. At the general government level, the change in the structural primary balance is
expected to be -½ and 0.1 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017, respectively. This should be mildly
supportive of growth, particularly if gauged against the fiscal contractions (of around ½ percent of
GDP) experienced in 2014–15. From a macroeconomic perspective, both near-term fiscal and
monetary policies appear consistent with the need to provide modest support to the economy as it
transitions toward full employment in the face of global and domestic headwinds (near-term fiscal
and monetary policy settings are in line with recommendations in the 2015 Article IV, see Annex I).
7.

Fiscal uncertainties have been diminished by the passage of:



The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 which suspended the debt ceiling until March 2017 and
avoided the risk of government shutdown by locking in appropriations for 2016 and 2017.



Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act that lowered tax revenues by 3½ percent of GDP over
the next 10 years. Among the many provisions, the bill made permanent the enhanced child tax
credit, the American Opportunity tax credit for college tuition, and the improvements to the
earned income tax credit (i.e. the expansion to larger families and removal of the marriage
penalty). The bill also made permanent the research and experimentation credit for corporations
(which had been temporarily extended 15 times since 1985, sometimes retroactively).



Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act that commits US$305 billion to surface transportation
for the next 4 years and provides some degree of stability to states in planning projects that are
co-financed with federal resources.

Medicaid (in those 19 states that chose not to
expand Medicaid to households that earn less than 133 percent of the federal poverty threshold) but
too low to receive ACA insurance premium subsidies. Following passage of the ACA, health costs
have been rising at a slower pace (PCE health care inflation has risen, on average, by 1.4 percent per
year over the past 5 years). The impact of the ACA on labor supply remains unclear and subject to
large uncertainties. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the ACA would reduce hours worked
by around 1.7 percent by 2025 (although other empirical studies have smaller effects). Also, the ACA
requirement to maintain children on a parent’s insurance until they are 26 years old appears to have
raised the wages of young adults. Finally, the early evidence suggests that the ACA has provided
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

UNITED STATES

some support to those below, or close to, the poverty line (simulation analysis points to a 6 percent
increase in the income equivalent for the lowest quintile).
9.
The volatility in financial markets in the early part of 2016 does not detract from the
fact that financial conditions have been very supportive of the real economy (Figure 1). This is
particularly true after parsing out the effects—on equity and bond prices—of the evident stress in
energy and mining companies. Most notably, the availability and cost of financing for households—
mortgage rates, auto loans, and the senior loan officer survey—remain very favorable. Also, as riskfree rates have trended downwards, investment grade yields of non-energy companies have
generally been moving sideways.
10.

Risks to the U.S. financial system are broadly unchanged from that of a year ago.

 The U.S. banking system continues to strengthen its capital position. Tier 1 capital is at
13 percent of risk weighted assets (RWA), with increasing RWA density (now at 71 percent). The
system appears resilient to a range of extreme market and economic shocks. The results of the
2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise will, however, be released in June,
precluding an updated assessment relative to the 2015 Article IV. Measures to bolster bank
liquidity, as well as strengthen recovery and resolution, are being steadily implemented.
 There are some pockets of vulnerability. These include credit quality in auto lending, student
loans, and commercial real estate lending. Energy and mining loan exposures are also likely to
bear losses. However, these are relatively small parts of the U.S. financial system. Compressed
interest margins continue to weigh on bank profitability and are causing intermediation to
increasingly move to the nonbank sector,

 The various financial stability issues highlighted in the 2015 FSAP, for the most part, have not
been addressed (Annex II). These include data blind spots, the lack of risk management
requirements and stress testing for the asset management industry, residual vulnerabilities in repo
markets and money market funds, the complex institutional structure for financial regulation, a
housing finance system that remains in limbo, and an incomplete understanding by the regulators
of financial interlinkages.

 A large U.S. insurance company appealed its designation by the Financial Stability Oversight
Council as a Systemically Important Financial Institution. Subsequently, a federal court has ruled
on the case and decided to rescind the designation. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is
currently appealing that court decision.
 The potential lack of market liquidity in a range of fixed income instruments, particularly at times
when markets are under stress, remains a concern that could increase the risk of destabilizing
forced asset sales or create volatility in market pricing. In the new regulatory environment, banks’
balance sheet space for market-making activities has become tighter and alternative market
systems are still unable to provide a full offset. Such market illiquidity not only induces more price
volatility but also has the potential for creating macro-financial effects. However, adaptation is
already occurring on multiple fronts as buy-side institutions arrange their activities with an
understanding that liquidity-under-stress will be lower.

THE SUPPLY SIDE CHALLENGES AHEAD
11.
Despite the sustained economic expansion, the U.S. faces a confluence of forces that
will weigh on the prospects for continued gains in economic well being. A rising share of the
U.S. labor force is shifting into retirement, basic infrastructure is aging, productivity gains are scanty,
and labor markets and businesses appear less adept at reallocating human and physical capital.
These growing headwinds are overlaid by pernicious secular trends in income: labor’s share of
income is around 5 percentage points lower today than it was 15 years ago, the middle class has
shrunk to its smallest size in the last 30 years, the income and wealth distribution are increasingly
polarized, and poverty has risen.
12.
These secular trends both interact and reinforce each other. Demographic changes are
slowing potential growth, delaying the renewal of business equipment, and depressing labor force
dynamism. Reduced dynamism in the corporate sector has the potential to diminish innovation,
deepen the loss of middle income jobs, and further polarize the income distribution. Income
polarization itself can prevent productivity-improving investments in education by poorer
households, lessen social mobility, add to economic insecurity, and limit consumption prospects. The
causes of and interactions between these various forces are complex and not well understood. Skillbiased technological change, the more globalized and integrated market for goods and labor,
changing structures of industrial and labor markets, and insufficient offsetting domestic policy
actions are all feeding into these dynamics. However, what is clear is that these trends are coinciding
with a well-documented decline in potential growth (from above 3 percent in the early 2000s to
below 2 percent today) that is being mirrored across a range of advanced and emerging economies.
If left unchecked, these forces will continue to drag down both potential and actual growth,
diminishing gains in living standards and worsening poverty.

Demographics are an immutable headwind. The aging of the baby boom generation is set
to cause a fall in the growth of the working age population in the coming years as well as a steady
decline in labor force participation. As a

Since the late 90s and early 00s, total factor productivity (TFP) in the U.S. has slowed
significantly. TFP growth has been close to zero in the past 5 years and estimates of labor
productivity have seen a similar decline. This slower productivity growth has been a global
phenomenon and there is evidence it is related, at least in part, to a slower pace of innovation, a
generalized decline in economic dynamism and the pace of new firm formation, rising firm
concentration, falling labor market turnover, and the continued shift from manufacturing to services.
15.
There has been a marked decline in labor market dynamism. In contrast to the “job-less
recovery” of the early 2000s, the current expansion has seen relatively healthy employment growth
but wage gains have been anemic. Over one-half of the post-recession employment gains have been
accounted for by the 55-and-over population who find themselves with insufficient income for
retirement (and, as a result, are working later in life). In addition, churning—a measure of labor
market dynamism that has been correlated with real wage growth—has followed a downward trend
for both men and women, is at historically low levels, and seems connected to slower productivity
growth (Box 4).

Box 4. The Decline of U.S. Dynamism
Labor market fluidity. Since the late 1980s, American
workers have been changing jobs less frequently1. Quit
and layoff rates have declined and job-to-job moves—
a common practice for workers as they move up the
wage ladder—have fallen by 40 percent. As a result
workers are holding fewer jobs during their careers,
reallocating less across sectors, and accumulating less
transferable skills. The decline in job-to-job moves may
also be a partial explanation behind lower wage
growth and a falling labor share of income.

This was initially concentrated in a few sectors (e.g.

The link to productivity. It has been no coincidence that, during this same period, the most productive
firms have been growing at a slower pace. Within individual industries business concentration has risen and
the dispersion of productivity across firms within a sector has grown.2 The decline in labor market fluidity
could well have slowed the allocation of employee talent to productive firms and, in so doing, suppressed
overall productivity growth.

Box 5. Polarization and Consumption1
Divergent paths. Since the 1970s, the real income of

has accelerated since the late 1990s.

Polarization. Over the last four decades, many
households have moved out of middle-income groups
(defined as those earning 50–150 percent of the
median income) and into the tails of the distribution.
Since 2000, this “hollowing out” of the middle class,
has been tilted more toward movements into the
lower than the higher income ranks.
Wealth. The net worth of households has also
polarized. The real net worth of those groups who
earn less than two-thirds of the median income is
now 20 percent below where it was when the data
started in 1983. Meanwhile the average real net
worth of those earning more than twice the median
income has doubled since 1983.

The re-profiling of the economic structure, coupled with skill-biased technological
progress in both services and manufacturing, has contributed to a shrinking of the share of
the population in middle income jobs and a broader polarization of the income distribution
(Box 5). Since the mid-1980s, the number of semi-skilled jobs paying incomes around the national
median has fallen and jobs are instead being

19.
In parallel with the polarization of the income and skills distribution, there has been a
steady increase in poverty in the U.S. In the latest data, 1 in 7 Americans are living in poverty,
including 1 in 5 children and 1 in 3 female-headed households. Further, around 40 percent of those
in poverty are working. The incidence of poverty has

21.
Authorities’ views. The administration has repeatedly argued for raising the minimum wage
and expanding the EITC for workers without dependent children as well as workers that are 21-24
and 65-66 years old. The President’s budget also makes the case for providing high-quality
preschool to lower income families, instituting full day kindergarten in every school district, and
expanding funding for programs that support learning and development of the neediest children.
More recently, the overtime regulations had been updated, doubling the salary threshold to US$ 913
per week and extending coverage to 4.2 million lower income workers. Moreover, the threshold will
now be automatically updated every 3 years based on wage growth. Officials also saw merit in
reexamining the structure of safety net spending, particularly given that the generosity of cash
poverty alleviation programs had declined in recent years with additional spending funded without
an increase in the deficit.

22.
Falling labor force participation is an inevitable consequence of an aging society but
those demographic effects can be mitigated. Improvements in the EITC, discussed above, will help
encourage work. It will also be important to:


Adopt family-friendly benefits, particularly as
a policy lever to slow the downward trend in
female labor force participation. These would
include providing means-tested support for
childcare and introducing paid family leave in
line with standards in ILO conventions.

Finally, perhaps the largest effect on the labor
supply would come from an agreement on an immigration reform that is skill-based, changes
the underlying demographic trends, reduces the dependency ratio, and raises the average level
of human capital in the labor force.

23.
Authorities’ views. Adverse demographic trends made supporting working families a high
priority so as to use the U.S. labor force most effectively. The 2017 Budget proposes federal funding
for start-up grants to assist states in introducing paid leave programs and providing federal
employees with six weeks of paid administrative leave for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of
a child (currently new parents who are federal employees are allowed to draw down six weeks of
their sick leave and take twelve weeks of unpaid leave). The budget also supports increasing
childcare subsidies for lower income families with young children and raising the child and
dependent care tax credit (to a maximum amount of US$3,000 per child for families with children
under age five). The administration is committed to common sense and comprehensive reform to fix
the broken immigration system and has taken executive actions to offer relief from deportation for
the parents of citizens or legal residents who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years.
24.
Raising productivity and bridging the skill divide will be essential. Since the boom of the
late 1990s, total factor productivity has slowed significantly. This appears to be a global trend that is
not confined to the U.S. Notwithstanding this, public policy tools could help facilitate innovation and
technological progress, and support efficiencies in private activity:


Expanding infrastructure investment. The public capital stock is aging and has been declining
as a share of GDP for some time. New investment is urgently required to improve the quality and
reliability of infrastructure, particularly for surface transportation. This will help remove
bottlenecks and congestion and add to the productivity of private activity. Public projects to
upgrade infrastructure technologies (e.g. in high speed rail, ports, or telecommunications) would
be particularly valuable. In parallel, innovative solutions should be sought to facilitate the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

UNITED STATES

financing (both public and private) of U.S. infrastructure. It is estimated that such investments
could cost about 5–8 percent of GDP over the next 10 years which should be financed without an
increase in the near-term fiscal deficit (i.e., by reallocating spending from other areas and raising
revenues). Estimates suggest that such an expansion in infrastructure investment could boost
potential growth by around ¼ percent.

K-12 education. There is a clear need for better spending on education so as to raise
educational outcomes. This could include prioritizing funding for early childhood education
(including financing of universal pre-K) and supporting science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics programs.



Vocational education. Closing the skills gaps would be facilitated by greater federal support for
state-level training as well as the expansion of partnerships between industry and higher
education institutions to facilitate apprenticeships and vocational training.

potential to set a new standard and pathway
for international economic cooperation. It would also aid the U.S. economy by capitalizing on its
strength in the fast growing area of tradable services. Resisting all forms of protectionism will
also be essential. There will likely be transition costs to both jobs and incomes from greater trade
integration as well as potential effects on income polarization. The consequences for tradeaffected U.S. workers should be taken into account and policy efforts should be taken to mitigate
the downsides through training, temporary income support, and job search assistance, including
deployment of the existing trade adjustment assistance program.

25.
Authorities’ views. The administration has proposed a “surge” in new infrastructure and
clean energy investment funded through an excise on crude oil and a one-time 14 percent tax on
unrepatriated corporate profits (as a transition to broader business tax reform). There has been
broad recognition of the importance of education and job training to support future growth and
productivity. The administration has already expanded grants and tax credits to increase access to
college and had proposed making community college free for two years. There is a hope that the
recent step to make the research and experimentation tax credit permanent could help with
productivity. Federal funding for job training has been increased in recent years, and, in the past two
years, 75,000 additional individuals have been enrolled into federally-supported apprenticeship
programs. Continued efforts along these lines could help lessen the skills mismatch that is currently
visible in the U.S. labor market. There is a strong commitment to working with Congress to pass the
TPP and move ahead with other plurilateral trade agreements. The U.S. is committed to resisting
financial and trade protectionism. Given that trend declines in productivity are widespread globally,
officials noted the value of further examining the productivity slowdown from an international
perspective.
26.
Steps should also be taken to avoid self-inflicted wounds from future disagreements
on the path for fiscal policy. Whatever gains could be achieved in supporting growth through the
supply-side measures described above could be easily dissipated by a repetition of past political
brinkmanship over appropriations and the debt ceiling. Near-term uncertainties have certainly been
diminished by the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax

Hikes Act, and the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. However, it will be important to
identify more lasting institutional solutions.


One possibility would be to replace the debt ceiling with a bipartisan agreement on a clear,
simple medium-term fiscal objective (with an integrated view of all budget functions and
numerical goals for both debt and deficit).



Alternatively, a legislative process could be introduced that adjusts the debt ceiling automatically,
consistent with whatever agreement is struck on the broader budget parameters.



Carefully-designed mechanisms could be built in to support fiscal discipline by triggering
automatic revenue or spending adjustments if congressionally approved targets are breached.



Consideration could also be given to more permanently shifting to a budget cycle where annual
spending levels are agreed for a two-year period (helping to divorce budget decisions from the
electoral calendar).

Demographic trends and rising interest rates will lead to larger fiscal imbalances over
the medium-term. Specifically, over the next decade healthcare and social security outlays are
expected to increase by 1¾ percent of GDP and interest spending will rise by 2 percent of GDP. As a
consequence, the federal debt is forecast to begin rising in 2019 and exceed 80 percent of GDP by
2025. Regrettably, the U.S. continues to lack a

Achieving this medium-term path will require actions on multiple fronts:
Tax reform. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that a comprehensive reform of the U.S.
tax system that removes exemptions, simplifies the system, and reduces statutory rates (both for
individual and corporate income taxes)—would raise the level of real GDP by up to 1.6 percent
over the next ten years. Reform of the corporate income tax is badly needed and could help
revitalize business dynamism and investment (Box 6). For the personal income tax, the structure
could be made more progressive so as to help mitigate income polarization and assist the
working poor. This could involve capping itemized deductions, including for mortgage interest,
to lessen the tax benefit for the most well off. Finally, as has been advocated in past
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

consultations, additional revenues should be generated through the introduction of a federal
level VAT and a broad-based carbon tax (see 2015 Article IV), including an increase in the federal
gas tax (which has been 18 cents per gallon since 1993).


Pension reform. The expected depletion of the social security trust fund calls for early steps
toward fundamental reform of the pension system. These would include raising the income
ceiling for social security contributions, indexing benefits and contribution provisions to chained
CPI, raising the retirement age, and instituting a greater progressivity in the benefit structure.



Healthcare cost containment. Healthcare inflation has come down but it appears largely linked
to slow wage growth in the health sector (which has already started to bounce back). More is
needed to sustainably lower the path of future healthcare costs. This could be achieved through
better coordination of services to patients with chronic conditions, greater cost sharing with
beneficiaries, innovations in efficiency technologies (e.g. electronic health care records, remote
consultations with doctors, international outsourcing of some diagnostic functions), and
changing incentives away from remuneration per procedure and toward payments for achieving
specified health outcomes. Higher Medicare premiums would also help address financial
imbalances in the publicly-funded health system.

29.
Authorities’ views. On the tax side, the administration has argued for closing personal
income tax loopholes for “carried interest” and to limit the value of itemized deductions and other
tax expenditures for higher income households. They also would favor increasing the top tax rate on
capital gains and dividends to 28 percent. The President has proposed a comprehensive, revenueneutral business tax reform that would reduce the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, eliminate dozens
of inefficient tax expenditures, impose a 19 percent minimum tax on foreign earnings that would be
paid currently without possibility of deferral (with no additional tax upon repatriation), and limits on
the use of excessive interest deductions by foreign companies to strip earnings. The administration
recognizes there are imbalances in the entitlement system and has, over time, put forward various
measures that could be part of a “grand bargain”—to strengthen the solvency of the system. In this
regard, it was important not to understate the important progress, in part linked to the Affordable
Care Act, that has been made in lowering the pace of cost increase in health care (which will lessen
the medium-term fiscal imbalances due to aging). Tackling the financing gap in the social security
system while ensuring beneficiaries receive robust benefits was seen as an increasing priority.

Box 6. Reform of the U.S. Corporate Income Tax1
The shortcomings. There is bipartisan acceptance that
the U.S. system for taxing corporate income is broken.
The current tax structure is too complex, has a
marginal rate that is too high and with a narrow base,
is rife with legislated exemptions, favors debt
financing, and incentivizes a range of cross-border
avoidance and tax planning mechanisms to lower U.S.
tax liabilities. Despite the well-documented distortions
and shortcomings, and their negative implications for
both productivity and the global competitiveness of
U.S. businesses, reforming the system has proven
politically impossible.



Reduce the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent.



Broaden the CIT base by eliminating the bulk of corporate tax expenditures including the Section 199
deduction (for domestic production activities) and repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax.



Align depreciation allowances with rates of economic depreciation. Eliminate tax incentives for
petroleum exploitation, including publicly traded partnerships.



Adopt the recommendations of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action 4 by limiting interest deductions
to 10–20 percent of EBITDA for both domestic and foreign-owned firms to reduce income-stripping as
well as debt bias.



Adopt a territorial system by excluding dividends of foreign subsidiaries from U.S. taxation. On a goingforward basis, impose a 15 percent country-by-country minimum rent tax on the foreign earnings of
U.S. corporations. Maintain the current system of crediting for foreign taxes paid.



Tax the existing stock of un-repatriated foreign-sourced earnings at a rate of 25 percent, with payments
spread over the next 8 years.

More fundamental reform. Over a longer horizon, the U.S. should transform its corporate tax system into a
rent tax. This would involve allowing U.S. corporations a general capital allowance against earnings for both
debt and equity-financed investment and then taxing the remaining rents at a lower marginal rate. Normal
returns to capital should be taxed at the investor level including by removing the current tax exempt status
for pension funds and endowments. Partial crediting should remain for foreign taxes paid.

A SLOW TRAIN TO “NORMAL”
30.
Since the first rate increase in December,
the predicted pace of subsequent rate increases
has slowed (in both the FOMC and market’s
expectations). Despite a string of strong labor
market data, there has been concern around weak
activity and, more recently, jobs data, recurrent
bouts of financial market volatility, and diminishing
global prospects. The FOMC has emphasized the
shallow, gradual upward slope in its expected policy
rate profile and has underlined that the federal
funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below
levels that were expected to prevail in the longer
run.

Wage and price inflation appears contained. Price developments have been marginally
above staff’s expectations at the time of the last Article IV. However, wage indicators appear
moderately softer than had been previously envisaged, despite the labor market repairing on a
faster-than-expected timetable. Over the past 12 months, compensation growth as measured by the
employment cost index has fallen to under 2 percent and average hourly earnings are only modestly
higher (at 2.5 percent). Despite this, inflation outcomes are currently expected to follow a slow
trajectory back to the central bank’s medium term target as labor market slack is steadily exhausted.

Evidently, monetary policy should remain data dependent. It is also important to note
that it will be the whole expected future path of rate movements that will be relevant for the
macroeconomy. At this point in the cycle, there is a clear case to proceed along a very gradual
upward path for the fed funds rate, conscious of global disinflationary trends and confirming along
the way that wage and price inflation are indeed maintaining their steady upward momentum.
Evidence suggests that the trade-off between slack and price pressures appears to have remained
reasonably stable (Box 7). Staff’s own macroeconomic outlook is built on an assumption of two
further rate increases in the second half of 2016 and the forecasted outturns for growth, inflation,
and unemployment are broadly in line with the FOMC’s own summary of economic projections.
Given the likelihood and severity of downside risks to inflation, the potential for a drift down in
inflation expectations, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price
stability, and the asymmetries posed by the effective lower bound, the path for policy rates should
accept some modest, temporary overshooting of the Federal Reserve’s inflation goal to allow
inflation to approach the Fed’s 2 percent medium-term target from above. Doing so will provide
valuable insurance against the risks of disinflation, policy reversal, and ending back at a zero fed
funds rate (see Working Paper). The Federal Reserve should be clear in communicating its intentions
and emphasize that its medium-term inflation goal is symmetric and that inflation could well
approach their target from above. If either wage or price inflation becomes visible at a faster pace
than is embedded in staff’s current forecasts, interest rates should be raised on a more front-loaded
timetable.
33.
Authorities’ views. A healthy labor market—notwisthstanding the slowdown in job growth
in May—and real income growth were expected to support a pickup in consumer spending, leading
to a faster pace of GDP growth in the coming quarters. The low unemployment rate appears, at
present, to be exerting little upward pressure on wage or price inflation. However, with consumer
demand growth continuing, the dollar no longer appreciating and energy prices apparently having
bottomed out, there was confidence that inflation would move steadily upward to the 2 percent
objective in the medium run. If incoming data shows economic growth continuing to pick up, labor
market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward 2 percent, then it
likely would be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate in the coming months.
However, incoming data would determine the timing and pace of future rate adjustments. There is
no preset course for the policy rate. Officials indicated that the Federal Reserve’s medium term
inflation goal should not be viewed as a ceiling and there were likely to be symmetric errors around
the 2 percent target. However, there was no intention to engineer an overshoot the inflation
objective and the welfare case for doing so was not compelling. There was a concern also that
aiming to overshoot the medium-term target would create the risk of being behind the curve and
potentially being faced with a need to raise rates more quickly especially if the labor market
tightening led to a faster increase in inflation than seen until now. This could be disruptive and
undermine the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s mandates of maximum employment and stable
prices.

Box 7. Did the Global Financial Crisis Break the U.S. Phillips Curve?1
A structural break? Since the global crisis, the combination of high unemployment and a lack of wage
deflation, followed by a period where unemployment was declining steadily without an acceleration in wage
growth, has raised questions as to whether the nature of the unemployment-inflation trade-off has changed.
Particularly, has the Phillips curve flattened or shifted to become less responsive to “slack”?
A multivariate approach. Using a large-cross-section Bayesian Vector Auto Regression and dynamic factor
model that exploits a wide range of data in a flexible framework, we find that there is some evidence, postrecession, that the nature of underlying shocks to the economy has changed. However, there is little
evidence of a change in the coefficients of the Phillips curve. In addition, corporate bond spreads are found
to be an important predictor of unemployment2 and financial and external variables are predictive of
inflation.

Intermediation activity is further migrating from banks to nonbanks and is likely to
continue to do so as policy rates increase. This argues for caution, including in assessing the
effects of higher policy rates on overall risk (Box 8). For instance, mortgage origination and servicing
have, to a large extent, moved off of bank balance sheets into specialized entities that sell the loans
for eventual securitization by government sponsored agencies. As the structure of the housing
finance industry evolves, the associated risks bear close examination. Retail deposits have, so far,
remained in the banks but, as rates rise, money market funds offering higher returns could
increasingly pull funding from the banks (which are constrained by regulatory liquidity measures and
the costs of deposit insurance).

Box 8. Securitization and Monetary Policy: Watch Out for Unintended Consequences
The approach. An empirical exercise was undertaken using a proxy-VAR drawing on flow of funds data to
trace through the effects of higher policy rates on credit flows in different parts of the financial system1.
The role of securitization. Estimates suggest that a monetary policy tightening does act as a liquidity shock
for banks that (temporarily) raises their costs of funds and puts pressure on bank profits, cash flow, and
liquidity. As a result, banks cut
Impact of Higher Policy Rate on Mortgage Credit
back on credit creation.
However, since securitization
provides a source of funding
and liquidity, it also appears
that a higher federal funds
rate causes U.S. banks to
liquefy part of their assets
(mostly mortgages) and
expand lending through
securitization. Specifically, a
monetary policy tightening
causes the total supply of
mortgages and the
securitization of conforming
(i.e., GSE) mortgage loans to
fall. However, higher policy
rates result in an increase in
private-label asset backed
mortgage securities. In
addition, the GSEs themselves
expand lending to the Federal
Home Loan Bank system.

Implication. The evidence suggests that higher policy rates do “get in the cracks” with broad effects on the
financial system but that they do so in very uneven ways. Specifically, our analysis suggests that different
forms of financial intermediation do not react in a uniform way to policy rate shocks. As policy is tightened,
financial activity migrates from bank balance sheets to the less-well monitored non-bank sector (including
via securitization). In the current context, this channel for disintermediation poses a lower risk than in the
past, given the subdued private-label securitization activity. However, in the aftermath of the global financial
crisis, new channels of credit creation have opened up in the nonbank sector (including ETFs and asset
management vehicles) so that the overall impact of monetary policy decisions on financial risks and activities
is far from clear.

Consequences”, IMF Working Paper 16/76 (2016).

36.
Many of the policy recommendations for the nonbanks made during the 2015 IMF
Financial Sector Assessment Program remain pertinent today, but have not been implemented
(Annex II). Two areas are particularly worth reiterating:


Asset managers. On-demand vehicles (such as mutual funds) that are ultimately invested in lessliquid fixed income assets have the potential to create market instability due to liquidity
mismatches and redemption or first-mover risks. As one indicator, the share of less liquid
corporate and foreign bonds held by mutual funds has doubled since 2009, to 21 percent.
Regulation is currently being explored to tackle these risks. However, to adequately analyze the
evolution of interconnections, exposures, and potential buildup of risks among asset managers,
there is a strong case to accelerate the work on building a more complete and transparent data
landscape of the asset management industry. This should go hand in hand with a structured
effort to implement comprehensive stress testing programs for the asset management industry
that focus on liquidity and counterparty risks.



The life insurance industry. The life insurance sector intermediates 30 percent of GDP in assets
that are leveraged. The low-interest rate environment and market pressures to maintain returns
at a sufficient level have forced firms to change asset composition (toward nontraditional asset
classes, private equity, and lower-rated fixed income) and compete on the liability side (through
an increase in unit-linked and guaranteed-return products). However, there is a lack of clarity, at
an overall portfolio level, of the underlying risk profile of the life insurance industry and how it
has evolved (Box 8), and the absence of harmonized national standards or consolidated
supervision makes any assessment of risks in the industry necessarily tentative and incomplete. A
coordinated, nationally consistent approach to regulation (particularly valuation and solvency
requirements), supervision, and stress testing is needed with regulatory oversight assigned to an
independent agency with a nation-wide mandate, operational independence, and appropriate
powers and accountability. For designated institutions, enhanced prudential standards should be
implemented without further delay.

37.
Authorities’ views. Leverage in the system on average does not appear high and risks
appear manageable. However, supervisors were closely watching risks associated with the
concentration of leverage and deteriorating credit quality in certain parts of the system. Over the
past few years there has been a clear recognition of the financial stability concerns that may arise
from liquidity and redemption risks in pooled investment vehicles (particularly mutual funds that
invest in less liquid assets). Work is now underway to improve liquidity management practices,
reporting and disclosure for mutual funds and to impose limits on a fund’s ability to hold assets with
very limited liquidity. While the structure of financial markets is evolving, markets have weathered
well the dislocations in the beginning of the year, indicating that market participants have been
adapting to the new environment. Efforts were ongoing to better understand the structure of
different markets and how they interact. Steps were being taken to build a better database on cash
treasury markets, enhance data collection and reporting on securities lending and repos, and form an
interagency working group to examine the potential risks to financial stability from hedge fund
activity. There was shared concern that regulators do not have a complete picture of the risks being
taken in the nonbank system. The Securities and Exchange Commission is developing proposed rules

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

to enhance the regulatory framework over the U.S. asset management industry, which includes
enhanced reporting and risk management requirements, limits to leverage, and—for registered
investment companies sand advisers—transition planning to address a potential major disruption in
their business. Separately, the alignment of repo and triparty settlement has eliminated intraday
credit risk, thereby completing the triparty repo reform. There was increased concern on the
operational risks to the financial system from a serious failure in either a market’s or an individual
entity’s cyber security protections, an interagency collaboration was underway to better understand
and address these risks.
38.
Important gains have been made in strengthening the financial oversight structure.
Over the past several years a series of decisive measures were put in place to lessen the potential for
financial stability risks, including enhanced capital and liquidity requirements, better underwriting
standards in the housing sector, greater transparency to mitigate counterparty risks, and limits on
proprietary trading. The Dodd Frank Act requirements have stimulated supervisory intensity, with
increased emphasis on banks’ capital planning, stress testing, and corporate governance. The Federal
Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process has proven to be particularly valuable.
Further important regulatory measures have been, or are being, implemented including liquidity risk
requirements for money market and mutual funds; standardization of derivatives products and
markets; measures that reduce banks’ medium term asset-liability mismatch (through the net stable
funding ratio), and a framework for bank recovery and resolution (i.e., rules on living wills and bailinable debt).
39.
These improvements in financial oversight need to be preserved. Eight years after the
inception of the financial crisis, political support behind the reform of the financial system has clearly
ebbed and there is a danger that the indispensable progress that has been made may stall or be
rolled back. Of course, it is natural to recalibrate some aspects of the oversight system as changes
are seen in action. Nevertheless, it will be important to oppose any wholesale or broad-based efforts
to dilute the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
40.
Authorities’ views. There is a strong commitment to continue to strengthen efforts to
monitor potential risks and emerging threats to financial stability. Changes to the structure and
practice of financial system oversight since the financial crisis have served to make the system
stronger, safer, and more resilient. Future changes to the regulatory structure will continue to be
driven by data and evidence-based analysis and will involve broad collaboration among the various
regulators under the umbrella of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. However, as the memory
of the financial crisis fades, there was a risk that some may want to let the guard down on financial
reform. Nevertheless, the administration was committed to ensuring that efforts to roll back the
Dodd-Frank Act would be resisted.

1/ Incl. direct lending, investment banking, and mutual & hedge fund investment

Assets. U.S. life insurers’ investment portfolios have changed considerably over time with a declining
presence of mortgages and rising investments in direct lending, equity, mutual funds, and hedge fund
investments. At the same time, average duration has risen and life insurers are now more sensitive to
abrupt increases in interest rates (although a slow rise in rates would benefit the industry). However,
given the inability of having a clear portfolio view of the asset side of the sector, and the correlations
among asset classes, it is difficult to assess the extent to which credit, liquidity, and market risk of the
sector has changed over time.
Liabilities. U.S. life insurers have increased the share of insurance products that have higher
guarantees or early withdrawal features. As a result, exposure has risen to lapse-induced liquidity risk
(with lapse rates between 4 and 7 percent across large firms). In the event that liquidity shortages give
rise to asset liquidation in volatile markets, the market liquidity risk that is being borne by the life
insurance industry on the liability side has likely risen.
Oversight and supervision. Insurance supervision has been strengthened by bringing it under the
oversight of the FSOC and creating the Federal Insurance Office. However, the regulatory system
remains fragmented at the state level (despite the ongoing internationalization and globalization of the
industry) and Federal Reserve oversight of the systemic insurance groups is still being developed.

41.
The withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships has created spillover risks for
some countries, particularly those that are unable to substitute to other financial connections
in a timely manner. As in other jurisdictions, a number of globally active U.S. banks have been
reducing their correspondent banking relationships with counterparts in a range of countries. There
is a confluence of factors potentially driving this phenomenon—including shortcomings in the
AML/CFT framework in recipient countries, higher supervisory scrutiny, the changing global
economic environment, profitability concerns, low margins in correspondent banking, changing
liquidity and capital requirements, a broader reorientation of bank business models, insufficient
regulatory clarity, reputation concerns of the banks, possible conflicts in regulations (e.g. with data
privacy laws), and economies of scale in compliance. On the U.S. side, the legal framework for
sanctions, AML/CFT, and tax information sharing appears to be applied in a manner that is
proportional to the seriousness of the violation. Nevertheless, regulators should continue their
investments in outreach and in the ongoing clarification of regulatory expectations. While the riskbased regulatory approach should strive to provide more clarity, there should be no expectation that
U.S. regulators and enforcement agencies are able to offer either certainty or “safe harbor”. The U.S.
should continue its efforts to assist recipient countries to build capacity and work with other
jurisdictions to foster global and bilateral solutions to data privacy impediments. Adherence to the
international standards on AML/CFT and the sharing of tax information would help to alleviate
concerns about the adequacy of controls at recipient institutions. It is worth exploring mechanisms
for U.S. financial intermediaries to lessen the fixed costs of compliance and risk management by
pooling resources and exploiting economies of scale (e.g. utilizing specialist transfer and clearing
services, building common platforms, and sharing information on clients). There may also be scope
for U.S. banks to vary more the risk-pricing of correspondent services so as to factor compliance
costs into their fee structure and make the risk-return profile more efficient (see Box 10 and Staff
Discussion Note).
42.
Authorities’ views. Due to the prevalence of U.S. banks in global finance, their withdrawal
from certain correspondence banking relationships has affected certain jurisdictions. The U.S.
remains fully committed to continuing outreach and supporting capacity building in recipient
countries. Recent studies on the impact of withdrawal from corresponding banking relationships on
remittances flows and U.S. dollar clearing have given mixed results so the causes and effects are still
unclear. Regulators noted the increased use of consent orders by U.S. supervisors and the
Department of Justice and the broad intentions to resolve violations with remedial measures taken by
financial institutions. Regulators’ principle focus was to ensure that internal controls were
appropriate and proportional to the risks of the institutions’ operations. Indeed, the supervisors’
preference was for these activities to remain within the regulated financial system but with
institutions having appropriate risk-based controls in place.
43.
A more structured, uniform and complete solution is needed to the current lack of
transparency in beneficial ownership in the U.S. A lack of information on the beneficial
ownership and control of U.S. corporations and trusts has given rise to loopholes for criminal
financial activities, including domestic and foreign based tax evasion. The U.S. authorities recently

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

UNITED STATES

issued regulations to strengthen the requirements for U.S. financial institutions to identify and verify
beneficial owners of the companies whose accounts they maintain. They also proposed regulations
requiring foreign owned, single member companies to provide ownership information to the tax
authorities. However, given that corporate registration and trusts are governed by the states under a
variety of statutes, a complete solution will require federal legislation to make beneficial ownership
information readily available to regulatory and law enforcement bodies.
44.
Authorities’ views. Treasury officials underlined the importance they attach to ensuring a
more transparent and uniform approach to making available beneficial ownership information. They
indicated that that the leaks from the Mossack Fonseca law firm had highlighted the globally
widespread use of corporate entities and trusts to avoid and evade taxes and to conceal corrupt
practices. Officials indicated that the issue of global tax avoidance and evasion was a huge problem
that necessitated both international cooperation and a multilateral solution. Transactions structured
solely around tax avoidance undermined public confidence in the tax system and violated the basic
principle of making sure that everyone pays their fair share. New Treasury regulations will help and
the administration was committed to working with congress to legislate steps to provide regulators
with the information they needed to undertake their statutory obligations.

Box 10. Withdrawal of Correspondent Bank Relationships
Trends and implications. Many globally active banks, including those based in the U.S., have been
scaling back correspondent banking relationships (CBRs). While the number of such relationships has
been declining, there are indications that the volume of correspondent activity continues to rise.
Nevertheless, prospective shifts in CBRs could impair cross-border financial intermediation (including
remittance transfers or trade finance), limit the provision of financial services to certain jurisdictions,
and cause customers and/or activities to migrate to areas with lower regulatory and supervisory
visibility and control.
Multiple drivers. The forces leading to this rearrangement of CBRs have included:


A broader realignment of bank business models as a result of changes to capital and liquidity
rules, the requirement for foreign banks to establish bank holding companies in the U.S., a
structural decline in profitability of various business lines, and significant fixed costs for the
banks associated with maintaining a compliant, risk-based approach to correspondent
activities;



Increasing economic, financial and reputational risks facing banks from undertaking certain
forms of cross-border activities, particularly those that bear the risk of both supervisory and
criminal enforcement actions for the violation of rules on money laundering, financing of
terrorism, tax evasion, sanctions programs, or intermediating the proceeds of narcotics
trafficking;



Tighter post-crisis regulation and broader reporting requirements (including those related to
AML/CFT) that require investments in transaction monitoring systems, processes to flag,
examine and report suspicious transactions, customer due diligence, and the maintenance of
transaction records; and



Conflict of regulations such as those that arise from data privacy constraints on cross-border
information sharing on the transactions in respondent banks and prevent U.S. based banks
from undertaking the needed due diligence with their foreign bank clients.

Regulatory clarity. On balance, the U.S. regulations while complex appear clear and generally well
understood by most global banks, particularly those with a sizeable U.S. footprint. However, some
global banks headquartered in Europe argued that regulations were inconsistently communicated and
unevenly implemented, asking for more regulatory clarity. To their credit, the U.S. authorities have
undertaken extensive outreach and education efforts, particularly to foreign jurisdictions and
internationally active banks. This has included placing in the public domain supervisory manuals, case
law, implementing regulations, and outreach presentations.
A risk-based approach. The U.S. regulators and enforcement agencies have been clear that they are
looking for adequate systems (in terms of compliance function and internal audits) to manage the risks
the financial institutions face. The regulators are not advising the discontinuance of activities but would
prefer the risks are, instead, managed and the activity is maintained within the regulated financial
system. There appears a proportional process of escalation from supervisory involvement, to
enforcement action, and eventually prosecution or sanctions, with most cases being resolved with
remedial measures. The oft-cited cases with large fines have involved egregious, widespread, repeated
and systemic violations of either sanctions rules or the Bank Secrecy Act. Most banks appear to be
assessing CBRs against their risk-return profile, and on a case-by-case rather than wholesale basis.

Box 10. The Evolution of U.S. Correspondent Bank Relationships (concluded)
Policy options:

42



U.S. regulators should continue their investments in outreach, the clarification of regulatory
expectations, and building understanding of the underlying standards relating to AML/CFT,
sanctions, tax issues, and narcotics-linked transactions.



The U.S. should continue its efforts to assist recipient countries to build capacity.



The U.S. should continue to work with other jurisdictions to foster global and bilateral solutions
to data privacy impediments such as helping to structure carve-outs to local privacy laws that
allow for information by other jurisdictions and banks sharing on a narrow set of regulatory
questions (as recently was undertaken with Mexico).



Full compliance with international standards on AML/CFT frameworks or the sharing of tax
information by other jurisdictions and banks will only help to mitigate the risks U.S. banks face
and help alleviate concerns about the adequacy of controls at recipient institutions.



There may be mechanisms for U.S. financial intermediaries to lessen the fixed costs of
compliance and risk management by pooling resources, utilizing specialist transfer and clearing
services, building common platforms, and sharing information on clients. This could be
particularly valuable for small states that are on the recipient side but lack scale in their
transactions.



There may also be scope for U.S. banks to vary more the pricing of correspondent services to
factor compliance costs in their fee structure and make the risk-return profile more attractive.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Growth and inflation. While the pace of the expansion has disappointed over the past few
quarters this is a temporary setback and there are signs healthy growth rates are already resuming in
the second quarter. As remaining slack is eroded, and employment continues to expand, wage and
price inflation should begin to rise, helping to raise average living standards and reverse some of the
loss in labor share of income.
46.
External assessment. The U.S. external position is moderately weaker than implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation and
policies to raise productivity, increase the labor force, and raise saving will help maintain external
stability while achieving full employment.
47.
Supply-side trends. Although near-term prospects for growth are good, over a longer
horizon the U.S. is likely to confront significant complications associated with a confluence of factors:
aging demographics, polarization of the income and wealth distribution, low productivity, declining
labor force participation, a falling labor share of income, compromised dynamism, and high levels of
adult and child poverty. Some of these reflect global trends and are likely to have common causes.
48.
Supply-side policies. The interlinked and complex nature of the supply-side trends facing
the U.S. economy mean that reversing them will require efforts on multiple fronts. These include
protections for low income households (through a combination of a higher federal minimum wage,
more generous earned income tax credit, and a better safety net), a range of benefits to incentivize
work and support families, and efforts linked to infrastructure, education, and trade to raise
productivity. Policymakers must recognize there is significant uncertainty about how the various
possible policy prescriptions will interact. Also, many of the solutions are legislative in nature and will
necessitate building a wide social consensus and congressional action. Efforts to foster broad-based
political support and to seek out common ground will be essential. If implemented, though, such
measures will not only support U.S. economic well-being but, almost universally, have positive
spillover implications for the global economy.
49.
Fiscal policy. Congressional action over the past year has reached a compromise on fiscal
policies that provides the right amount of fiscal support to the U.S. economy. However, those
agreements last only until 2017 and efforts can no longer be deferred on tackling the medium-term
problems facing the budget. Fortunately, the options to achieve the needed adjustment are many
and can accommodate the needed reduction in the medium-term deficit and also fund the
additional fiscal measures to support higher potential growth and diminish poverty.
50.
Monetary policy. The Federal Reserve should remain data dependent. There is a clear case
to proceed along a very gradual upward path for the fed funds rate. Given the likelihood and severity
of downside risks to inflation, the potential for a drift down in inflation expectations, the Federal
Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and the asymmetries posed by
the effective lower bound, the path for policy rates should accept some modest, temporary

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

UNITED STATES

overshooting of the Federal Reserve’s inflation goal to allow inflation to approach the Federal
Reserve’s 2 percent medium-term target from above.
51.
Macrofinancial policies. While there are pockets of financial sector vulnerabilities they are
unlikely to prove systemic. Nevertheless, there are serious data gaps across various parts of the
nonbank system which make it impossible to assess the degree of leverage, vulnerabilities and
interconnections in the broader financial system. Work should focus on building a more complete
and transparent data landscape of the nonbanks. The administration should oppose any attempt to
significantly dilute or backtrack on the important progress made in strengthening the resilience of
the financial system.

Sources: Congressional Budget Office; Office of Management and Budget; and IMF staff estimates
Note: Fiscal projections are based on the March 2016 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the
IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the key provisions of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, including a partial rollback of the Sequester spending cuts in fiscal year 2016.
In fiscal years 2017 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially
replaced, in proportions similar to those already implemented in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, with back-loaded
measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional revenues. Projections also incorporate
the Protecting American From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which extended some existing tax cuts for the short term
and some permanently. Finally, Fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts for key
macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of
defined-benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.

Annex I. Response to Past Policy Advice
Fiscal policy. Public finances remain on an unsustainable path. Over the last few years staff has
emphasized the importance of fixing long standing fiscal problems and normalize the budget
process. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015 were welcome steps. The Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2015 suspended the debt ceiling until March 2017 and approved appropriations for 2016 and
2017, lessening fiscal uncertainties. These agreements, however, did not address the sustainability of
public finances over the medium term. Staff has advocated adopting a medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan to restore long-run fiscal sustainability, stressing that early action is needed to
slow entitlement spending. Anchored by such a plan, staff called for expanding the near-term budget
envelope through specific measures—including front-loaded infrastructure spending, a better tax
system, active labor market policies, and improving educational spending, with these measures
funded by offsetting savings in future years. As part of the Bipartisan Budget Act and Protecting
Americans from Tax Hikes Act, the authorities did expand the near-term deficit and made permanent
various tax measures (including improvements to the EITC, the research and experimentation tax
credit, and child tax credit advocated by staff).
Monetary policy. Staff supported the FOMC remaining data dependent and recommended
deferring the first increase in policy rates until there were greater signs of wage or price inflation
than were evident at the time of the 2015 Article IV Consultation. Based on staff’s macroeconomic
forecast, this implied a gradual path of policy rate increases starting in the first half of 2016. Staff has
also repeatedly stressed the importance of communication and pointed to scope for enhancing the
Fed’s communications toolkit. The Fed did raise rates in December 2015, with little impact on
domestic or international financial markets, and continues to judge further increases in the federal
funds rate based on incoming data. Communications have repeatedly emphasized that the
normalization path will be data dependent and gradual. The Fed continues to maintain a supportive
monetary policy and has made significant efforts—in FOMC statements, press conferences, and
speeches—to prepare markets for the path toward more normal levels of the policy rate.
Monetary policy and financial stability. Staff has recommended that policy rates should not be
used in an effort to either reduce leverage or dampen financial stability risks. Instead, efforts should
be targeted toward strengthening the macroprudential framework, developing regulatory tools, and
addressing gaps in regulation and supervision. The authorities largely agreed saying that “the jury is
still out” on whether such using interest rates for financial stability purposes would be advisable in
the U.S. context. They also said there were other tools available to manage emerging risks (such as
countercyclical capital buffers or margin requirements). Judging from Fed minutes, financial stability
considerations appear not to have been a relevant consideration in recent Fed policy rate decisions.
Financial policies. Based on the 2010 and 2015 FSAPs, staff has recommended multiple steps to
tackle financial sector risks, particularly those related to activities in nonbank intermediaries.
Substantial progress has been made on the national and global financial reform agenda over the last
few years, and many of the policy suggestions have been implemented. These include enhanced
capital and liquidity buffers, strengthened underwriting standards in the housing sector, greater

48

transparency to mitigate counterparty risks, as well as progress in collecting more comprehensive
information to assess risks. Still, several reforms emphasized by staff remain to be completed, such as
addressing remaining vulnerabilities of the money market funds and the tri-party repo market,
reducing data blind-spots, better risk management and stress testing of asset managers, enhancing
the effectiveness of the FSOC, simplifying the institutional structure for financial oversight, and
increasing the resilience of the insurance sector. Annex II provides a fuller summary of progress on
FSAP recommendations.
Structural policies. Staff has recommended structural measures to counter the slowdown in
potential growth and high poverty rates, including further expanding the EITC, increasing the
minimum wage, investing in infrastructure and education, improving the tax system, using active
labor market policies, implementing a broad, skills-based approach to immigration reform and
capitalizing on the gains from rising U.S. energy independence. The Administration has taken
measures to increase wages for employees of federal contractors and some states and localities have
increased minimum wages and mandated paid family leave. Building political consensus on a reform
of the tax system in the direction envisaged by staff (a less complex system with a broader tax base
and lower rates) has made little progress. Support for immigration reform is elusive and there is no
plan to raise the gas tax or to introduce a VAT or a carbon tax. However, the recent tax bill whose
provisions made permanent the enhanced child tax credit, the American Opportunity tax credit for
college tuition, the improved earned income tax credit (expanded to larger families and removing
the marriage penalty), and the research and experimentation credit for corporations.
Housing finance. Staff has stressed policy measures to encourage greater availability of mortgage
credit, while clarifying the future role of government in housing finance. Administrative measures
have been taken to lessen regulatory uncertainties and to transfer risks from the agencies to private
investors through market transactions but more could be done in this direction without legislation
(see 2015 Selected Issues Paper). Legislative proposals to more fundamentally reshape housing
finance have made little headway in Congress.

In end-January 2016, the Federal Reserve (FRB) extended until March 21, 2016 the comment period
for the proposed policy statement detailing the framework the FRB would follow in setting the CCB

proposed policy statement gives details on the range of financial system vulnerabilities and other
factors that could be taken into account as it calibrates the CCB. Further, the FRB also affirmed that
the current level of the CCB should be 0 percent. The FRB consulted with staff of the Federal Deposit

determination.

data sets.
The OFR’s Bilateral Repo Data Collection Pilot Project was the first instance where the OFR went
directly to the industry to collect information. Participation in the pilot project was voluntary and,
specifically, the participating companies provided input to the OFR on what data should be
gathered. While information and data on the triparty and General Collateral Finance (GCF) repo
markets are published regularly, information about bilateral repos (about half of the repo market in
terms of volume) was hardly available, and largely incomplete. The data collection is being made
permanent.
While steady progress in data collection and sharing is being made, there are two areas where more
work needs to be done: (i) The collection of data on securities lending, asset management, and
bilateral repos is still at an early stage; (ii) outstanding obstacles to interagency data sharing should
be reduced, as recommended in the FSAP.

bank's total regulatory capital to another counterparty; (iv) BHCs with less than $50 billion in total
consolidated assets, including community banks, would not be subject to the proposal. Similarly
tailored requirements would also be established for foreign banks operating in the United States.

Guidance on operational risk and interest rate risk: Supervisory guidance and reporting requirements

value of liquid assets). Hence, the NSFR contains elements of liquidity stress test, as well. However,
stress testing exercises, like the DFA stress tests or the CCAR, focus on credit and market risk, not on
funding and market liquidity risk. Authorities do not yet conduct, on regular basis, liquidity stress
tests on nonbanks.
Liquidity stress tests for banks: The final rule on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which requires
large banking organizations to hold a minimum amount of high-quality liquid assets that can be
utilized to meet net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period, was finalized in September 2014.
Firms are required to be fully compliant with the standard by January 1, 2017.
The authorities in May 2016 proposed a rule to strengthen the medium-term funding patterns of
U.S. banks by requiring a minimum amount of available stable funding (Net Stable Funding Ratio,
NSFR) relative the required stable funding. The NSFR would become effective on January 1, 2018.
The NSFR proposal would complement the LCR rule. The proposed rule foresees specifications
conditional on the risk of a particular bank, i.e., the most stringent requirements would apply to the
largest firms (those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in
on-balance sheet foreign exposure, as well as those banking organizations' subsidiary depository
institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more). The proposed rule for the largest BHCs would be
consistent with the liquidity standard agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
BHCs with less than $250 billion, but more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, and less than

$10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure would be subject to a less stringent, modified NSFR
requirement. The rule would not apply to holding companies with less than $50 billion in total
consolidated assets and would not apply to community banks. Holding companies subject to the
proposal would be required to publicly disclose information about their NSFR levels each quarter.
Network analysis, and integration with liquidity and solvency stress tests. The DFA stress tests or the
CCAR do not integrate different risk classes beyond credit and market risk. Tests look at banks
individually, while contagion and spillover risks are not assessed in the tests. Publicly available
information suggests there is no supervisory requirement to integrate in a single framework
different risk factors.

proposals on how to regulate the US asset management industry. These included enhanced data
reporting for registered investment companies and advisers of separately managed accounts; a
strengthening of asset management firms’ liquidity risk management and disclosure; and limits to
leverage obtained through derivatives transactions by registered investment companies. The FSOC’s
review focused on five areas: liquidity and redemption; leverage; operational functions; securities
lending; and firm resolvability. As regards liquidity and redemption risks, the FSOC recommends
implementing requirements for robust liquidity risk management practices for mutual funds,
including stress testing; the issuance of guidelines on funds’ holdings of less liquid assets; enhanced
reporting as well as public disclosure; and the reallocation of redemption costs.

NAVs for MMMFs, which mandate the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate according to
changes in the market-based value of fund assets. The new rules issued by SEC require floating
NAVs for institutional prime MMMFs but allow retail and government MMMFs to continue using an
amortized cost method of pricing where constant NAVs are applied. For the latter group of MMMFs,
the rules provide new tools—liquidity fees and redemption gates—to address potential runs, but
structural vulnerabilities remain. For government MMMFs, the framework remains unchanged. The
rules provide a two-year transition period for their implementation, and are not likely to be revised
again anytime soon.

financial crisis, has been improved. The amount of intra-day credit extended to the collateral

repo settlement with the new triparty settlement process has been achieved by moving the
unwinding of inter-dealer GCF repos to 3:30 pm, largely reducing the need for discretionary
extensions of intraday credit to settle.
It remains important to closely monitor the CCP that settles interbank GCF repo transactions, in
particular as the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation suspends GFC repo transactions on an interbank
basis starting July 2016, and to take further measures to reduce the usage of intraday credit if the
interbank GCF repo program is restored.
Risk of fire-sales of collateral by a dealer loosing access to repo or by a dealer’s creditors: The latter
has been reduced through the use of CCP-like clearing for repo financing, an industry effort
establishing a process for orderly asset liquidation of a defaulted member. And although the risk of
collateral fire-sales has reduced through the introduction of capital and liquidity regulations for
broker-dealers, it remains a significant risk that warrants attention.
Intraday counterparty risk exposure in the tri-party repurchase (repo) market contracted significantly
in recent years, but more work is needed to bring the settlement of General Collateral Finance (GCF)
repo transactions in line with post-crisis reforms. The potential for fire sales of collateral by creditors
of a defaulted broker-dealer also remains a significant risk. Additionally, data gaps continue to limit
firms and market participants. Regulators will need to monitor market responses to new SEC money
market mutual fund (MMF) rules, which become effective this year, and assess where there may be
unforeseen risks, as well as potential regulatory and data gaps associated with other types of cash
management vehicles.

product standardization and increasing liquidity), as well as newly introduced margin requirements
for uncleared swaps constitute important examples of regulatory and supervisory efforts. However,
those apply only to broker-dealers under a bank holding company, and leverage can still be
increased through other instruments (like commercial paper).
In order to reduce the financial stability risk potential of derivatives, US bank swap dealers are now
required to collect and post margin on (almost) all swaps that cannot be centrally cleared. The use
of uncleared derivatives is thereby made less attractive, and will motivate substitution with standard
derivatives that go through central clearinghouses. This measure also helps ensure that a default of a
major OTC derivatives market participant would not bring down the system. As CCPs take on such a
central role in today’s financial markets, it is critical that be both resilient and resolvable.
In December 2015, the SEC proposed rules on the use of derivatives by registered investment
companies, limiting leverage generated through derivatives, and requiring formalized risk
management programs for funds with particularly complex derivatives structures.
In October 2015, FRB, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), OCC, Farm Credit
Administration (FCA), and Federal Housing Finance Association (FHFA) together issued a final rule on
capital and margin requirements for common swap entities (swap dealers, key swap participants,
security-based swap dealers and participants). In parallel, the agencies issued another final rule that
specified which non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps are exempted from the general rule.

The key change here is the use of a variation margin requirement, which will be phased in over six
months starting September 2016.
The European Commission (EC) and the CFTC reached agreement on the Common Approach for
Transatlantic CCPs OTC Derivatives Reform agenda, which will allow the European Securities and
Markets Authority (ESMA) to recognize U.S. CCPs as ‘equivalent’ to EU CCPs for the purpose of
providing their services in the European Union (EU) while complying with CFTC requirements.
Reciprocally, EU CCPs will also be permitted to provide services to U.S. clearing members and clients
while complying with certain corresponding EU requirements. As a result, derivatives clearing
become harmonized across the Atlantic. However, international regulatory and supervisory bodies
should continue to develop rules and standards as market infra- and microstructure evolves. Broader
international harmonization of standards, beyond the U.S.-EU, would help reduce the potential for
regulatory arbitrage, and further enhance the stability of critical market infrastructure.

provide further support to the revisions made by the DFA that a program should not be for the

Entities (GSEs). This means that the availability of mortgages will continue to be wider than without
Fanny and Freddy dominating the market. Lender surveys organized by Fannie or housingrisk.org
further show that credit standards have been loosening continuously since end-2014, indicating that
loan loss impairments for the GSE (despite a recent decline) may increase somewhat going forward.
As a result, the GSEs’ capital buffer could erode going forward, and Treasury funds are needed. Also,
since 2015, the GSEs have to transfer their funds to the Housing Trust Fund (in line with the 2008
Housing and Economic Recovery Act), which puts additional pressure on the GSEs financial situation.
The “Qualified Mortgage” (QM) rule (September 21, 2015) will stimulate the housing market further,
as it provides smaller banks with protection against lawsuits under the Ability-to-repay regulation.
This could in fact mean a competitive advantage for the smaller banks, as well as broader extension

of housing credit in general. Perhaps this advantage can compensate for their low economies of
scale in the high fixed-cost mortgage business. Large banks, on the other hand, continue to tighten
standards and reduce mortgage exposure, resulting in an increase in nonbanks’ market share (see
list of risks further below).
Also, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) continues to push for a modification of the GSEs’
multifamily and single-family operations (“shrink or eventually close”). The discussion centers around
four different options, including a hybrid approach, where investors take the first hit, while the rest is
covered under a federal guarantee (in line with the 2015 Article IV recommendations). However,
there is little momentum for decisive housing market reform.
The House Financial Services Committee in March 2016 passed three bills that aim at reducing small
banks’ regulatory reporting requirements, which would allow regulators to tailor regulations to a
bank or credit union’s business model and risk profile (H.R. 2896), modify the Volcker Rule so that
smaller banks and businesses have easier access to finance (H.R.4096), and exempt from the DoddFrank Act’s risk retention requirements certain qualified commercial real estate loans (H.R. 4620).
The two bills that featured prominently in the 2015 U.S. Article IV Special Issues Paper both did not
pass Congress: House bill “Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act of 2013 - GSE Bailout

risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
The budget deficit in the United States has been reduced significantly over the past few years. Yet, the
public debt ratio remains on an unsustainable trajectory over the medium term. Under the baseline
scenario, public debt is projected to first stabilize, but then to start rising as aging-related spending
pressures on entitlement programs assert themselves and interest rates normalize. Gross financing
needs are large but manageable given the global reserve currency status of the United States. A
medium-term, credible consolidation plan remains a key policy priority.
Background. Significant fiscal consolidation measures were legislated in 2011–13 to tackle the high
public debt ratio, which has doubled at the federal government level since 2007 as a result of the
financial crisis and the ensuing recession. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015 partially
reversed the cuts scheduled to take place in FY2014-2017, replacing them with savings generated
through cuts to mandatory spending in later years and, thus, improving the pace and distribution of
near-term deficit reduction. On the other hand, the Tax Act of 2015, extended many tax cuts through
the medium term and made some permanent, leading to higher deficits in the medium and long
term.
Baseline. Staff’s baseline assumes the current laws, except that the automatic spending cuts beyond
FY2017 would be partially reversed and replaced similar to the deals reached in the Bipartisan
Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015). With these assumptions, the public debt ratio temporarily stabilizes
in 2016–18. However, the debt ratio starts rising again owing to the rising interest rates, as well as
health care and social security related spending pressures from an aging population. Federal debt
held by the public is projected to increase from 75 percent of GDP now to close to 82 percent of
GDP in FY2025, with general government gross debt exceeding 108 percent of GDP by FY2025.
Overall, despite the substantial deficit reduction achieved so far and the legislated savings in the
pipeline, the U.S. public finances remain on an unsustainable trajectory.
Adjustment scenario. The 2015 general
government primary balance was -1½ percent of
GDP. In staff’s view, aiming for a medium-term
general government primary surplus of about
¾ percent of GDP (a federal government surplus of
about 1 percent of GDP) would be appropriate to
put the public debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
The target primary surplus would have to be higher
in the long run to bring the debt ratio closer to the
pre-crisis levels by 2030.

Debt servicing costs. The fiscal projections benefit
from the current favorable interest rate-growth differential. Reflecting accommodative monetary
policy and the safe haven status of the United States, real interest rates have fallen well below GDP
growth. Under the staff’s baseline, the effective interest rate is projected to rise gradually from the
current historical lows and reach about 4¾ percent by 2025 (compared to an average of about
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

UNITED STATES

3½ percent over 2005–2015). As a result, real interest rates will become a major debt-creating flow
over the medium-term.
Realism. Baseline economic assumptions and fiscal projections are generally within the error band
observed for all countries. While ambitious, the projected fiscal adjustment is realistic based on the
consolidation episodes observed in 1990–2011.
Stress tests. The public debt dynamics are highly sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions,
primarily reflecting the fact that the U.S. public debt ratio already exceeds 100 percent of GDP. An
increase of 200 basis points in the sovereign risk premium would mean a debt ratio that is about
15 percentage points above the baseline. If real GDP growth turns out to be one standard deviation
below the baseline, the public debt would increase by about 8 percentage points above the baseline.
A scenario involving a 1 percentage point slippage in the planned consolidation over the next two
years would lead to a debt-to-GDP ratio of 110 percent in 2025. A combined macro-fiscal shock
could raise the public debt ratio as high as 132 percent of GDP by the end of the 10-year horizon. An
exchange rate shock is unlikely to have important implications for debt sustainability in the United
States given that all debt is denominated in local currency and the reserve currency status of the
dollar.
Mitigating factors. The depth and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market as well as its safe haven
status at times of distress represent a mitigating factor for relatively high external financing
requirements.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government
2/ Based on available data
3/ Bond Spread over German Bonds
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange
rate depreciation
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. Also includes ESM capital contribution, arrears clearance, SMP and ANFA income, and the effect of deferred interest
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year

Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) declined from -18.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to -38.8 percent of
GDP in 2015, reflecting sustained current account deficits, stronger performance of the U.S. stock market relative to trading
partners, and valuation changes of foreign currency denominated assets. 1/ Under staff’s baseline scenario, U.S. NIIP would
deteriorate by about 10 percentage points of GDP over the next five years predominantly due to projected current account
deficits. Potential valuation losses including from losses on FDI assets in overseas energy projects are a source of uncertainty.
Assessment. A decline in foreign demand for U.S. debt securities (for example, by a protracted failure to restore long-run fiscal
sustainability) would raise financial stability risks, but at the same time weaken the exchange rate and strengthen the trade
balance. Given the dollar’s reserve currency status, such financial stability concerns are limited. Most U.S. foreign assets are
denominated in foreign currency and over 50 percent are in the form of FDI and portfolio equity claims, whose value tend to
decline when global growth and stock markets are weak, as well as when the U.S. dollar appreciates.

Overall Assessment:
The U.S. external position was
moderately weaker than implied by
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. As of May 2016
the REER has strengthened
marginally relative to the 2015
average, but this does not change the
overall assessment.

Current account

Background. The U.S. current account (CA) balance has narrowed from its pre-crisis height of -6 percent of GDP to -2.6
percent of GDP in 2015 (cyclically adjusted -2.6 percent as well), reflecting a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, higher private
saving, lower investment in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and a stronger energy trade balance (due to the rapid increase
of unconventional energy production). 2/ The CA deficit is expected to rise moderately but steadily from its low point in 2014
through the medium-term as the effects of a stronger U.S. economy and the lagged effects of a more appreciated U.S. dollar
are only partly offset by lower oil prices.
Assessment. The EBA model estimates a cyclically-adjusted CA gap of 1.7 percent of GDP for 2015 which is primarily
accounted for by a (policy-unrelated) residual. In staff’s view, the gap is moderately overstated because the estimation of the
EBA CA norm does not fully account for the discovery of shale oil, which resulted in a substantial wealth gain. Taking this factor
into account, the CA norm should be smaller reducing the CA gap by about ¼ percent of GDP. 3/

The U.S. external position has
improved considerably in recent
years, as have assessed imbalances
and fiscal policy gaps. Nevertheless,
solid U.S. economic performance
and divergence of U.S. growth and
monetary policy prospects from key
trading partners has led to a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar and
a rise in the current account deficit.

Real exchange
rate

Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated in 2015 by about 11 percent compared to 2014 due to solid
U.S. economic performance and divergence of U.S. growth and monetary policy from key trading partners. As of May 2016, the
REER was about 1 percent stronger than its average value over 2015.
Assessment. Indirect estimates of the REER (relying on the EBA current account assessment) suggest the exchange was
overvalued by almost 20 percent in 2015. Direct REER analyses suggest an overvaluation of between 14-23 percent. 4/
Considering all estimates and the uncertainties around them, staff assess the 2015 average REER to be overvalued by 10-20
percent relative to the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Net financial inflows were about 2 percent of GDP in 2015. 5/ Portfolio inflows increased by about 0.4 percent,
year over year, in 2015 but were offset by weaker direct investment and other inflows. On the outflow side, there were further
increases in U.S. portfolio investment overseas, but much less so than in 2014. The stronger outlook for the U.S. economy
compared to its key trading partners, the dollar’s reserve currency status and safe haven motives continue to boost foreign
demand for U.S. Treasury securities.
Assessment. The U.S. has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are limited by the dollar’s status as a reserve currency
and the U.S. role as a safe haven.

FX intervention
& reserves level

Assessment. The dollar has the status of a global reserve currency. Reserves held by the U.S. are typically low relative to
standard metrics but the currency is free floating.

Recommended policies:
Over the medium term, fiscal
consolidation should aim for a
general government primary surplus
of about ¾ percent of GDP (a
federal government primary surplus
of about 1 percent of GDP).
Structural policies should be
implemented to raise productivity,
increase labor force growth, and,
thus, raise saving. This would be
consistent with maintaining external
stability while achieving full
employment.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ The U.S. has a positive net equity position, with sizable portfolio equity and direct investment abroad, and a negative debt position vis-à-vis the rest of the world,
owing to sizeable foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds. Gross assets and liabilities are about 140 and 180 per cent of GDP, respectively.
2/ The oil and gas portion of the CA had a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015, 0.5 percentage points lower than in 2014, reflecting less net imports and lower oil
prices.
3/ Because of the discovery of shale and related investments to build capacity for exports, the CA norm is estimated to be about 0.25 percent of GDP smaller than the
one estimated by EBA, hence narrowing the gap.
4/ The two direct EBA models are the REER Index model and the REER Level model.
5/ This is substantially below pre-crisis levels of about 5.0 percent of GDP.

Exchange Rate Arrangements. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar floats independently and is
determined freely in the foreign exchange market. The United States has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the IMF's Articles of Agreement and maintains an
exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those measures imposed for security
reasons. The United States notifies the maintenance of measures imposed for security reasons under
Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). The last of these notifications was made June 3, 2016.

Article IV Consultation. The 2015 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 6, 2015 and the
Staff Report was published as IMF Country Report No. 15/322. A fiscal Report of Observance of
Standards and Codes was completed in the context of the 2003 consultation.
The 2016 Article IV discussions took place May 23–June 9, 2016. Concluding meetings with
Chair Yellen of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Treasury Secretary Lew
occurred on June 20 and June 21 respectively. The Managing Director, Ms. Lagarde, the Deputy
Managing Director, Mr. Zhu, and WHD Director, Mr. Werner, participated in the concluding
meetings. A press conference on the consultation was held on June 22, 2016. The team comprised
Nigel Chalk (head), Yasser Abdih, Ali Alichi, Ravi Balakrishnan, Stephan Danninger, Emanuel Kopp,
Andrea Pescatori, Damien Puy (all WHD), Christian Henn and Stefan Laseen (SPR), Thornton
Matheson (FAD), and Emmanuel Mathias (LEG). Mr. Sabharwal (Executive Director), Mr. Haarsager
(Senior Advisor) and Mr. Hall (Advisor) attended some of the meetings. Outreach included
discussions with Congressional staff, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO, private sector
representatives, and think tanks. Unless an objection from the authorities of the United States is
received prior to the conclusion of the Board’s consideration, the document will be published.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical Issues. Comprehensive economic data are available for the United States on a timely
basis. The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of U.S. economic data are adequate for
surveillance. The United States has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 8, 2016
1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Better activity data for the first two quarters of the year. Growth in the first
quarter was revised up from 0.8 to 1.1 percent due to stronger net exports and non-residential
investment. The revised estimate is broadly in line with staff’s expectation based on high
frequency activity indicator models. Real private consumption expenditure (PCE) for April
and May grew by 0.8 and 0.3 percent m/m, respectively. The strong spending momentum and
upward revision to first quarter growth strengthen the basis for staff’s growth forecast of
2.2 percent in 2016.
3.
Uncertainty surrounding the implications of the U.K. referendum. U.S. markets
reacted negatively to the result of the U.K. referendum. After a sell-off in risk assets in the
first two days, U.S. stock markets have recovered and the U.S. dollar, in nominal effective
terms, has appreciated by less than 1 percent. Long-term treasury yields have fallen
substantially to 1.4 percent on 10-year bonds, driven by safe haven flows and expectations of
a slower pace of future policy rate increases. Continued bouts of financial market volatility or
a further appreciation of the U.S. dollar are possible. The team expects the impact on the
baseline to be small but because of uncertainty about the economic fallout, risks to the
outlook appear now as skewed to the downside. Should downside risks materialize, interest
rate increases should be delayed in line with a data dependent approach. Near-term fiscal
spending could be increased in the event that growth decelerates substantially.
4.
On June 30, the President signed a bill to provide a framework to restructure
Puerto Rico’s debt. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act
(“PROMESA”) puts in place an oversight board for the Commonwealth, imposes a stay on
creditor action, and establishes a collective action mechanism for restructuring existing
bonds. The collective action mechanism allows creditors holding over two-thirds of the
outstanding principal of the bonds within a pool to bind the minority. In the event a voluntary
restructuring agreements cannot be reached, the law provides for a U.S. court-supervised
restructuring process (replicating a number of the provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy
Code). After passage of the law, Puerto Rico defaulted on US$1.9 billion of debt obligations.
5.
The Federal Reserve published results of its 2016 Comprehensive Capital
Assessment Program (CCAR). Owing mainly to strengthened capital buffers, all 33
participating bank holding companies passed the supervisory stress test, which was based on
stringent scenarios including a long recession and negative yields on U.S. Treasuries.
However, the Federal Reserve objected to the capital plans of U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche
Bank and Banco Santander on the basis of qualitative factors related to capital planning.
