IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis
On July 8, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with St. Kitts and Nevis, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
St. Kitts and Nevis successfully exited the Post-Program Monitoring Framework in October
2015, maintaining favorable macroeconomic performance and a broadly stable financial system.
The economy continued its strong growth at around 5 percent, recording the strongest growth in
the region over 2013-2015. Strong growth has been underpinned by construction and tourism
sector activity and their favorable spillovers on the rest of the economy, supported by surging
inflows from its Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program. Large CBI inflows continued in
2015, albeit at a slower pace, reflecting the temporary impact of the program reform and
increased competition from similar programs in the region. Consumer price inflation turned
negative, owing to lower global commodity prices and recent VAT and Import Duty exemptions
on food items that carry a large weight in the CPI basket. The banking system remained broadly
stable with comfortable capital and liquidity buffers, but high levels of nonperforming loans
(NPLs), low profitability, and slow progress with land sales have created pockets of
vulnerability, adding to the risks from regional financial developments.
The fiscal position remained in surplus, but weakened compared to previous years, owing to a
slowdown in CBI receipts to the budget, delays in grants, and the impact of the 2014-2015 VAT
and Import Duty exemptions. Notwithstanding, the debt-to-GDP ratio continued its impressive
downward trajectory and is projected to reach the ECCU’s 60 percent target in 2017, well ahead
of peers.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a proposal can be
considered without convening formal discussions.

2
The medium-term outlook is positive, but remains dependent on developments in CBI inflows.
Growth is expected to moderate to 3.5 percent in 2016 and 3 percent, on average, over the
medium term, reflecting projected tapering of CBI-related construction activity as the pace of
new CBI applications normalize from recent peaks, including due to higher competition.
Potential spillovers from weak growth prospects in key tourism source markets, regional
financial sector challenges, including derisking trends, and exposure to natural disasters pose
additional downside risks to the outlook. However, CBI inflows and favorable spillovers from a
protracted low oil price could surprise on the upside.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal as follows:
Although St. Kitts and Nevis continued to enjoy strong macroeconomic performance in recent
years, the outlook is highly dependent on developments in the CBI program. A multi-pronged
strategy is needed to preserve macro-financial stability and hard-earned gains in debt
sustainability. The elements of such a strategy include: (i) strengthening the fiscal framework to
reduce reliance on CBI inflows, while preserving the accumulated savings from the CBI program
and further improving public financial management; (ii) resolving the debt-land swap to
safeguard financial stability, while mitigating emerging financial sector risks; and (iii) enhancing
competitiveness, diversification, and resilience to shocks, including from natural disasters.
A prudent medium-term fiscal framework with a zero primary balance target, net of CBI receipts
and Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) grants, would help safeguard fiscal
sustainability, with the adjustment paced over the medium-term. The framework would help
build resilience to negative surprises in future CBI inflows, and facilitate accumulation of fiscal
buffers to address external shocks and absorb unforeseen financing needs if tax performance
disappoints after CBI flows decline. Implementing this framework requires broadening the tax
base, including by streamlining tax incentives and further improving compliance, especially at
the Nevis Island Administration (NIA) level, as well as containing recurrent spending. The
authorities’ commitment to a comprehensive review of the concessions regime is welcome, as
well as plans to contain the wage bill and spending on goods and services.
Establishing a ‘Growth and Resilience Fund’ can help preserve the accumulated savings from the
CBI program, while providing a contingency buffer for future shocks, such as costly natural
disasters. The fund should have a prudent investment strategy, with appropriate governance and
accountability, and its flows fully integrated with the fiscal framework with the zero primarybalance-target. Investing the funds in safe instruments abroad according to appropriate
investment guidelines should help reduce risks to financial stability by easing banks’ excess
liquidity pressures. A comprehensive investment and debt management strategy that optimizes
the government balance sheet through further debt reduction and improves the cost and

3
composition of debt would complement efforts to build adequate buffers as self-insurance for
future shocks.
The authorities should press ahead with structural reforms that strengthen public financial
management. In this context, strengthening the NIA’s budget framework, tax policy, and revenue
administration, and better coordination with central government on the sharing of VAT and CBI
revenues are crucial for the Federation’s fiscal sustainability. Enhancing oversight of public
corporations and enforcing timely reporting of their audited financial statements are also critical
to safeguarding the sustainability of the consolidated public sector position. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ efforts to enhance the transparency of SIDF financial reporting and commitment to
streamline and re-orient the People Employment Program. Plans for potential integration of the
SIDF with the government’s Consolidated Fund should enhance assessment and management of
the overall fiscal policy stance.
A clear framework for resolving the debt-land swap is crucial to preserve the credibility of debt
restructuring, the hard-earned gains in debt sustainability, and financial sector stability. With the
appointment of the SLSC board of directors and approval of the two sale offers recently, the
SLSC can be operationalized as a marketing agent to sell the remaining plots of land, including
to the diaspora. A clear strategy should be developed to enable reasonable progress with land
sales, to remove the policy uncertainty around the swap. While setting up this framework, staff
recommends the consideration of a temporary extension of the dividend guarantee on unsold
land, at possible renegotiated terms, and agreement on the reporting treatment of the swap by all
parties—the banks, the regulator, and the government.
Preserving financial stability also calls for further strengthening of the supervisory frameworks
for banks and nonbanks and more systematic coordination between their regulatory authorities.
Further supervisory strengthening would help capture weaknesses in growing market segments.
A more systematic coordination between the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the
Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) will help limit potential risks from linkages
between banks and nonbanks and between onshore financial institutions and those operating
internationally. Implementing the new Banking Law will also enable the ECCB to conduct
consolidated and risk-based supervision and address potential spillover risks. Trends in
Correspondent Banking Relationships (CBRs) need to be systematically monitored to limit the
risk of losing CBRs, as well as maintaining a watertight AML/CFT regime with adequate
financial disclosure, and full compliance with international standards on transparency and
exchange of tax information.
A structural reform agenda that focuses on economic diversification, improved business
environment, and contingency planning should enhance resilience to external shocks and bolster
long-run growth potential. Ongoing efforts to improve the business environment and addressing
the skills gap will provide an enabling environment for private sector development and help
attract foreign investment crucial to financing the current account. Investing in targeted

4
transformative projects (including by broadening options under the CBI program to include
business investment in renewable energy, education and health) will improve competitiveness,
diversification, and resilience of the economy, including to natural disasters.
Urgent attention is needed to improve the quality of statistical data. In particular, addressing
shortfalls in Balance of Payments, National Accounts, and labor market statistics is critical to
enhancing surveillance and providing better basis for policy decisions.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 23, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The 2016 Article IV consultation is the first since St. Kitts and Nevis exited the
Post-Program Monitoring Framework in October 2015 following the conclusion of the
Stand-By Arrangement in July 2014, with purchases of 532 percent of quota fully repaid
as of end-April 2016. In 2015, economic activity remained robust and there was a
sizeable fiscal surplus. This surplus, however, was significantly weaker than in recent
years, owing to a slowdown in receipts from the Citizenship-By-Investment (CBI)
program, recent tax exemptions, and other one-off factors. Public debt fell to 68 percent
of GDP, from 159 percent in 2010.
Article IV: The consultation focused on preserving the economic gains accumulated
over the last half-decade. Key issues included steps needed to cement the improvement
in debt sustainability from the debt-land swap, while maintaining the soundness of
domestic banks’ balance sheets. Staff proposed a medium-term fiscal framework that
reduces reliance on CBI inflows, while building fiscal buffers to safeguard sustainability
and enhancing resilience to external shocks, including from natural disasters. Discussions
with financial sector participants and regulators focused on reducing macro-financial
risks and on effects of de-risking for domestic banks, reforms to enhance the business
environment, diversify the economy, and restore healthy credit growth.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the key
economic challenges and policy recommendations and concurred on the need to
safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability in the face of increased risks to future CBI
inflows. They agreed with the need for a comprehensive review of the tax concession
regime and to contain recurrent expenditures, but preferred a less ambitious timeline in
the medium term. The authorities intend to launch a ‘Growth and Resilience Fund’,
following Cabinet approval, to safeguard fiscal buffers to address future shocks within a
transparent framework, while exploring further reduction of debt, where possible. They
also intend to resolve uncertainties in the debt-land swap, and are considering best
options to contribute to long-term development of the local economy and national
interests.

CONTEXT
1.
St. Kitts and Nevis continues to enjoy broadly favorable macroeconomic
developments. Over 2013-2015, the country recorded the strongest growth and fiscal results in the
region, supported by surging inflows from its Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program that
facilitated accumulation of substantial fiscal buffers. Under their home-grown program that
concluded in July 2014, the authorities implemented substantial fiscal consolidation measures and a
major debt restructuring, including an innovative debt-land swap with domestic banks that helped
reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 68 percent, the lowest in the region. The structural reform agenda
has achieved significant improvements in tax administration and public financial management.
Additional efforts are needed to secure these gains, while enhancing the resilience of the economy
to shocks, including from natural disasters, a sudden stop in CBI inflows, and domestic and regional
financial sector risks.

3.
The overall fiscal balance remained in surplus in 2015, at an estimated 5 percent of
GDP, but has significantly weakened compared to recent years. Weaker performance partly
reflects the decline in CBI receipts to the budget (to an estimated 12 percent, from 14 percent of
GDP in 2014). The decline was partly due to

GDP. Notwithstanding savings on the
interest bill and goods and services, delays in external grants from the EU and one-off financing of
the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) spending (due to the delayed appointment of
its board of directors) further worsened the overall balance by 1.5 percent of GDP. On an underlying
basis, excluding CBI receipts and SIDF grants, the overall deficit increased from 6 to 6.9 percent of
GDP. Public debt has continued its impressive downward trajectory, to 68 percent of GDP at end2015, and is projected to reach the ECCU’s 2030 debt-to-GDP target of 60 percent in 2017, well
ahead of peers.
4.
The domestic banking system remains stable, but has pockets of vulnerability. The
reported capital-adequacy ratio
(CAR) remains high at 22 percent
as of end-2015. (A different
regulatory treatment of land
assets in bank balance sheets
would imply a lower ratio, but
still comfortably above the
regulatory minimum—see
below.) The nonperforming
loans (NPLs) ratio is high and
rising, even after adjusting for the impact of the debt-land swap on the size of the banks’ loan
portfolio.1 Banks’ appetite for lending is dampened by the high level of NPLs, and by the limited
number of projects deemed bankable (in particular for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
1

Swapping banks’ public sector loans for land reduced the size of their loan portfolio, leading to an initial rise in
NPLs. The rise in the NPL ratio in 2015 to 22.2 percent reflects reclassification of a Nevis Island Administration loan as
nonperforming—discussions for the loan’s resolution are ongoing.

perceived as risky), despite strong economic activity and high banking system liquidity. Private
sector credit growth hence remains subdued, at 3.2 percent in 2015 following two years of negative
to flat growth. Ample project funding through the CBI program and limited government borrowing
needs also contain credit growth. Limited lending, along with a growing deposit base and the high
cost of funds induced by the ECCB’s 2 percent interest rate floor on savings accounts, in turn, put
pressure on indigenous banks’ profitability.
5.
External sector performance presents a mixed picture, with an accurate assessment
hampered by significant shortcomings in balance of payment statistics.2 While the current
account deficit remained stable at an estimated 12 percent of GDP in 2015,3 the international
investment position has deteriorated significantly from a recent peak (Figure 4). Reduced CBI
budgetary receipts (which appear as service receipts in the current account) and lower foreign
grants in 2015 were largely offset by an estimated decline in merchandise imports—the latter
reflecting the significant drop in fuel and commodity prices and lower imports of construction
materials. CBI-related inflows, including capital transfers and CBI-linked FDI, continued to finance
the current account deficit. However, net international reserves and commercial banks’ net foreign
assets (NFA) fell for the first time since 2010, indicating a significant drain on foreign currency assets,
even after adjusting for large repayments to external creditors in 2015.4

Distortions arise from inaccurate estimation of tourism receipts, spending by the large foreign student population,
and significant underestimation of the volume of merchandise imports and exports since 2013; these have
complicated the assessment of the current account balance (see Annex II). Further, the methodology for estimating
foreign direct investment (FDI) based on transfer of title from the land and property registry does not capture foreign
developers’ significant investment spending on construction, while CBI-related inflows of foreign currency deposits
to domestic banks through the real estate route also appear underestimated. The ECCB is currently revising external
sector statistics with new surveys using the BPM6 methodology. Technical assistance from CARTAC and IMF
headquarters is being mobilized to address the significant data gaps.

The decline may be partly explained by the slowdown in new CBI investment commitments through the real estate
option, while real estate developers continued funding construction activity by drawing down on their balances—in
effect, reducing banks’ NFA.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable, but risks are tilted to the downside and
are particularly subject to future developments in CBI inflows. The flow of new CBI applications
has declined significantly since mid-2015, compared to the average flow in 2014, reflecting, in part,
the negative impact of the loss of visa-free access to Canada and the US FinCEN advisory.5 Growing
regional and global competition, global security concerns, and rising international migration pose
downside risks to future CBI inflows, with budget receipts projected to fall closer to the budgeted
figures over 2016-2018.6 CBI-related FDI is
also expected to moderate, with real estate

7.
Economic activity is projected to slow as the surge in construction activity tapers off.
Growth is expected to moderate to 3.5 percent in 2016 and 3 percent, on average, over the medium
term, with a projected contraction in construction after 2019. By then, most projects would have
reached completion and a large number of new real-estate developments would become eligible for
resale to new CBI applicants following expiration of the mandated 5-year holding period. Tourist
arrivals are projected to continue recovering, bolstered by the new CBI-funded tourism facilities, the
bulk of which are expected to come on stream over 2017-19. Inflation is expected to remain below 2
percent over the medium term, benefitting from the projected weakness in commodity prices and
subdued inflation in key trade partners. The projected decline in CBI inflows is also expected to
widen the current account deficit over the medium term and increase pressures on the net
international investment position. On the upside, stronger-than-projected CBI inflows and a
protracted period of low oil prices could support growth compared to the baseline.

St. Kitts and Nevis. Following these actions, the authorities implemented a comprehensive reform program, including
enhanced due diligence procedures for applicants.

The decline in new applications has not affected budgetary receipts in 2015 owing to the significant clearance of
the backlog of applications accumulated in previous years.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on (i) strengthening the fiscal framework to increase the resilience of fiscal
performance to negative surprises in future CBI inflows, preserve debt sustainability, and further
improve public financial management; (ii) safeguarding financial stability, while resolving the debtland swap and mitigating emerging domestic and regional risks; and (iii) enhancing the economy’s
competitiveness, diversification, and resilience to shocks, including from natural disasters.

A. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
8.
Notwithstanding the significant fiscal adjustment and debt restructuring under the
Fund-supported program, the strength of the economic recovery and fiscal performance in
recent years owes much to the strong CBI inflows and their spillovers across the economy.
Critical goals are to increase the resilience of fiscal performance through a prudent medium-term
fiscal framework, ensure continued accumulation of savings from the CBI revenue windfall, and press
ahead with reforms to enhance public financial management, in order to preserve fiscal and debt
sustainability.
9.
Despite efforts to maintain a reasonably prudent budget framework, fiscal policy has
been expansionary and procyclical in recent years. The underlying fiscal position, measured by
the fiscal deficit net of CBI budgetary receipts and SIDF grants, has been an average -6½ percent of
GDP since 2013.8 The expansionary stance coincided with a surge in CBI inflows (at about 40 percent
of GDP annually over 2012-15), which, besides financing the underlying deficit, also contributed to
the SIDF, with the remaining large share flowing to the construction sector through the program’s
real-estate investment option. The quasi-fiscal activities of the SIDF increased the fiscal impulse,
observed through the widening of the consolidated public sector deficit by about 5 percent of GDP
over 2013-2015. This reflects SIDF’s sizeable spending on social programs (e.g., the People
Employment Program (PEP)) and funding of other public and private investment projects that
further boosted the construction boom. This off-budget activity has made it difficult for the

11.
Challenges facing the Nevis Island Administration (NIA) and some public corporations
have persisted. The NIA continues to face significant financing constraints and has more recently
relied on short-term T-bills, overdrafts and ad hoc fiscal transfers from central government to
finance its deficit, while rolling over a sizeable stock of budgetary arrears (about 0.5 percent of GDP).
The St. Kitts Electricity Company, SKELEC, runs significant arrears to its fuel supplier (PDVSKN) and
remains unable to service its debt due to cash flow problems from slow collection of bills. Ensuring
adequate oversight of public corporations and timely audited financial statements remains a
challenge.
12.
Safeguarding fiscal sustainability requires a prudent medium-term fiscal framework
anchored by a General Government zero-primary-balance target net of CBI receipts and SIDF
grants.10 Adhering to such a target would (i) reduce the risk of weakening fiscal discipline and
dependence on CBI inflows and SIDF grants and (ii) facilitate saving the bulk of CBI-related inflows
to the budget, including upside surprises. The framework aims to (i) build resilience to a sudden
stop in CBI flows, by financing the budget from domestic revenues and safeguarding against large
deficits if tax performance disappoints after CBI-related activities dry up, and to (ii) dampen the
fiscal impulse from the SIDF’s quasi-fiscal spending and other public sector activities. A credible

The target is also adjusted to offset the government’s 3.5 percent dividend payment on unsold land from the debtland swap; this temporary payment replaced the high interest rate banks previously received on government debt,
with a view to safeguarding bank stability until land sales are mobilized (see text table).

the local government level (NIA). Revenues forgone from tax exemptions at customs are estimated
at 6 percent of GDP (large by international standards)—including 1.3 percent from the recent VAT
and Import Duty exemptions on food and other items, and 1.2 percent on construction materials
and vehicles.11 Addressing the specific features of the tax concession system with TA support and
necessary administrative and legislative reforms in consultation with the private sector would
facilitate successful implementation. The reformed concession system should be rule-based, with
limited discretion, to ensure consistency with the fiscal framework. Increasing property tax intake
can also contribute to meeting the target, including by updating property valuations and enhancing
compliance (particularly by economic citizens through the CBI program). Cabinet approval on an
action plan to meet the underlying primary-balance target, at both central government and NIA
levels, would help entrench fiscal discipline in the Federation.
Authorities’ views
The authorities agreed on the need to enhance resilience to downside risks in CBI flows and
to reinforce a culture of savings. They broadly agreed with staff’s proposed measures to
strengthen structural revenue sources but preferred a more gradual pace of adjustment.

They expressed commitment to a comprehensive review of the tax concession regime,
particularly as it relates to concessions on VAT, Customs Service Charge, Stamp Duties,
Property Tax, Withholding Tax and Import Duties, and intention to continue efforts to
contain growth in recurrent expenditure, by formulating a preset 3-year package to contain
the wage bill, restraining new hires to the civil service, and containing growth in spending on
goods and services. They also support a regional fiscal responsibility law and wish to explore
fiscal rules in a regional context to strengthen fiscal discipline.
14.
A comprehensive investment and debt management strategy is needed to optimize
the government balance sheet, through further debt reduction where possible, and improved
cost and composition, while maintaining adequate buffers for possible shocks. Using CBI
resources to retire debt remains a policy priority, to increase fiscal space and reduce the debtservice burden. Staff urged progress on finalizing negotiations on restructuring the debt to PDVSA
and resolving accumulated arrears (about 2.7 percent of GDP). Staff also recommended reducing
outstanding T-bills, particularly those held by private investors (2.7 percent of GDP), lowering the
average interest rate on debt instruments, and lengthening their maturities (including possible
issuance of a 2-year T-bond) to support debt sustainability.12 A comprehensive strategy that
considers the impact of these actions on the earning assets of financial institutions (banks, insurance
companies, and the Social Security Board) is also needed.
15.
Introducing a ‘Growth and Resilience Fund’ (GRF) can provide an effective and
transparent framework to manage the savings from the CBI program, while providing a
buffer for future shocks. Staff encouraged setting up a fund with a simple sovereign wealth fund
(SWF) structure that operates as a financing fund, fully integrated with the fiscal framework—that is,
linking the fund’s flows directly to the fiscal balance, which in turn adheres to the zero-primary
balance target, net of CBI receipts and SIDF grants. The GRF would serve as a contingency buffer to
address future shocks, such as natural disasters, consistent with staff’s previous recommendations,
best practices in setting up SWFs for revenue windfalls,13 and recent Fund advice on managing fiscal
risks.14 The fund would enhance the governance and accountability framework for managing CBI
resources, including through transparent reporting on the use of saved resources to Parliament. In
using the resources, staff cautioned against rigid withdrawal/accumulation rules that can complicate
budget financing. Staff recommended management of financial assets according to appropriate
investment guidelines that define risk tolerance and investment horizon, and placing the funds in
safe investments overseas to ease excess liquidity pressures in banks and limit incentives to take
undue risks to boost profitability.

savings, with a view to supporting sustainable development over the medium term. They
have been taking steps to set up a fund to support resilience and preserve CBI-generated
savings at the Federation level, but noted sensitivities to investing the funds abroad. They
noted that the room for further debt repayments is limited but the intention is to press
ahead with resolving arrears to PDVSA. The authorities have already taken steps to change
the composition of the T-bill portfolio towards longer maturities, reduced interest rates by 1
percentage point (from May 2016), strictly limited issuing T-bills to new investors, and
refrained from rolling over interest. They expressed interest in TA to develop an effective
debt strategy to issue longer-dated instruments.
16.
A careful strategy is needed to manage SIDF finances in light of its declining revenue
stream and significant drain on its resources. CBI contributions to the SIDF, net of processing,
marketing and due diligence fees, have declined by around 30 percent in 2015, reflecting an
increasing share of applications to the real-estate option (which offers possible divestment after
5 years and a potential interim return). Competition from other programs that accept lower
contributions to their national development fund has further dampened the SIDF’s appeal. Staff
projects SIDF net contribution income to be subdued in 2016 (at about 4 percent of GDP), against a
projected expenditure of about 3½ percent of GDP (including capital grants to the government of
1 percent in 2016, with the remainder on extra-budgetary social programs—mainly to finance PEP).
17.
A number of steps recently undertaken will help in better managing SIDF finances.
Staff welcomed ongoing efforts to streamline and reorient PEP as a training, rather than a social,
program.15 Staff supported the government’s initiative to increase the transparency of SIDF financial
reporting, including progress in publishing financial statements and the ongoing forensic audit. Staff
welcomed plans for potential integration of the SIDF with the government’s Consolidated Fund,16 in
line with previous recommendations,17 and encouraged the development of a comprehensive fiscal
perimeter, reflecting the SIDF’s quasi-fiscal activities, to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment
of the fiscal policy stance. At the same time, staff noted that the SIDF’s existing portfolio of equity
investments in key tourism projects might require private sector experience to ensure adequate
returns to the nation and minimize contingent liability risks to the government. Centralizing the
investment budget at the Ministry of Finance can facilitate efficient allocation of resources towards
well-targeted transformative priority projects that support long-run potential growth.
Authorities’ views
The authorities were mindful of the increasing challenges to SIDF finances and noted plans
to recruit the necessary expertise to devise a reform strategy after the ongoing forensic
audit is completed. They stressed the significant progress in reducing the size and cost of
PEP and reorienting its focus, with the support of the Technical and Vocational Education

and Training Council; the Council will provide program participants with vocational
certification to facilitate graduation to the job market, gradually bringing the program to
sustainable levels and reducing its drain on SIDF resources.
18.
Further strengthening of public financial management, particularly at the NIA and
public corporations, is critical to protecting fiscal and debt sustainability of the Federation.
Improving the NIA’s budget framework and debt management strategy is crucial. Strengthening its
fiscal position requires improvement in its revenue stream, by refraining from renewing concessions
to long-standing investors in Nevis and enhancing tax policy and revenue administration. A clear
mechanism for sharing VAT and CBI revenues between the two islands is needed to minimize ad hoc
transfers and expenditure overruns that weaken the overall fiscal position. The NIA can also build
cash buffers over the near term given its limited access to new credit and high rollover risk from the
short-maturity of its T-bill portfolio. Resolving persistent cash flow challenges at SKELEC and
improving its bill collection rates are needed to enable servicing its debt. The authorities are also
encouraged to continue efforts to fully operationalize the ASYCUDA World system to increase the
efficiency of reporting at the Customs and Excise Department—a critical element for monitoring and
implementing reforms to the tax concession system. Finally, an action plan is needed following
completion of the payroll audit, and, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Social Security
Board, prompt implementation of the parametric reforms highlighted in the Final Report on the 10th
Actuarial Review of the Social Security Fund.
Authorities’ views


The authorities agreed with the need to strengthen revenue administration in Nevis,
particularly at Customs, and the need for legislative action to revise property tax valuations.
They noted that some of the concessions granted at NIA were not sustainable and further
efforts were needed to improve its tax performance.

appointing the new board of directors. Further delays in land sales may require banks to start
provisioning for unsold land in line with the ECCB’s prudential requirement to divest seized collateral
assets within 5 years, adding to banks’ challenges.
20.
Establishing a clear framework for completing the debt-land swap is crucial to
preserve the credibility of the debt restructuring and hard-earned gains in debt sustainability,
while protecting financial stability. The significant achievements in creating fiscal space, putting
the public debt on a firm downward trajectory, and building sizable buffers will be jeopardized if the
second leg of the restructuring is not completed by divesting the land within a timeframe consistent
with the ECCB’s regulatory guidelines. In this

21.
In the interim, the economic and legal treatment of the debt-land swap needs to be
clarified and agreed by all parties—the banks, the regulator, and the government. The legal
transaction of transferring the land to banks extinguished public debt, as envisaged under the swap
agreement. However, in 2014Q3, the ECCB reclassified the banks’ holdings of SPV shares as de facto
government exposure, assigning a zero risk-weight in computing the CAR, compared to a previous
100 percent risk weight.18 The new treatment results in a reported CAR of 22.3 percent as of endDecember 2015, compared to 15.3 percent if the full risk weight were applied. Staff urged the
authorities, the ECCB and the banks to agree on a uniform treatment of the swap to better assess
the loss-absorption capacity of the banking system.
Authorities’ views

The authorities noted the Cabinet approval of the purchase offers and signaled commitment
to moving forward with the debt-land swap, including by considering all credible purchase

The reclassification considers the SPV shares as a financial investment in government securities collateralized by

offers, while ensuring that national interest is preserved and the resulting investment
contributes to the economy. In addition, the Cabinet will examine other policy options that
can further expedite the downward trajectory of the national debt. They are also cognizant
of the need to safeguard bank soundness, while considering options to reduce the annual
cost to government of dividend payments on unsold land. The authorities agree on the need
to articulate a pro-active role for the SLSC in marketing the land and are engaging with the
ECCB on adopting a consistent treatment of the swap in the balance sheets of both the
government and the banks.
22.
Rapid progress is needed to resolve the high level of NPLs in the banking system and
restore sustainable private sector credit growth. Like in other ECCU countries, a protracted
foreclosure process, with difficulties in seizing and divesting collateral, slows down the NPL
resolution process. As a result, banks have tightened lending standards and exercise caution in new
lending (especially to SMEs perceived as high-risk borrowers in the absence of adequate business
plans, cash flow projections, and audited financial statements), despite the high level of liquidity in
the system. Legislative reforms, including the draft regional Foreclosure Law (targeted for
implementation by end-2016) and the recent passage of the Eastern Caribbean Asset Management
Corporation (ECAMC) Act, should support banks’ efforts in lowering their NPL ratios, stimulating
credit growth and improving profitability. Educating borrowers, creating a culture of business
planning, and establishing credit bureaus should also help reduce information gaps on the
creditworthiness of borrowers to generate more bankable projects.
23.
Continued strengthening of the supervisory frameworks and more systematic
coordination between the regulators of banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) are
critical to limiting risks to the domestic financial system. Following the introduction of the riskbased supervisory framework in 2014 and increased onsite examinations of NBFIs, the nonbank
regulator (Financial Services Regulatory Commission, FSRC)19 has identified weaknesses in some
segments of the sector (e.g., high delinquency rates and accelerated lending activity). Staff
recommended continued strengthening of supervisory frameworks to capture risks in growing
market segments, and close coordination between the FSRC and the ECCB, to limit potential risks
from ownership and funding linkages between banks and NBFIs.20 Close coordination will also help
limit contagion risks that may emerge in the absence of clear prudential regulations on crosstransactions between onshore and offshore financial institutions.21 Staff stressed that enforcement

19

The FSRC is also in charge of AML/CFT oversight, for both banks and nonbanks, and banks operating offshore.

The two domestic insurance companies are subsidiaries of two groups, which include financial institutions with

of the new Banking Law, ratified by Parliament in July 2015, would enable the ECCB to conduct
consolidated and risk-based supervision, while helping banks increase capital.22
24.
Supervision and regulation of offshore banks should continue to follow international
best practices. With the increased scrutiny and de-risking practices by international banks now also
affecting indigenous banks in St. Kitts and Nevis,23 staff recommended systematic monitoring of
developments in existing CBRs, maintaining a watertight AML/CFT framework with adequate
financial disclosure, prudent financial sector oversight, and full compliance with international
standards on transparency and exchange of tax information, to reduce the risk of losing CBRs and
avoid adverse implications for the CBI program.
Authorities’ views
The authorities shared the concerns on the potential impact of losing CBR’s. Some
indigenous banks are proactively exploring other potential counterparts, training staff and
expanding compliance departments. The authorities have continued efforts to ensure full
compliance with international standards on AML/CFT,24 and requested Fund advice on
possible alterative arrangements should de-risking trends continue.

C. Enhancing Resilience, Boosting Competitiveness and Long-run Growth
25.
In a currency union with a fixed exchange rate, enhancing competitiveness will require
raising productivity and resilience, economic diversification, and improving the business
environment. The External Stability Assessment (Annex II) points to competitiveness challenges
based on exchange rate and other indicators. The Federation continues to lag the rest of the region
and the world in terms of ease of doing business, is highly exposed to natural disasters, and has
limited diversification. Limited labor market data hinders adequate assessment of labor costs, but
the country has the highest minimum wage in the region. A comprehensive structural reform
agenda should focus on the following priorities to bolster long-run potential growth and
competitiveness:
Improve the business environment. Pressing ahead with the regional effort to revise
foreclosure legislation, establish a credit bureau, and the ongoing reform of land registry will
help enhance access to credit and handling insolvency—key obstacles to private sector
development. Fostering initiatives that educate entrepreneurs on proper business planning
and financial management would further increase the bankability of domestic projects.



22

Banks are given 450 days to comply with the increase in the minimum paid-up capital and the ECCB retains
discretion to extend the period if needed. The ECCB will also be able to introduce differentiated capital requirements
based on the riskiness of the institution.

23

Including through increased fees, greater resources needed for due diligence, and possible changes in
correspondent banking relationships (CBRs).



Address the existing skill gap. Re-orienting the PEP toward vocational training and
certification is one way to increase productivity of the domestic labor force and build skills
that meet the demands of key sectors (mainly construction and hospitality). Investment in
soft-skills training is a priority to meet the needs of the growing high-end tourism sector.



Invest in well-targeted and managed infrastructure projects. Investing in sustainable
infrastructure, such as the ongoing and planned investments in geothermal energy, is
expected to contribute to reducing and stabilizing energy costs—a key contributor to the
high cost of doing business in the Caribbean. Closing the infrastructure gap and
strengthening public investment management would enhance the efficiency of public
investment spending, the productivity of the economy, and its long-run growth impact, as
well as increasing resilience to natural disasters.25



Adopt a targeted marketing strategy that differentiates the country’s tourism brand.
This is critical to maintaining the country’s market share in the region in the face of price
competition from other destinations, including new markets like Cuba, and is consistent with
the authorities’ Master Tourism Strategy. Actively diversifying tourism source markets should
help reduce the impact of external shocks to the economy (Annex IV).



Increase economic diversification. Increasing backward linkages from tourism (e.g., into
agriculture) can help maximize the spillovers from tourism recovery. Broadening options
under the CBI program to include business investments in different sectors, such as
education or health, can help foster growth in other sectors and mitigate the risk of realestate overdevelopment and boom-bust cycles in construction.



Enhance resilience to natural disasters. A comprehensive risk management framework that
focuses on both risk reduction (through investments in disaster-resilient infrastructure) and
risk transfer (e.g., through weather-linked or catastrophe insurance), is critical to reducing
the burden of costly natural disasters on the public sector. Self-insurance through fiscal
buffers remains instrumental in the context of grossly insufficient payouts from existing
catastrophe risk insurance in the Caribbean (Annex V).



Enhance the quality of statistical data in the Federation. Significant shortfalls in Balance
of Payments and National Accounts statistics hamper economic assessment and policy
prescription. In particular, significant distortions in current and capital account flows hinder
an accurate assessment of the country’s external position and activity in various economic
sectors. A near-term action plan would involve strengthening the capacity of the statistical
office through additional staff training and targeted technical assistance by CARTAC, the
Fund, and World Bank, in effective coordination with the ECCB’s technical staff.



Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed with these priority areas and noted ongoing
efforts to implement reforms that enhance the business environment. They were keen on

25

improving the efficiency and targeting of public investment spending. They supported the
ongoing geothermal plant development in Nevis and noted plans to test geothermal
potential in St. Kitts. They shared staff’s concerns on the urgent need for improving
statistical data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
St. Kitts and Nevis exited the Post-Program Monitoring Framework in October 2015,
maintaining favorable macroeconomic performance and a broadly stable financial system. The
economy continued its strong growth, underpinned by construction and tourism activity, and their
spillovers to the rest of the economy. The fiscal surplus weakened compared to previous years,
owing to a slowdown in CBI receipts to the budget, delays in grants, and the impact of recent VAT
and Import Duty exemptions. The debt-to-GDP ratio continued its impressive downward trajectory,
owing to strong economic growth and early debt repayments, projected to reach the ECCU’s 60
percent target well ahead of peers. The banking system remained broadly stable with comfortable
capital and liquidity buffers, but high levels of NPLs, low profitability, and slow progress with land
sales have created pockets of vulnerability, adding to the risks from regional financial developments.
27.
The outlook for 2016 is positive, but remains dependent on developments in CBI
inflows. The medium-term outlook remains highly vulnerable to negative surprises in CBI inflows,
given increased regional and global competition from other CBI programs and global security
concerns, and the sizeable underlying fiscal deficit. Weak growth prospects in key tourism source
markets, regional financial sector challenges, including derisking, and exposure to natural disasters
also tilt the risks to the downside.
28.
A multi-pronged strategy is needed to preserve macro-financial stability and hardearned gains in debt sustainability. The elements of such a strategy include: (i) strengthening the
fiscal framework to reduce reliance on CBI inflows, while preserving the accumulated savings from
the CBI program and further improving public financial management; (ii) resolving the debt-land
swap to safeguard financial stability, while mitigating emerging financial sector risks; and (iii)
enhancing competitiveness, diversification, and resilience to shocks, including from natural disasters.
29.
A prudent medium-term fiscal framework with a zero primary balance target, net of
CBI receipts and SIDF grants, would help safeguard fiscal sustainability, with the adjustment
paced over the medium-term. The framework would help build resilience to negative surprises in
future CBI inflows, and facilitate accumulation of fiscal buffers to address external shocks and absorb
unforeseen financing needs if tax performance disappoints after CBI flows decline. Implementing
this framework requires broadening the tax base, including by streamlining tax incentives and
further improving compliance, especially at the NIA level, as well as containing recurrent spending.
The authorities’ commitment to a comprehensive review of the concessions regime is welcome, as
well as plans to contain the wage bill and spending on goods and services.
30.
Establishing a ‘Growth and Resilience Fund’ can help preserve the accumulated savings
from the CBI program, while providing a contingency buffer for future shocks, such as costly
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

natural disasters. The fund should have a prudent investment strategy, with appropriate
governance and accountability, and its flows fully integrated with the fiscal framework with the zero
primary-balance-target. Investing the funds in safe instruments abroad according to appropriate
investment guidelines should help reduce risks to financial stability by easing banks’ excess liquidity
pressures. A comprehensive investment and debt management strategy that optimizes the
government balance sheet through further debt reduction and improves the cost and composition
of debt would complement efforts to build adequate buffers as self-insurance for future shocks.
31.
The authorities should press ahead with structural reforms that strengthen public
financial management. In this context, strengthening the NIA’s budget framework, tax policy, and
revenue administration, and better coordination with central government on the sharing of VAT and
CBI revenues are crucial for the Federation’s fiscal sustainability. Enhancing oversight of public
corporations and enforcing timely reporting of their audited financial statements are also critical to
safeguarding the sustainability of the consolidated public sector position. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ efforts to enhance the transparency of SIDF financial reporting and commitment to
streamline and re-orient PEP. Plans for potential integration of the SIDF with the government’s
Consolidated Fund should enhance assessment and management of the overall fiscal policy stance.
32.
A clear framework for resolving the debt-land swap is crucial to preserve the
credibility of debt restructuring, the hard-earned gains in debt sustainability, and financial
sector stability. With the appointment of the SLSC board of directors and approval of the two sale
offers recently, the SLSC can be operationalized as a marketing agent to sell the remaining plots of
land, including to the diaspora. A clear strategy should be developed to enable reasonable progress
with land sales, to remove the policy uncertainty around the swap. While setting up this framework,
staff recommends the consideration of a temporary extension of the dividend guarantee on unsold
land, at possible renegotiated terms, and agreement on the reporting treatment of the swap by all
parties—the banks, the regulator, and the government.
33.
Preserving financial stability also calls for further strengthening of the supervisory
frameworks for banks and nonbanks and more systematic coordination between their
regulatory authorities. Further supervisory strengthening would help capture weaknesses in
growing market segments. A more systematic coordination between the ECCB and the FSRC will
help limit potential risks from linkages between banks and nonbanks and between onshore financial
institutions and those operating internationally. Implementing the new Banking Law will also enable
the ECCB to conduct consolidated and risk-based supervision and address potential spillover risks.
Trends in CBRs need to be systematically monitored to limit the risk of losing CBRs, as well as
maintaining a watertight AML/CFT regime with adequate financial disclosure, and full compliance
with international standards on transparency and exchange of tax information.
34.
A structural reform agenda that focuses on economic diversification, improved
business environment, and contingency planning should enhance resilience to external shocks
and bolster long-run growth potential. Ongoing efforts to improve the business environment and
addressing the skills gap will provide an enabling environment for private sector development and
help attract foreign investment crucial to financing the current account. Investing in targeted

transformative projects (including by broadening options under the CBI program to include business
investment in renewable energy, education and health) will improve competitiveness, diversification,
and resilience of the economy, including to natural disasters.
35.
Urgent attention is needed to improve the quality of statistical data. In particular,
addressing shortfalls in Balance of Payments, National Accounts, and labor market statistics is critical
to enhancing surveillance and providing better basis for policy decisions.

Sharp drop in CBI inflows. Increased competition
from regional programs, high global security risks,
and rising international migration pressures increase
downside risks to CBI inflows to the public sector
and real estate development with significant
implications to macroeconomic performance.
Slow pace of land sales from the debt-land swap.
A large stock of unsold land at the end of the 3-year
dividend arrangement with the government poses
risks to banks’ balance sheets and profitability.
High banking system liquidity and limited credit
opportunities. Excess liquidity associated with large
public sector deposits and CBI inflows place
downward pressures on profitability and may
pressure banks to engage in high risk investments
and/or raise concentration risks to specific sectors.
Persistent banking sector weaknesses in the
ECCU. Regional financial distress could spill over to
domestic financial institutions. Vulnerability is
heightened by the lack of deposit insurance, low
capitalization of regional banks and limited fiscal
space in the region to support weak institutions.
Reduced financial services by global/regional
banks ("de-risking"). Loss of correspondent
banking services would significantly curtail crossborder payments, trade finance, and remittances in
St. Kitts and Nevis.
Natural disasters. The high vulnerability to natural
disasters increases risks of substantial damage to
infrastructure, entailing large reconstruction costs,
and risk to growth and fiscal prospects.
Disruption to the PetroCaribe arrangement. A
sustained decline in oil prices can affect the
sustainability of the financing arrangement, leading
to the emergence of external sector vulnerabilities.
Spread of the Zika virus. Associated health
concerns may lower tourist arrivals and reduce
Caribbean tourism market share.
Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies. Persistently weak demand
and lower medium-term growth could lower tourist
arrivals, trade, FDI, grants, and investor confidence.

Annex II. External Stability Assessment
The external stability assessment suggests that the country is facing competitiveness challenges. An
adjusted EBA-lite model suggests some overvaluation, about 4 percent in 2015. However, significant
uncertainty about the true size of the current account balance—largely reflecting recently uncovered
statistical shortfalls and large volatile CBI receipts to the government in recent years—calls for caution
in interpreting the model results. Other indicators, including REER movements, the World Bank Doing
Business Ranking, and wage-cost indicators vis-à-vis the rest of the region, confirm competitiveness
challenges. Persistence of US dollar strength may increase competitiveness pressures over the medium
term. In a currency union with a fixed exchange rate, enhancing competitiveness will require cost
adjustments, strengthening productivity, and improving the business environment. Significant foreign
currency accumulation by central government at commercial banks suggests a relatively stable reserve
position notwithstanding a fall in imputed reserves at the ECCB in 2015. The projected decline in CBI
inflows may put downward pressure on the medium-term international investment position.

A.

Current Account and Exchange Rate Assessment

1.
The current account deficit remained relatively stable at an estimated 12 percent in
2014-2015. The estimated deficit is based on published Balance of Payments (BOP) data in
accordance with BPM5, augmented with staff’s preliminary revisions of merchandise imports and
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) data to adjust

inflows. The tapering of CBI-linked investment
spending is expected to moderate FDI
inflows, suggesting that the deficit will be financed mainly by drawing down the significant net
foreign asset position of commercial banks from the accumulation of pre-funded investment
commitments through the CBI program’s real estate route.2

The data underestimate the level of foreign investment spending and related imports of capital goods and raw
materials since 2013. Staff’s preliminary revisions to merchandise imports over 2013-2015 used data from the US
Census Bureau, Eurostat, the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) and historical ECCB’s BPM5 data. Further
adjustments are likely as ECCU balance of payments statistics are migrated from BPM5 to BPM6.

2 CBI application fees to the budget appear as service receipts in the current account, while contributions to the
Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) appear in the capital and financial account as a capital transfer. FDI
inflows reflect CBI-Investments in real estate sector. This is initially offset by strong accumulation of foreign assets by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2.
The external stability assessment is hampered by significant shortfalls in BOP statistics.
Distortions arising from inaccurate estimation of tourism receipts, including from the large student
population, and significant underestimation of the volume of both merchandise imports and exports
since 2013 have complicated the assessment of the current account balance. Further, the
methodology for estimating FDI, based on transfer of title from the land and property registry, does
not capture the significant investment spending in the construction sector by foreign developers,
while CBI-related inflows of foreign currency deposits to the domestic banking system through the
real-estate route also appear to be underestimated. Moreover, the reversal in commercial banks’
NFA growth trend in 2015 remains unexplained.3 The ECCB is currently reforming external sector
statistics by implementing new surveys using BPM6.4 Further technical assistance from CARTAC and
IMF headquarters is currently being mobilized to address the abovementioned data gaps.
3.
The sustainability of the external position will depend on the impact of revisions to
the BOP data, as well as future developments in CBI inflows. CBI fees to the budget, averaging
about 9.9 percent of GDP over 2011-2015, have helped narrow the size of the CA deficit. The
projected decay in future CBI receipts to the budget

4.
The external assessment using the available data is based on an adjusted EBA-lite
methodology that incorporates some unique characteristics of St. Kitts and Nevis’ economy.
In general, small, tourism-dependent economies run sizable current account deficits, reflecting the
high import content of FDI (compared to other economies) and repatriation of investment profits
(also higher, reflecting a larger share of FDI in these economies).6 This is true for St. Kitts and Nevis,
which relies heavily on tourism activities, and, in recent years, significant CBI inflows. The surge in

developers draw down on these balances, funding imports of construction materials and other related expenditures.

The decline in domestic banks’ NFA position in 2015, following significant accumulation of foreign assets since 2012
due to large CBI-related inflows to the banking system, cannot be explained through current account developments
or CBI flows in 2015.

Reforms to the external sector statistics for 2014 using BPM6 reflect updated tourist expenditure surveys, and wider
coverage of offshore universities and their student population. The external assessment in this annex is based on the

The adjusted EBA-lite model estimates suggest that the REER is somewhat overvalued
relative to the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies, implying a challenge for
external competitiveness. Both the adjusted Current Account and REER models estimate an REER
overvaluation of about 4-5 percent in 2015, explained mostly by the residual of the model in the case
of the CA model, and by the policy gaps in the case of the REER model. As expected, the unadjusted
Current Account model implies a larger REER gap, equivalent to 13.6 percent of GDP. However, if, as

The assessment of the current account norm uses historical fiscal balances, net of CBI receipts, and a
corresponding policy target, net of CBI, to reflect the true fiscal stance in the economy, which otherwise would be
distorted by large fiscal surpluses portraying a picture of an overly contractionary fiscal policy.

deficit may become significantly larger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals as of 2015.
6.
Analysis of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (excluding Ukraine) confirms a
marginal loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis trade partners over the past decade.8 After a
significant appreciation in the run up to the global financial crisis, the REER has remained relatively
stable, with an appreciation of about 4 percent over the past 10-years. In 2015, the impact of the
appreciation of the US$, to which the EC$ is pegged, on the NEER appears to be offset by a large
deflationary impulse from the VAT exemptions and declining global commodity prices.

Labor cost indicators also signal competitiveness challenges. While labor productivity
has been recovering steadily after a slowdown following the global financial crisis, labor costs may
be higher than ECCU peers. The minimum wage is the highest in the ECCU region, suggesting high
labor costs associated with low-skilled workers, against a background of skills gaps particularly in
the service and tourism industry. The minimum wage was increased in November 2014, which
restored the real minimum wage back to its 2008 level.

The growth in tourist arrivals has been driven largely by buoyant cruiseship arrivals,
while the share in stay-over visitors in the ECCU region has remained stable since 2010. The
number and share (in ECCU) of cruiseship passengers has increased strongly since 2008 and now
accounts for almost a third of all the arrivals to the ECCU region, but cruiseship passangers
contribute less to the local economy compared to stay-over visitors, which has remained relatively
stable as a share of total tourism to the region in recent years. As a result, tourism receipts have
remained broadly stable at around 13 percent of GDP.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) 1
The debt-to-GDP ratio remains on a firm downward trajectory, in line with the 2015 Article IV projections,
yet the debt position remains vulnerable to a range of risks. The ratio declined to 68 percent of GDP at end2015 and is projected to fall below the ECCU target of 60 percent by end-2017, with the downward path
supported by strong economic growth since 2013 and early retirement of debt equivalent to 6 ½ percent of
GDP. Purchases under the SBA have been fully repaid as of end-April 2016, three years ahead of schedule.
Notwithstanding, recent tax exemptions and higher risk to the sustainability of CBI inflows have increased
risks to the currently favorable debt trajectory. If CBI receipts to the budget decay as projected, large fiscal
buffers would gradually decline, absent adequate fiscal adjustment, although the debt-to-GDP ratio would
still fall to a projected 50 percent by 2021 under baseline assumptions. Adverse shocks, including a sudden
stop in CBI flows or a costly natural disaster, may reverse the downward debt trajectory, if fiscal buffers are
rapidly depleted, although stress tests indicate that debt is likely to remain below 70 percent of GDP by
2021 under most shocks. Risks relating to the debt-land swap also constitute a significant risk for debt
sustainability, in case of further delays in divesting land assets. Gross financing needs remain high, mainly
owing to the large stock of T-bills, with ongoing efforts to gradually reduce the size of the portfolio and
extend its average maturity.

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Medium-Term Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Medium-term debt sustainability is projected to improve further following the
significant debt restructuring, thanks to favorable debt dynamics and ample fiscal buffers
generated by the CBI program.2 The debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 68 percent of GDP at end2015, compared to 80 percent at end-2014, and is projected to fall below 50 percent by 2021.3
Although the public sector primary balance has deteriorated since 2014 because of lower grants,
some slowdown in CBI inflows, and a marginally weaker tax performance, and despite the steep
decline of CBI receipts incorporated in the baseline, the public sector primary surplus is projected to
average about 1 percent of GDP over 2016-2021.4 Automatic debt dynamics remain favorable at an
average growth rate of 3.2 percent over the medium term—about 1.6 percentage points above the
This annex presents an analysis of debt sustainability utilizing the DSA framework for Market-Access Countries
(MAC). Modifications have been made to the MAC DSA template to accommodate the large surplus position of St.
Kitts and Nevis (see paragraph 3).

1

Public debt declined significantly from a peak of 159 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 80 percent of GDP at end2014, largely as the result of debt-restructuring that involved an innovative debt-land swap with domestic banks
(equivalent to about 41 percent of 2010 GDP), a debt exchange with bondholders and external commercial creditors
in 2012, and a flow restructuring with other Paris Club creditors.
2

3 Gross public debt balances have been revised to include about 2.1 percent of GDP in budgetary arrears by central
government on fuel purchases from PDVSA that date back to before 2009. These remain contested by the authorities
and are under negotiation, but have been conservatively included in the public debt stock. Retroactive corrections to
staff’s public enterprise debt figures have kept headline public debt close to former estimates.

The public sector primary balance is largely governed by changes in the consolidated general government fiscal
position. The financial position of 14 public enterprises is estimated based on unaudited financial performance of 10
enterprises through 2015 and estimates for 4 others over 2013-2015.

effective real interest rate on public debt. Public debt, net of liquid financial assets of the public
sector, is estimated at 39 percent of GDP at end-2015 and is projected to decline to 36 percent of
GDP by 2021 (see figure 3).5
2.
The public sector has accumulated significant fiscal buffers from windfall revenues
through the CBI program. At end-2015, central government has accumulated liquid deposits of
about 25 percent of GDP, allowing it to cover its projected financing requirements and comfortably
meet its debt service obligations without contracting new debt over the forecast horizon in the
baseline scenario. In addition, the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF), the country’s
national development fund, has accumulated assets equivalent to 20 percent of GDP from CBIrelated flows, of which 14 percent of GDP are liquid assets in the form bank deposits and marketable
securities. Public sector enterprises hold an additional 3.5 percent of GDP in bank deposits.
3.
Despite large accumulated public sector savings, the scope for more rapid debt
repayment is limited. Central government has already paid down all outstanding domestic loans to
commercial banks and social security and settled debt with major external bilateral creditors except
debt owed to PDVSA (about 7 percent of GDP, including 2.7 percent of GDP in arrears), where
negotiations are still ongoing. Purchases under the SBA were fully repaid in April 2016. Bonds from
the debt restructuring or external multilateral debt carry a low interest rate with long maturities,
hence beneficial for long-run debt sustainability. Meanwhile, expensive overdraft debt accounts
held by the Nevis Island Administration (NIA) (about 5 percent of GDP) is being restructured into a
long-term loan with lower interest rate. Using central government savings to more aggressively
repay the remaining debt owed by the NIA and public corporations (equivalent to 21 percent of
GDP) would not be warranted, unless there is significant strengthening of fiscal discipline at NIA and
sufficient central government oversight of public corporations. Debt equivalent to about 6 percent
of GDP, including T-bills held by private investors and arrears to PDVSA, seems the most likely
candidate for immediate repayment, and the authorities plan to move in that direction.
4.
The baseline scenario incorporates the following assumptions on growth and the
outlook for CBI inflows:


Fiscal Balance: CBI budgetary revenues are assumed to decline from 11.9 percent of GDP in 2015
to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2021, contributing to the significant decline in the public sector
primary surplus from 8.7 percent in 2015 to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2021.



Growth and Inflation: Real economic activity moderates to about 3.5 percent over 2016-2018,
before stabilizing at about 2.8 percent for the rest of the projection horizon—about 0.8
percentage point below the 10-year pre-crisis historical growth average. The drop reflects the
phasing out of CBI-related investments and the impact of a subsequent slowdown in the
construction sector as planned projects reach completion in 2019 and beyond. Continued

recovery in tourism and related sectors, as new high-end tourist facilities come on stream, partly
offsets the drop. Inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, averages 1.8 percent over 2016-21.


Debt: Repurchases of about 1 percent of GDP have been made since end-2015, settling all
outstanding obligations to the Fund as of end-April 2016. No assumptions are made on further
early retirement of debt, despite the authorities’ plans to consider repaying historical budgetary
arrears to PDVSA. No new debt is expected to be contracted by the central government (St.
Kitts) given its ample fiscal buffers. However, the NIA is expected to finance its projected deficits
through new borrowing, given its limited access to central government savings (see below).
Public corporations are expected to refinance their debt position, which is expected to remain
stable in nominal terms.

5.
The MAC DSA template has been enhanced to more accurately reflect the impact of
adverse shocks on St. Kitts and Nevis’ debt trajectory in light of its significant surplus
position. Given ample fiscal buffers, staff modified the design of the MAC DSA stress tests to reflect
a drawdown on liquid deposits before new borrowing takes place.6 This is consistent with staff’s
proposal of pooling accumulated savings in a Contingency Fund to address future shocks, including
increased financing needs from a sharp decline (or sudden stops) in CBI revenues and natural
disaster shocks (see ¶16 of the staff report). In implementing these modifications, the following
methodology was used:
i.

Only liquid deposit balances of the central government and public corporations, equivalent
to about 29 percent of GDP at end-2015, are used to address additional financing needs
that arise from the shocks. The liquid assets of the SIDF are conservatively excluded since its
financial accounts are not yet consolidated with the rest of the public sector.7

ii.

The NIA is projected to continue facing financing constraints given its limited access to
central government savings. Therefore, about 20 percent (roughly the size of NIA revenues
and expenditure in the consolidated federal accounts) of deviations in the primary balance
in shock scenarios are financed through new borrowing (at an average interest rate of 7
percent). However, deviations in the fiscal balance emerging from sudden stops to CBI are
fully financed through central government deposits since NIA’s budget is not a direct
beneficiary of these flows.

iii.

In order to reflect the need for a minimum level of fiscal buffers, new debt issuance is
assumed to cover additional financing needs (in excess of baseline) once buffers fall below

Deposits are readily available for withdrawal given the very high liquidity of the domestic banking system (and the
government's domestic banking agent in particular). The bulk of the banks’ assets are in correspondent bank
balances, investments in foreign marketable securities, and excess reserves at the ECCB.

6

7 The

SIDF remains a quasi-fiscal entity that, while not formally considered a statutory body, has consistently
supported public sector activities, including through grants to the government and various social programs. Its liquid
assets are expected to be available as a buffer in the event of severe shocks, including natural disasters. In the 2016
budget, the PM announced plans to consolidate the SIDF with the central government consolidated account. Staff
proposes an overarching framework that enhances the management of the SIDF (see ¶17 and ¶18 of the staff report).

10 percent of GDP. In all shock scenarios, at least 5 percent of GDP of buffers were retained
by 2021.8
iv.

Shock scenarios incorporate the drawdown on deposit balances already assumed in the
baseline.

6.
Staff used standard and customized MAC DSA shocks to simulate the impact of
downside risks, highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix, on the public debt trajectory.
Despite a favorable baseline trajectory, the path remains vulnerable to shocks, especially if a
combination of them were to materialize.


An adverse shock to growth (calibrated as 1 standard deviation of growth volatility over the
past 10 years), reflecting adverse external shocks, such as to tourism and from global spillovers,
lowers output growth by 4.1 percentage points relative to baseline over 2017-2018, and lowers
inflation by 1 percentage point in each year. Cumulative primary deficits of about 9 percent of
GDP lower fiscal buffers to 11 percent of GDP in 2020 before central government contracts new
debt in 2021 in line with the 10 percent threshold assumed above (¶5, iii) Public debt rises,
mainly due to lower growth, to 61.7 percent of GDP in 2021, about 14 percentage points above
baseline.



A sustained interest rate shock of 368 bps (difference between the average real interest rate
level over the projection period and the maximum 10-year historical level) was applied—
consistent with a projected 350 bps increase in US interest rates over the medium-term.9 The
shock has only marginally slowed down the rate of debt decline (by about 1 percentage point
compared to baseline). This reflects rolling over short-term debt, both by central government
and NIA, at higher interest rates as well as higher interest expense on new borrowing by NIA.



A primary balance shock was used to simulate the impact of a sudden stop in CBI inflows. A
sudden stop in 2017 shocks the primary deficit by about 3½ percentage points in 2017 and
2018 and about 1½ percentage points over 2019-2021. Under this scenario, buffers decline to
7.8 percent and the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 53.5 percent by 2021, about 5½ percentage
points above baseline.



A combined macro-fiscal shock of all of the above would lead to an explosive debt trajectory.
Debt rises to 74.4 percent of GDP in 2021, about 26 percentage points higher than baseline.
Buffers drop to 10 percent of GDP in 2019 and decline further to a low of 5.4 percent in 2021.



A custom natural disaster shock, based on historical episodes of hurricane shocks in St. Kitts
and Nevis (see Annex V), lowers growth by 6 percentage points compared to baseline in 2017,
but growth is assumed to quickly recover to 2 percent in 2018 including through reconstruction

8 Like other highly vulnerable small states, St. Kitts and Nevis needs to maintain a minimum cushion of liquid buffers
to safeguard against the possibility of multiple adverse shocks materializing over a short horizon. The thresholds
reflect the need to start tapping markets before fiscal buffers are fully depleted.
9 The economic projections of the Federal Reserve Board members as of December 2015 show an upper range
forecast of 350 bps increase in the Federal Funds rate by 2018.

efforts. Historical shocks suggest an expected deterioration in the fiscal balance by about 5
percentage points in both 2017 and 2018. However, fiscal buffers are able to cover the bulk of
the cost. Some additional borrowing in the outer years slows down the decline in the debt-toGDP ratio, which reaches 51.8 percent in 2021, about 3.7 percent above baseline.10,11 A second
natural disaster shock of a similar magnitude materializing in 2023 would deplete buffers, raise
the debt ratio by 13 percentage points over 2023-2024 and require a fiscal adjustment of about
1 percent of GDP to lower the debt back to below 60 percent of GDP by 2027.


A custom shock was used to simulate the impact of a debt-land swap shock, if the swapped
land were not divested within a timeframe consistent with the ECCB’s regulatory guidelines. The
scenario assumes swapping the land for a long-term loan with domestic banks at an interest
rate of 4.5 percent (about 0.5 percent higher than the current interest rate on one-year T-bills
and about 1 percentage point higher than the 3.5 percent dividend guarantee on unsold land).
This shock results in a 28 percentage points upward shift in the debt ratio compared to baseline
in 2017. The primary balance improves reflecting the shift of payments for dividends from
transfers to interest expense, yet the effective interest rate on debt rises by an average of 0.6
percentage points over 2017-2021.12 Given the new debt dynamics, public debt declines from a
peak of 87 percent of GDP in 2017 to 73.6 percent by 2021—to about 26 percentage points
above the baseline.

7.
The historical and constant primary balance scenarios do not provide a reliable insight
into possible risk. The historical scenario takes into account several years of very high CBI
budgetary inflows combined with strong fiscal performance under the Fund-supported program.
The scenario with a constant primary balance also reflects the very high CBI budgetary inflows.
While CBI inflows may prove to be stronger than staff’s projections, such large inflows are more
likely to be used to bolster fiscal buffers than pay down debt more rapidly (see ¶3)
8.
The heat map reflects an improved debt risk profile compared to the 2015 Article IV
assessment, although it remains highly vulnerable to rollover risks. Under this modified shock
design, the debt level does not trigger the heat map threshold of 70 percent under either the
baseline scenario or any of the standard shock scenarios, reflecting the contribution of large fiscal
buffers in stabilizing the debt position. However, the debt-land swap shock, if it materializes, would
raise the debt level above the 70 percent threshold for EMs. Debt is still vulnerable because of the
large annual gross financing needs given the large stock of short-term debt (mainly T-bills).
Although lengthening the maturities of commercial debt instruments would materially improve debt
sustainability, the significant liquidity in the domestic banking system lowers potential challenges in
rolling over short-term instruments over the near-term, at least for central government. Indicators
In the event of a natural disaster, the SIDF is expected to undertake additional spending to provide disaster relief,
projected at about 4 percent of GDP, which will further drawdown on its assets (see Annex V).

An additional scenario combining a sudden stop in CBI inflows with a natural disaster shock was modeled outside
the DSA suggesting a debt ratio of about 70 percent by 2021. This scenario is presented in Annex V.
11

In the baseline scenario, the 3-year dividend guarantee is assumed to be extended for two additional years,
expiring by 2018 for the first tranche of swapped land and 2019 for the second tranche, consistent with the ECCB’s
guidelines on resolving collateral assets within a 5-year window.

show a medium level of vulnerability with respect to external debt and foreign currency
denominated debt, while the fan charts show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is unlikely to rise above 80
percent over the medium term, even under the asymmetric fan chart (where only negative shocks to
growth and the exchange rate are considered).
9.
High uncertainty related to CBI inflows explains large forecast errors in recent years.
The forecast track record indicates that staff has underestimated growth and fiscal outturns in recent
projections. This reflects the unanticipated surge in CBI inflows, resulting in a delayed but much
stronger-than-anticipated recovery and record primary surpluses, far above peers and historical
averages. Given the high uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of future CBI flows, staff remains
cautious on future growth and fiscal projections, which may continue to lead to higher forecast
errors. Inflation projections have shown fewer forecast errors in recent years.
10.
The cyclically adjusted primary balance in the forecast period reflects the assumption
that CBI inflows are not expected to continue at their current pace. The estimated change in the
cyclically adjusted primary surplus over the forecast period is at the lower end of the distribution of
adjustments historically achieved by advanced and emerging economies with debt greater than
60 percent of GDP. This reflects the baseline assumptions of significantly lower CBI inflows, and
hence, the projected decline in non-tax revenues and primary surplus over a 3-year forecast horizon.
Conclusion
11.
The authorities agreed that ensuring St. Kitts and Nevis’ medium-term debt
sustainability requires resolving the debt-land swap and prudent management of large
government savings. Cementing the gains achieved in debt sustainability will require a framework
to effectively mobilize land use/sales in a manner that ensures the credibility of the debt
restructuring, while preserving national interests and the stability of domestic banks. Meanwhile,
implementing an effective framework to preserve and prudently manage the large accumulated
savings from CBI inflows by both central government and the SIDF will be critical to stabilizing the
debt path and increasing resilience to exogenous shocks, without renewed build-up of public debt.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
12.
The external public debt is projected to decline rapidly over the medium term to 12
percent in 2021, down from 26 percent in 2015. Amortization of restructured bonds with external
commercial and projected repayment of multilateral debt, largely from the CDB, will significantly
contribute to this decline. The current account deficit is projected to widen as a result of the
modeled decay in CBI inflows in the baseline scenario, while imports remain elevated, in part
because of continued imports of construction materials and capital goods. Drawdowns on the
accumulated investment commitments from prior years, reflected in commercial banks’ large net
foreign asset position (and the growth in the imputed reserves at the ECCB), will finance the bulk of
the current account deficits, as CBI-projects reach completion, resulting in no significant
accumulation of new foreign debt. Stress tests indicate that external debt would continue to decline
under interest rate, growth, real depreciation, and combined shocks. However, debt stays relatively
higher under the current account shock scenario, suggesting that some external adjustment would
be necessary to bring the debt path back to a downward trend under that shock.

1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector, including 14 public enterprises.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
7/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. The residual negative effect on debt
creating flows in 2012, 2013 and 2014 includes the impact of the debt forgiveness on the stock of debt.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex IV. Tourism Sector in St. Kitts and Nevis
Tourism is an important contributor to employment and economic growth in St. Kitts and Nevis. It plays
a role in the development of less well-developed and rural areas in the country and in promoting the
image and perception of the country externally. This annex provides an analysis of the tourism sector in
the country, presents measures of tourism performance, assesses tourism competitiveness of the
country in the region, and discusses the challenges facing the sector and opportunities for further
development.

A. Measuring Tourism Performance and Impact
1.
Tourist arrivals are still recovering from the sharp decline during the global financial
crisis. Notwithstanding the upward trend, stay-over tourist arrivals have not returned to the peak
levels before the crisis and suffered more compared to the ECCU average, suggesting increased
competition from other destinations in the region. Cruise-ship tourist arrivals, on the other hand,
have grown almost four-fold since 2007, and have been over performing the ECCU average. The
strong rise in cruise-ship arrivals underpinned an improved performance in tourism activity in 2015.

B. Tourism Competitiveness and Challenges
3.
St. Kitts and Nevis has been an attractive destination for cruise-ship tourists in the past
few years. Ranked as the top destination in the ECCU region in 2014-2015, it hosted, on average, 30
percent of all cruise-ship tourists visiting one of the ECCU member countries, up from around 10
percent in 2007. New investment decisions in St. Kitts and Nevis are also supporting cruise-ship
tourism. A new pier project, which will be able to host larger cruise ships, is expected to be
completed by October 2017, after which tourist arrivals are expected to grow even faster.
4.
At the same time, St. Kitts and Nevis is ranked as the fourth country receiving the
highest number of stay-over tourists in the ECCU region. Its share has been stagnant around 11
percent over the 2004-2015 period, after reaching a maximum of 13 percent in 2005. The shares
suggest that St. Kitts and Nevis has been a relatively less attractive destination for stay-over tourists,
compared to other countries in the region, suggesting a need to take steps toward improving its
stay-over tourism competitiveness.

Box 1. Estimating Room Occupancy Rate
Monthly room occupancy rate is the ratio of purchased hotel nights per month to total available hotel
nights (total room stock times 30). Purchased hotel nights in a month are calculated based on the length of
stay times the number of stay-over arrivals in each category of arrivals. Stay-over tourist arrival statistics
reflect the number of air arrivals and exclude sea arrivals, which are mostly cruise-ship tourists. The room
stock of St. Kitts and Nevis was 2932 in 2015. Some of these rooms were occupied by students of the
offshore universities in the islands and the estimations show both including and excluding the student
population staying at hotels.
Regular tourists are assumed to stay 7 nights with two people occupying one hotel room; business tourists
are assumed to stay 5 nights, one person occupying one hotel room; arrivals in “other” category are
assumed to stay 3 nights. For students, January arrival numbers are used to calculate the number of hotel
nights for the period of January-April, and May arrival numbers are used to calculate number of hotel nights
over the period of May-August; students are assumed to stay 30 nights a month during this period, two
students occupying one bedroom. For the rest of the year, students are treated as normal tourists, staying 7
nights a month.

1
A typical stay-over tourist visiting St. Kitts and Nevis is middle-age, earns higher than middle-income, stays around 7
days, and spends around US$1,500 excluding hotel costs and airfare for the entire stay in the islands (text table).
2

In addition to the hotel room charges, the cost of food served in these hotels are also very high, given the high
service charges and imported ingredients typically used in their production.
56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

6.
Airlift has also been a constraint on the tourism sector in St. Kitts and Nevis. There are
only two daily international airlines, one flying from the Caribbean region and the other from the
United States. Flights from other destinations are only once or twice a week, typically arriving in St.
Kitts on Saturday or Sunday, and hence cannot accommodate a long-weekend trip. In an effort to
increase the airlift to the country, the authorities have supported minimum revenue guarantee
arrangements with certain airlines. The expected increase in hotel room capacity in high-end
properties is likely to trigger higher demand for business class seats, reducing the pressure to
support the airlift for minimum revenue, as well as to increase the number of private jet flights to the
islands.
7.
Its highly concentrated tourist base increases the exposure of St. Kitts and Nevis to
shocks from source countries, as well as to potential competition from new entrants. The
United States has been the main source market for some time, with more than 60 percent of the
stay-over tourists visiting from the United States. The U.S. share in stay-over tourist arrivals has been
stagnant over the past few years, however, and may be exposed to potential competition from new
entrants, such as Cuba following the beginning of a gradual normalization of relations between the
United States and Cuba. Continued increase in the share of arrivals from other source markets, such
as the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, Canada, and other countries, may help reduce the
vulnerability to adverse economic developments in the dominant source country, as well as to the
impact of competition from new entrants on its tourism demand.

C. Opportunities for Further Development
8.
A targeted marketing strategy toward high-income earners in source markets is
important, given the large stock of higher-end tourist facilities coming on stream in the next
three years. Focusing on a specific market niche would help differentiation of the St. Kitts and Nevis
tourism brand and maintain the country’s market share in the region. Yachting, diving, and golf are
three main niche markets that the tourism authorities currently focus on. At the same time, given
that the bulk of the existing room stock belongs to 3-star hotels, the tourism strategy also needs to
target middle-income families and youth to maintain the occupancy rates in existing properties.
9.
Meanwhile, increasing backward linkages from the tourism sector would help
maximize the spillovers from future expansion in the tourism sector. Efforts could include
fostering initiatives to promote local farm produce to hotels and substitute imports that can be
produced locally. Investment in human resource development and soft-skills training is also a priority
to meet the needs of high-end tourist facilities.
10.
The authorities will also need to address the new challenges on the tourism sector,
including the possible spread of the Zika virus and potential competition from Cuba. While the
average age of tourists typically visiting St. Kitts and Nevis is above child-bearing age, for which Zika
virus is a great threat, efforts are needed to prevent exposure to the virus to limit any downside risks
to tourism flows. While competition from Cuba has been an ongoing challenge for St. Kitts and Nevis
for visitors from non-US source markets, the anticipated normalization of relationships between
Cuba and the United States is expected to introduce new competition for U.S. visitors—the largest
source market for St. Kitts and Nevis. Efforts to focus on strategic market niches, such as eco-tourism,
culture and heritage, and effective marketing strategies for high-end resorts could help attract
tourists who are looking for both niche markets and luxury.

Annex V. Natural Disasters in St. Kitts and Nevis
Around 42 million human lives are lost in internationally reported disasters each year. Global average
annual loss due to investment requirements in urban infrastructure is estimated to reach up to US$450
billion in the next 15 years.1These global figures, however, do not reflect an evenly distributed disaster
risk around the world. Small island developing states have disproportionately high disaster risk relative
to the size of their economies and capital stock. As a small island state, St. Kitts and Nevis faces very
high potential losses associated with natural disasters. Maintaining an adequate level of fiscal buffers is
crucial for the resilience of the economy and for fiscal sustainability in the aftermath of a disaster, as
well as effective efforts for risk reduction and transfer.

between 1980 and 2015.

Damage and losses related to natural disasters have been disproportionately high in St.
Kitts and Nevis relative to the size of its economy. Tropical hurricane Georges that hit the country
in 1998 destroyed 80 percent of the housing stock and caused significant damage to the power
infrastructure. The estimated total damage during this hurricane was more than 50 percent higher
than the average total damage experienced in the most severe disaster episodes of the Caribbean
region. Annual hurricane disaster cost is estimated to average at 4.6 percent of GDP over 1980-2015,
with 40 percent of the damage borne by the public sector.

B. Mitigating Economic Impacts of Disasters
3.
Reducing the cost of natural disasters requires a comprehensive risk management
framework. A key component of managing disaster risk is risk reduction, including adaptive
measures, such as revising and enforcing building codes for public and private properties, building
disaster-resilient infrastructure, and protecting agricultural production and residents with new
technologies. Efforts in disaster risk management continue in these areas, but additional work is
needed to close infrastructure gaps (e.g., for slope stabilization, resilience to storm surge and road
erosions). For extreme droughts and flooding, St. Kitts and Nevis has recently joined a program
funded by United States Agency for International Development to implement climate-smart
technologies, including a master drainage plan and installation of four flood-monitoring stations that
would provide early warning and data analysis. By providing more data on disaster risk, these new
technologies could also help development of the insurance market, which has very limited coverage.
4.
As a country facing disasters with low frequency but high expected losses, St. Kitts and
Nevis would also benefit from risk-transfer strategies that help internationalize some of the
losses through global financial markets. Mandatory property insurance, currently only required for
those with mortgages, is one form of risk transfer that could reduce the burden that the public sector
typically bears in a small island economy after a natural disaster. Among the three main types of risk
transferring mechanisms widely used in the world—reinsurance, catastrophe insurance, and
catastrophe bonds—re-insurance is widely used in St. Kitts and Nevis for risk transfer.2 The country

also participates in the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and it received a
payout of US$1,055,408 in November 2014, under the excess rainfall insurance policy. In addition to
the existing catastrophe insurance and reinsurance practices, insurance products such as regional
catastrophe bonds and weather-linked insurance could further enhance and strengthen the resilience
in the financial sector and the economy and reduce the fiscal burden of costly natural disasters.
With the average payouts from current risk transfer mechanisms largely insufficient to cover
potential fiscal costs, self-insurance through policy buffers is needed. Historically, around 40
percent of natural disaster costs were borne by the public sector in St. Kitts and Nevis. However,

following year. With its accumulated fiscal
buffers, the country seems capable of withstanding a severe natural disaster shock without a reversal
in the downward debt trajectory, although debt-to-GDP ratio would be 4 percentage points higher
than the baseline (as a result of the lower growth rate) and fiscal buffers would drop to about
6 percent of GDP by 2021, absent a fiscal adjustment. A combined shock featuring both a natural
disaster and a sudden stop in CBI inflows in 2017 would completely deplete fiscal buffers by 2020
and would result in a debt-to-GDP ratio of 70 percent by 2021—about 22 percentage points above
baseline projections. Ensuring continued accumulation of buffers would facilitate resilient public
financing and allow fiscal policy to respond proactively should a disaster materialize. Launching the
Growth and Resilience Fund will be instrumental to internalizing the expected cost of natural
disasters and institutionalizing efforts to build resilience.

Exchange Arrangement
St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S.
dollar since July 1976. The de jure regime is a currency board, which in practice the ECCB has
operated like a quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency
and demand liabilities close to 100 percent. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in December 1984. The exchange system is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is
subject to a full safeguards assessment on a four year cycle. An update assessment was
completed in April 2016 and found that the ECCB has maintained generally strong controls
over its key operations. External audit and financial reporting practices remain sound. The
ECCB financial statements are compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards and
are published on a timely basis. The internal audit function needs to be reformed to align it
with leading international practices and oversight could be further strengthened by enhancing
the financial expertise of the audit committee.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV staff report (IMF Country Report No. 15/248) was published on September

Technical Assistance: (2010–Present)
Since 2010, St. Kitts and Nevis has benefited from technical assistance in the areas of tax
policy, tax administration, economic statistics, financial supervision and macroeconomic
management, both from IMF headquarters and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Centre (CARTAC).

4



CARTAC and the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) advised the National Statistics
Office on rebasing the national accounts, rebasing the consumer price index, and
developing export-import price indices. CARTAC is also assisting in compiling
separate production-based measures of GDP for St. Kitts and Nevis. Further, CARTAC
is providing technical assistance to the ECCB and the National Statistics Office to
improve the quality of external sector statistics and to introduce the new survey
instruments in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Statistics Manual (BPM6).



CARTAC, the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM), and the IMF’s
Legal Department (LEG) advised the authorities on strengthening financial sector
regulation and supervision, including risk-based supervision. With assistance from the
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada (OSFI), CARTAC
provided technical assistance to the ECCB on drafting the OECS Insurance Act, and
also, in conjunction with LEG, provided technical assistance to the ECCB in finalizing
the drafting of the OECS Money Services business Act. CARTAC also assisted in the
development of the Single Regulatory Unit and provided training to the Financial
Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) on implementing Risk-Based Supervision,
including for nonbank financial institutions in the Federation and the offshore
banking sector in Nevis.



CARTAC has delivered significant TA to the Customs and Excise Department (CED) in
relation to its reform and modernization program, including Post-Clearance Audit
(PCA), Valuation and Risk Management training and developing a Corporate and
Strategic Business Plan (2014-17). CARTAC also provided assistance in drafting a new
Customs bill and regulations and training for the implementation of the OECS
Harmonized System for goods classification.



CARTAC and MCM provided technical assistance on public debt management under
the Fund-supported program.



IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) and the World Bank provided assistance on
Public Financial Management under the SEMCAR project. A follow-up mission from
FAD visited the Federation in February 2016 to review progress with previous FAD
recommendations and provide advice on remaining challenges for modernizing tax
and customs administration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS



IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) is currently providing assistance for the
comprehensive review of the tax incentives regime. An FAD scoping mission took
place in March 2016 to review the main laws granting tax concessions and identify
the next steps for developing an incentive regime that would be appropriate for the
circumstances of St. Kitts and Nevis.



CARTAC, FAD and LEG provided assistance to improve cash management and tax
administration—including collection enforcement. CARTAC also provided assistance
in Property Tax reform to move the property tax base from rental value to market
value, and in improving central government fiscal and debt data.



A capacity building exercise was conducted to train new officers in the preparation of
fiscal and debt projections.

As part of the Stabilization and Adjustment Technical Assistance Program (SATAP), St. Kitts and
Nevis have benefited from capacity building in macroeconomic analysis.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 2016)
World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy: On November 13, 2014, the Board of
the Executive Directors of the World Bank Group has endorsed the new OECS Regional Partnership
Strategy (RPS) which will cover the period FY15-19. The high-level objective of the new RPS is to
contribute to lay the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth, in line with the OECS
governments’ priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the program is planned to be organized
around three main areas of engagement. Under the first one, the WBG is planning to support
“competitiveness”. Growth and job creation in the private sector will be supported both horizontally
– by improving the business environment– and vertically – by focusing on specific sectors with a
high potential to generate inclusive sustainable growth (particularly tourism, agribusiness and their
respective linkages). The second area of engagement is “public sector modernization”, with
particular focus on public financial management (PFM) and institutional capacity, including for
statistics and public private partnerships (PPPs), to better leverage private investment in
infrastructure and service provision. The third area is “resilience”, with the objective to address both
social vulnerabilities (in education, health and social protection), and exposure to natural disasters.
Constrained by the small size of investments in the OECS, the IFC and MIGA will contribute to the
RPS objectives through selective investment support, depending on opportunities. The IFC will focus
on crisis response; job creation and inclusive growth; innovation, competitiveness, and integration;
and climate change. MIGA faces limited opportunities for engagement because of the small market
size of the OECS countries.
The RPS is grounded in a holistic approach to tackling the long-standing issues of low growth
and debt sustainability in the Caribbean: the Comprehensive Debt Framework, developed in
2010 by the Bank at the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM countries. Structured
around four pillars, the Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF) is designed to address the
interdependent structural causes of high debt and low growth in small island states by (i) promoting
private-sector led growth, (ii) strengthening fiscal management, (iii) building resilience to natural
disasters, and (iv) improving debt management. Governments of the OECS recognize the
multifaceted nature of the challenges they face and understand that improvements in
competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal adjustments to ensure macro
sustainability, and enhanced sustainability and resilience to shocks are interrelated aspects that are
critical to resume and sustain inclusive growth. As a result, they have used the CDF to frame their
own reform strategies and activities.
The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS countries is expected to be around US$120
million, or up to a maximum of US$20 million for each OECS country for the period of the RPS
(FY15-19), subject to country and program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and exposure
management parameters. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries (Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA national allocation.
The IDA17 (FY15-17) allocation for the OECS is equal to SDR61.3 million, an increase of around

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

22 percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3 million). With regard to St. Kitts and Nevis, as
the country is not eligible to IDA resources (similarly to Antigua and Barbuda), it has available an
indicative amount of US$ 20 million IBRD resources for the period covered by the RPS (FY15-19).

A. Projects
St. Kitts and Nevis, because of its income status, is not eligible for IDA resources. Its indicative
IBRD allocation for the period covered by the RPS FY15-19 is US$20 million. As of today, there are
no active lending operations in St. Kitts and Nevis.
The most recent WBG engagement has been limited to the implementation of a grant which
had the objective of enhancing Public Sector Governance and Efficiency. This operation
(US$ 415,000) closed in October 2015 and was financed by a grant from the Institutional
Development Fund (IDF), a World Bank’s financing tool to enhance the delivery and implementation
of programs that will lead ultimately to better development results. The objective of this project was
to increase the quality of expenditures and public sector efficiency and promote a fiscally
sustainable and more equitable system of pay and employment which generates the right incentives
to improve public sector performance in St. Kitts and Nevis. This was done through building capacity
at the Ministry of Finance by working with government teams to: (i) implement measures to rapidly
increase the efficiency of personnel expenditures; (ii) align human resource needs and staffing in St.
Kitts and Nevis public service through the implementation of recommendations of functional
reviews; and (iii) introduce pay classification and evaluations.
The government of St. Kitts and Nevis launched its national chapter of the Caribbean Growth
Forum (CGF) in February 2013. The CGF is an initiative led by the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, in collaboration with the United
Kingdom Agency for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian Department of Foreign
Affairs, to identify policies and initiatives aimed at inducing growth and creating jobs in the
Caribbean region through analytical work, knowledge exchange and inclusive dialogue. The CGF can
contribute to an enhanced and participatory policy dialogue (involving the private sector, CSOs, and
other non-traditional stakeholders, such as youth and Diaspora) on key challenges that affect
economic growth, in a situation where fiscal space is limited and the need to promote a more
diversified knowledge-based economy is pressing. The CGF national chapters have been launched in
12 Caribbean countries, including all the six OECS countries.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal
and debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector
management and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key
instrument for policy dialogue with the OECS governments, including St. Kitts and Nevis. The Bank’s
program in St. Kitts and Nevis is further supported by a comprehensive series of analytical and
advisory activities, including the following: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and
competitiveness study (2005); An OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a Caribbean Air

disseminated in the context of the Caribbean Growth Forum. A number of knowledge products have
also been disseminated more recently, including “Driving tourism in the Eastern Caribbean: The case
for a regional Ferry”; “Trade matters: new opportunities for the Caribbean”; “Linking farmers and
agro-processors to the tourism industry in the OECS”; and the “OECS Growth report”.

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 2016)
Over the years, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has supported the economic and
social development of St. Kitts and Nevis, by providing financing for priority capital and
technical assistance (TA) projects. In addition, CDB has engaged in policy dialogue with the
Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. CDB’s involvement with SKN has been concerned with activities
such as: the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic, social and sectoral policies;
development of infrastructure to facilitate growth and economic diversification; direct and indirect
lending to agriculture; and emergency rehabilitation.
In December, 2012, CDB approved a new assistance strategy for St. Kitts and Nevis for the
period 2013-16. The strategy focuses on establishing an enabling environment for sustained
inclusive growth and poverty reduction and strengthening resilience by securing social stability and
improving environmental sustainability. The indicative list of interventions contained in the
assistance strategy was expected to result in a lending program of up to US$42.7mn over the
strategy period. At the end of 2015, CDB had approved loans totaling US$177.8mn to St. Kitts and
Nevis, of which US$2.4mn were undisbursed.
The Nevis Water Supply Enhancement is the only major project currently under
implementation. The project aims to assist in improving the water supply network capacity on the
island of Nevis. Under the project, approximately 20 kilometers of pipelines, two pumping stations
and storage capacity of 1.0 million gallons will be constructed. The project also provides for capacity
building and strengthening institutional arrangements for the delivery of water services.
The 2015 reporting period saw continued progress, although completion of the overall
project will be delayed. The installation of tanks and pumping stations is 95% completed. However
only 57% of the pipe network (parallel funded by NIA) has been completed, due to local capacity
issues. This will delay completion of the project by three years. Disbursement totaled $6.2mn,
approximately 74% of the loan amount of $8.4mn. Based on the amounts outstanding on existing
contracts and projected activities, the project will be completed approximately $1.3mn below
budget. The savings will be spent on additional reservoirs and pipe network. In addition, a tariff
study is to be carried out.
Three other projects were previously in the pipeline in 2013. (i) The Sixth Student loan was
terminated by the borrower, the St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla National Bank, and all monies owing to CDB
were repaid; (ii) the works funded by the Immediate Response Loan for Tropical Storm Otto were
completed under budget and the balance of the loan was cancelled; (iii) the Second Power Project
for Nevis which included the installation of a generator of 2.5mw, ancillary switchgear and an
operations facility was cancelled.
In 2015 CDB’s Board approved support for Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET). A TVET enhancement project was appraised by CDB staff, and approved in December
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2015. CDB will lend US$8mn to improve the TVET learning environment, enhance institutional
capacity, provide support for TVET Secretariat programming, and develop operational guidelines to
support PEP training. Disbursement is expected to start in late 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Methodological deficiencies are present in the real sector statistics. GDP
figures rely on the production approach, both in constant and current prices. Limited survey data
hinder the assessments of value-added for each sector with some sectors suffering from significant
weaknesses in estimation methodology. On the expenditure of GDP, which is available only at
current prices, the aggregate final private consumption expenditure is derived as a residual. This
residual includes households and NPISH final consumption expenditures, and changes in
inventories. Weaknesses are observed in the methods to estimate gross capital formation. GDP
figures are derived from the production approach in constant and current prices. There are
significant delays in completing data collection and processing of the annual NA. Staffing
constraints in the compiling agency may compromise the development of new statistics, the quality
improvement of the existing ones, and the intended improvements of timeliness. No quarterly GDP
is available. Monthly data on tourism is disseminated by the ECCB with a significant lag.
Price Statistics: CPI only covers St. Kitts but not Nevis although the information is available. Monthly
CPI data are posted on the ECCB website with a long lag, and a break in the series in November 2010
suggests a methodological problem in the linking process with the previous base. The ECCB
disseminate monthly data on tourism also with a long lag, and the estimates on tourism expenditure
are based on an old survey of spending by types of tourists and are only updated by changes in CPI.
Except for data from the social security board, limited data are available on labor market
developments.
Government Finance Statistics: St. Kitts and Nevis has reported to STA quarterly government
finance statistics (GFS) up to 2014Q1 and annual GFS up to 2012 on main aggregates and their
components for revenue, expense, and financing of the budgetary central government. Extrabudgetary units are included in budgetary central government. Accounts for the public enterprises
are only available with a long lag. There are also limited accounts provided on the activities of the
Sugar Investment Diversification Foundation, although it is playing an incremental role in fiscal policy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

Progress has been made in reducing discrepancies between overall balance and available financing in
2013 but further work is needed to resolve discrepancies in earlier years. Government finance data
are recorded by the authorities on a cash basis, and reported to the Fund based on a Chart of
Accounts broadly in line with the GFSM 1986 classifications. Efforts to report the government
financial balance sheet, particularly the main liabilities (loans and debt securities), will strengthen the
fiscal data for surveillance purposes. In implementing the GFSM 2014, the authorities should consider
making selective adjustments to the current cash accounting, as relevant, in the following
categories: arrears, debt reorganization, transactions in kind, and interest.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the
Fund by the ECCB, based on standardized report forms (SRF) for the central bank (SRF 1SR) and for
other depository corporations (SRF 2SR), since July 2006. In April 2007, a data ROSC mission assessed
the monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS and the Data Quality Assessment Framework
(DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the institutional coverage of other depository corporations is
incomplete, as data for mortgage companies, finance companies, building societies, and credit
unions—all of which accept deposits—are excluded. Also, accrued interest is not incorporated in the
value of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities, and valuation adjustments are included in other
liabilities. In addition, source data for the commercial banks do not provide the disaggregation
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide. Close
coordination between the ECCB and the single regulatory unit (which supervises financial
corporations other than those licensed under the Banking Act) is crucial. The ECCB is currently
working in implementing a new reporting system for commercial banks that is envisaged to address
the recommendations made by the April 2007 data ROSC mission. It is expected that the new
reporting system would be implemented in 2016-2017.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI): The ECCB compiles financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for its
member countries, including St. Kitts and Nevis. However, due to confidentiality reason,
dissemination of FSIs for the ECCB member countries has so far not been approved.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are compiled and disseminated by the ECCB on
an annual basis. The ECCB released preliminary summary estimates of 2014 balance of payments
and—for the first time—international investment position statistics following the latest international
standard methodology (BPM6) for the eight ECCU member economies in January 2016. The ECCB
plans to publish comprehensive balance of payments data in October 2016. The estimates benefited
from CARTAC technical assistance to develop and administer new surveys, and train data compilers
and survey respondents. Given the lack of detail of preliminary 2014 data, more work is needed to
review the recent revisions and identify balance of payments components that need further
improvement. The quality of major components of the balance of payments needs substantial
improvement, including the recording of goods imports, travel credits, investment income, and direct
investment transactions. There is also need to compile private sector external debt data; St. Kitts and
Nevis does not report external debt data to the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.

Further work have also been identified to (a) improve timeliness of annual data dissemination (the
most current data reported to STA pertains to 2013) and (b) review and produce time series that are
consistent with BPM6 methodological changes. Actions will have to be undertaken in conjunction with
the ECCB, which coordinates the compilation of external sector statistics for all its member economies.
Data shortcomings are being addressed by a shift from BPM5 to BPM6, as well as additional TA from
STA and CARTAC.
II. Data Standards and Quality
St. Kitts and Nevis has been participating in the
Data ROSC was published on August 2007.
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
October 2000, and currently participates in its
successor initiative, the e-GDDS. The 2007 regional
data ROSC provides an assessment on the ECCB’s
monetary statistics. No data ROSC is available for
other sectors. Monetary Statistics Component of
the Regional Data Module Report on Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) was published in
2007.
