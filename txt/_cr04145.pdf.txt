HUNGARY
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2004 Consultation with Hungary
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and Liam P. Ebrill
April 2, 2004

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Budapest during January 19–
30, 2004. The mission met with: President Járai of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB or the
National Bank); Finance Minister Lászlo; then Finance Minister designate Draskovics; senior
officials in the MNB, government ministries, Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority, and
parliament; trade unions; and representative of financial and research institutions. The staff team
was headed by Mr. Feldman, included Messrs. Drummond and Kuijs and Ms. Fabrizio (all
EUR), and was assisted by Mr. Sassanpour (resident representative in Poland) and Mr. Jiménez
(STA) in the preparation of updates of the Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) modules on
the fiscal sector and data dissemination. Mr. Abel, of the office of the Executive Director for
Hungary, participated in the discussions. The concluding statement was published.
Hungary has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and meets the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) specifications. The economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are
adequate for conducting effective surveillance.
In concluding the last consultation on May 9, 2003, Directors noted that Hungary’s high level of
integration with the EU provided a good basis for progress towards adoption of the euro—as
long as vigorous fiscal adjustment, wage restraint, and continued structural reforms were
pursued. While Hungary has responded to many of the policy challenges identified in past
Article IV consultations (e.g., enhancing exchange rate flexibility and strengthening fiscal
transparency), large public sector wage increases, an expansionary fiscal policy, and limited
progress on structural fiscal reforms ran counter to Fund advice.
The center-left coalition is led by the socialist party; the next parliamentary elections are
scheduled for 2006; Hungary is joining the EU in May 2004; and European Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for mid-June 2004.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Hungary’s entry into the EU comes on the heels of impressive accomplishments
(Figure 1). Its successes were based on the long-lasting effects of significant structural reforms
and privatization during the 1990s, which also facilitated Hungary’s outward orientation, FDI
inflows, strong export performance, flexible labor and product markets, and sound banking
system. This success was also rooted in undertaking macroeconomic adjustment measures when
needed, and in maintaining an adequate level of international competitiveness.
2.
More recently, while growth held up well despite the global slowdown, developments
point to the emergence of significant macroeconomic imbalances.
●
As a result of election promises, most public sector employees received a 50 percent
increase in wages in the fall of 2002. Together with increases in the minimum wage of over
90 percent during 2001–02, these increases spilled over into the private sector. This resulted in
year-average real wages on an economy-wide basis surging by some 13 percent in 2002. Real
wage growth slowed in 2003, but remained high at about 7½ percent. Such rapid wage growth
had adverse consequences for fiscal policy, inflation, and the current account. (Table 1 and
Figure 2, panel C).
●
The jump in government wages and its impact on pensions made it difficult to contain the
deficit of the general government (Figure 2, panel D). Combined with spending overruns in
health, housing subsidies (see Appendix IV on these subsidies), and interest expenditures
(described below), the deficit in 2003, according to preliminary data, was 6 percent of GDP
(ESA-95 basis), compared with an original target of 4½ percent (Table 2).
●
Real GDP growth stayed significantly positive in 2003 (at 2.9 percent). However,
consumption―fueled by wage increases, and a sharp drop in household savings and rapid credit
growth, both partly stemming from an expanded housing subsidy scheme―was a leading factor
(Figure 2, panels A and B).
●
Core inflation has recently picked up, and, in the face of rapid consumption demand,
wage and price growth in the services sector has been stubbornly high, (Figure 2, panel E). Yearon-year headline inflation reached 5.7 percent in December 2003, compared with the MNB target
of 3½ ± 1 percent.
●
Rapid consumption growth spilled over into imports (limiting the external sector’s
contribution to growth) and the external current account deficit widened to 5.5 percent of GDP
in 2003 (Table 3a and Figure 2, panels F and G).1 This widening also reflected the lagged effects

Official BOP statistics now use a new methodology for calculating FDI-related income, mainly
by including reinvested earnings. However, these new statistics, which only became available at
end-March 2004, were unavailable at the time of the Article IV discussions, and are therefore not
incorporated in the BOP for this report. Including reinvested earnings (as in Table 3b) raises both
the current account deficit and FDI, with no impact on the overall BOP.

of the decline in competitiveness in 2001–02 (Figure 2, panel J) and sluggish exports in the first
half of the year, also because of weak external demand. At the same time, net FDI turned
negative. The large current account deficit was therefore financed mainly by debt-creating inflows
that can be especially volatile in the face of lost policy credibility (Figure 2, panel I).

Over the course of the past year or so, the imbalances together with policy
inconsistencies have weakened policy credibility contributing to volatility in financial
markets. Several factors were at play: in the second half of 2003, the pursuit and announcement
of a Ft 250–260 per euro target (within Hungary’s ERM2-like exchange rate regime) when
policies were inconsistent; conflicting statements by policymakers about the appropriate exchange
rate level; and targets and estimates that went unfulfilled (including revisions to the 2003 fiscal
deficit target and the mid-December estimate of the 2003 fiscal outcome). As markets became
increasingly concerned about

Recent data have, however, included some bright spots that give rise to optimism on
the prospects for economic growth (Figure 2, panels F and J–L). The significant deterioration in
external competitiveness in 2001–02 was reversed during 2003. This reflected the forint
depreciating by about 11 percent against the euro, and wage moderation, alongside steady
improvements in productivity, in manufacturing. Industrial production and export growth began
accelerating in the second half of 2003. Meanwhile, investment growth was also rising; and
although imports were booming, the share of investment goods also increased. In all, the fourth
quarter saw year-on-year real GDP growth continuing to gather pace, reaching 3.6 percent.
5.
The authorities announced a revised target for the general government deficit
in 2004 of 4.6 percent of GDP, compared with an outturn of 6 percent in 2003. While the
new target is larger than the original proposal of 3.8 percent, it reflected the slippages in 2003.
With a view to enhancing transparency and credibility, the government decided on a more
realistic target, rather than risking another miss by a wide margin. Consistent with this revision,
expenditures are slated to drop by 1.2 percentage point of GDP compared with 2003; revenues are
expected to rise by 0.1 percentage point of GDP, with increases in VAT and social security taxes
(of 1 percentage point of GDP) almost offset by declines in other revenues (mostly non-tax
receipts).

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
6.
Dealing with macroeconomic imbalances and re-establishing policy credibility were
the most pressing issues, along with minimizing vulnerabilities on the road to euro
adoption. There was general agreement that large fiscal and current account deficits, if left
unattended, would impair economic prospects. Moreover, the loss of policy credibility, if not
reversed, would make the financing of these twin deficits all the more precarious. Thus, without
action, Hungary would be vulnerable to significant exchange rate and interest rate risks in the
period immediately ahead. Over the medium term, with the market focused on the timing of euro
adoption, shifts in market expectations about progress with nominal convergence will be an everpresent potential source of financial market pressure. Nevertheless, in part because Hungary
stacks up well on optimal currency area criteria, the advantages of euro adoption are clear, and a
credible target date would surely help to anchor expectations and minimize the output costs of
bringing inflation down.2 Thus, developing and expounding a consistent policy strategy with euro
adoption in mind and communicating it effectively were key aspects of the discussion.
A. Economic Outlook and Objectives
7.
There was broad agreement that the outlook for this year is characterized by a pick
up in growth, a temporary acceleration of inflation, and a narrowing of the current account
deficit.
●
With the envisaged strengthening of foreign demand and the depreciation of the forint in
2003, the external sector and business investment can be expected to make increasing
contributions to real GDP growth. Meanwhile, private consumption seems set to slow in response
to a slower pace of real wage gain and higher taxes. The National Interest Reconciliation Council
(NIRC)—representing government, employers, and employees—recommended an increase in
gross nominal wages for the private sector of 7–8 percent; after the mission, the government in
late-February agreed with trade unions on an average nominal increase in the wage rate for the
public sector of 6 percent. These broad considerations underlie most forecasts, with staff and
official GDP growth projections ranging from 3.1 to 3.5 percent (the finance ministry based the
budget on 3.5 percent growth).
●
The main one-off effects on inflation are adjustments to VAT rates and excise tax hikes.
According to MNB estimates, which seem reasonable to staff, the direct effect of these factors
will boost the price level by 1.9 percent; the lagged effects of the recent depreciation also raise
prices. Assuming no indirect effects and private sector wage growth somewhat above the NIRC
recommendation (wage increases have tended to be higher), the MNB projects headline inflation
of 6.9 percent at end-2004, compared with its target of 3½ ±1 percent. Largely because of lower
assumptions on fuel prices, staff’s projection is 6½ percent. The finance ministry’s projection
relies on lower pass-through of VAT and excise adjustments to consumer prices, with recent
statements by ministry representatives suggesting inflation might be below 6½ percent.
2

These issues are discussed in Adopting the Euro in Central Europe—Challenges of the Next
Step in European Integration (forthcoming IMF Occasional paper).

-6-

●
A projected narrowing of the current account deficit reflects a slowdown in domestic
demand (with slower consumption growth). The narrowing also stems from robust export growth
on the back of recovery abroad and the gains in external competitiveness in 2003. Staff projects a
deficit of 5¼ percent of GDP, compared with 5.5 percent in 2003 and a sustainable level of
roughly 4 percent.3 The MNB projects a deficit of 5.2 percent.
●
Various risks were apparent to both the authorities and staff. Among them, a weaker-thanexpected recovery abroad would lower growth and widen the current account deficit. It was
generally acknowledged that the current account deficit would be larger if consumption growth
did not moderate as anticipated. However, staff projections assumed conservative increases in
export market share so higher exports and a smaller current account deficit are also possible. The
importance of communication was also stressed: avoiding inconsistent policy statements would
help to minimize the risks that could arise to investment and growth if policy uncertainty were
heightened. Finally, on inflation, the up-tick in 2004 could adversely affect expectations and
make it more difficult to keep inflationary pressures at bay; exchange rate weakening is another
risk. On the other hand, the pass-through from VAT and excise adjustments could be lower than
expected.
8.
With respect to the medium term, the authorities were in the process of revising their
macroeconomic framework. They noted the difficulties in keeping to the original 2005–06 fiscal
targets envisaged in their last Pre-Accession Economic Program (PEP) (2.8 and 2.5 percent of
GDP, respectively) in light of the fiscal slippages in 2003. They were also concerned about
announcing targets that would be difficult to stick to, in circumstances in which further slippages
could hurt credibility. But irrespective of any possible delay in the target date for adopting the
euro,4 the authorities saw the importance of fiscal consolidation and containing the current
account deficit in its own right, and the need to adjust policy further if the current account deficit
did not continue to narrow. The authorities stressed, additionally, their goal of seeing investment
once again grow more rapidly than consumption, noting that this, and disinflation over the
medium term, would require wage moderation.
9.
The authorities were considering various factors related to the timing of ERM2
entry. The government saw advantages to entry soon after joining the EU, as ERM2 could act as
a disciplining factor and reinforce credibility. At the same time, the authorities saw the
advantages of waiting until both the details of their macroeconomic framework were fleshed out
and a narrowing of the twin deficits was more firmly in train. They also recognized the
complications in determining the “right” central parity given the fragility of the current
conjuncture. Thus, timing was under active review, with a sense that sooner would be better than
later. For its part, staff stressed that re-establishing policy credibility and having in place policies

-7-

that provide greater assurances that the necessary fiscal adjustment and disinflation would
materialize were essential for establishing a timeframe for entering ERM2 and euro adoption.

-8-

Staff’s medium-term scenario, based on continued fiscal consolidation, shows
Hungary’s current account moving to a sustainable path. The baseline (Table 4) assumes the
authorities meet their target for the general government deficit in 2004 and adjustment in later
years is in line with the last PEP (though the level of the deficits would be larger). Thus, the
(3 percent of GDP) Maastricht fiscal deficit criterion is met in 2007. With the increase in private
saving expected to be insufficient to finance rising investment (also assuming household saving
rises only moderately), the current account deficit contracts to about 3.5 percent of GDP by 2007;
government and external debt also decline in relation to GDP. Interest rates gradually fall from
their currently high levels. The alternative scenario—which assumes fiscal slippage in 20045 and
less adjustment than the baseline in later years—illustrates the risks in terms of a higher current
account deficit and debt, higher interest rates and interest payments, and, over the medium term,
lower growth. More generally, if various downside risks or other shocks were to materialize in
line with the stress tests shown in Tables 5 and 6, external and public debt dynamics could
become problematic in the absence of a policy response. All this strengthens the case for fiscal
adjustment against the background of a large current account deficit.
10.

11.
An important aspect of the discussions, for both the short and medium term, was
external competitiveness—which was judged to be broadly adequate. A key question was
whether the exchange rate level was appropriate. Both the authorities and private sector
representatives saw competitiveness as comfortably adequate. Among the considerations noted
were that: (i) while competitiveness had deteriorated earlier, it improved during 2003 (Figure 4);
(ii) Hungary continued to gain market share, and export growth has been accelerating; and (iii)
while anecdotal, exporters were not complaining recently. Staff broadly shared the general
conclusion, noting that with wage moderation and declining inflation, external competitiveness
would continue to improve. An accompanying selected issues paper analyzes competitiveness.
B. Fiscal Policy
12.
At this critical juncture, there was consensus that taking decisive actions in support
of fiscal adjustment was the only way to restore policy credibility and improve the
monetary-fiscal policy mix. Taking into account the slippages in 2003, staff concurred that the
original fiscal deficit target for 2004 had become unrealistic, and that the new deficit target of
4.6 percent of GDP (a reduction of almost 1½ percentage points with respect to 2003) was
sufficiently ambitious. Moreover, both the authorities and staff felt that significant fiscal
tightening would allow risk premia and interest rates to come down and limit vulnerability to
shifts in market sentiment. Thus, with questions hanging over the market on the government’s

mission estimated would be needed to hit the government’s target.

-9-

ability to secure its 2004 fiscal deficit target, the benefits of the early implementation of credible
fiscal measures toward this end were apparent.
13.
Important measures―announced in general terms just before and during the
mission—were firmed up by the cabinet in late February. These measures, equivalent to about
1 percent of GDP, come from reducing ministries’ operational spending (including the suspension
of certain expenditures announced in December by the previous finance minister, and cutting
back on maintenance, renovation, IT, and vehicles); from restraining transfers from the ministries
to institutions under their purview; and from scaling back project and investment spending
(excluding EU-related spending on highways and other items). Also important were changes in
the housing subsidy scheme, which imply relatively smallg budgetary savings in 2004, but will
contribute to substantial saving in the coming years.
14.
Notwithstanding these actions, achieving the 2004 deficit target will likely pose
serious challenges. Largely due to lower projected tax revenue, staff estimated that the deficit
would exceed the target by about ¾ percent of GDP. Staff thought that the finance ministry’s
reliance on efficiency gains in tax collection of VAT and social security contributions, and their
projection of the tax base for the personal income and profit taxes, were too optimistic.6
15.
The authorities indicated their readiness to make timely corrections to achieve the
deficit target if needed. As a measure of last resort, they saw room to further delay nonpriority
investment spending (unrelated to EU funding). Taking into account the risks posed by the current
account deficit and the election cycle, staff urged the authorities to quickly identify specific
contingency measures to facilitate a timely response.
16.
Staff regretted that the progress so far with structural fiscal reforms recommended
in recent years has been limited overall. The discussions revealed the difficulties that have
arisen because of a heavily polarized political climate. This was evident in wage policy: the
authorities reached an agreement on an increase in most public sector wages of 6 percent; staff
had recommended a nominal wage freeze in the general government (worth up to 0.5 percent of
GDP in saving). Staff recognized that formulating and implementing fundamental structural
reforms in the short time available in 2004 would border on the implausible. However, given the
lead time necessary for structural reforms, staff stressed the importance of beginning the
preparation early of structural spending measures that would support durable fiscal adjustment
over the medium term and improve the quality of public services. In this connection, steps in
starting health care reform in 2005 are encouraging, but implementation is key. Wage moderation
in the public sector—possibly a nominal wage freeze in 2005—is also needed.

6

For example, in the case of personal income taxes, the finance ministry uses a rise in the tax
base of over 13 percent, which appears to be inconsistent with the projections of wages and
employment. In the case of the VAT, a Ft 40 billion efficiency gain (about 0.2 percent of GDP)
was assumed, which seemed unlikely in light of the experience of the recent past and absent
concrete measures.

- 10 -

17.
All agreed that, while perhaps difficult politically, further fiscal consolidation is
required in the medium term and would be especially beneficial if centered on expenditure
restraint. This reflects the already high tax incidence, particularly on labor (indeed there is talk in
government circles of trying to lower taxes). At the same time, to leave room for spending
pressures arising from public investment needs and EU accession, careful expenditure
prioritization will be needed while focusing on consolidating current expenditure. And, as
analyzed in a selected issues paper from last year’s Article IV consultation, the experience in
other countries suggests that expenditure-based adjustment tends to be more durable, friendly to
growth, and credible.7 Earlier

size of the public sector. In the discussions, staff also emphasized that delaying the timetable for
euro adoption should not be seen as a reason for delaying fiscal adjustment, in light of
macroeconomic requirements. In addition, the potential benefits were noted of increasing the
labor force participation rate—including by leaving room for labor tax cuts (and phasing out the
lump-sum health care contribution from employers as planned) and reducing disincentives to
work stemming from the structure of benefits—which could be expected to raise potential output
and help mitigate pressures on public finances over the medium term.
18.
Fiscal performance and credibility would be enhanced by developing a well-defined
medium-term fiscal strategy, backed by expenditure ceilings. Thus, staff urged the authorities
to adopt the three-year rolling framework under consideration last year, which included a ceiling
on overall expenditure and sub-ceilings on key components. In the staff’s view, in an effort to
garner broad political support, such a framework should be submitted to parliament with a clear
statement of policy as part of the budgetary process. Moreover, in circumstances in which fiscal
adjustment is crucial, staff encouraged the authorities to use realistic but conservative
assumptions, with a view to erring on the side of fiscal over performance. Casting changes in the
tax system within a coherent medium-term strategy, rather than undertaking them from time to
time in an uncoordinated way, would enhance the predictability and quality of fiscal policy, and
the business climate.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
19.
After the significant interest rate hikes in 2003, monetary policy was appropriately
on hold at the time of the discussions. While all agreed that inflation would be outside the target
range this year, this largely reflected transitory factors. The MNB has noted that decelerating unit
labor costs would set the stage for a resumption of disinflation in 2005 (forecasting 4.3 percent at
end-2005, assuming that economic agents see the spike in inflation in 2004 as temporary). Staff
agreed that the inflation target for end-2005 (4.0 ± 1 percent) was in reach, noting, in line with
WEO inputs, that support would also come from subdued oil and other import prices. Thus,
taking into account that the lagged effects of the sizable interest rate hikes since mid-2003 are still
in the pipeline, staff did not see a compelling reason to raise interest rates further. However, while
the level of interest rates seemed broadly appropriate, staff felt that re-establishing confidence,
including through convincing fiscal adjustment, and limited second-round effects from the
transitory inflation factors were conditions that would permit interest rates to be lowered. The
finance ministry expressed confidence in meeting its fiscal deficit target and therefore felt there
would be room to lower interest rates reasonably soon. The MNB acknowledged the various
considerations above, but stressed the difficulties for monetary policy without fiscal
consolidation. On March 22, the MNB reduced its key policy rate by 25 basis points to
12¼ percent, against the background of the cabinet’s approval of spending measures, an
appreciating exchange rate during March (to Ft 250–255 per euro), and favorable economic data
(including smaller-than-expected general government and trade deficits for February).
20.
The advantages of the MNB’s move to greater exchange rate flexibility within the
existing regime was recognized. While the authorities had been targeting publicly an exchange
rate of Ft 250–260 per euro, this became increasingly untenable in the face of inconsistent
policies and the widening current account deficit, and the target was abandoned around the start
of the 2004. This was welcomed by staff, which emphasized that greater exchange rate flexibility
made good sense because, in circumstances in which the current account deficit was large, it
provided some room to absorb unanticipated shocks (including fiscal slippages)—albeit probably
at some cost to inflation.
21.
In the years ahead, monetary policy will need to grapple with a couple of key
questions.
●
How to adapt to ERM2? Once in ERM2, disinflation over the medium term will
increasingly need to take place in circumstances in which exchange rate variability against the
euro will be limited, consistent with the interpretation of the exchange rate stability criterion
within ERM2. Thus, inflation targeting will be operated in a qualified way with limited monetary
policy flexibility.8 Balassa-Samuelson effects are not expected to be particularly problematic,

8

Letting the exchange rate appreciate would enhance flexibility (and central parity revaluations
are allowed on the strong side without stopping the clock on the two-year requirement within
ERM2). However, with a large current account deficit, this would carry risks. For a discussion of

with economists at the MNB estimating the effects to now be small at about 1 percent or less.
However, inflationary pressures could arise from domestic sources or from capital inflows and
credit growth.
●
What are the key supporting policies? The authorities and staff agreed that monetary
policy would therefore need to be supported by the full use of policy tools required to achieve
disinflation. To this end, fiscal consolidation would be essential, for market confidence, to
contain demand pressures, and to avoid unwanted upward pressure on the currency. Wage
discipline needs to be backed by actions of the government: as the latter is a sizable employer, it
can play a lead role by signaling the importance it attaches to wage moderation through its public
sector wage policy. Moreover, drawing on the experience of current members of the euro area in
bringing inflation down to the Maastricht criterion, closer cooperation between the social partners
to achieve private sector wage agreement would also seem necessary.9 The goal of euro adoption
could help provide the necessary policy momentum on this score. To further minimize
vulnerabilities, there was agreement that it would be essential to get the central parity right and
develop and expound a consistent policy strategy.
C. The Financial Sector
22.
The supervisory authorities felt that the Hungarian financial system is basically
sound. Banks have remained adequately capitalized and liquid; profitability has been solid; and
the quality of banks’ loan portfolios has remained broadly stable (Table 7).
23.
The authorities nevertheless recognized potential vulnerabilities on various fronts.
While they considered the associated risks to be manageable for now, they agreed that careful
monitoring is warranted.
•
Vulnerabilities arose, first, from rapidly growing consumer lending. Consumer loans
increased by some 4 percentage points of GDP (to about 12½ percent) in 2003, with housing
loans accounting for more than 40 percent of this increase. On the one hand, the increase in
housing loans is expected to subside after the revisions to the housing subsidy scheme in
December 2003. The authorities also noted that rapid credit growth started from a low base so
growing credit could be seen as a positive structural development toward long-run equilibrium.
On the other hand, in circumstances in which the housing subsidy scheme is being scaled back

flexibility within ERM (see Adopting the Euro in Central Europe—Challenges of the Next Step in
European Integration (forthcoming IMF Occassional Paper).

At the risk of oversimplification, econometric estimation of a simple inflation determination
equation demonstrates the extent to which wage growth affects inflation (Appendix V).

and the banking market is highly competitive, the potential for financial intermediaries to take on
more risk to boost profitability was recognized.10
•
Second, potential vulnerabilities arose from credit risk as a result of exchange rate
volatility. The authorities noted that many companies have natural hedges and that the share of
households’ foreign currency borrowing from banks is small (3 percent of total bank lending to
households). However, they also indicated that such lending is highly concentrated within a few
banks and that lending to households by bank-owned financial enterprises (amounting to roughly
10 percent of households’ total liabilities) is mainly denominated in foreign currency. Staff has
encouraged the authorities to strengthen monitoring of the financial sector’s indirect exposure to
exchange rate movements (including through surveys of borrowers’ exposure).
•
A third vulnerability was the growing share of commercial property loans in overall
corporate lending, its high concentration within a few banks, and, in less developed parts of the
country, risks from less liquid collateral. In addition, commercial property lending is mainly
denominated in foreign currency, adding another element of risk.
•
Looking further ahead to the period close to euro adoption and afterward, interest rate
convergence can be expected to contribute to credit expansion. The Hungarian Financial
Supervisory Authority (HFSA) and the MNB agreed this should be closely watched for a credit
boom and shared the view that a strong fiscal policy and supervision of banks’ internal risk
management systems would be the main lines of defense.
24.
Important issues have arisen with respect to the HFSA. With the authorities having
requested technical assistance to ensure that legal changes governing the HFSA and its
institutional setup would be in line with best practices, an accompanying selected issues paper
summarizes practices in other countries. During the discussions, staff stressed that it is important
to maintain the independence of the supervisory authority, while ensuring its accountability.
D. Structural Reforms, Transparency, and International Standards
25.
Privatization is in its final stage, and structural reforms continue with the
liberalization of the energy sector and adjustment of electricity and natural gas prices to
cost recovery levels. Further privatization would help to increase FDI. In addition, the
liberalization of the electricity market is progressing and subsidies were eliminated as a result of
raising regulated prices by over 18 percent in 2003. This rise, according to Energy Office
estimates, closed the gap between costs and revenues at the state-owned grid-operator and public
wholesaler. Natural gas prices moved close to world market levels. Meanwhile, Hungary’s
10

Empirical work by Fund staff indicates that the ratio of bank credit to the private sector to GDP
in Hungary is well below long-run equilibrium, but that the pace of the expansion of this credit in
recent years has been sufficiently fast to at least raise a warning flag. See Early Birds, Late Risers,
and Sleeping Beauties: Bank Credit Growth to the Private Sector in Central and Eastern Europe
and the Balkans (WP/03/213).

- 14 -

competition legislation and enforcement, and market regulation, compare favorably with
advanced countries. However, with only modest progress in reforming the rail transport and
postal services sectors, there remains scope to increase efficiency. In addition, while the labor
market is generally quite flexible, the authorities could explore the possibility of differentiating
minimum wages and social benefits across regions with a view to alleviating regional imbalances.
26.
Hungary’s trade policy will soon be guided by the common EU policy. The authorities
did not envisage any significant negative impact from adopting the EU import duty structure. The
negative effects of the required elimination of some existing free-trade agreements (e.g., with
Serbia and Montenegro) were expected to be offset by the current EU trade agreements with other
third countries.
27.
Hungary made further progress in observing standards and codes in the fiscal and
data dissemination areas.11 BOP statistics are being moved to a full accrual basis. In this
connection, reinvested earnings have been incorporated at end-March 2004. Recent initiatives
have also been taken to increase transparency in the spending of public funds by strengthening
interim audits, financial control and management, and information dissemination. However, the
2002 amendment to the organic budget law allowed considerable leeway in undertaking
additional spending without supplementary appropriations and parliamentary approval as this can
be done as long as the deficit does not exceed what is budgeted by more than 5 percent of total
expenditure.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Hungary’s entry into the EU is a tribute to more than a decade of far-reaching
institutional and structural reforms although, more recently, large macroeconomic
imbalances have re-emerged. The country’s willingness and ability to undertake
macroeconomic adjustment measures in the middle of the 1990s laid the groundwork for the
subsequent macroeconomic successes that were achieved. However, in recent years, inappropriate
macroeconomic policies have led to large fiscal and current account deficits. If these are not
reined in, economic prospects would be seriously impaired, and Hungary would continue to be
vulnerable to significant exchange rate and interest rate volatility.
29.
The concerns raised by large twin deficits have only been exacerbated by the loss of
policy credibility. Such a loss increases the risks to the financing of the deficits. This is not only
because markets become less inclined to give Hungary the benefit of the doubt, but also the risk
of contagion from unexpected shocks outside of Hungary becomes greater.
30.
Looking ahead, there is reason for optimism concerning the short-term outlook. The
momentum of recovery has been evident in recent data on GDP, industrial production, exports,
and investment. Moreover, the deterioration in competitiveness in 2001–02 has been reversed and
can be expected to improve further with continued productivity growth and wage moderation.
11

See the accompanying data and fiscal ROSCs for more details.

- 15 -

Thus, with the right policies and an appropriate exchange rate level, Hungary would be well
poised to take advantage of a strengthening external environment and set the stage for a period of
more balanced economic growth—with exports and investment again taking the lead. The current
upswing forms a favorable backdrop for the challenges ahead.
31.
At this fragile juncture, decisive and concrete actions in support of fiscal adjustment
are the only way to restore policy credibility and improve the monetary-fiscal policy mix.
Such actions would help to lower risk premia, facilitate a reduction in interest rates, and limit
vulnerability to shift in market sentiment—all of which would strengthen prospects for
sustainable economic growth.
32.
Fiscal policy is embarking on an appropriately ambitious course, with the authorities
targeting a general government deficit of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2004 This implies a
narrowing of the deficit by almost 1½ percentage points of GDP from the previous year and
would facilitate a return of the current account toward a sustainable path. Moreover, a more
ambitious target would not have been realistic in light of the slippages in 2003.
33.
But the fiscal deficit target is again at risk. Based on announced policies, the risks of
falling short of the target, potentially by some ¾ percent of GDP, are significant. In view of the
importance of re-establishing policy credibility and taking into account the risk posed by the
current account deficit and the election cycle with parliamentary elections in 2006, timely
corrections are likely to be needed soon. Against this background, the authorities’ announced
intention to make such corrections is well placed and they are urged to quickly identify contingent
spending measures.
34.
At the same time, more fundamental expenditure reforms are needed to ensure
durable fiscal adjustment over the medium term. While the composition of fiscal adjustment
in 2004 could have been better geared to sustainable expenditure consolidation, fundamental
expenditure reforms would be difficult in the short time frame of one year, so the authorities must
prepare early for permanent structural spending measures if they are to begin to implement them
in 2005. Given the high tax incidence, particularly on labor, and the need to leave room for
spending pressures arising from public investment needs and EU accession, consolidating current
expenditure is particularly key. Moreover, consolidation focused on spending, when the latter is
high, tends to be more durable, friendly to growth, and credible. With reforms, savings could be
achieved in the areas of government employment, pensions, social benefits, subsidies, education,
and health care (where recently developed plans are encouraging). Related to this, a further
scaling back, if not elimination, of the housing subsidy scheme is warranted. Greater public sector
wage restraint is also warranted in the period ahead, after the lamentable lack of a freeze in 2004.
35.
Mechanisms to enhance fiscal discipline and bring forward policy credibility are also
needed. In this connection, the authorities had been considering a three-year rolling framework,
which included a ceiling on overall spending and sub-ceilings on key components. Introducing
such a framework would be beneficial and, in an effort to garner broad political support, should
be submitted to parliament along with a clear policy statement.

- 16 -

36.
The level of official interest rates is broadly appropriate, but there could be room to
reduce them as confidence is re-established. In light of the one-off factors affecting inflation
in 2004, and the lagged effects of the sizable interest rate hikes of last year, it would be a mistake
for the authorities to try to bring inflation within the target range in the immediate future by
raising interest rates. Moreover, the authorities are rightly focusing their public pronouncements
on their medium-term inflation objectives, and the supporting policies to achieve them,
communicating clearly that the impact of one-off factors are not expected to be repeated.
However, room would be created for interest rate reductions, following the recent small cut, by
re-establishing policy credibility, including through convincing fiscal adjustment, and to the
extent that the temporary hike in inflation is not igniting second-round effects that would threaten
the 2005 inflation target.
37.
The recent practice of allowing greater exchange rate flexibility is welcome. Focusing
on keeping the exchange rate within a particular narrow range and announcing this publicly was
problematic in light of the futility of defending particular rates when policies were inconsistent.
Faced with a large current account deficit, the greater flexibility provides a degree of insurance—
albeit at some cost to inflation—against unanticipated shocks, including fiscal slippage.
38.
The overarching challenge in the medium term will be to adapt the policy
framework to the goal of and requirements for adopting the euro. While Hungary stacks up
well on optimal currency area criteria and the advantages of adopting the euro are clear, putting in
place policies that provide greater assurances that the necessary fiscal adjustment and disinflation
will materialize are essential for establishing a time frame for ERM2 entry and euro adoption. As
ERM2 approaches, it will be important to avoid public communication that implies a hard and
fast commitment to a particular exchange rate level or range that could prompt another
speculative attack. Once in ERM2, monetary independence will be significantly lower, which will
make it more important to make full use of all policy tools for sustainable disinflation, including
fiscal consolidation and wage moderation. To minimize exchange rate vulnerabilities, it will also
be important to get the central parity right. A strong incomes policy is particularly needed for
alleviating tensions between inflation and current account objectives. In this area, the government
should take the lead with its public sector wage policies, including in state-owned enterprises.
39.
Available information indicates a healthy financial system, but it will be important
to keep an eye on the vulnerabilities that have arisen. These mostly reflect strong credit
growth and increasing credit risk and, while manageable now, warrant careful monitoring with a
view to taking timely corrective action if needed. Moreover, any legal changes to the supervisory
framework must preserve the independence of the HFSA while ensuring its accountability.
40.
Recent product market reforms are encouraging. Plans to complete the final stage of
privatization are welcome, as are the increases in gas and electricity prices, which take them to
cost recovery levels and eliminate implicit subsidies.
41.
Hungary’s commitment to transparency and standards, through its continued
participation in ROSC updates, is to be commended. Recent further improvements are
welcome, but the amendment to the organic budget law that allowed considerable leeway in

- 17 -

undertaking additional spending without supplementary appropriations and parliamentary
approval should be discontinued.
42.
The next Article IV consultation with Hungary is expected to be conducted under the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ These projections assume the government achieves its fiscal deficit target for 2004 and the pace of fiscal adjustment in 2005-06 is the same
as in the 2003 Pre-Accession Economic Program (PEP).
2/ Pending further data revision and reconciliation, there is a statistical discrepancy between the private sector savings-investment balance,
the general government balance, and the external current account balance of about one-half percent of GDP in 2002 and 2003.
3/ The 2002 general government balance includes various one-off financial operations (amounting to 3.1 percent of GDP) that are not part of the
saving-investment balance on a national accounts basis.
4/ Measuring the output gap is epecially difficult for a transition economy. For 2000 through 2003, the estimates are from the 2003 PEP (except
that an adjustment is made for 2003 for the difference between the estimated outcome for actual GDP and the projection contained in the PEP).
For 2004-07, potential GDP is assumed to grow by 4 percent.

1/ Consolidated general government debt, gross debt, ESA-95 basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ This scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ The macroeconomic variables in the baseline scenario are broadly in line with market consensus. Thus, this scenario is similar to the baseline.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
B4. Combination of 2-4 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2004 10/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2004

B. Bound tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2004-08 7/
A2. Primary balance under no policy change in 2004-08
A3. Country-specific shock with less fiscal adjustment in 2004-08 8/
A4. Selected variables are consistent with market forecast in 2004-08 9/

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as non interest current account deficit, plus interest and amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ Includes preliminary data as well as projections.

Between May 16, 1994 and January 1, 1997, the exchange rate of the forint was linked to a
basket of the European Currency Unit (with a weight of 70 percent) and the U.S. dollar (with a
weight of 30 percent). On January 1, 1997, the NBH changed the composition of its fixing
basket to a combination of deutsche mark (with a weight of 70 percent) and the U.S. dollar (with

- 36 -

APPENDIX I

a weight of 30 percent). Since January 1, 1997, the NBH has based its official rate on the
interbank spot rates. As of January 1, 2000, the central parity of the intervention band has been
defined solely in terms of the euro. Margins for the NBH's intervention band were widened to
±2.25 percent on December 23, 1994; and ±15 percent on May 4, 2001. Until March 13, 1995,
the value of the peg to the basket was adjusted periodically, mainly on the basis of the difference
between domestic and foreign inflation rates; from then until October 1, 2001, the value of the
peg was adjusted in accordance with a preannounced rate of crawl. Since October 1, 2001, the
central parity has been set at 276.1 forint per euro. Between March 13 and June 30, 1995, the
rate of devaluation against the basket was 1.9 percent per month; it was reduced to 1.3 percent
per month as of July 1, 1995; to 1.2 percent per month as of January 1, 1996; to 1.1 percent per
month from April 1, 1997; to 1.0 percent per month as of August 15, 1997; to 0.9 percent per
month from January 1, 1998; to 0.8 percent per month from June 15, 1998; to 0.7 percent per
month from October 1, 1998; to 0.6 percent per month from January 1, 1999; to 0.5 percent per
month from July 1, 1999; to 0.4 percent per month from October 1, 1999; to 0.3 percent as of
April 1, 2000; to 0.2 percent as of April 1, 2001; and eliminated effective October 1, 2001.
Hungary accepted the obligations of Article VIII as of January 1, 1996, and its exchange system
is free of restrictions on payments and transfers of current international transactions. In
accordance with UN Resolution 661 and Executive Board decision No.144–(52/51), Hungary
continues to maintain exchange restrictions against Iraq. The UN Security Council Resolution
on food for oil was implemented in December 1996. As confirmed by the authorities on March
23, 2004, Hungary continues to maintain exchange restrictions against Iraq, in accordance with
the UN Resolution 661, and financial restrictions against organizations and individuals
suspected of terrorism listed in the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. Hungary has
notified these measures to the Fund consistently with the Articles of Agreement.

APPENDIX II

HUNGARY—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Significant progress has been made in improving the coverage, periodicity, and
quality of Hungarian economic and financial statistics. Most data quality issues noted in
the data dissemination module of the 2001 Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) have been satisfactorily addressed, but some still remain.12
2.
Hungary subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). Hungary meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars.
A. Real Sector Issues
National accounts
3.
A statistical discrepancy between the final version of GDP by production activities
and GDP by expenditure components appeared in 1997, and has persisted. From 2000, the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO) has been regularly publishing an estimate of
this discrepancy for final annual data. Subsequent methodological refinements and a
change in the base year have trimmed the magnitude of the discrepancy to about 1¼
percent of GDP, based on 2001 current price data. From June 2002, the HCSO began
publishing seasonally adjusted estimates of quarterly GDP by type of economic activity and
by expenditure components beginning with the first quarter of 2002, with retrospective
coverage from 1995. The benchmarking of the quarterly estimates to the annual estimates
has been applied from 2000. Beginning with the annual data for 2000, the methodology for
estimation of imputed owner-occupied rent, which had been based on 1993 benchmarks,
was changed in line with recommendations of Eurostat.
B. Balance of Payments
4.
A work plan, with clear time tables, is being implemented to replace the current
cash-based balance of payments statistics, compiled by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB),
with the accrual-based accounting principles of the fifth edition of IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). A number of improvements has already been implemented:
customs data are used to derive trade in goods; balance of payments statistics record goods
under processing and repair as goods and financial lease arrangements according to the
BPM5 methodology; and estimates of reinvested earnings have been included in the
balance of payments statistics, raising the current account deficit with an offsetting impact
on the financial accounts. Further improvement is expected in 2004, when investment
income will be recorded on an accrual basis. These modifications will complete the process
12

The original 2001 ROSC Data Module and its annual updates are available on the IMF
internet web site. The latest update is Hungary: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module, 2004 Update (forthcoming).

- 39 -

APPENDIX II

of shifting Hungary’s balance of payments statistics to accrual accounting consistent
with the BPM5. The release of revised quarterly series is scheduled by the MNB for endMarch 2004 and will cover the period 1995–2003.
5.
The MNB and the HCSO have reconciled their data sources and methodologies
with regard to travel receipts and payments, eliminating a discrepancy which had existed in
this area between the balance of payments statistics and the national accounts.
6.
Since 2002, the cooperation between the HCSO and the MNB has been formalized
through memoranda of understanding signed each year between the two institutions,
identifying areas to improve statistics and harmonize data sources and methodologies.
C. Monetary Sector
7.
The International Financial Statistics (IFS) country page for Hungary provides
timely data for the monetary authorities, banking institutions, and the banking survey. The
coverage of the MNB’s analytical accounts has been extended, and Hungary complies with
the strengthened reserves standard. The framework for the compilation of monetary
statistics in Hungary basically conforms to the Fund's current methodology.
8.
The Statistics Department (STA) had suggested excluding deposit liabilities of
credit institutions under liquidation from the monetary aggregates by reclassifying them as
“restricted deposits.” The MNB has decided, as from beginning 2003, that these credit
institutions are no longer classified as Monetary Financial Institutions (depository
corporations) and hence deposits held with them are excluded from the monetary
aggregates. Moreover, the deposits of these credit institutions held with the MNB and with
other credit institutions have been reclassified as deposits of “nonfinancial enterprises,”
thus excluding them from base money. However, it should be noted that in line with the
IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and consistent with the advice of the
European Central Bank (ECB), such institutions should be reclassified as other financial
intermediaries.
9.
STA had also recommended that securities on the balance sheets of depository
corporations be valued at market prices; these securities are currently based on partial
market valuation. Work is in progress in this area. From 2004, depository corporations are
encouraged to use market valuation for securities in their trading portfolio. From 2005, this
requirement is compulsory for those depository corporations that are listed on the stock
exchange. Also, securities of all companies that are listed on the stock exchange and are
held by depository corporations in their trading portfolio should be based on market
valuation.13
13

The securities of those companies not listed on the stock exchange will be priced on the
basis of secondary market values. In the absence of a secondary market, the valuation will
be: (i) on the basis of company profitability using the last two annual company reports, or
(ii) by calculating the present value of securities using acquisition prices. If no other
information is available, acquisition prices could be used for the valuation.

- 40 -

APPENDIX II

Depository corporations are required to revalue their securities at least quarterly, and more
frequently if possible.
10.
Starting with the release of data for January 2003, the MNB has been compiling and
publishing the monetary aggregates by adopting a new methodology consistent with that
used by the ECB. In addition to the central bank and credit institutions, monetary financial
institutions now also comprise money market funds (MMFs), as the investment units
issued by MMFs show characteristics similar to those of bank deposits. Accordingly, the
MMFs’ balance sheet data are included in the consolidated balance sheet of the banking
system (depository corporations survey). Other classifications that are already in
conformity with ECB guidelines include: classification of credit extended on a gross basis
(excluding interest accrued); fixed assets at acquisition cost; deposits at face value (without
interest accrued); and debt securities not reported at market value are recorded at face value
and zero coupon bonds at discounted value.
D. Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
11.
In January 2004, STA conducted a substantive update of the GFS dataset using the
July 2003 Data Quality Assessment Framework that it had developed for assessing the
quality of five macroeconomic datasets. The mission reported that, overall, significant
progress has been made in addressing the shortcomings of budget execution data and GFS
identified in the original ROSC Data Module. These improvements relate mainly to
institutional coverage of general government, consolidation of data and reconciliation of
deficit and financing. However, plans to report monthly expenditures classified on an
economic basis have yet to come to fruition.
12.
Following a GFS mission in 1998, the authorities provided annual data for
publication in the GFS Yearbook starting from 1991. The latest data reported for
publication in the 2003 GFS Yearbook are for 2002. These data now cover the operations
of the State Property Management and Privatization Company, since its inception in 1995,
National Road Construction Company, State Debt Management Co., CASA Co., and the
Participation Management Co. Data for 2000 through 2002 were compiled on an accrual
basis, in accordance with the methodology of the 2001 Government Finance Statistics
Manual. The GFS Yearbook data, and the monthly data reported for IFS, still contain
inconsistencies between the measures of the deficit and financing.

APPENDIX III

HUNGARY— RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Hungary joined the World Bank in 1982. Since then the Bank has committed some
US$4.3 billion for 40 projects and programs. During the 1980s, Bank assistance focused on
liberalizing the economy and modernizing and expanding its productive capacity, and
infrastructure. During the 1990s, support for macroeconomic and structural adjustment was a
key element of the Bank’s assistance program. Bank assistance included structural adjustment
loans in the early 1990s, accompanied by Japan Exim co-financing and an IMF EFF Program,
and sector adjustment loans in the mid-1990s supporting financial sector and pension reform.
The Bank also provided support to help strengthen public institutions (e.g., in tax
administration and public finance, health and social assistance).
Hungary continues to enjoy access to private capital at terms that are extremely competitive for
sovereign borrowings, and to significant financing from European institutions. Consequently,
Hungary has ceased to borrow from the World Bank and does not envisage any further
borrowing. In accordance with the last CAS Progress Report, discussed by the Bank’s Board in
April 2002, which envisaged a pre-graduation assistance program, the Bank has been
providing analytical and advisory services, to complement support from the EU and other
sources, and taking into account the Bank’s comparative advantage.
There is only one ongoing Bank-financed project, the Municipal Wastewater Management
with an undisbursed balance of about US$12 million as of mid-November 2003. In addition to
the Wastewater Project, ongoing activities include a GEF Project Development Facility grant
to prepare a Nutrient Reduction Project, an IDF grant for a Center of Excellence in Hungary
for Property Rights and Land Market Development in EU Candidate and Balkan countries, an
IDF grant for the new Office of Roma Affairs in Hungary, and advisory work on health,
pensions, and energy reform options to help meet EU requirements, increase effectiveness and
ensure financial viability. The Bank is also providing policy and institutional advice on subnational development issues. In addition, Hungary is participating in the “Cities of Change”
initiative established jointly by the Bank and the Bertelsmann Foundation to support policy
and administration reform at the municipal level in medium-sized cities in Hungary, Poland,
Latvia, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.
Hungary has started to pre-pay some loans and its outstanding obligations to the Bank amount
to about US$253 million as of the end of October 2003. IFC has not undertaken new
investments and guarantees in Hungary in recent years.

APPENDIX IV

HUNGARY—THE HOUSING SUBSIDY SCHEME
The housing subsidy scheme introduced in 2001 has had a significant impact on the
general government deficit and the external current account. Under the scheme,
households can obtain mortgage loans from commercial banks at below-market rates, while
the banks are compensated with a subsidy from the government. With subsidies initially
available only towards the purchase of new houses, the use of the scheme increased
significantly when in March 2002 subsidies under the scheme also became available towards
the purchase or reconstruction of used houses. Increases in market interest rates in 2003
further boosted subsidy spending to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003. The impact of the scheme
on domestic demand and external balances is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, because of
fungability, the usage of subsidized loans—particularly those for used houses—partly for
consumption purposes is considered to have boosted domestic demand significantly. The
MNB estimates that 15–30 percent of the loans granted towards used houses are used for
consumption.14
Recent amendments—reducing the credit limit and the size of the interest subsidy and
tightening the eligibility criteria—are expected to reduce the fiscal costs and the impact
on private consumption over the medium term. In June 2003, the maximum credit limit
was reduced from Ft 30 million to Ft 15 million (still almost 10 times the average annual
wage), while the number of subsidized mortgage loans per households was restricted to one.
In December 2003, the maximum credit limit for the purchase or reconstruction of used
homes was further decreased to F5 5 million. In addition, the interest subsidy element was
reduced by making the interest rate for customers partly dependent on market interest rates.
These changes are expected to rein in the fiscal expenditures and domestic demand pressures
stemming from the scheme. The MNB estimates the fiscal savings to increase to 0.3–
0.4 percent of GDP in 2006/7, and the impact on the current account deficit to rise from 0.1–
0.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 0.45–0.75 percent of GDP in 2006/7.1 Nevertheless, with the
changes applying only to new contracts, the immediate impact is expected to be modest,
while high market interest rates and a spurt of new contracts arranged during the grace period
in December 2003 are expected to boost expenditures in 2004 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004.

APPENDIX V

HUNGARY—ESTIMATION ERROR CORRECTION MODEL FOR CPI INFLATION
This appendix uses a simple econometric estimation method (the Engle-Granger two step error
correction method) to assess the relative importance of wage costs and import prices in the
determination of inflation. In a first step, a long-term relationship was estimated for the CPI index
(excluding regulated prices), using wages and productivity in the enterprise sector (or unit labor
costs, so that the coefficients on these variables are constrained to be equal in size) and import
prices. This estimation suggested weights for wages and productivity of around 0.7 and somewhat
over 0.4 for import prices (see equation 1). That the sum of these weights is close to 1 is
encouraging.
LCPIXR = 0.69 * LULCEP + 0.43 * LCPIGF – 2.86 + seasonality,
(0.022)
(0.025)
(0.142)

(1)

where CPIXR is the CPI index excluding regulated prices, ULCEP is unit labor costs in the
enterprise sector, CPIGF is the German consumer price index denominated in forint, and L is the
log operator.
Inclusion of this long-term relationship as an error correction term in a dynamic equation for the
CPI index confirms that inflation responds to disequilibria with respect to the long-term
relationship (see equation 2).
DLCPIXR = 0.374 * DLCPIXR_1 + 0.236 * DLCPIXR_3 + 0.231 * DLCPIXR_4

(0.021)
(0.0298)
(0.002)

(2)

where ECM is the long run relationship from equation 1, and OPG is the output gap estimated using
GDP data.15
The coefficient of the ECM suggests that 60 percent of a disequilibrium would be closed in one
year. The output gap appears with a significant coefficient in the dynamic equation, suggesting that
price pressures increase when activity becomes more buoyant.

15

Key test results include: a standard error of 0.0039, and a Durban-Watson statistic of 2.11. The
equation passed a number of specification tests.

Supplementary Information

May 7, 2004
1.
This supplement reviews developments in Hungary since the preparation of the staff
report for the 2004 Article IV consultation. The additional information does not change the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND DATA REVISIONS
2.

Recent economic developments include:
•

Merchandise exports in euro terms were 13.1 higher in January-February 2004 than a
year earlier (about 20 percent in volume terms). With imports in euros higher by
8.4 percent during that period (about 15 percent in volume terms), the trade deficit
was substantially lower (totaling € 270 million in January-February of this year,
compared with € 467 million in January-February 2003). However, the overall
external current account did not improve much: the 12-month rolling current account
deficit (including reinvested earnings) was 9 percent of GDP in February, down from
its peak of 9.2 percent in August-October 2003. Industrial output benefited from the
strength of exports: it was up 10.8 percent in the first quarter of 2004 from a year
earlier.

•

Year-on-year headline CPI inflation was lower than expected in March, declining to
6.7 percent from 7.1 percent in February, as food prices developed favorably. Core
inflation (which excludes food and fuel) remained constant at 6.1 percent.

•

Gross monthly wage growth in the private sector was 10.1 percent, year-on-year, in
January-February 2004 (3.3 percent in real—CPI deflated—terms), compared with
year-average growth of 9.0 percent in 2003 (4.3 percent in real terms). In the public
sector, wage growth fell to 5.5 percent in January-February 2004 (-1.4 percent in real
terms), compared with 17.8 percent in 2003 (13.2 percent in real terms).

-2-

•

Since the preparation of the staff report, the forint has continued to stabilize in the Ft
250-255 per euro range. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) reduced its key policy
rate by 25 basis points on April 5, and on May 3 by another 50 basis points (to
11½ percent), citing with the latest cut improvements in foreign investors’ assessment
of the risks facing the Hungarian economy.

•

Based on preliminary data, the general government deficit was about 2.1 percent of
estimated annual GDP in the first quarter of 2004, compared with 1.6 percent in the
first quarter of 2003 (excluding local governments, who typically run a small deficit).
Tax revenues increased by 8.3 percent in the year to the first quarter of 2004; total
expenditures increased by 17.3 percent, though the increase was 7.8 percent
excluding “chapter administered professional appropriations.” The latter is a bulky
item which includes transfers to central budgetary institutions, a large share of which
occurred earlier than usual this year. The Ministry of Finance expects that the general
government deficit will continue to increase through the second quarter, but will then
be very low in the second half of 2004.

3.

Fiscal data have been revised:
•

On April 5, after the staff report was prepared, the Ministry of Finance provided staff
with revised estimates of the allocation within the 2004 budget, partly reflecting
revised estimates of the 2003 fiscal outcome (see attached table). The latter revision
incorporated information on local governments and the consolidation among different
parts of the general government, which had previously been unavailable. While some
numbers and ratios used in the tables and text of the staff report would be modified
(see below), the analysis and conclusions of the staff report would not change in a
substantive way. The revisions largely reflect adjustments to the consolidation of the
fiscal data for 2003 across different parts of the general government, increasing both
consolidated revenues and expenditures by about 1.2 percent of GDP, while changing
the balance by only a very small amount (to 5.9 percent of GDP from the preliminary
estimate of 6.0 percent mentioned in the staff report). The revised projections for
2004 show roughly unchanged total revenues and expenditures—and therefore an
unchanged deficit—although the composition of these components differs from the
budget projections in the staff report.

•

Nevertheless, staff still sees risks to achieving the 2004 fiscal deficit target, consistent
with those elaborated in the staff report.

Anti Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
4.
The authorities updated staff on the status of AML/CFT legislation and its
enforcement. In June 2003, the new AML Act came into force. Its key features include:
(i) bringing rules for lawyers and public notaries fully in line with the second AML Directive
of the European Union; and (ii) introducing re-identification and verification of identification

-3-

documents of existing customers of financial sector institutions. Other developments include
an increase in the number of suspicion reports, and an increase in the number of staff of the
Financial Intelligence Unit. Hungary was removed from the FATF monitoring list in June
2003.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Hungary
On May 10, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Hungary.1
Background
Hungary’s entry into the EU comes on the heels of impressive accomplishments. Its successes
were based on the long-lasting effects of significant structural reforms and privatization during
the 1990s, which also facilitated Hungary’s outward orientation, foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows, strong export performance, flexible labor and product markets, and sound banking
system. The success was also rooted in undertaking macroeconomic adjustment measures
when needed, and in maintaining an adequate level of international competitiveness.
However, while growth held up well in recent years despite the global slowdown, significant
macroeconomic imbalances have emerged. Reflecting huge increases in public sector and
minimum wages, economy-wide real wages surged by some 14 percent in 2002 and grew by
another 10 percent in 2003. Such rapid wage growth had adverse consequences for fiscal
policy, inflation, and the current account. And, while real GDP growth stayed significantly
positive (at 2.9 percent) in 2003, consumption was a leading factor—fueled by the large wage
increases, and a sharp drop in household savings and rapid credit growth (partly reflecting an
expanded housing subsidy scheme). The general government deficit in 2003, according to
preliminary data, was 5.9 percent of GDP (ESA-95 basis), compared with an original target of
4.5 percent. In addition to the carryover effect of large public sector wage increases and its
impact on pensions, the deficit outturn resulted from overruns in spending on health, housing
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

subsidies, and interest payments. Core inflation has recently picked up and, in the face of
rapid consumption demand, price growth in the services sector has been stubbornly high.
Meanwhile, year-on-year headline inflation was above target at 5.7 percent in December 2003.
Rapid consumption growth also spilled over into imports and the current account deficit,
influenced additionally by the lagged effects of declining competitiveness in 2001-02, widened
to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2003 (excluding reinvested earnings). This deficit was financed
mainly by debt-creating inflows.
Over the course of the past year or so, the imbalances together with policy inconsistencies
weakened policy credibility—contributing to volatility in financial markets. Several factors were
at play: in the second half of 2003, the pursuit and announcement of a Ft 250–260 per euro
target (within Hungary’s ERM2-like exchange rate regime) when policies were inconsistent;
conflicting statements by policymakers about the appropriate exchange rate level; and targets
and estimates that went unfulfilled (including revisions to the 2003 fiscal deficit target and the
mid-December estimate of the 2003 fiscal outcome). As markets became increasingly
concerned about external and fiscal developments (and policy credibility generally), Hungary
experienced significant bouts of volatility. Interest rates were increased to support the
currency. The main short-term policy interest rate was increased by 300 basis points in
November 2003 to 12.5 percent, bringing the total increase to 600 basis points since June.
Recent data have, however, included some bright spots that give rise to optimism on the
prospects for economic growth. The significant deterioration in external competitiveness
in 2001-02 was reversed in 2003. This reflected forint depreciation against the euro, and wage
moderation, alongside steady improvements in productivity, in manufacturing.
Industrial production and export growth began accelerating in the second half of 2003, while
investment growth was also rising. In all, the fourth quarter saw year-on-year real GDP growth
continuing to gather pace, reaching 3.5 percent.
The authorities announced a revised target for the general government deficit in 2004 of
4.6 percent of GDP, compared with an outturn of 5.9 percent in 2003. While the new target is
larger than the original one of 3.8 percent, it reflected the slippages in 2003. With a view to
enhancing transparency and credibility, the government decided on a revised but more
realistic target, rather than risking another miss by a wide margin.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors saw Hungary’s entry into the EU as a fitting tribute to a successful
transition to a market economy, based on more than a decade of far-reaching institutional and
structural reforms. However, Directors were concerned about the emergence of large fiscal
and current account deficits, as well as continued inflationary pressures, and saw important
benefits to strengthening policy credibility.
Looking to the period immediately ahead, most Directors welcomed recent indications that
growth prospects have improved. They observed that continued productivity growth and wage
moderation would support further competitiveness gains. Overall, Directors felt that, with the
right policies, Hungary is well poised to take advantage of a strengthening external
environment to achieve more balanced economic growth. However, they stressed that a
lasting improvement in economic prospects and a reduction in Hungary’s vulnerability to
exchange rate and interest rate volatility will require reining in the macroeconomic imbalances.
Directors called upon the authorities to move ahead forcefully in taking decisive and concrete
actions in support of fiscal adjustment to improve the monetary-fiscal policy mix. Credible fiscal

policy measures will help strengthen the external current account, lower risk premia, facilitate a
reduction in interest rates, and limit vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment.
Directors generally considered that the fiscal adjustment envisaged by the authorities in 2004
is appropriately ambitious. However, Directors noted the risks of falling short of the 2004 deficit
target, and cautioned that further fiscal corrections could be needed soon. They were
encouraged by the authorities’ intention to stand ready to introduce such corrections, and
urged them to quickly identify specific contingent spending cutbacks.
Directors considered that more fundamental expenditure reforms are needed to ensure
durable fiscal adjustment over the medium term. They noted that, given the high tax incidence,
particularly on labor, and the need to leave room for spending pressures arising from public
investment needs and EU accession, priority should be given to consolidating current
expenditure. In this connection, Directors identified a number of areas in which reforms can
achieve significant savings, also with a view to improving the efficiency and delivery of public
services. These include rationalizing government employment, continuing pension reform,
improving the targeting and structure of social benefits and subsidies, and reforms in
education and health care. In a related vein, Directors recommended a further scaling back of
the housing subsidy scheme and called for greater public sector wage restraint in the period
ahead. In addition, as a way to enhance fiscal discipline, Directors encouraged the authorities
to follow through on plans to introduce a rolling medium-term fiscal framework with expenditure
ceilings, and to integrate it in the annual budget process.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on medium-term inflation objectives.
Several Directors noted that official interest rates remain high, and some saw room, after the
cuts in official rates of the last few months, to reduce them somewhat further in light of the
recent strength of the currency. Several other Directors, however, considered that the stance
of monetary policy remains appropriate for the time being. Directors agreed that room for more
significant cuts would be created once demonstrated fiscal adjustment is undertaken to firmly
re-establish policy credibility.
Directors noted that in the face of inconsistent policies, the authorities’ focus on keeping the
exchange rate within a narrow range in 2003 had become problematic. In light of the large
current account deficit, they welcomed the recent shift to greater exchange rate flexibility,
which, they felt, will provide a welcome cushion against unanticipated shocks.
Directors noted that the overarching challenge in the medium term will be to adapt the policy
framework to the requirements for adopting the euro. In this context, they underlined that there
will need to be greater assurance that the necessary fiscal adjustment and disinflation will
materialize before the authorities proceed to establish a definitive time frame for ERM2 entry
and euro adoption. Directors added that, as ERM2 approaches, it will be important to avoid
public communication that implies a rigid commitment to a particular exchange rate level or
range, which could prompt another speculative attack.
Recalling that ERM2 will reduce monetary flexibility, Directors stressed that the authorities
should ensure that they make full use of all policy tools for sustainable disinflation, including
fiscal consolidation and wage moderation. To minimize exchange rate vulnerabilities, they also
emphasized the importance of getting the central parity right. Several Directors also
underscored the benefits that could derive from an incomes policy aimed at alleviating
tensions between the inflation and current account objectives, adding that the government
should take the lead on restraining wages.

Available information indicates that the Hungarian financial system is healthy and that the
vulnerabilities that have arisen appear manageable. Directors noted that some of these reflect
strong credit growth and increasing credit risk. Directors recommended that the authorities
carefully monitor these vulnerabilities, with a view to taking timely corrective action if needed.
Moreover, they emphasized the importance of ensuring an independent and accountable
financial supervisory authority. Directors commended the authorities’ effort to comply with
international standards on Anti-Money Laundering/Combating The Financing of Terrorism, and
encouraged the implementation of the new AML law.
Directors were encouraged by recent product market reforms. They welcomed plans to
complete the final stage of privatization, as well as the increases in gas and electricity prices to
cost recovery levels, which will eliminate implicit subsidies. As regards the labor market,
Directors encouraged actions to help raise the current low labor participation rate.
Directors commended Hungary’s commitment to transparency and standards, through its
continued participation in Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes updates.
While welcoming the further improvements made recently, Directors suggested that the
authorities’ considerable leeway to undertake government spending above budgeted levels
without supplementary appropriations and parliamentary approval threatens fiscal discipline
and needs to be rectified.
