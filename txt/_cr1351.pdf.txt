STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 28, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Near-term outlook. Along with a handful of neighboring countries, Malaysia has
bucked global trends and posted strong growth in 2012, supported by domestic
demand. In the face of weak external demand, this has led to a significant moderation in
the current account surplus. Growth is expected to remain robust in the near term,
fueled by resilient domestic demand and a modest uptick in exports. Inflation should
remain restrained. Risks to the outlook are mainly external and tilted to the downside.
General elections, which must be held by June 2013, may add to short-term market
volatility. Macroeconomic policies are well calibrated to the current conjuncture, and
monetary policy has ample room to respond in a downside scenario. The economy’s
external rebalancing is expected to continue over the medium term.
Safeguarding financial stability. The 2012 FSAP found that the Malaysian financial
system is sound and supported by a strong regulatory and supervisory framework. Risks
to financial stability from high household debt or, potentially, from capital flow volatility,
should continue to be monitored closely, but are contained by high bank capital buffers,
ample international reserves, and sound monetary and financial policies.
Strengthening fiscal sustainability. Malaysia must regain the fiscal space it lost after
the global financial crisis. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to medium­term
fiscal consolidation, which should be underpinned by a concrete and comprehensive
plan. Consolidation must be accompanied by structural reforms to improve the
efficiency and equity of fiscal policy: the revenue base must be broadened and
diversified away from energy­related receipts; universal fuel subsidies must be gradually
replaced by targeted social transfers; and public financial management must be
strengthened to better deal with risks associated with growing federal government
contingent liabilities.
Promoting higher and more inclusive growth. Malaysia’s record of economic
development since independence has been impressive. Achieving the authorities’ goal of
turning Malaysia into a high­income nation by 2020 will require sustained
implementation of the wide ranging structural reforms they have identified to boost
investment and productivity. The authorities are also committed to enhancing social
protection. A new minimum wage policy has taken effect from January 2013, and other
reforms to strengthen social safety nets are being considered. Together, these reforms
will help boost growth, support the ongoing rebalancing, and promote inclusiveness.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Political context. Malaysia has a parliamentary political system. General elections must be
held at least once every five years, but can be called at any time by the Prime Minister before the
five­year period has expired. The next general election must be held by June 2013, but has been
expected since 2011, leading to a pre­election political climate for the past two years or so.
2.
Developments. Malaysia’s economic performance in 2012 surpassed expectations. Robust
domestic demand is offsetting external weakness and is fueling growth, now estimated by staff at
5.1 percent in 2012 (Figure 1). Private and public investment has been a key driver of the expansion,
supported by low interest rates and the catalytic effects of large projects under the Economic
Transformation Program (ETP), particularly in oil, gas, and infrastructure. Consumption growth has also
been vigorous, supported by a strong labor market, credit to households, and government transfers.
Net exports, on the other hand, have declined. This has led to a significant external rebalancing, with
the current account surplus moderating by about 5 percentage points of GDP relative to 2011
(paragraph 31). Inflation eased in 2012, on lower global commodity prices and base effects. Average
CPI inflation was 1.7 percent in 2012. Indicators of underlying inflation have also remained relatively
subdued. With growth above potential in 2011−12, the output gap has closed (Figure 2).

3.
Growth outlook. The robust pace of economic activity is expected to continue in 2013 and
over the medium term. Consumption in 2013 will remain supported by low unemployment and by
fiscal transfers. Investment should also remain strong, reflecting in part a large pipeline of ETP­related
projects.1 Exports are expected to pick up slightly next year, in line with the WEO baseline. The federal
government (FG), on the other hand, will provide a modest drag, with a fiscal impulse of ­0.6 percent
in 2013. Overall, staff projects growth in 2013 at 5.1 percent. Over the medium term, growth is
projected at about 5 to 5.5 percent, as ETP­related investments boost productivity and female labor
force participation rates increase (paragraph 27).
1

In the year to November 2012, 48 projects with a total committed investment of RM 52 billion were announced,
bringing the cumulative total since ETP was launched in October 2010 to 158 projects and RM 231 billion (just under
25 percent of GDP) of investment commitments, to be realized over the coming years.

4.
Inflation outlook. With output at about potential and dissipating base effects, inflation is
projected to rise slightly to 2.2 percent in 2013. In addition, the introduction of a minimum wage
in 2013 (Box 1), the gradual removal of fuel price subsidies, and the planned adoption of a goods and
services tax (GST) are expected to have small one­off effects on inflation in the period 2013−15,
tapering off subsequently.
5.
Risks. The principal risks to Malaysia’s outlook are external and tilted to the downside
(Appendix I). An intensification of the euro area crisis, a sharp slowdown in China (Malaysia’s main
trading partner) or other shocks to global growth or risk aversion (for instance from a sharp fiscal
contraction in the United States) would impact Malaysia through trade, commodity prices, and
financial channels and could trigger capital flow volatility.2 The continued strength of intra­ASEAN
trade, supported by robust domestic demand in several ASEAN economies, is however providing some
resilience against these risks (Box 2). Domestically, elevated housing prices and growing household
debt may pose risks for the financial sector. Also, a slower-than-expected pace of implementation of
fiscal and structural reforms could pose risks. For instance, a protracted increase in unit labor costs
resulting from slower-than-envisaged medium-term productivity increases or a higher-thananticipated impact from the minimum wage could harm potential growth. Finally, the upcoming
general elections could lead to some market volatility.
6.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that growth would remain robust in 2013 and
beyond.


They argued that the existing pipeline of ETP projects would continue to support investment
in 2013−14 while private consumption would hold up, partly due to fiscal transfers in early­2013
and continued growth in disposable incomes. They project growth at 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent
in 2013, with potential growth boosted over the medium term to 5 percent to 5.5 percent by
higher private investment.



The authorities agreed that the inflation outlook was fairly benign. While it may increase slightly,
they expect inflation to remain modest in 2013 given subdued global commodity prices. They also
argued that the impact of the minimum wage or any further gradual fuel subsidy cuts on inflation
would likely be minor.



The authorities concurred that the principal risks to the outlook were external and skewed to the
downside. They remained concerned about developments in the euro zone, uncertainty about the
direction of U.S. fiscal policy, and the risk of a sharper slowdown in China. They did, however, point
to the upside potential of the growth outlook associated with continued implementation of
ETP­related investment projects and reforms.

The transmission of, and policy responses to, these external spillovers were assessed in detail in the 2011 Article IV
staff report.

THE NEAR-TERM: KEEPING THE ECONOMY ON AN
EVEN KEEL
A. Near-Term Macroeconomic Policy Stance
7.
Monetary policy. Monetary conditions remained accommodative in 2012. Having been one
of the first central banks in the region to start a tightening cycle after the 2008−09 global crisis,
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has now kept its policy rate at 3 percent since May 2011, resisting a
renewed trend among regional peers toward lowering rates (Figure 3). BNM characterizes its stance
as supportive of growth in an environment that combines robust domestic demand and narrowing
spare capacity with subdued inflation and well-anchored inflationary expectations.
8.
Fiscal policy. The FG’s fiscal turnout in 2012 has been better than expected. Additional
spending on fuel subsidies, wages, pensions, and transfers to target groups has been more than
offset by buoyant revenue and one­off factors (including an extraordinary dividend payment). As a
result, the FG deficit is estimated to decline to 4.5 percent of GDP this year, compared with
4.8 percent in 2011

GDP. On the other hand, the overall public sector deficit is projected to have risen to 5.1 percent of

9.
Staff position. In staff’s view, the macroeconomic policy mix in 2012−13 is well calibrated
for the current conjuncture.


Bank Negara Malaysia’s slightly accommodative monetary policy stance strikes the right balance
between supporting growth and keeping inflation in check, a view also supported by a simple
Taylor rule (Figure 3). While domestic demand is robust and spare capacity is narrowing,
inflation is subdued and inflationary expectations are well anchored—a testimony to BNM’s deft
monetary management. The 2013 fiscal stance is also appropriate, balancing concerns about
growing public debt with the need to avoid excessive or premature fiscal adjustment. While
the 2013 budget likely understates spending, it is also conservative in its revenue projections.
The deficit target seems feasible if, as assumed in the staff’s baseline, there are only minor
slippages in current spending and a modest fuel subsidy reform is adopted in the second half
of 2013.



Should downside risks to the growth outlook materialize, BNM has ample room to cut rates and
allow the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber. However, the FG’s relatively high debt level
affords limited space for a fiscal response in a downside scenario. Any fiscal stimulus should be
well targeted, temporary, and anchored in an ambitious medium term consolidation plan.



In response to commodity price shocks, the exchange rate should be allowed to adjust. If the
shock pushes prices up, monetary policy tightening ought to be considered only if second round
price effects risk unhinging inflation expectations. Any fiscal revenue windfalls from higher
commodity prices should be saved.

3

The macroeconomic impulse from NPFE capital spending is dampened by its high import content and the fact that
much of these investments (about one third in 2012) are estimated to take place outside Malaysia.

10.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment on near­term
macroeconomic policies. If downside risks were to materialize, the authorities agreed that they had
ample room to cut interest rates and that two­way exchange rate flexibility would help respond to
weak external demand. The authorities also argued that the 2013 budget reflected their
commitment to fiscal consolidation while providing for policies (including cash transfers to
low­income households) that would support domestic demand in a weak external environment.

12.
Policy response so far. Malaysia has successfully dealt with volatile capital flows in recent
years. Its sound banking system and liquid capital markets facilitate the absorption of flows, while a
stable core of domestic institutional investors and comfortable levels of official international
reserves provide additional buffers against any volatility in external demand for domestic securities.
But the policy response has also been appropriate: the authorities have coped with capital flows by
allowing two­way exchange rate adjustment while smoothing out excessive exchange rate volatility.
Macroprudential policies (MPPs) have been used selectively to tackle specific markets or risks, such
as credit to households, but not as a direct response to capital flows.
13.
Staff position. In case of large and sustained inflows, the exchange rate should be allowed
to appreciate gradually and fiscal policy could be tightened at a faster pace. MPPs could also be
adopted or tightened as needed to mitigate potential risks (paragraph 15), and could be
complemented by liquidity management measures, including higher reserve requirements. Staff
welcomes measures to liberalize outflows adopted by the authorities in recent years, such as the
elimination of the requirement on residents to convert export earnings into ringgit. Regional
initiatives under way, including regional crisis management and resolution frameworks, will bolster
regional communication and cooperation in case of an emerging crisis.
14.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that capital flows would likely be volatile in the
near term but felt the impact on the broader economy was manageable. While the share of
foreigners in the sovereign bond market had risen since the global financial crisis, risk­off cycles
over the last two years had not affected domestic credit provision. Moreover, domestic investors

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

stood ready to step in if foreign demand for sovereign bonds slackened. The authorities expressed
concern about the extended easy monetary policy in advanced economies and the challenges this was
creating for emerging economies. The authorities took note of the Fund’s view that capital flow
management measures should be part of the policy toolkit.

SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY
15.
Background. The 2012 IMF­World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and the
accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA), found that Malaysia’s financial system is
sound, well capitalized, and backed by a strong regulatory and supervisory framework.4 Malaysian banks
have high capital adequacy ratios and are expected to comfortably meet Basel III capital requirements
by 2019. FSAP stress tests indicate that the banking system has sufficient capital buffers to absorb credit
losses under tail­risk scenarios. However, the capital of some small banks could fall below the regulatory
minimum if a prolonged recession in Malaysia led to higher unemployment and lower housing prices. The
quality of bank assets has improved. Liquidity is adequate, and while the share of corporate “at call”
deposits is high, these appear to be stable. Banks’ exposure to currency risk is limited, as is their reliance
on interbank and cross­border funding (Figure 7). Malaysia is a global leader in Islamic finance. This
sector is playing a central role in promoting financial development through product diversification and
financial inclusion. And the Financial Sector Blueprint, launched in 2011, strikes the right balance between
tighter regulations in line with global trends and measures to foster further financial development.
16.


Staff position.5 In line with the FSSA, the following areas warrant attention:
Strong growth of credit to households and house price appreciation (Figure 8). Housing prices are
running ahead of household incomes and housing rents. Household debt is high, as is bank exposure
to households (55 percent of bank credit) (Figure 8).6 In response, the authorities have introduced a
number of MPPs and fiscal measures since 2010.7 These measures have succeeded in slowing down
household credit growth, particularly for unsecured loans, while preliminary data suggest housing
price appreciation may have decelerated. Some pressure points do remain, however: growth in credit
to households remains in double digits, the supply of low­cost housing is tight, and prices are still
rising strongly in some housing segments. The government is putting in place measures to increase
the supply of more affordable housing, and the real property gains tax rate was further

The FSSA’s main recommendations are listed in Appendix II.

5

See Appendix III for a summary of staff’s advice during previous Article IV consultations and the authorities’ response so
far.

6

About half of this (that is, 27 percent of total bank credit) is mortgage loans. Total bank exposure to real estate is over
40 percent if loans for nonresidential properties and construction are added.

7

These include limits on credit card debt; lower loan-to-value (LTV) caps on third and subsequent mortgages (LTV of
70 percent) and for corporate borrowers (LTV of 60 percent); higher capital risk weights (100 percent ) for mortgages with
LTVs over 90 percent; reintroduction of the real property gains tax; and increased minimum prices for house purchases by
foreigners.

raised on January 1, 2013. However, if household credit growth and housing prices remain high,
additional measures could be taken, including lower loan-to-value (LTV) caps, further increases
in capital gains taxes on properties, higher stamp duties on real estate transactions, and a
further tightening of regulations on unsecured personal loans. As noted by the FSSA, continued
efforts to capture granular data on household assets and liabilities by income segment would
strengthen monitoring of risks in this sector.


Malaysia’s extensive cross­border banking activities. Risks include foreign bank deleveraging and
exposure of the domestic financial system to developments abroad. On balance, these risks
appear manageable (Box 3). However, regional exposures should continue to be monitored
closely. Deepening cooperation between home and host country supervisors is also important.



Consolidated supervision of financial holding companies. There is scope to enhance the
framework for consolidated supervision of financial groups, including on capital and liquidity
standards. Passage in December 2012 of the Financial Services Act, the Islamic Financial Services
Act, and Amendments to the Central Banking Act 2009 is a welcome step in this direction.

17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with the FSAP assessment that the financial
system is sound and that the regulatory and supervisory framework is strong. They also agreed with
the findings from stress tests suggesting that the banking system has sufficient capital buffers even
under tail­risk scenarios, except for some small banks. They have been closely monitoring household
leverage and the housing market as well as lending practices of banking institutions. The increased
vigilance has resulted in the issuance of a number of macroprudential policies and supervisory
responses as well as fiscal measures. They said some of the measures already taken were working, as
demonstrated by the recent moderation in the growth of household credit, a substantial decline in
multiple housing loan accounts, and improvements in the repayment behavior of credit card
holders. The ramping up of the supply of low­cost housing, improvements in public transportation,
and the increase in the real property gains tax would help to further ease house price pressures. The
recently passed financial services legislations and amendments to the Central Banking Act 2009
strengthen BNM’s powers to extend regulations to nonbank lenders as well as bringing them under
the direct oversight of BNM where necessary. The authorities stand ready to take additional
measures as and when needed.

STRENGTHENING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND
EFFICIENCY
A. Fiscal Sustainability and Resilience
18.
Background. Malaysia’s fiscal space has shrunk considerably following the global financial
crisis. The FG debt­to­GDP ratio has increased by 12 percentage points since 2008, reflecting both
substantial discretionary fiscal stimulus and declining growth and oil prices in the aftermath of the
crisis. This debt ratio is elevated compared to countries with similar credit ratings. The structural
fiscal position has also deteriorated, as evidenced by the persistent decline in the non­oil primary
10

MALAYSIA

balance and the current balance. The significant increase in operating expenditures in recent years
may put at risk the FG’s golden rule of maintaining a positive current fiscal balance. A weak
structural fiscal position and a relatively high debt ratio reduce the ability to mount countercyclical
fiscal responses in the future.

19.
Outlook. In the absence of policy changes, Malaysia’s debt­to­GDP ratio would remain
above current levels into the longer term (Annex I, Debt Sustainability Analysis). The staff’s fiscal
baseline8 assumes some adjustment, consistent with the authorities’ target of reducing the FG deficit
to 3 percent of GDP by 2015. However, the FG deficit would start rising again thereafter, reflecting
declining oil revenue and rising pension and healthcare costs. These pressures are expected to
intensify in the long term. Moreover, while the debt ratio is projected to decline slowly under the
baseline, shocks to growth and interest rates could push it over the authorities’ 55 percent of GDP
debt ceiling (Box 4). Lower-than-expected growth, because of slower reforms or a protracted global
growth slowdown, could also push up the debt ratio.
20.
Staff position. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and
encourages them to underpin it with a comprehensive medium­term plan based on concrete
measures, targets and timelines to be announced and put in place as early as feasible. This fiscal
consolidation strategy should:


Take into account the potential decline in oil­ and gas­related receipts and the increase in
age­related government spending associated with demographic change in coming decades.



Be anchored, as suggested by staff analysis (Box 4), on the objective of gradually lowering FG
debt to around 40 percent of GDP by 2020—the debt ratio prevailing before the global financial
crisis. This target is also consistent with the authorities’ New Economic Model. Adhering to it

8

The baseline assumes: (i) fuel subsidy reform; (ii) introduction of the GST (to replace existing sales taxes) at a rate of
5 percent along with offsetting revenue measures, yielding net revenue gains of about 0.5 percent of GDP in the
medium term; and (iii) an increase in direct transfers to low­income households of ½ percent of GDP per year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MALAYSIA

would require strengthening the FG’s non­oil primary fiscal balance by 1.5 percentage points of
GDP on average relative to the baseline.


Include increases in non­oil and gas­related tax revenues, as well as a rationalization of subsidies
(see paragraphs 22−23).

21.
Refocusing budget targets. Anchoring budget targets on the non­oil primary balance
instead of the overall balance would help insulate government spending from volatile oil prices.
This, in turn, would render fiscal policy more counter­cyclical.

B. Structural Fiscal Reforms
22.
Broadening the revenue base. The FG’s revenue base is narrow and overly reliant on
volatile oil and gas receipts, which account for about a third of the total. The planned introduction
of the GST would help broaden the revenue base. In addition, the authorities should streamline fiscal
incentives for investment, with their budgetary costs made more transparent.
23.
Making government spending more cost­effective and equitable. Some components of
spending, especially fuel and food subsidies, are not well targeted. Staff welcomes the authorities’
plans to gradually rationalize fuel subsidies, which will help reduce spending pressures while
staggering the impact on inflation and real incomes. Subsidy reform should be accompanied by
targeted support measures for vulnerable groups. Spending on emoluments, which increased by
0.6 percent of GDP in 2012 (in part reflecting a public sector salary review), must also be contained.
Recent measures to reduce civil service growth and improve payroll management should help.
Parametric reforms to the civil service pension system (a defined benefit scheme with no employee
contributions) would also help contain long­term spending pressures.

C. Public Financial Management and Fiscal Risks
24.
Growing fiscal risks. The public sector deficit is rising, reflecting a large increase in NFPE
spending (Figure 5). Due to long reporting lags, the latter is difficult to monitor and control.
Contingent liabilities for the FG are also growing from the rise in government’s statutory guarantees
(which increased to 15 percent of GDP, partly reflecting borrowing by special purpose vehicles set
up to finance large public infrastructure projects), and from public-private partnerships (PPPs) more
generally. An IMF technical assistance mission will assess these risks and recommend mechanisms to
monitor and manage them.
25.
Strengthening public financial management. Staff welcomes the authorities’ planned shift
to accrual­based fiscal accounting and outcomes-based budgeting by 2015, and work underway to
formulate a medium­term fiscal framework. Fiscal transparency should also be improved by
expanding the coverage of the budget to include pension funds and all autonomous entities, and by
reporting on PPPs, new revenue and expenditure measures, and fiscal risks more generally.

D. Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities stressed their commitment to fiscal consolidation, tax reform and
expenditure rationalization. They reiterated the government’s commitment to implement the GST,
rationalize energy subsidies, and strengthen public financial management, including through a
medium­term budget framework. They also highlighted their intention to address long­term
spending pressures, including through reforms to the public pension scheme, to housing and
student loan programs, and to the civil service.

REFORMS TO BOOST GROWTH AND ENHANCE
INCLUSIVENESS
27.
Boosting growth. Malaysia’s record of economic development since independence has
been remarkable, but growth slowed after the
Asian financial crisis. Efforts are now underway to
turn Malaysia into a high­income country
by 2020. Thus, private investment has been
propelled in recent months by the catalytic effect
of large scale projects under the ETP. And
significant progress has been made in improving
the business climate: Malaysia’s ranking in the
World Bank’s 2013 Doing Business survey has
improved to 12th, from 14th in 2012. But
important challenges remain that still hinder
investment and growth:


A key bottleneck is the scarcity of skilled workers. Planned reforms to improve the education
system and enhance equality of educational opportunities are therefore welcome.



Also, redundancy costs are high (Malaysia is ranked 108th out of 144 countries in this area in the
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report).



At 46 percent, female labor force participation is low by regional standards. Staff thus welcomes
the authorities’ plans to boost this rate to 55 percent by 2015, including through incentives for
the establishment of childcare facilities and the employment and training of women after a
career break, and legal reforms to promote flexible work arrangements. 9

9

The World Bank estimates that raising Malaysia’s female labor participation by 11 percentage points to 57 percent
between 2000−2010 would have boosted growth by around 0.4 percentage points per year (Malaysia Economic
Monitor, October 2012).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALAYSIA



Fostering technological readiness (including better access to broadband internet) and greater
competition in product markets is also important.

28.
Minimum wage. A minimum wage has been introduced with effect from January 2013,
aimed at boosting wages of low­skilled workers and enhancing productivity. Preliminary analyses
suggest that it is likely to have a limited impact on inflation and unemployment (Box 1), and should
therefore help improve the incomes of the poor. The authorities could however consider whether
highly affected firms should be granted more time to adjust, and whether further allowance should
be made for regional wage dispersion. While the minimum wage should provide incentives for
affected firms to shift to more capital-intensive production technologies, a sustained increase in
productivity would require implementing the complementary reforms discussed in the
previous paragraph.
29.
Enhancing social protection mechanisms. The authorities could consider other measures
to strengthen inclusiveness, such as introducing an unemployment insurance scheme funded by
employers and employees; improving the targeting of cash transfer programs; and making them
conditional on access to education and health care. Such conditional cash transfer schemes have
proven effective in a number of countries. Stronger social safety nets should also help reduce
precautionary savings and narrow the current account.
30.
Pension reforms. Staff welcomes the recently introduced Private Retirement Scheme (PRS),
which will help supplement the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Consideration could be given to
increasing the risk­sharing characteristics of Malaysia’s existing pension system by: (i) introducing a
publicly funded, pillar­one pension scheme for low or noncontributors; and (ii) providing an option
for workers to receive their pensions in the form of annuities, to help reduce longevity risk. The
minimum age for pension withdrawals for existing EPF contributors should be gradually raised from
55 to 60 to match the increase in the retirement age in the private sector.
31.
Authorities’ views. The authorities stressed that they remained committed to increasing
potential growth and enhancing inclusiveness. The ETP was gaining traction in terms of boosting
investment. However, they view it as a marathon and not a sprint, with progress on structural reform
initiatives remaining essential. The authorities noted that there was broad support in the private
sector for the adoption of a minimum wage. While they expect limited impact on employment, they
would monitor implementation closely, and would consider modifications as and when needed. The
authorities said they would study the case for greater use of conditional cash transfers and had
tasked the International Labor Office with producing a report on how to design an appropriate
unemployment insurance scheme.

EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
32.
Staff position. The Malaysian economy is undergoing a significant external rebalancing,
reflecting surging domestic demand and weak external demand. As a result, the current account is
projected to decline to 6 percent of GDP in 2012−13, from 11 percent in 2011 and 17 percent
in 2008, while the non­oil current account has swung into deficit. Notwithstanding the significant
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

narrowing of the current account, staff assesses the external position to be stronger than is
consistent with medium­term fundamentals and desirable policies (Box 5). As explained in Box 5,
Malaysia’s strong external position mainly reflects structural factors, including insufficient social
safety nets, investment bottlenecks, and large exports of nonrenewable resources.10

33.
Outlook and policy implications. Over the medium term, the current account is expected
to continue moderating. This reflects the impact on national saving of population aging and of
reforms to strengthen social protection, which are expected to more than offset the effect of the
envisaged fiscal consolidation. The structural reforms discussed earlier in this report to boost
investment would further help narrow the current account. Reserve levels are adequate and no
further accumulation is therefore needed for precautionary purposes. In that regard, continued
exchange rate flexibility, with two­way intervention limited to dampening excessive volatility, should
allow for a gradual appreciation of the trend real exchange rate. This, in turn, will underpin the
continued external rebalancing and facilitate a gradual shift of resources from tradable to
nontradable sectors.
34.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred that the current account gap likely reflects
structural characteristics, and stressed that it is not rooted in currency undervaluation. They noted
that tackling it therefore calls for structural reforms rather than a shift in exchange rate policies. They
also agreed on the need to consider the role of gas and oil trade when assessing the current
account. The authorities questioned the capacity of EBA­based regressions to capture
country­specific factors, and strongly disagreed with the conclusion from those regressions that the
real exchange rate is undervalued. They also noted that typical symptoms of currency
undervaluation are notably absent. In particular, there is no evidence of overheating and inflation
has remained low (averaging just over 2 percent over the past decade); there are no financial

10

Net oil and gas exports amount to over 7 percent of GDP. A significant fraction of this hydrocarbon wealth is being
saved by PETRONAS, the state-owned oil company, in the form of capital spending outside Malaysia (averaging
around 1.5 percent of GDP per year in 2009-11) and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of financial assets. Saving an
important fraction of wealth generated from non-renewable resources is consistent with intergenerational equity and
efficiency considerations. Therefore, the presence of non-renewable resource wealth drives up optimal national
saving.

imbalances (such as excessive credit growth); and the trade balance has shrunk considerably in the
past three years.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Outlook and risks. The Malaysian economy performed strongly in 2012, and is undergoing
a significant external rebalancing. The near­term outlook is positive, with domestic demand
expected to continue propelling activity and inflation remaining benign. Downside risks, however,
remain substantial, and are predominantly external. A sharp intensification of the euro area crisis or
a further growth shock in China could impact Malaysia through lower export volumes, lower
commodity prices, and increased financial market volatility.
36.
Near-term policies. Malaysia’s strong economic record in recent years reflects skillful and
pragmatic economic management in the face of large external shocks. The current policy stance is
no exception, with macroeconomic policies appropriately calibrated to the outlook and risks.
Monetary policy is slightly accommodative, providing support for an economy with very low
inflation and still subject to substantial external headwinds. The moderately contractionary fiscal
stance provides a welcome step towards fiscal consolidation. In case downside risks materialize,
monetary policy has ample room for easing. There is, on the other hand, less room for a
countercyclical fiscal response given the relatively high level of FG public debt.
37.
Dealing with capital flows. Malaysia has been exposed to volatile capital flows, and this is
likely to continue in the near term. The policy response so far, characterized by two­way exchange
rate flexibility while smoothing excessive exchange rate fluctuations, has been successful. This policy
should continue going forward, and could be complemented with MPPs if needed to mitigate
potential risks.
38.
Safeguarding financial sector stability. The 2012 FSAP found that Malaysia’s financial
system is sound, and backed by a strong regulatory and supervisory framework. Relatively high
levels of household indebtedness and rising house prices could, however, pose some risks. Their
impact would likely be low unless accompanied by a protracted growth slowdown in Malaysia, and
policies so far seem to have helped cool off household credit growth and housing prices. Continued
close monitoring is nonetheless warranted, and additional MPPs and other measures should be
considered if needed.
39.
Strengthening fiscal sustainability. Bringing down FG public debt over the medium term is
a key policy priority of the authorities. Fiscal consolidation must be underpinned by a concrete plan,
anchored on a debt target. This plan should account for the potential long­term decline in
oil­related revenue and increases in age­related government spending, and be complemented by
reforms to: (i) broaden the revenue base away from volatile oil­ and gas­related receipts, including
through expeditious passage of the GST; and (ii) boost the efficiency and inclusiveness of
government spending, including through continued gradual reform of universal fuel subsidies,
accompanied by targeted support measures for vulnerable groups.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

40.
Addressing fiscal risks. Fiscal risks, arising from the rising public sector deficit and
government guarantees, have increased substantially in recent years. Staff supports the authorities’
efforts to monitor these risks more closely through sustained efforts to improve public financial
management and statistical reporting, supported by Fund technical assistance.
41.
Boosting growth. Realizing the authorities’ goal to turn Malaysia into a high­income nation
by 2020 will require the sustained implementation of the broad structural reforms already identified
by the authorities in their many initiatives. Particular priorities should be to improve education and
develop the skills needed for a high­tech, high value­added economy; to increase labor market
flexibility, including by reducing redundancy costs; and to raise female labor force participation.
42.
Enhancing social protection. The introduction of a minimum wage policy from
January 2013 should support the incomes of poorer workers, provided any negative impact on
employment is small. The authorities should remain flexible to adjust the policy as experience is
gained from its implementation. Introducing an unemployment insurance system, currently under
consideration, and a pillar­one (noncontributory) pension scheme, would further strengthen social
protection.
43.
External assessment. Malaysia’s external position is stronger than warranted by
medium­term fundamentals and desirable policies. In particular, despite having narrowed
significantly in recent years, the current account is still above the norm. This current account gap
likely reflects structural factors, such as inadequate social protection and investment bottlenecks, as
well as the role of hydrocarbon exports. Population aging, as well as policies to boost investment
and social protection, supported by continued two­way exchange rate flexibility, should help
moderate the current account over the medium term.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12­month cycle.

Box 1. Malaysia: Minimum Wage
In May 2012, Malaysia announced the adoption of a minimum wage (MW) policy, with effect from
January 2013. It follows significant recent increases in MWs across the region—in China, India, the
Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam—and the introduction by Hong Kong SAR of a MW policy in May 2011.
Justification. The Malaysian authorities gave three main reasons for adopting a MW: (i) ensuring basic
needs of employees are met; (ii) encouraging firms to move up the value chain by investing in better
technology and increasing labor productivity; and (iii) reducing dependence on unskilled foreign labor.
Key facets. The rate was set at RM 900 per month for Peninsular Malaysia; and RM 800 for Sabah, Sarawak,
and the Federal Territory of Labuan. It will cover all sectors and employees except domestic servants. The
main criteria used for calculating rates were poverty­line income and the median wage. While the median
wage is much lower in Sabah and Sarawak than Peninsular Malaysia, poverty­line income is much higher
(given higher costs of living). This is why the chosen rates do not differ much. The rate applies to the basic
wage, which can include some regular, fixed allowances but not variable allowances. Small firms (no more
than five workers), except those in professional services, will be allowed to defer it for up to 6 months.
Likely impact. The theoretical and empirical literature suggests that the impact of a MW depends on
multiple factors. A key factor is the ratio of the MW to the average wage: if the rate is set too low, the MW
does not bind; if too high, it will lead to significant employment losses. But other factors matter too, such as
the degree of competition in the labor market and the degree of enforcement. For Malaysia, the impact on
employment and inflation will likely be conditioned by the following:



Employment. The ratio of the chosen MW rates to mean wages is high, at around 50 percent for
Peninsular Malaysia and above 60 percent for Sabah (levels in most OECD countries cluster around
40 per cent), suggesting there may be a negative impact. An estimated ¼ of the formal workforce
currently have incomes below the set MW, and employers say that the MW will have an impact on the
whole pay structure, even for wages above the MW. Employers have also complained that the
adjustment period is too short, particularly for poorer states in Peninsular Malaysia and in Sabah and
Sarawak, where the MW will likely be more binding. Over the medium term, many firms are likely to
increase capital­labor ratios given the change in relative prices, potentially reducing employment growth
(including of foreign workers). But several factors will provide important offsets: (i) the authorities and
many analysts think that labor costs make up a small share of total business costs in many sectors, with
profit margins able to absorb the hit; (ii) employers were given some flexibility in terms of allowances to
be included in the MW rate; (iii) there is a sizable informal sector (the MW itself may lead to an increase
in informality); and (iv) the current environment of robust growth and low unemployment is favorable.



Inflation. The inflationary impact will likely be mitigated by the low share of labor costs in total
production costs. Moreover, wage growth has been slower than productivity growth in recent years,
suggesting there is some room for additional wage increases before unit labor costs rise materially. The
muted impact on inflation of substantial MW hikes in Thailand in 2012 provides some reassurance in this
regard.

Box 2. Malaysia: ASEAN Trade Integration: A Source of Resilience? 1/

How important is intraregional trade for Malaysia’s
near­term growth? A Bayesian­VAR analysis suggests that
intraregional demand is an important driver of Malaysian
growth, alongside global demand, global financial shocks,
and commodity price movements (Figure 2). Meanwhile,
shocks to China’s growth do not have a statistically
significant impact on Malaysia’s or ASEAN’s GDP growth,
once global demand is controlled for. This suggests that,
despite its increasing share in Malaysia’s and the region’s
trade, China serves mainly as a conduit in transmitting global
shocks through the supply chain network.

Foreign bank claims on Malaysia are relatively large but are
mainly held by long-established U.K. and Singaporean banks.
BIS˗reported foreign bank claims are over 50 percent of GDP,
significantly higher than for other countries in the region excluding
the financial centers (see chart). These claims comprise mainly the
local operations of the foreign banks in Malaysia (approximately
40 percent of GDP) which are predominantly funded in the form of
local currency deposits. The longest established banks are the
U.K. and Singapore ones, with total claims of around 35 percent of
GDP, and which have extensive local branch networks.

Malaysia

The problems at the heart of advanced economy banking systems
and the expansion of Malaysia’s banks abroad raise two important
issues: (i) the implications for Malaysia of foreign banks
deleveraging from Malaysia; and (ii) the exposure of the Malaysian
financial system to developments abroad.

Sources: Bank for International Settlements; CEIC Data Company Ltd.; Haver Analytics; and IMF staff
calculations.
1/ Claims are on an ultimate risk basis. The sum of quarterly GDP in U.S. dollars between 2011:Q3 and
2012:Q2 is used in the denominator.

The euro zone crisis may lead to some deleveraging but the impact appears manageable. The pullout of U.S. banks from
emerging markets following the Latin American debt crisis and the
deleveraging by Japanese banks in South East Asia after Japan’s
financial crisis in the 1990s are cautionary tales. However, the
U.K. banks with a systemic presence in Malaysia—HSBC and
Standard Chartered—are not strongly interconnected with the euro
zone: the bulk of their assets is outside of Europe, the U.K., and the
United States. Singaporean banks are also well capitalized and
appear able to withstand major shocks. Moreover, a high share of
foreign bank claims resides in local affiliates and is in local
currency. As a result, deleveraging by foreign banks has been small
over the past few years (see chart). And overall credit provision has
remained robust, as it did even during the global financial crisis
when foreign bank deleveraging was marked (see chart). However,
BNM should continue to monitor developments closely, especially
any rating downgrades of relevant U.K. banks.
Over the last decade, Malaysian banks have expanded abroad
significantly. The six biggest banking groups in Malaysia all have
an overseas presence (Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank, Hong Leong,
RHB Capital, and AmBank). Branches, subsidiaries, representative
offices, and associate companies have been established
in 20 countries. The largest affiliates are in ASEAN (Indonesia,
Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and Hong Kong SAR, where
exposures of the biggest three Malaysian banks are just below
30 percent of GDP. Over 30 percent of assets of the two largest
Malaysian banks are in overseas operations.
Relative to other jurisdictions, Malaysian banks’ expansion
overseas so far looks moderate but will require continued
careful monitoring. Austrian, U.K., and Spanish banks also have
significantly expanded overseas operations in recent times, but
have much higher exposures (ranging from 60−400 percent of
GDP). Looking ahead, Malaysian banks are likely to continue
expanding abroad in light of increasing ASEAN economic integration and the opportunity provided by European bank deleveraging.
International experience suggests that rapid bank expansion in new markets can pose challenges as bank risk management and
supervisory monitoring may fail to keep pace. Uneven supervisory quality in host markets can also contribute to the masking of
vulnerabilities. Thus, further deepening of home­host cooperation in supervision and crisis prevention—as outlined in the Malaysia’s
Financial Sector Blueprint—will be important going forward.

Box 4. Malaysia: Anchoring Fiscal Consolidation—A Stochastic
Debt Sustainability Analysis (SDSA)
Background. Malaysia’s debt­to­GDP ratio has increased by 12 percentage points since the global
financial crisis, reflecting both substantial discretionary fiscal stimulus and declining growth and oil prices.
The debt ratio is projected to reach 53 percent of GDP in 2012, just below the government’s self­imposed
ceiling of 55 percent. The authorities are committed to bringing debt down to ensure sustainability and
create sufficient space to conduct counter­cyclical fiscal policy. The consolidation path should be anchored
on a reasonable medium­term debt target and use the non­oil primary balance as an intermediate target.
However, any consolidation plan is subject to potential shocks and therefore to uncertainty. A possible
approach to estimating the debt target is thus to consider a path that ensures that debt remains below a
certain debt ceiling with sufficiently high probability. This is the essence of the SDSA exercise presented in
this box.
Methodology and assumptions. In this approach, two parameters must be chosen. The first is a debt
ceiling. This exercise uses the government’s debt ceiling of 55 percent, which is also close to those
adopted in other countries and recent estimates of debt thresholds for emerging markets.1/ The second
parameter is the probability of remaining below the ceiling, given historical uncertainty in key
macroeconomic variables such as real interest rates, economic growth, the real exchange rate and oil
prices. In line with standard statistical analysis, a probability of 90 percent is chosen. The distribution of
debt profiles reflects shocks to macroeconomic and fiscal variables around the baseline based on a small
quarterly VAR. The SDSA also reflects: (i) a gradual decline in oil­ and gas­related revenue in the medium
term; and (ii) an increase in pension and healthcare related spending.
Results. A consolidation path consistent with remaining below the given debt ceiling with about
90 percent probability would reduce debt to

consolidation plan (the baseline) is projected to
lower debt to about 48 percent of GDP by 2017.
However, under this scenario macroeconomic and commodity price shocks could lead to breaching the
ceiling with a relatively high probability. The figures also show, as benchmark, a no­reform (passive)
scenario, which would most likely keep debt on an upward path and breach the ceiling.

GDP by 2017. This highlights the importance of
employing mechanisms to hedge against the volatility in oil­related revenue.

Longer­term challenges. In the long term, oil revenues are expected to continue to decline and
aging­related costs to rise further. These pressures will require sizable additional measures beyond 2020.

Box 5. Malaysia: External Sector Assessment
Current account (CA). Although there is a significant ongoing moderation in the CA, econometric analysis based on
the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Assessments (CGER) and the pilot External Balance Assessment
(EBA) methodologies suggests that the cyclically­adjusted CA is still stronger (by between 4½ to 6½ percentage points
of GDP) than the level consistent with medium­term fundamentals and desirable policies (the CA “norm”). However,
Malaysia’s CA has been erratic and the models contain large residuals, which account for most of the difference
between the actual CA and the fitted CA norm (the CA “gap”). In the staff’s view, Malaysia’s CA surplus predominantly
reflects structural factors that are not fully captured in the econometric models; in particular:



Insufficient social safety nets (which are not fully captured by health spending) as well as large exports of
nonrenewable resources (net oil and gas exports are 7 percent of GDP), both of which drive up the actual and
optimal rates of saving.



Bottlenecks to investment, resulting in relatively low private investment rates (despite the recent increase).

Taking these factors and the uncertainty surrounding model estimates into consideration, staff assesses the CA gap to
be of the order of 2−5 percentage points of GDP.
Real effective exchange rate (REER). After a strong appreciation between September 2009 and April 2010, the REER
has fluctuated around a fairly horizontal trend. CGER and EBA­based estimates suggest that the REER is undervalued
relative to the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. However, as noted above, these methodologies
do not fully capture Malaysia’s structural characteristics.
Capital account. Malaysia, like other emerging markets, has experienced volatile portfolio flows over the past few
years. Overall net capital flows, however, have typically been negative in Malaysia, driven by net foreign direct
investment (FDI) and nonportfolio investment outflows. In 2012, the capital account is projected to have returned to a
net negative balance. The authorities have continued to liberalize restrictions on foreign exchange administration,
including via greater flexibility for companies to undertake FDI abroad and obtain loans from related resident and
nonresident companies.
Reserves. Foreign exchange intervention by BNM seeks to limit excess exchange rate volatility and is two sided. In line
with this, official reserves have fluctuated around a relatively flat trend over the past two years. They stand at about
131 percent of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric (the benchmark range is 100−150 percent), and cover
about 247 percent of short­term external debt and 31 percent of broad money. Thus, current reserve levels are
adequate.
Net foreign assets. The net international investment position remains small and positive, at about 4 percent of GDP.
Gross liabilities (118 percent of GDP) consist primarily of FDI and portfolio equity. External debt is relatively low at less
than 30 percent of GDP, and only about 40 percent of this is short term, by original maturity. The overall net foreign
asset position is thus not a source of risk.
Overall assessment. In sum, the external sector position appears stronger than that consistent with estimates of
medium­term fundamentals and desirable policies.

The real economy would be adversely
affected through weaker bank balance
sheets and slower credit, as well as
negative wealth and confidence effects.



Medium to High
Malaysia’s overall export exposure (both
direct and indirect) to the EU is around 1.
But the overall growth impact would be
dampened by the current strength of
domestic demand in Malaysia and the
ASEAN region (Box 2).
Foreign investor holdings account for
about one fifth of the domestic
bond/equity market.
European banks’ claims on Malaysia are
about one quarter of GDP, but U.K. banks
account for about 80 percent of the total
claims, and most of the claims are funded
through domestic deposits.
High
China is Malaysia’s largest trading partner,
with an export share of 13 percent. Staff
analysis in the 2012 Spillover Report finds
that a 1 percentage point investment
slowdown in China would reduce
Malaysia’s growth by 0.6 percentage
points.
The impact would be compounded by
spillover effects in other Asian countries
strongly integrated with both China and
Malaysia, particularly ASEAN countries.
High
Prolonged weakness in external demand
would likely break the resilience of
domestic demand (Box 2), leading to low
growth, rising unemployment and falling
house and asset prices. This in turn would
weaken bank, corporate and sovereign
balance sheets, in a negative feedback
loop.
Low to Medium
The federal government’s explicit loan
guarantees are 15 percent of GDP, and
there are other significant contingent
liabilities arising from government-linked
companies and other entities.
A sudden increase in fiscal debt would
affect investment and may force a
stronger pace of fiscal adjustment.
However, Malaysia has monetary policy
room to counter the shock.
Low
High share of foreign holdings of
sovereign and BNM securities (33 percent)
makes these markets vulnerable to risk­off
cycles, but there is pent­up domestic
demand from a stable core of domestic
institutional investors.
Domestic credit is resilient to deleveraging
by foreign banks given high share of
domestic deposit funding.
Previous isolated capital outflow episodes
have had little visible impact on credit or
the real economy.
Low
Household debt is high at 74 percent of
GDP. One half of this is mortgages.
However, a stand­alone house price bust
is unlikely to significantly affect credit
quality unless accompanied by a
protracted growth slowdown that affects
employment and income. The authorities
are monitoring the risk and have adopted
measures to cool the housing market.








There is ample space for monetary easing.
The exchange rate should be allowed to
act as a shock absorber, intervening only
to smooth excessive volatility.
There is scope to provide liquidity support
(in domestic and foreign currency) to
maintain financial stability.
There is only limited room for
countercyclical fiscal support given the
relatively high fiscal deficit and debt levels.
Any temporary fiscal expansion should be
well targeted and anchored in a credible
medium­term consolidation plan.

Similar to above:
 A monetary easing should be the first line
of defense.
 There is also scope to let the exchange
rate absorb the shock, using reserves to
smooth excessive volatility.
 However, only limited room exists for
countercyclical fiscal support.



The ability of policy to provide a
long­lived cushion against a protracted
slump is limited; excessive stimulus could
lead to macro and financial instability.
Policymakers would need to adjust to
slower medium-term growth.

A preventive approach would be critical:
 Adopt a sufficiently ambitious fiscal
consolidation path to increase room to
absorb contingencies.
 Introduce mechanisms to monitor and
control fiscal risks, including from the
granting of government guarantees.
If the risk materializes, monetary policy could
be eased that the extent this is consistent with
the growth-inflation trade­off.








Let the exchange rate depreciate; use
reserves to prevent overshooting.
Provide foreign currency liquidity to
maintain market stability if needed.

Ease monetary policy, resolve insolvent
banks, and provide liquidity support for
viable banks.
A preemptive approach would combine
further targeted macroprudential policies
and continued sound bank lending and
risk management practices.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report (which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of staff). The relative
likelihood of risks reflects the staff’s subjective assessment (at the time of discussions with the authorities) of the risks surrounding this baseline.

Consultations
Staff Advice

Policy Actions
Fiscal

Bring down debt to sustainable levels (e.g., pre­2008 levels
by 2020) and articulate credible revenue and spending
measures to achieve that target (2010 and 2011).

The authorities agree on the need for fiscal consolidation and are
targeting a fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2015. The target of
reducing federal government debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2020 is also
in their plans. They are in the process of developing a medium term
budget framework with the help of the World Bank.

Issue a statement of fiscal risks (2010 and 2011).

The authorities requested Fund technical assistance on fiscal risks. A
mission was fielded in January 2013.

Broaden tax bases by implementing a GST and rationalizing
tax incentives (2010 and 2011).

The authorities agree on the need for a GST and are planning to
introduce it as soon as feasible.

Phase out subsidies and replace with targeted cash transfers
to the needy (2010 and 2011).

The authorities fully agree with this goal. They have already reduced
some fuel and food subsidies, and plan to further rationalize subsidies
going forward. They have increased the use of cash transfers in recent
budgets and are studying how to further condition these transfers.

Anchor budget decisions on the non­oil balance (2010).

The authorities monitor the non­oil balance but anchor budget decisions
on the overall federal government deficit.

Financial
Broaden the regulatory perimeter to include financial holding
companies (2010).

The new Financial Services Act (passed in December 2012) gives BNM the
powers to regulate and supervise financial holding companies.

Continue to monitor the increase in household debt (2011).

The authorities have taken a variety of macroprudential measures to deal
with rising household indebtedness (LTV cap on third and subsequent
mortgages, 100 percent risk weights on mortgages with LTV above
90 percent, and stricter limits on credit card debt). They have also issued
guidelines on responsible lending practices.

Structural
Boost growth and productivity through steady
implementation of structural reforms, including reforms to
government­linked companies; liberalization of labor and
product markets; and enhanced education and training.

The New Economic Model (NEM) takes on many recommendations from
previous Article IV reports. Via the Economic Transformation Program
and the Government Transformation Program, the authorities have
started implementing some of the recommendations of the NEM. Some
progress has been made on the strategic reform initiatives (e.g. setting
up a competition commission, and further divestment of GLCs). The
authorities' further plans to boost growth are discussed in this staff
report.

Consider introducing a carefully­designed minimum
wage (2011).

The authorities enacted a minimum wage in 2012 and it came into effect
in January 2013.

Consider implementing an unemployment insurance
scheme (2011).

The ILO has been tasked with drafting a paper on the appropriate design
of an unemployment insurance scheme for Malaysia.

Develop defined contribution private pension plans and
increase the age of withdrawal from EPF accounts
from 55 (2011).

A private retirement scheme (defined contribution) has been introduced.
The retirement age for private workers has been increased to 60 from 55,
although workers can still withdraw savings from the EPF at 55.

MALAYSIA—MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
1.

Malaysia’s external debt is expected to remain on a steady downward trend over the

medium term, falling to 23 percent of GDP by 2017. The 6 percentage point decline in the
external debt to GDP ratio from 2011 to 2017 mostly reflects sustained current account surpluses
and some shift towards domestic debt. Stress tests indicate that external debt would remain
manageable under a variety of shocks, including weaker GDP growth, a lower current account
balance, and a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the ringgit. Under these scenarios, the external
debt to GDP ratio rises above the baseline over the projection period by only modest margins. In the
case of the exchange rate depreciation scenario, the debt ratio would rise sharply to 41 percent of
GDP in 2012, but would subsequently fall to 35 percent of GDP by 2017.
2.

The gross debt to GDP ratio for the general government is expected to decrease

modestly over the medium term. Under the baseline scenario, debt is expected to decline
gradually relative to GDP over the next five years, reaching about 51 percent of GDP by 2017. Bound
tests indicate that the debt path is highly vulnerable to growth and interest rate shocks. Indeed, as a
result of plausible shocks the federal government’s self-imposed debt ceiling of 55 percent of GDP
would be breached. For instance, a decline in real GDP growth of about 1.2 percentage point relative
to the baseline would increase the debt to GDP ratio to about 58 percent in 2017. Stronger and
more front-loaded consolidation efforts can help reduce the probability of breaching the debt
ceiling and ensure that the government’s goal of reducing debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2020 can
be achieved. This consolidation effort would require clearly articulated revenue and expenditure
measures, including a phased reduction of subsidies, a broadening of the tax base, and more
targeted and efficient social spending.

VII. Exchange Arrangement:
On July 21, 2005, Bank Negara Malaysia announced the adoption of a managed float with the
exchange rate of the ringgit to be monitored against an undisclosed trade˗weighted basket of
currencies. Based on information on the exchange rate behavior, the de facto exchange rate regime
is classified as “other managed”.
Malaysia maintains bilateral payments arrangements with 23 countries. The authorities have
indicated that these arrangements do not have restrictive features.
Capital control measures imposed in early 1994 and in 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis have
mostly been lifted, except for the internationalization of the ringgit. In particular, since May 2001,
nonresident portfolio investors are freely allowed to repatriate their principal sums and profits out of
the country at any time. Malaysia further liberalized exchange control regulations during 2002−10.
The main measures were a relaxation of regulations on investment abroad by domestic institutions,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

an easing of regulations on domestic credit facilities extended to nonresidents, abolition of
overnight limits on all foreign currency accounts maintained by residents and of the net open
position limit imposed on licensed onshore banks, allowing residents to open and maintain foreign
currency accounts for any purpose, easing requirements on foreign currency and ringgit credit
facilities from nonresidents, relaxation of rules on the provision of financial guarantees, abolition of
several reporting requirements, and a relaxation of the conditions on residents and nonresidents to
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge capital account transactions with licensed
onshore banks. Further measures were also taken to ease rules on residents’ borrowing in foreign
currency, and borrowing in ringgit by residents from nonresidents as well as lending in ringgit by
residents to nonresidents for use in Malaysia.
The Malaysian authorities view remaining exchange control regulations as prudential in nature and
necessary to ensure the availability of adequate information on the settlement of payments and
receipts as part of the monitoring mechanism on capital flows. These controls do not contravene
Malaysia’s obligations under Article VIII.
Malaysia, in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions, maintains restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions with respect to some designated individuals and
entities. These measures are maintained for the reasons of national and international security and
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to the IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Malaysia also restricts current international transactions between Malaysian residents and Israeli
companies and individuals; however, since these restrictions affect the underlying transactions
themselves, they are not subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(b).

VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Malaysia is on the standard 12˗month consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2011 Article IV
consultation took place during October 27-November 9, 2011 (IMF Country Report No. 12/43). Staff
discussions for the 2012 Article IV consultation were conducted on a mission to Kuala Lumpur
during November 29-December 12, 2012. In addition, a staff visit took place during
July 11−13, 2012.

IX. FSAP Participation:
Malaysia conducted its first FSAP in 2012.

X. Technical Assistance:
FAD: Mission in October 2008 to analyze the distributional impact of social safety net programs. A
fiscal ROSC mission was fielded in May˗June 2011. A mission on debt management was fielded in
June 2012 to look at the institutional, legal, organizational and operational aspects of debt
management, monitoring of fiscal risks, and reporting of debt operations. A mission on fiscal risks
took place in January 2013.

MALAYSIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 10, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts to improve statistics
for the consolidated general government and public sector are necessary.
National accounts: Currently, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) compiles and publishes
annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure at current and constant prices, and
annual estimates for gross disposable income, saving, and net lending for the economy based on
the 1993 SNA. The quarterly data are released about two months after the reference quarter.
Price statistics: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. A revised CPI was
introduced in January 2011; it covers all 14 states and features a more disaggregated measure of the
consumption basket and updated expenditure weights based on a 2009/10 comprehensive household
income and expenditure survey.
Government finance statistics: There is a need to improve the timeliness, detail, and availability of data
on NFPEs and the state and local governments. Dissemination of more detailed data on nonlisted NFPEs’
assets and liabilities and domestic and foreign financing by type of debt instrument and holder would be
desirable; efforts in this direction will require continued close collaboration among the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU), the Treasury, and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). There is also a need to disseminate more
information on public private partnerships.
Monetary statistics: The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are reported on a timely and regular basis
and are broadly in conformity with the Fund’s data needs. There is a need to improve the institutional
coverage of the financial corporations, sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification and
valuation of financial instruments to ensure full adherence to the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. In addition, due to the growing importance of insurance corporations, pension funds, and other
financial intermediaries in Malaysia, coverage of MFS should be expanded to include these institutions. The
MFS missions of January 2004 and 2005 developed an integrated monetary database to be used for
publication and operational needs of the BNM, STA, and APD. The Bank Negara Malaysia reports data in
STA’s standardized report forms (SRFs) which provide more detailed classification of certain items, fuller
sectoral and instrument breakdown, and currency aggregation. MFS based on the SRFs are published in
the quarterly IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments: Department of Statistics Malaysia compiles and publishes quarterly balance of
payments estimates in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and the SDDS.
The quarterly data are released three months after the reference quarter. No data are shown for the capital
transfers or acquisition/sale of nonproduced nonfinancial assets, and transactions in reserve assets are
computed as differences in amounts outstanding and thus include valuation changes. The international
investment position data on other investment—assets and liabilities—are reported only in an aggregate
form.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Malaysia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). It is using a timeliness flexibility
option for general government operations (within six quarter lags after the end of reference year).

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Malaysia
On February 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Malaysia. 1
Background
Malaysia’s economy continues to perform well. Robust domestic demand has offset external
weakness and fueled growth, estimated at 5.1 percent in 2012. Key drivers of the expansion
have been private and public investments, particularly in oil, gas, and infrastructure, including
large projects under the government’s Economic Transformation Program. Consumption growth
has also been strong, supported by a strong labor market and by government transfers to
households. Net exports, on the other hand, have been a drag on growth, reflecting weak
external demand. Inflation has continued to ease, on lower commodity prices and base effects.
Average consumer price inflation eased to 1.7 percent in 2012, the lowest in three years and
one of the lowest in the Asia­Pacific region.
With inflation subdued, Bank Negara Malaysia has kept its policy interest rate at 3 percent since
May 2011, and market interest rates have remained also low and stable. Malaysia has
experienced significant and volatile portfolio flows in recent years, reflecting unsettled global
financial conditions. However, Malaysia’s sound financial system, liquid capital markets, and
two­way exchange rate flexibility have facilitated the absorption of flows. Credit growth has
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

continued to be robust. While credit to households has moderated somewhat, unsecured
personal loans have continued to grow rapidly, and household debt remains high. Housing
prices have also continued to climb.
The federal government’s deficit is estimated to have declined to about 4.5 percent of GDP
in 2012, from 4.8 percent in 2011. Spending in 2012 exceeded original budget projections by
about 2 percent of GDP, particularly in wages, pensions, fuel subsidies, and transfers. This,
however, was offset by buoyant revenue, reflecting strong economic growth and one­off factors.
The federal government’s debt is estimated to have risen to about 53 percent at end­2012, from
about 52 percent in 2011.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their skillful policies, which have
underpinned Malaysia’s strong macroeconomic performance despite a weak external
environment. Directors noted that the external rebalancing of Malaysia’s economy has gained
momentum, and that domestic demand is increasingly driving economic growth. Looking ahead,
Directors considered that Malaysia’s medium term prospects are favorable, as the authorities
continue to focus on safeguarding financial stability, strengthening fiscal sustainability, and
securing high and inclusive growth.
Directors endorsed the current settings for monetary policy and the mildly contractionary fiscal
stance in the 2013 budget. They nonetheless encouraged the authorities to further develop their
medium­term plans to restore a prudent level of federal government debt and rebuild fiscal
space. Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation would need to be supported by structural
fiscal reforms and a move away from oil­ and gas­related revenues. Accordingly, they
welcomed the authorities’ plans to introduce a goods and services tax, and to gradually replace
universal fuel subsidies with targeted support for the most vulnerable. Directors took note of the
authorities’ efforts to reform public financial management, and encouraged them to adopt the
recommendations of the recent Fund technical assistance on fiscal risks.
Directors noted with satisfaction that the 2012 Financial Sector Assessment Program review
found Malaysia’s financial sector to be robust, highly capitalized, and underpinned by a sound
supervisory and regulatory framework. They welcomed the recent passage of legislation to
further strengthen financial supervision. Directors also commended the use of targeted
macroprudential policies to curb risks associated with rising household debt and housing prices,
and the authorities’ readiness to take additional action as needed.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement wide ranging reforms to boost growth
and inclusiveness. In this context, they underscored the importance of increasing labor market
flexibility, raising female participation, and fostering the skills needed for a high value­added

3
economy. Directors welcomed the introduction of a minimum wage, and considered that
adopting unemployment insurance and pension system reforms would further strengthen social
protection.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that, despite the significant narrowing of the
current account, Malaysia’s external position appears stronger than warranted by fundamentals
and desirable policies. However, they agreed with the authorities that this mainly reflects
structural factors. A few Directors also pointed to underlying methodological limitations in the
assessment of the external position. Directors considered that the authorities’ policy of
maintaining two­way exchange rate flexibility remains appropriate, and that a flexible exchange
rate and ongoing structural reforms would facilitate the economy’s continued rebalancing.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour, Alternate Executive Director for Malaysia
and Zainal Abidin, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 11, 2013
1.
On behalf of our Malaysian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF team for the
focused and constructive discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in
Malaysia. For the most part, there is broad agreement on almost all of the major policy thrusts.
We are encouraged by the assessment that the current policy stance is appropriately calibrated to
the outlook and risks facing the economy and the financial system. We are further encouraged by
the FSAP assessment that the Malaysian financial system is sound, well capitalized and backed
by a strong regulatory and supervisory framework. This statement will provide an update on
recent developments and elaborate on selected issues mainly for emphasis and clarifications.
Economic Outlook for 2013
2.
In September 2012, the authorities projected the Malaysian economy to grow between
4.5% and 5.5% in 2013, underpinned by continued strong domestic demand, particularly firm
private sector activity. Staff’s estimates are in line with this assessment. Private consumption is
expected to expand, driven by higher disposable incomes and favourable labour market
conditions. Meanwhile, private investment will be supported by capital spending in the
domestic-oriented sectors, the oil and gas industry and the on-going implementation of
infrastructure projects. External demand is also expected to gradually improve and provide
additional support to the economy.
Monetary Policy
3.
Our authorities welcome Staff’s assessment that monetary policy strikes the right balance
between supporting growth and containing inflation. Going forward, BNM will continue to
carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the
overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.
Fiscal Policy
4.
The conduct of fiscal policy in 2013 will continue to be aimed at bringing about structural
changes in the economy to support inclusive and balanced regional growth while ensuring sound
public finances. Supported by stable revenue collection, the fiscal deficit is projected to be lower
at 4% of GDP in 2013 with Federal Government debt to GDP ratio contained within 55%.
5.
Fiscal reforms are also underway to strengthen public financial management. This includes
consolidating the fiscal deficit to 3% by 2015, broadening the tax base, rationalizing subsidies
and revisiting the medium term fiscal framework. Outcome-based budgeting and accrual
accounting are expected to be operational in 2015. Comprehensive approaches are also being
considered to better manage the Government’s long-term fiscal obligations. Areas being looked
at include Federal Government debt management strategies; pension liabilities; administration of
housing loan fund for civil servants and higher education student’s loan fund. Concerted efforts

2
will continue to be made to ensure the timely implementation of development plans and reform
initiatives.
Financial Sector
6.
Financial stability has been preserved, supported by strong financial buffers both at the
system and institutional level. In line with the FSAP assessment, the capacity of the domestic
financial sector to withstand potential economic and financial shocks continues to be well
supported by strong capitalization. The banking sector is also well positioned to smoothly
transition to Basel III. Risk to domestic financial stability arising from household indebtedness in
Malaysia remains manageable. The FSAP team expects low to medium impact on financial
stability arising from any potential higher unemployment, slowdown in economic growth or
decline in property prices. This is based on:


Sustained growth in income levels and conducive employment conditions;



Sound aggregate household balance sheet position and financial buffers, with financial
assets-to-debts ratio of more than two times, sustained high savings rate and growth of
deposits (2012: 11.3% yoy);



Strengthened risk management infrastructure (comprehensive credit information via the
Central Credit Reference Information System, use of credit scoring in loan approvals,
robust administration and monitoring of loans) and sustained underwriting practices of
banks;



Majority of borrowings are for wealth accumulation purposes, while unsecured financing
only accounted for 20% of household debts or 8% of bank loans; and



Positive trend in loan repayments and low levels of delinquencies.

7.

Developments on the following areas continue to be under BNM’s close surveillance:



Borrowers earning less than USD1,000 a month – these individuals have higher leverage
positions than other classes of borrowers, although loans to this group only comprised
12.7% of bank loans, with potential loss of RM2.3 billion or 1.3% of the capital base of
banking institutions; and



Lending activities of non-bank entities (e.g. building society and cooperatives) to
households, particularly in the personal financing segment.

8.
The Government and BNM have undertaken comprehensive measures (monetary,
macroprudential, supervisory, fiscal, financial education and debt resolution) to manage the
rising trend of household indebtedness, house prices and the higher cost of living in urban
centres. These measures have shown some positive outcomes, as evidenced by the substantial
decline in multiple housing loan accounts and improvements in the repayment behavior of credit
card holders. The effectiveness of these measures continues to be assessed by the authorities.
Moving forward, BNM is establishing a database to match borrowers’ debts and income data for
more granular analyses, in collaboration with several Government agencies.

3
9.
BNM’s assessment revealed that risks from foreign bank deleveraging and the regional
presence of Malaysian banks remain manageable, in line with the FSSA.


While claims of foreign banks on Malaysia are relatively large, 80% of such claims
comprise the Malaysian operations of locally-incorporated foreign banks;



Overall domestic credit growth and financial intermediation were sustained even when
foreign claims on Malaysia fell during the global financial crisis; and



The financial positions of major overseas establishments of Malaysian banks are strong,
supported by strong capitalization, profitability and local currency funding.

10. As part of BNM’s consolidated supervision of financial institutions, potential risks from
overseas operations are assessed regularly. This is supported by ongoing exchange of
information and supervisory assessments and actions through existing home-host supervisory
arrangements (e.g. Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam and
China; and supervisory colleges for three domestic banking groups). BNM also leverages on
multilateral platforms e.g. Executives’ Meeting of East Asia Pacific (EMEAP) Central Banks to
discuss and cooperate on international regulatory and supervisory issues, as well as crisis
management and resolution.
11. The FSAP assessment recognises that the regulatory and supervisory regimes for banking,
insurance, securities and financial market infrastructures in Malaysia are well developed and
exhibit a high degree of compliance with international standards. Similarly, Malaysia’s deposit
insurance framework and AML/CFT regime conform to international best practices. BNM
wishes to highlight that remaining legislative shortcomings in the banking and insurance
supervision frameworks, such as those relating to consolidated supervision, are eliminated with
the coming into force (in 2Q 2013) of the Financial Services Bill and Islamic Financial Services
Bill – both legislations were passed by the Parliament on 19 December 2012.
12. While the FSAP assessment opined that the Government has significant equity ownership
in the main Malaysian financial and banking groups via Government Linked Investment
Companies, the FSAP team recognised that these entities are operationally independent and
commercially run with no interference from the Government. The authorities wish to highlight
that these financial institutions are held to the same high standards of governance and risk
management as other financial institutions. The board members and senior management are also
subject to similarly stringent and robust fit and proper criteria and due diligence in the
appointment and reappointment processes.
13. FSAP stress tests indicate that the banking system is resilient to economic and market
shocks. Although some smaller banks could be more affected under adverse conditions, this is
due to the capital management strategy of the group which allocates relatively smaller capital at
the subsidiary level with the commitment that the capital needs will be met when needed. The
parents of these banks have strong capacity and capital positions. The FSAP team indicated that
recapitalization needs of banks under the adverse macroeconomic scenario (S2) of the

4
Top-Down stress test are limited at RM2 billion (0.2% of nominal GDP in 2011) under the
existing Basel II requirements. While the recapitalization needs are higher based on Basel III
standards, these capital requirements are only taking effect in 2019, in line with the global
implementation timeline.
14. The FSAP assessment opined that the building blocks for a comprehensive crisis
management framework are in place, including deposit insurance, emergency liquidity assistance
arrangements and powers to resolve financial institutions. The Financial Stability Executive
Committee (FSEC), set up in 2010, enables BNM to address risks to financial stability arising
from entities outside its regulatory sphere. In December 2012, the Minister of Finance has
approved the appointment of the Executive Chairman of the Securities Commission Malaysia as
an ex-officio (permanent and voting) member of the FSEC – hence enhancing the role of FSEC
as a platform for coordinating domestic crisis management and resolution measures.
15. The FSAP team recognised that the prudential and systemic risks spillovers on the onshore
financial system may be modest, although reputational risk remains, due to the current size of the
Labuan International Business and Financial Centre. The authorities have initiated a number of
steps to address these areas, including legislative and regulatory reforms in 2010. The FSAP
team recommended for further enhancements to the legislative, regulatory and supervisory
frameworks for the Labuan International Business and Financial Centre and recognized the steps
that are already being taken towards this end. These include the formation of the Financial
Stability Committee in 2012 with representatives from BNM and Securities Commission
Malaysia, to strengthen the risk management and surveillance practices.
16. The FSAP team recognised that the authorities are addressing potential challenges relating
to the growth of profit sharing Islamic finance products, such as market perception of the level of
protection for depositors and investors, and other regulatory, supervisory and market conduct
issues. While the FSAP team highlighted that tax incentives granted to Islamic finance are
significant, the authorities wish to highlight that these are commonly used in other jurisdictions
to compensate for extra issuance costs associated with Islamic products. In some other cases,
these incentives are finite and time-bound and are accorded to specific contracts to promote new
markets.
Reforms to Boost Growth and Enhance Inclusiveness
17. Initiatives to transform Malaysia into a high-income economy by 2020 are progressing
well. The second phase of the Government Transformation Programme was launched in
mid-2012, building on initiatives that have already been put in place as well as the introduction
of new initiatives. Under the Economic Transformation Programme, total committed investments
have amounted to USD71 billion, with most of these going into the oil, gas and energy sector.
18. To achieve a more inclusive financial sector, BNM had also introduced a framework for
agent banking which will allow financial institutions to reach out to the underserved segments, in
a more cost efficient manner through the use of non-bank retail outlets whilst still maintaining
prudent and responsible banking practices.

5
External Sector Assessment
19. Our authorities would like to reiterate that the current account gap is not rooted in currency
undervaluation. This is evidenced by the notable absence of symptoms of undervaluation; there
is no evidence of overheating, inflation has been low, there are no financial imbalances, trade
balances are shrinking and intervention has been two-directional. Besides the absence of these
symptoms, it is also important to note that notwithstanding the depreciation pressure during the
global financial crisis, the ringgit has generally been on an appreciating trend since the adoption
of the managed float regime in July 2005. In fact, the ringgit has appreciated by 22.6% against
the U.S. dollar and 7.5% on a real effective basis.
20. The authorities agree that estimates of the current account gap likely reflect structural
factors of the economy, which are not present in the econometric analysis of the current account.
It is important to note that the bulk of the high savings in Malaysia is accounted for by the
business sector. Household savings are mainly in the forms of mandatory contribution to the
Employees’ Provident Fund and other forms of private savings and financial assets to address the
partial availability of social safety nets in Malaysia. Meanwhile, private investment has been on a
strong trajectory since 4Q 2011 and into 2012. This development has been facilitated by various
structural reforms to improve the domestic investment climate.
21. Indeed, our authorities have asserted through our Chair that the EBA and ESR should not
only be quantitative exercises, which are highly sensitive to the choice of models and
assumptions, but should aim to establish country-specific explanations behind the changes in the
country’s current account, REER, and external balance in general. In this instance, we are
encouraged to note that the technical discussion between Staff and the authorities on EBA
methodology recognised the limitations of the methodology and encompassed discussions on
structural characteristics of the economy and the structural reforms needed to address the desired
outcome.
Final Remarks
22. While Malaysia continues to implement its long-term reform agenda to elevate it to the
next stage of growth and development, the authorities remain mindful of the downside risks
posed by the current challenging global economic and financial environment. As a highly open
economy, Malaysia is not insulated from the uncertainty in the global environment.
Nevertheless, the economy is expected to remain resilient, underpinned by favourable
macroeconomic and financial fundamentals and policy flexibility. The authorities will closely
monitor developments in the external environment and will respond as appropriate.
