•

The Article IV discussions were held September 3–14, 2004. The mission—
Mr. Ford (head), Ms. Banerji, Mr. Gagales (all EUR), and Mr. Bouscharain
(MFD)—held discussions with the Bank of Greece; the Ministry of Economy
and Finance; the economic adviser to the Prime Minister; and other government
officials. The mission also met the main labor federation, industrialists, and
other private sector participants, especially in the banking sector. Ms. Xafa,
Alternate Executive Director, attended the meetings.

•

The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and have agreed to
the publication of the staff report.

•

An FAD mission was held November 1–9, 2004 to update the 1999 assessment
of fiscal transparency, which was a precursor of the ROSCs, and as such was
considered experimental and based largely on a self-assessment by the
authorities.

•

Greece has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions, apart from those related to
UN resolutions (Appendix I). Greece subscribes to the SDDS (Appendix II).

•

The center-right New Democracy party won a comfortable parliamentary
majority in March 2004, returning to power after a decade in opposition.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Economic growth is set to be strong in 2004 for the fifth year running. Eroding
competitiveness and the need to quickly correct high fiscal deficits suggest activity
will slow appreciably in 2005 and beyond, although the authorities maintain a more
optimistic outlook.

•

Data revisions, spending overruns (in part due to the Olympics), and revenue shortfalls
pushed the general government deficit to an estimated 5½ percent of GDP in 2004.
Indeed, the revisions revealed that the deficit never fell below 3 percent of GDP. The
very high debt-GDP ratio (based on revised data, 112 percent of GDP in 2004) has
fallen little in recent years.

Policy discussions and assessment
•

Fiscal consolidation is the overriding priority. The 2005 budget targets a deficit
reduction of 2½ percent of GDP (of which 11 ⁄4 percent is due to the end of Olympics
spending), which the staff judges feasible and necessary. Staff calculates that the
deficit will fall to 3½ percent of GDP in 2005, although it may prove higher.

•

Medium and long-term fiscal consolidation is also needed. Structural adjustment of
slightly more than ¾ percent of GDP a year would yield near budget balance by 2010,
while further adjustment will be required thereafter. This is more than the authorities
currently envision, although their plans are not yet firm. Pension reform is off the
authorities’ policy agenda for now.

•

The unreliability of the fiscal data, revealed by the large revisions agreed with
Eurostat, has hindered surveillance, policy-making, and credibility. The fiscal ROSC
update lays out further desirable improvements to fiscal management.

•

The banking system seems in good health, although the rapid rise in private sector
credit during the economic boom may hold credit risks if the economy slows.

•

Convergence with the EU-15 living standards is a longstanding priority. The
government program seems relatively strong on tax reform, and enhancing
competition, a thrust welcomed by the staff. However, much less focus is being placed
on labor-market reforms.

-4-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Real GDP growth in 2004 is expected to be about 4 percent for the fifth
consecutive year (Table 1, Figure 1). The boom was sustained by accommodative monetary
conditions associated with adoption of the euro and subsequent easing by the ECB. Fiscal
policy was also markedly stimulative, with revised figures showing the budgetary situation to
have deteriorated throughout the boom period. Private consumption and household confidence
have been buoyant, reflecting strong wage increases, wealth effects from rising real estate
prices, gains in employment and a falling unemployment rate, and deregulation of financial
markets that spurred very large increases in consumer credit (Figures 2, 3, and 4). Rising
profitability and, in the past two years, the Olympics have sustained investment, especially
construction.
2.
However, years of high growth have resulted in inflationary pressures and an
erosion of competitiveness, and structural weaknesses have remained largely
unaddressed. There has been progress in implementing Fund recommendations in some areas
(notably, the financial sector and, following recent fiscal revisions, data quality), but less has
been done elsewhere (Box 1). In particular, limited progress on resolving longstanding
supply-side impediments has meant that the output gap has risen and labor markets have
tightened as aggregate supply has not been able to meet rising demand. Inflation and unit
labor cost increases have been among the highest in the euro area, causing a sustained
appreciation of the real exchange rate (Figure 5). Although about half the inflation differential
may be due to Balassa-Samuelson effects, international competitiveness has eroded and the
export market share has fallen. Strong domestic demand and poor competitiveness underlie
large and persistent current account deficits and, in the past three years, a negative
contribution of the external sector to aggregate demand.1 The size of the current account
deficit and the fact that it is financed largely by portfolio flows—FDI inflows have been
weak—raises issues of longer-term sustainability (Table 2). However, interest rate
differentials relative to Germany remain small, reflecting Greece’s participation in a monetary
union.

1

Shipping has proved very strong, however, as demand and fares have risen sharply. By contrast,
tourism has disappointed as costs exceed those of other Mediterranean competitors and, in 2004,
potential Olympic games spectators were dissuaded by security concerns.

-5-

Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal policy. The Fund has repeatedly called for a more ambitious fiscal stance, but
consolidation stalled in recent years and revisions have revealed that deficits were much larger
than reported. Had these numbers been available, staff would have advised a still stronger
fiscal effort. The Fund has encouraged multi-year fiscal planning, which has not been adopted.
Data quality. The Fund has called for improvements in statistical data, as identified in the
fiscal and data ROSCs. Progress has been made, notably with adherence in 2002 to the SDDS
and the recent fiscal revisions, but more needs to be done (Appendix II and the ROSC updates).
Pension reform. The Fund has called for early action to address the high projected costs of
population aging. Pension reforms in 2002 consolidated a number of funds, but did not address
underlying expenditure pressures.
Financial sector. The Fund has welcomed actions to improve supervision and strengthen
banks’ risk management, processes which have continued. A law establishing an independent
insurance supervisor was passed in February 2004, but has not been implemented.
Structural policy. The Fund has called for further privatization, which continues to be a key
government goal. Most recently, divestiture of the remaining stake in the National Bank was
announced. Labor market reform, which the Fund has consistently advocated, has been limited.

3.
Fiscal consolidation stalled during the boom, with the situation proving much
worse than had been thought even as late as last spring. Restatement of the fiscal accounts
by the authorities and Eurostat resulted in large upward revisions to general government
deficits for 1997–2003, which never fell below the 3 percent of GDP Maastricht ceiling (Box
2 and Table 3). The general government deficit remained close to 4 percent of GDP
during 2000–02 before expanding to an estimated 5½ percent in 2004; the primary surplus
declined precipitously to almost zero. Olympics spending was partly responsible, adding 1 to
1½ percentage points to the deficit-GDP ratio in each of 2002–04 (Table 4). Spending
overruns and revenue shortfalls raised the 2003 and 2004 deficits well beyond budget
projections. Owing to the lack of fiscal adjustment, the debt-GDP ratio, officially expected to
be 112 percent in 2004, has fallen little in recent years. Following these revisions, Greece was
downgraded by Standard and Poor’s and put on a negative rating watch by Fitch, which
however seems not to have widened interest rate differentials. In its report to Parliament and
the Council, the EC announced an infringement procedure to prevent future misreporting by
Greece, and raised broader issues of ensuring member-country data quality.2

Box 2. Revision of General Government Accounts
From May to November 2004, the authorities and Eurostat agreed to revisions to the public
accounts which substantially increased fiscal deficits for 1997-2003. The key sources of the
revisions were:
•

Corrections for under-recording of military procurement, as well as a change in the
method of accounting for this item from a delivery basis (preferred by Eurostat and
used by the bulk of euro-area countries, but for which reliable data are not available in
Greece) to a cash basis. The latter shifted the recording of some acquisitions to earlier
years, but did not increase the total.

•

Corrections for over-estimation of social security and other non-central government
surpluses, based on a new census of these organizations yielding up-to-date data.

•

A reversal of the decision to book January 2004 VAT receipts in 2003, a change in
treatment of EU structural funds, and reclassification of a transaction with the postal
savings bank from revenue to a financial transaction.

•

Debt was also revised up, mainly reflecting the capitalization of delayed interest
payments and lower social security assets.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
The discussions focused on three areas: the fiscal situation, medium-term growth,
and the financial sector. Key issues were fiscal consolidation in 2005 and the medium term,
and long-term fiscal sustainability in light of population aging. Policies to boost longer-term
growth were also discussed extensively, as was the state of the financial sector. At the time of
the mission, the new government which had taken office in March was still formulating its
economic policies, although the Prime Minister’s key economic speech on September 10
provided some direction.
A. Economic Outlook
5.
The authorities were more optimistic than the mission on growth for 2005. Staff
projects GDP growth will slow to 3 percent, while the draft 2005 budget projects 3.9 percent,
little changed from 2004.3 Since substantial wage gains and high confidence levels were
expected to bolster private consumption, the key differences involved investment and the
external sector. The authorities felt that business-tax reform would stimulate investment,4 the
recovery in Europe would increase exports, and favorable Olympics publicity would boost
tourism, offsetting the end of Olympics spending and planned fiscal consolidation. Staff
argued that these latter factors would slow investment in the short run, and that losses in
competitiveness would limit any advantage of stronger European growth. The authorities and
the mission agreed that the key downside risks to the outlook were oil price rises5 and a large
euro appreciation, which would dampen domestic demand and undercut the European
recovery.
6.
The authorities were also more optimistic regarding medium-term growth
prospects. They judged that infrastructure investment associated with the Olympics and other
projects in coming years would boost productivity and sustain growth at rates similar to those
of recent years. The mission argued that the waning effects of euro adoption, correction of the
cyclical imbalances built up during the boom, and the need for continued fiscal consolidation
would all weigh on aggregate demand growth (Table 5). Nevertheless, quantifying potential
output growth and separating trend from cycle in the recent boom are difficult, and therefore
medium-term prospects remain quite uncertain. There was agreement that fundamental
structural reform and improving international competitiveness, which would require wage
restraint, would be key to boosting medium-term growth.
3

The October EC forecast is 3.3 percent, the November OECD projection is 3.2 percent, and the
December Consensus Forecast is 2.7 percent.

4

The combination of phased-in business tax cuts and higher depreciation allowances was expected to
provide an incentive to bring investment forward.

5

Staff estimates suggest a permanent 20 percent rise in oil prices, would cut growth by some
0.3 percentage points in 2005.

-8-

B. Fiscal Policy
7.
In the wake of the large revisions, the mission emphasized that accurate and
timely fiscal data are a prerequisite for effective surveillance and for the government’s
own policymaking and credibility. It stressed that the national authorities were ultimately
responsible for ensuring the integrity of the data, and that data shortcomings had hindered
surveillance and also policymaking (Box 3). The authorities agreed, noting that they had
initiated the revision process and underscoring their firm commitment to transparency. To this
end, surveys of the social security funds and local governments would henceforth be
conducted every quarter and military expenditures would be recorded on a cash (instead of
delivery) basis, which were judged more reliable. Revisions available at the time of the
mission covered 2000–03 and for this period the authorities reassured staff that, to the best of
their knowledge, there would be no further major changes. However, they did note scope for
further improvements in the new quarterly surveys and the accounting practices of local
governments.
8.
Staff urged that the integrity of the fiscal accounts be reinforced. While changes
made in the wake of the review by the authorities and Eurostat resulted in major
improvements, staff made further recommendations, including in the context of the fiscal
ROSC update (Box 4). The authorities welcomed the mission’s proposal of a full fiscal
ROSC, and have also committed to compiling fiscal financing data from 2005, which should
provide an additional check on the budget figures.
9.
The key concern, which the revisions intensified, was the need for fiscal
consolidation going forward. Staff projects a general government deficit of 5½ percent of
GDP in 2004, much higher than the 1.2 percent targeted by the 2004 budget, reflecting a
much worse starting point in 2003, shortfalls in tax revenues and transfers from the EU, and
overruns in Olympics related expenditure, social transfers, and public sector wages. There are
risks of a still higher deficit: Olympics costs have yet to be finalized and revenue collection
has been weak. Looking ahead, the staff’s constant-policy medium-term scenario implies little
progress in deficit reduction (Table 5), and its debt sustainability analysis suggests the debtGDP ratio will fall only gradually through 2010, and increase sharply thereafter as pension
and health-care costs rise due to population aging (Table 6).
10.
The authorities and the mission agreed that the large adjustment in the 2005
budget—2½ percent of GDP—was necessary and attainable (Table 4). Fiscal withdrawal
would be appropriate in the short term given the large positive output gap and wage and price
pressures; and a substantial up-front adjustment would help set a course for a needed
sustained consolidation effort in coming years. The planned deficit reductions reflect the end
of Olympics spending (1¼ percent), lower pension increases, lower public-sector wage
growth (in the wake of large increases in the previous two years), substantial projected
revenues from the settlement of old tax cases and the continuation of tax amnesties, and
interest savings as some high-interest debt is paid off. The budget projects a deficit of 2.8
percent of GDP, but based on its lower growth projection and a somewhat worse outturn in
2004, staff expects a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP. Although this would mean breaching the

-9-

Maastricht ceiling for yet another year, the authorities agreed with staff that hasty or one-off
measures would only compound future fiscal difficulties and should therefore be avoided.
However, in this event further measures would be needed to reduce the deficit below 3
percent of GDP in 2006, which is expected to be required by the EU under its excessive
deficit procedure.
Box 3. Staff Advice on Fiscal Transparency in Greece
This box summarizes past staff assessment of fiscal transparency in the 1999 report on fiscal
transparency, and subsequent updates, the 2003 data ROSC, and various staff reports.1/ These documents
were on the whole appreciative of the progress the authorities had made on various issues, and urged
remedial action to correct remaining weaknesses. Fund staff did not identify the major misreporting
issues regarding defense acquisitions and social security surpluses, but did raise questions regarding
large below-the-line operations and stock-flow discrepancies.
The 1999 report on fiscal transparency, a precursor of the ROSCs, was based on a self-assessment by
the authorities. Relevant recommendations were: clarifying the treatment of state enterprises; integrating
ordinary and investment budgets; better reporting on quasi-fiscal activities (or eliminating such
activities), and state financial assets; clarifying the accounting basis underlying the budget; bolstering
oversight through parliamentary hearings on audited financial statements. Subsequent factual updates
recorded improvements in transparency of the management of state financial assets and extrabudgetary
funds, increased public availability of fiscal data, and initial steps to improve auditing.
The 2003 data ROSC found government finance statistics to be generally of lower quality than other
areas, but was moderately positive on fiscal data integrity in the context of EU standard-setting and
control. Identified weaknesses included: lack of reconciliation of fiscal and financial accounts;
insufficient resources available to the statistical agency; limitations in the legal and institutional
environment; methodological weaknesses; unavailability of financial flows and stocks; lack of
consistency between fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments data; inability to establish internal
consistency of net lending/borrowing and financing; and lack of metadata. The ROSC recommended
measures to strengthen these areas.
The 2000 staff report called for improved statistics in several areas, including the fiscal accounts, to
facilitate economic assessment and surveillance. The 2001 report focused on the need for greater fiscal
consolidation, in particular identifying and discussing the persistent and large below-the-line entries, and
noting inadequacies in the accounting of these stock-flow discrepancies. These themes were taken up in
the 2003 report, which called for further improvements in transparency and accountability.

Box 4. Recommendations of the 2004 Fiscal ROSC Update
The report found considerable progress had been made in improving clarity and accountability,
communication with the public, budget preparation, and data integrity. Regarding the last, the new
survey agreed with Eurostat should greatly improve oversight of the large social security sector.
However, the report also made a number of recommendations for improvement:
Clarity of roles and responsibilities would be improved by eliminating the overlap of pre-auditing,
which is now done by three agencies; fully integrating all debt operations in the public debt agency;
unifying responsibility for privatization; strengthening the role and mandate of the Court of Audit; and
introducing performance evaluation of government activities.
Public availability of information would be improved by developing more descriptive budget
documentation illustrating government objectives, policies, activities and targets. This would need to be
combined with a programmatic presentation and costing of the budget itself, as has become the norm in
OECD countries.
Open budget preparation, execution, and reporting would be enhanced by structuring appropriations
by program, moving to a multi-year perspective, consolidating extra-budgetary and off-budget spending,
including most importantly defense spending, closing special accounts, and harmonizing Greek and EU
fiscal reporting practices.
Assurances of integrity could be strengthened by an independent review of budget assumptions, as well
as moving the statistical agency outside the Ministry of Economy and Finance and providing it with a
mandate assuring its independence.

11.
There is some risk that the 2005 deficit could prove larger than expected. The
2004 starting point could be worse: revenues, including from the tax amnesties, may fall short
of projections; and public-sector wages may overshoot the budget, as has happened
consistently in the past; Olympics spending is not yet finalized; and continuing Eurostat
investigation may lead to further revisions (stock-flow discrepancies, though diminished,
remain significant). The mission also noted that a number of the measures were not permanent
(the tax amnesties and settlements) or were ad hoc (the decisions to slow the pace of pension
and wage increases, which are one-time adjustments not linked to deeper civil service or
pension reform and therefore may not be sustained), which would complicate the task of
needed further consolidation in 2006 and beyond. The authorities concurred on this point, but
with the uncertain state of the public finances—at the time of the mission the fiscal outturn for
2003 was still unknown—argued that they had not had time to devise more permanent
measures.
12.
The mission stressed that the more difficult tasks—achieving near budget
balance in the medium-term and still further adjustment in the longer term—lay ahead.
Staff argued for a substantial and decisive effort to demonstrate the authorities’ determination,
meet EU commitments to reach near-budget balance, rapidly reduce the national debt, and
prepare for rising spending associated with population aging. In the staff adjustment scenario,
budget balance is achieved by 2010 by declines in the cyclically adjusted deficit of slightly
more than ¾ percentage point of GDP annually (Table 7). The authorities, who were still
formulating their plans, agreed with the need for sustained consolidation but envisaged slower

- 11 -

adjustment, with further primary spending cuts (especially in the public-sector wage bill)
reducing the deficit by about 1 percent of GDP between 2006 and 2008, to 1.8 percent of
GDP. They argued that the pace of consolidation would be limited by the tax cuts and
infrastructure spending needed to stimulate medium-term growth. While the mission agreed
with the need for growth-enhancing initiatives, it stressed that sustained deficit cuts would
require compression of primary current spending, which in the staff adjustment scenario
grows in real terms by 1½ percent a year on average during 2006–10.
13.
Strong medium-term adjustment is all the more important since population aging
will begin to exert fiscal pressure in the next decade and pension reform is off the policy
agenda for the time being. According to current projections, pension outlays will rise by
some 12 percentage points of GDP by 2050, the largest in the EU, due to the combination of
generosity and one of the largest increases in the dependency rate.6 In this context, the
mission noted that reforms had been adopted or discussed in other countries (including raising
the retirement age, cutting benefits, and indexing to wages rather than prices), and that a
number of countries also planned sustained fiscal surpluses to help pay for aging costs. The
authorities responded that an electoral commitment not to change the pension system in the
government’s first term in office would be honored, although measures would be taken
regarding bank pensions (Section C) and to bring the large number of guest workers into the
social security system. The mission pressed for a greater sense of urgency and, as a minimum,
argued for an early start to a public debate to build social consensus for the substantive
reforms that would be required.
14.
The other long-term threat to sustainability is rising health-care costs. The
authorities saw considerable scope for reform of this sector, which is characterized by
universal public health-care coverage, one of the highest spending-GDP ratios in the OECD,
and a relatively large number of physicians per capita.7 Immediate official priorities are to
centralize hospital procurement and rein in arrears that have built up despite a legal
prohibition.
15.
Containing spending growth in the
medium and long term will require strict
review of spending management and priorities.
The mission argued that restraining transfer
spending, slimming the public service by taking
advantage of computerization and aging-induced
retirements, cutting lending to public enterprises,
and reducing waste in procurement should be
high on the agenda. It also noted that government

debt guarantees should be scaled back, as they were frequently triggered and, to that extent,
amounted to subsidies. Finally, it warned that overly optimistic medium-term growth
assumptions would inflate tax revenues and thus understate the required degree of spending
restraint. The authorities have made expenditure management a priority, and are developing
an expenditure control unit within the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), although its
exact role—a narrow auditing function versus a broader investigative mandate—remains to be
determined.
16.
The mission reiterated its recommendation to adopt a medium-term budget
framework. Such an approach, now adopted in many advanced economies, would buttress
credibility and help the government resist spending pressures in coming years. The authorities
expressed interest in such frameworks, though they argued that the Stability and Growth Plans
fulfilled this role. On the latter point, the mission noted that such plans tend not to be very
detailed and had typically (and not just in Greece) been revised substantially from year to
year, undermining their credibility.
17.
The authorities have introduced legislation to reform personal and business
income taxation. The mission endorsed the thrust of these measures—including phased
reductions in profits tax rates; flexibility in choosing depreciation schedules; a unified tax rate
on interest income from deposits, bank bonds, and repos; a reduced transfer tax on shares; and
improvements in tax administration. More generally, staff urged the authorities to favor base
broadening and tax simplification, and eschew special tax breaks. In this connection, it
supported the elimination of industry-specific exemptions on retained earnings, which was not
in the draft legislation.
C.

Financial Sector

18.
The Greek banking system—which dominates the financial sector—appears
adequately capitalized and profitable (Table 8).8 The ratio of capital as a percent of riskweighted assets and after-tax profits compares favorably to the euro area as a whole; average
asset quality appears to have improved, with rapid credit growth driving down
nonperforming-loan ratios; prudential requirements are largely in line with EU standards; and
banking supervision includes coverage of the Balkans, where Greek banks have expanded in
recent years.

1/ Some comparisons with EU averages must be done with caution, in particular for NPL ratios.
2/ The Agricultural Bank of Greece is excluded from the statistics.
3/ Interest rate margin is defined as the difference between the average interest received on
interest bearing assets and the average interest paid on interest bearing liabilities.

Credit Institutions and Fixed Yield Securities with a discount to reflect market price volatility.

19.
Nevertheless, the rapid increase in private sector credit may expose banks to
credit risk, especially if the current favorable environment for lending turns sour. As the
market for consumer loans was fully liberalized at the end of the 1990s and interest rates fell
sharply with the adoption of the euro, Greek banks expanded lending to households while
reducing holdings of government bonds (Figure 4). This portfolio shift raised returns but also
increased risk, especially since the credit bureau provides comprehensive information on each
customer’s borrowing only since June 2003. This increase in private sector credit is part of the
broader process of the development of the financial sector and is likely to continue for some
time—private debt as a fraction of income is still only about half the European average.
Nevertheless, the quality and robustness of banks’ risk management have not been tested
during an economic downturn or a large rise in interest rates.
20.
The Bank of Greece (BoG), the banking supervisor, has taken measures to meet
these risks. The BoG has increased specific provisions and capitalization levels, and reported
that its stress tests suggest that Greek banks are not significantly exposed to market risks.
Since banks hold mostly floating-rate assets, their interest-rate risk is also limited. However,
as this risk is shifted to borrowers, credit risk may have risen. The BoG has also strengthened
its capacity to supervise risk management by recruiting additional specialists. The mission
raised the possibility of the credit bureau collecting more comprehensive debt data, but the
authorities responded that strong confidentiality laws precluded this. While some statecontrolled banks now have large pension liabilities, these will be transferred to IKA, the main
public pension fund, by 2007. The mission urged early clarification of the terms of this
transfer, especially as banks will have to recognize their pension liabilities under International

- 14 -

Accounting Standards, which are scheduled to come into force at end-2005. The BoG judged
the banking system to be well prepared for the introduction of Basel II by end-2006.9
21.
Insurance supervision is weak, and the mission urged the independent supervisor
be established quickly. The authorities agreed, and planned to implement the legislation
(which had been passed in February, 2004) as soon as possible; in November, inspections
were intensified and the head of the independent supervisor was appointed. They also noted
that systemic risks were limited because the insurance sector and banks’ exposure to it were
small.
22.
The authorities agreed to participate in an FSAP, scheduled for the first half of
2005. An FSAP would be timely in view of the large changes in the financial system in recent
years and the BoG’s efforts to upgrade its own capacities and banks’ risk management
practices.
D. Higher Growth and Convergence with the EU
23.
The overarching goal of structural policy is to raise per capita real GDP to the
EU average over time. From the Irish experience, as described in Chapter II of the selected
issues paper, the mission distilled two policy priorities: control of spending and budget
deficits, as discussed above; and improvement in the business climate by accelerating product
and labor market reforms.
24.
The authorities underscored the importance of continued infrastructure
investment. They noted that the budgetary cost could be limited through careful use of funds
remaining from the third Community Structural Framework (which must be spent by 2008)
and via Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs), for which they were preparing an appropriate
legal framework. The mission concurred, but reiterated that fiscal consolidation was the first
priority. With regard to PPPs, staff pointed out that the fiscal savings today could result in
higher debt in the future, and therefore underscored the need to choose projects with the
highest economic payoff, guarantee transparency and independence in project evaluation,
shift risks to the private sector to ensure good performance, and clearly account for all explicit
and implicit public sector liabilities.
25.
There was agreement that measures to improve the business climate would be
key to sustained growth and higher incomes. Businesses generally face greater
impediments in Greece than elsewhere and research suggests that substantial gains would be
possible if Greece moved to best practices.10 Some progress has been made, including the
9

According to the Quantitative Impact Study (QIS3), minimum capital requirements would rise by
7.5 percent under Basel II for institutions adopting the standardized approach, but would fall for those,
such as the larger Greek banks, expected to use advanced approaches.

establishment in 2003 of Investment Reception Centers (one-stop shops) for business
establishment, which provide useful guidance but have yet to live up to the promise of cutting
red tape. Businesses also face high dismissal costs, an eroding competitive position, and
increasing labor shortages (recent high immigration notwithstanding). The authorities
indicated they intend to move on several fronts, and the structural reform agenda announced
by the Prime Minister in September highlighted tax reform, including of tax administration,
and streamlined business regulation. The mission supported such initiatives, and called for
further privatization to reduce the exposure of the budget to loss-making public enterprises
and promote efficiency.
26.
It was agreed that limited domestic competition had resulted in inefficiencies and
high prices. The Competition Commission, which was reformed in 2003, will be a key
agency in this regard. Although increasingly active, it remained understaffed owing to
difficulties in hiring qualified personnel, and its ability to initiate investigations has been
limited relative to best practice. The mission argued that reforms to the energy sector should
be accelerated; although Greece generally adheres to EU liberalization timetables, there is
scope for more rapid implementation and measures to increase competition in the sector,
including by continuing the program of increasing import capacity.
27.
The labor market is characterized by low employment rates, especially among
youth and women, and a high, though gradually falling, unemployment rate. In many
respects, performance is near the bottom of the EU (Figures 6 and 7).11 These problems partly
reflect mismatches between skills and demands, pointing to a need to reappraise the education
and training system and the public employment service. But they also reflect impediments to
employment: employment protection legislation, including high severance pay and
administrative protections; limited part-time and temporary employment opportunities; and
high wages, especially at the entry level.
28.
However, labor market reform has been slow. The authorities concurred that labor
market reforms would be key to increasing incomes, especially in the long-term context of
population aging. In this regard, they stressed the potential benefits of the large amount of
immigration in recent years (mainly from the Balkans) and were making efforts to regularize
such guest workers. Nevertheless, the September policy statement said little on labor-market
reform. Such reform will face stiff opposition from labor organizations, although the 2004–05
wage agreement—while generous at nearly 6 percent a year—confirmed the change in the
previous agreement that eliminated longstanding inflation catch-up clauses, a development the
mission welcomed. Also, the decision in the draft 2005 budget to limit public-sector wage
growth in 2005 may restrain subsequent private-sector negotiations and help to hold down
entry wages.

11

Hours worked, however, appear very high, even by U.S. standards. This may reflect the low amount
of part-time work in Greece, which may itself indicate structural rigidities.

- 16 -

E. Other Issues
29.
The authorities supported multilateral trade liberalization. In particular, they
supported efforts to successfully conclude the Doha round, and argued that the end of textile
quotas would encourage a welcome restructuring of the Greek industry toward higher valueadded products. They felt that reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy were moving in the
right direction, but argued for only gradual liberalization of the sugar regime, since
economically depressed regions depended heavily on sugar production. The authorities also
intend to improve the operation of the National Exports Council to promote Greek exports.
30.
Greece is making progress toward complying with international AML/CFT
standards, and the amendment of the 1995 AML law would be a significant step
forward. Further work will then be needed to achieve full compliance with the latest FATF
Recommendations of 2003, and in due course with the Third EU AML directive currently
being negotiated. The Phase 1 review concluded that Greek legislation implemented in 1998
meets the requirements of the OECD anti-bribery code.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Greece has enjoyed an economic boom for some years, which appears to have
continued into 2004. Very supportive monetary conditions, due in part to declining interest
rates associated with euro adoption, and an expansionary fiscal stance have underpinned
domestic demand. Strong wage increases and an improving labor market have spurred
consumption, while rising profits and, in the past two years, the Olympics have sustained
investment. This activity has been financed by rapid increases in private-sector credit in the
wake of financial market liberalization.
32.
However, the outlook for 2005 and beyond is for weaker growth, and the
government needs to formulate and implement a specific policy agenda to address
growing imbalances and longstanding structural weaknesses. The public finances are in
very poor condition: budget deficits have risen despite strong economic growth and the public
debt-GDP ratio remains high. High inflation and labor cost increases have eroded
competitiveness and contributed to large and persistent current account deficits. Labor-market
performance remains poor, and excessive government regulation and red tape weigh on the
business climate. For 2005, consumption is expected to remain strong, but needed fiscal
consolidation, including the end of Olympics spending, will sap domestic demand. Expected
further deterioration in international competitiveness will limit the benefits of any pickup in
the euro area. Beyond 2005, prospects depend critically on credible fiscal consolidation,
policies to boost aggregate supply, and better alignment of real wages with productivity to
help restore competitiveness. In the absence of strong measures, there is a significant risk of
tepid growth.
33.
The overriding priority is to establish control over the public finances. The 2005
fiscal adjustment of 2½ percent of GDP is an appropriate start to what will be a long process
of fiscal retrenchment. With euro-area monetary conditions expected to remain expansionary
and the Greek economy overheated, fiscal constraint would be helpful as a countercyclical

- 17 -

policy. A substantial up-front adjustment is also needed to set the course for medium-term
consolidation, although in this regard greater use of permanent measures would have been
preferable. In the staff’s view, the deficit is likely to remain above the authorities’ target (and
the 3 percent Maastricht ceiling) in 2005, due to slowing growth and, possibly, a worse
outturn in 2004 than officially expected. Nevertheless, the authorities should refrain from
taking further ad hoc measures, and instead focus on developing durable adjustment measures
in the 2006 budget.
34.
Needed medium and long-term fiscal adjustment will require strict control of
primary current spending, buttressed by a medium-term budget framework. Decisive
and sustained reductions in the structural deficit of some 3 ⁄4 percent a year to achieve budget
balance in 2010 would demonstrate the authorities’ resolve to correct deep underlying fiscal
imbalances and meet EU commitments regarding deficits and debt reduction. Beyond 2010, a
surplus position will be required to rapidly reduce very high debt levels and deal with the
long-term costs of population aging. In this context, although growth-enhancing policies are
needed, tax cuts and infrastructure investment cannot be allowed to delay or undermine deficit
reduction. Containing current primary spending will require fundamental review of
expenditures on social programs, the public service, defense, procurement practices, and
support to industry (including loan guarantees). This long-term effort, and fiscal credibility
more generally, would be bolstered by an explicit medium-term budget framework that lays
out realistic economic assumptions, specific measures, and expenditure ceilings consistent
with deficit objectives.
35.
Addressing aging-related fiscal pressures will require reforms to pension and
health-care systems, even with sustained fiscal adjustment. Current estimates indicate that
aging-related costs will escalate in the next decade and will subsequently rise by more than in
any other EU country. The election promise to forgo reform during this government term will
delay addressing the problem by at least four years, making the adjustment eventually needed
more difficult. Early reform would therefore be desirable, but at a minimum and consistent
with their electoral commitment, the authorities should take immediate steps to open a
discussion on concrete reforms to build social consensus for change. Measures planned or
taken elsewhere in Europe could inform this discussion, and in Greece the transfer of banks’
pension liabilities to IKA provides one opportunity to launch a wider debate.
36.
While economic statistics have improved, the inaccurate reporting of fiscal data
has hindered surveillance and policy-making, and undermined credibility. The revisions,
while long overdue, have improved the methodology and accuracy of the fiscal data. Further
measures are nevertheless warranted, and every avenue should be pursued to bolster data
integrity. Financing data, which is to be published beginning in 2005, should be used to crosscheck budget outturns, and surveys of the non-central government sector should continue to
be refined. The authorities should also consider strengthening the oversight role of the Court
of Audit, reinforcing the independence of the statistical agency by moving it out of the MEF,
and establishing an entity to perform independent reviews of budget policies and assumptions.
In other areas, the authorities should correct remaining weaknesses identified in the

- 18 -

accompanying fiscal and data ROSC updates. Their decision to undertake a full-fledged fiscal
ROSC is welcome.
37.
The banking sector appears to be profitable, well capitalized, and adequately
provisioned; the BoG should continue to enhance its assessment and supervision,
notably as regards credit quality. The rapid increase in private-sector lending reflects in
part the development of the sector, but also raises risks, especially as banks have not recently
faced an economic slowdown or rising interest rates. The BoG has commendably
strengthened its supervisory capacity, increased specific provisioning and capitalization
levels, and encouraged banks to enhance their risk-management procedures. These initiatives
should be continued, especially in the context of the introduction of Basel II. Insurance
supervision is a notable weak point, underscoring the need to ensure that the independent
insurance supervisor is operational as soon as possible. The authorities’ decision to undertake
an FSAP is welcome.
38.
The key structural policy priority is to put in place the conditions for sustained
increases in real output and living standards, and the authorities’ emphasis here is well
placed. To succeed, however, a broad range of weaknesses need to be addressed. Fiscal
consolidation would ensure macroeconomic stability and provide room for growth-enhancing
tax cuts. The authorities’ focus on improving the business climate is welcome, as this will be
key to increasing investment, including foreign investment, and productivity. But labormarket reform to raise employment rates, which has so far received less emphasis, is also
critical for the sustained expansion of living standards.
39.
Improving the business climate will require reform on several fronts, but the
payback would potentially be substantial and rapid. Tax policy should emphasize base
broadening, simplification, and rate reductions. In this vein, the 2002 reform and the proposed
reforms beginning in 2005 are welcome. Reducing administrative burdens (“red tape” and
excessive regulation) and simplifying tax administration, including by narrowing the
discretion now available to tax inspectors, are also critical. Product market reforms should
focus on intensifying competition. All relevant EU directives on the liberalization and
regulation of network industries should be effectively implemented as soon as possible. The
privatization program should be intensified, with the ultimate goal of the government leaving
all sectors where commercial forces normally operate. The more active stance of the
Competition Commission is welcome, but steps should be taken to increase staff and
strengthen its legal powers.
40.
The authorities’ emphasis on continuing infrastructure investment is
appropriate, but also carries risks in terms of potential future liabilities. Wise use of
European structural funds and the proposed use of PPPs can reduce immediate budgetary
costs and provide efficient delivery of services. However, careful attention needs to be paid to
the consequences for the future path of the public debt that such arrangements may entail, and
full accounting of explicit and implicit public-sector liabilities, transparent project selection
and evaluation, and risk transfer to the private sector will therefore be essential.

- 19 -

41.
These initiatives will have limited effectiveness without accompanying reforms in
the labor market and wage-setting mechanism. The significant weaknesses in the labor
market should be addressed by: improving the education and training system and the public
employment service to reduce the mismatch between skills and demand; amending
employment protection legislation to encourage hiring; extending part-time and temporary
employment opportunities; and lowering entry wages to allow low-skilled workers to gain a
foothold in the market. Regarding wages, the end of inflation catch-up clauses is welcome,
but to avoid further erosion of international competitiveness wage increases must be brought
in line with domestic productivity growth and the ECB inflation target. National wage
bargains should more explicitly acknowledge this constraint, and the public sector has an
opportunity to lead by example, especially given the demonstration effect it appears to have
on the rest of the economy.
42.
The authorities’ support for multilateral trade liberalization is welcome. Their
intention to continue to increase ODA is also welcome, and they are encouraged to raise the
current level of 0.26 percent of GNI toward the UN target of 0.7 percent of GNI.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

currency-denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Historical average for fiscal variables are for the period 2001-03 due to the unavailability of consistently defined data for earlier years.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.

APPENDIX II

GREECE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Greece has made substantial progress in recent years in statistical methodologies and
compilation practices aimed at fulfilling its responsibilities as a member of the European
Union and the euro area. Greece became the fifty-first country to subscribe to the
International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on November 8,
2002—it has taken flexibility options on the periodicity and timeliness of central government
operations data on financing, which are released annually. In addition, there have been recent
difficulties in meeting SDDS timeliness for other data categories. Greece has undertaken a
data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).
Recent progress could form a sound basis from which further improvements can be achieved.
Improvements in the quality and coverage of general government public finances are urgently
required; large and frequent revisions in these data undermine policy-making. More staff
resources are needed to develop financial accounts of the government and achieve cross sector
data consistency. There is scope for bringing government finance and balance of payments
statistics closer to internationally acknowledged methodologies. Further progress is needed in
providing short-term national accounts data, with reconciliation across datasets of data for
government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. Even though all statistics
are readily available to the public, statistical presentations could be improved in most cases to
facilitate analysis and understanding. Service to users could be further enhanced by
dissemination of more detailed metadata including wider identification in press releases, and
by publicizing contact persons. Most statistics do not provide the public with a clear statement
of the revision policy.
National accounts
The scope of the national accounts produced by the National Statistical Service of Greece
(NSSG) based on the 1995 ESA extends beyond the recommended range of annual tables, and
includes regional accounts, simplified provincial accounts, accounts for agriculture, detailed
tables relating to environmental issues, and a Social Accounting Matrix (for 1997). In some
cases, there is reliance on benchmark ratios that are old and estimates of unrecorded activities
that are residuals of balancing procedures. In addition, limited quarterly national accounts
estimates are available from the first quarter of 1970 to the third quarter of 2002, which rely
more on econometric estimation than on actual data.
Balance of payments and external trade
The Bank of Greece (BoG), in cooperation with several European central banks, has been
engaged for a number of years in a comprehensive revision of balance of payments data on a
settlements basis consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5). Data for 1999 are the first available under the new system, with the BoG also
providing estimates for 1997–98 (collected under the previous system, but compiled in the
new categories). Monthly balance of payments data are reported to both the European Central
Bank (ECB) and the IMF according to the timetable set by the ECB. Greece’s balance of

- 38 -

APPENDIX II

payments monthly data series present some departures from BPM5, including: data do not
include reinvested earnings nor undistributed branch profits; the basis for recording departs
from accrual accounting as is typical with the use of bank settlements-based reporting
systems; and data on interest payments for government debt are also reported on a cash basis.
Greece reports to STA data on quarterly balance of payments and the annual international
investment position (IIP) for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. As an SDDS subscriber, Greece started to
disseminate quarterly data on the SDDS prescribed external debt data category, with a onequarter lag, in end-September 2003.The BoG is disseminating monthly data on the template
on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity within 21 days after the end of the
reference month. Despite the new settlements-based reporting system, significant differences
remain in comparison to national-accounts-based current account data, with sizable
differences in changes (and even in direction) of the current account and its components in
recent years.
Government accounts
Monthly data for the budgetary central government are very aggregated. Revenue,
expenditure, and financing definitions are broadly in line with the 1986 GFS Manual. The
quality and timeliness of the data on other public entities, including social security funds and
local governments, are poor.
The NSSG compiles data on general government revenue, expenditure, and deficit on an
accrual basis in the context of the ESA95 Transmission Program and the Excessive Deficit
Procedure. The absence of financing data (Greece has a derogation for financial accounts
reporting until 2005) impedes elementary checking of the consistency of the data, including
reconciliation between the government deficit and debt, and between government statistics
and the statistics of other economic sectors. Greece traditionally carries out substantial capital
injections, whose nature must be carefully monitored in order to determine the proper
statistical treatment (above or below the line).
Recently, the fiscal accounts for 1997-2003 were significantly revised following a review by
Eurostat, reflecting lower tax receipts, lower payments received from EU institutions, a
reclassification of payments from the Saving Postal Bank to the government as a financial
transaction, higher expenditures on military equipment, and lower surpluses of the Social
Security Funds and other non-central government entities. Government debt was also
increased after properly accounting for capitalized interest obligations and lower assets of
social security funds.
Greece’s annual government finance statistics on an accruals basis were published in the
Supplement to the 2002 GFS Yearbook, which contains the statistics of selected countries
according to the GFSM 2001 methodology. These data were extracted from Greece’s
submission to Eurostat. Greece did not report data for publication in the 2003 GFS Yearbook.
No sub-annual GFS data are reported for publication in IFS.

- 39 -

APPENDIX II

Monetary accounts
Upon Greece’s participation in the euro area, the BoG successfully transitioned to compiling
monetary statistics in accordance with ECB requirements. Monetary statistics for publication
on Greece’s IFS page have been revised for consistency with the other euro-area countries.
Data reporting is timely. However, reporting discrepancies among banks’ bilateral positions
suggest improvements could be made in the accuracy and reliability of the source data used to
compile monetary statistics. Interbank reporting discrepancies in Greece’s monetary statistics
are not only large in stock terms, but also volatile. In addition, systematic cross-checks
between monetary statistics and other data sets are not undertaken. The data ROSC module
for Greece noted the following additional areas where Greece’s monetary statistics are not
fully in line with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual: (i) positions in
financial derivatives and claims on the central government are not separately identified;
(ii) some deposits are not accurately classified; and (iii) accrued interest is excluded from
outstanding amounts for loans and deposits recorded in the balance sheet.
Labor market
A more detailed quarterly labor force survey, with an enlarged sample size and capable of
generating data on an EU-harmonized basis, has been used since the fall of 1998. However,
the interpretation of labor market developments continues to be hampered by difficulties in
covering immigrants, which constitute, compared with other EU countries, a relatively large
fraction of the Greek labor market. Data on earnings have not been produced since 1998.
Short-term data
The recent publication of quarterly national accounts is an important improvement in this
area. However, other high-frequency indicators for economic surveillance (including retail
sales, industrial production, wholesale prices, and other indices) are at times based on out-ofdate benchmark ratios and reporting delays seriously undermine the usefulness of these data.
Source data and statistical techniques could be strengthened for prices, and source data
improved for government finance statistics.
Advance release calendars
The NSSG has announced an advance publications schedule for all statistical releases.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GREECE
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European and Policy Development and Review Departments
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Liam Ebrill
January 28, 2005
1.
This supplement to the staff report for the 2004 Article IV consultation with Greece
provides an update on recent developments. The new information does not change the thrust
of the staff appraisal. However, the authorities’ medium-term fiscal path, as laid out in its
Stability and Growth Program (SGP) update, falls well short of the adjustment path
advocated by staff.
2.
Macroeconomic indicators are broadly in line with expectations. Third-quarter
growth remained robust at 3.8 percent (year-on-year). Looking forward, growth prospects
have improved with the reduction in world oil prices (although these remain volatile), but
have also been undermined by the more subdued recovery now expected in the euro area.
The January Consensus Forecast for 2005 real GDP growth remained at 2.7 percent. Inflation
has been somewhat lower than expected due to the stronger euro, weaker oil prices, and a
moderation in food prices due to favorable weather conditions. Estimates of the 2004 general
government budget deficit are not yet available. However, the cash deficit of the central
government rose to 6½ percent of GDP by end-November, and preliminary reports indicate
that large revenue shortfalls have continued in December. In a press interview on January 16
the central bank governor said the central government cash deficit for 2004 as a whole was
9.4 percent of GDP. As a result, the risks for a general government deficit higher than the 5½
percent of GDP estimated in the staff report may have materialized. Having been placed on a
negative rating watch, Greece was downgraded by Fitch on December 16, 2004.
3.
In its report to ECOFIN, the European Commission concluded that the Greek
authorities have not taken effective action to correct the excessive budget deficit. The
Commission judged that the measures put in place last year and in the 2005 budget would not
reduce the deficit below 3 percent of GDP, and estimated that the 2004 budget deficit will be
5½ percent of GDP. Both of these conclusions are in line with the projections in the staff
report, although the Commission projects a more or less unchanged debt-GDP ratio in 2005,
whereas the staff foresees a modest decline. In its meeting on January 18, ECOFIN, while
acknowledging measures put in place by the Greek government for 2004 and 2005, decided
that Greece is not in compliance with the Council recommendations issued on July 5, 2004
and considered that the excessive deficit may persist in 2005.

-2-

4.
The authorities have submitted an updated Stability and Growth Program for
2004-07 to the Commission (Table 1). The macroeconomic framework assumes that output
growth will exceed 4 percent by 2007, due to strong private consumption demand,
underpinned by rapid real wage growth, and continued investment activity. The contribution
of the external sector is expected to rise due to the global recovery and improved
competitiveness.

5.
The SGP envisages only a modest decline in the overall general government
deficit to 2½ percent of GDP in 2007. Revenue collection is expected to remain strong due
to robust growth, improved tax collection, and a broader tax base. These factors are expected
to offset losses from a continued decline in the tax burden of enterprises and households after
2005. Despite the government’s plans to restrict hiring, allow only modest wage increases,
and reduce current operating expenditure, primary spending is projected to accelerate after
2005.
6.
The new SGP’s medium-term fiscal path is not very ambitious and is subject to
significant risks should growth falter (Table 2). Given the authorities’ growth and inflation
assumptions, but using staff’s estimate of potential output growth (3¼ percent a year), the
cyclically adjusted deficit, after falling significantly in 2005, remains unchanged in 2006 and
rises slightly in 2007, in contrast to staff’s recommendation of continued reductions in the
structural deficit of some ¾ percent a year. Were the staff’s medium-term output and
inflation projection to materialize, actual deficits would increase substantially in 2006-07.
7.
While details remain sketchy in many areas, the structural reform priorities laid
out in the SGP are a step in the right direction. These include: improving tax
administration and expenditure management; establishing an Independent Body of Fiscal
Inspectors to improve the effectiveness of the fiscal auditing system; implementing a new

-3-

framework to improve the financial operation of public enterprises; and, health care reform to
improve financial viability in the short run and long-run sustainability. The government
intends to continue improving product market competition by putting in place the pending
secondary legislation to open up the electricity market, and speeding up the opening of the
natural gas market. The government also hopes to attract investors by simplifying, updating,
and codifying legislation, rationalizing the tax system, reducing red tape, and providing
incentives to investors. No new initiatives have been announced in the areas of labor-market
or long-term pension reform (although tripartite discussions are taking place to settle details
on the transfer of pension obligations from the formerly state-owned banks to the public
sector).

Statement by Miranda Xafa, Alternate Executive Director for Greece
February 2, 2005

I would like to express the appreciation of my authorities for the high quality of the staff
papers. The exchanges between the staff and the Greek government have been frank and
productive, and staff’s recommendations on fiscal issues have been particularly useful. My
authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis and recommendations, including on the
challenges in the years ahead, which can be summarized as follows:
•

Fiscal policy is the most difficult challenge. The recent restatement of the public
finance figures brought a welcome improvement in fiscal transparency, but also
served to highlight the size of the needed fiscal adjustment. Persistent efforts will be
needed to achieve a sustainable fiscal position over the medium term.

•

Policies are geared to maintaining the high growth rate achieved in recent years, but
the risks are skewed to lower growth following the completion of major infrastructure
projects and other temporary growth-boosting factors.

•

Sustained increases in living standards require fundamental structural reform to
improve competitiveness and efficiency.

Fiscal consolidation is the most urgent priority
Upon taking office in March, the new Greek government undertook a wide-ranging fiscal
audit which resulted in significant upward revisions of the deficit and debt figures in the
period 1997-2004. The main elements explaining the revisions -- detailed in Box 2 of the
staff paper and in the December 2004 update of Greece’s Stability and Growth Program
(SGP) -- were the under-recording of military expenditures and the over-estimation of the
surplus of social security funds. In addition to the fiscal audit, fiscal developments in 200304 were impacted by the acceleration of expenditure related to the Olympic games and by the
electoral cycle, which led to a strong acceleration in public consumption in 2004. The
combined effect of the above factors was an increase in the general government deficit from
4.6 percent of GDP to an initial estimate of 5.3 percent in 2004, with Olympics-related
spending adding 1 to 1.5 percent of GDP to the deficit in each year.
Looking back, fiscal consolidation efforts over the past five years failed to secure a primary
surplus sufficient to reverse the dynamics of rising debt. Thus, general government debt
remained broadly stable as a percentage of GDP from 112.3 percent at end-1999 to 112.1
percent at end-2004, despite above-potential GDP growth averaging 4.1 percent during this
five-year period. Moreover, there was a gradual relaxation of the fiscal stance since Greece
joined the Euro area on January 1, 2001, as evident from the decline in the primary surplus
from 4 percent of GDP in 2000 to zero in 2004. This deterioration was masked by the
significant decline in debt service costs as interest rates fell, which limited the deterioration
in the overall general government deficit to just over 1 percent of GDP over this period, from
4.1 percent of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 5.3 percent in 2004.

-2Looking forward, the government has taken some measures to bring the deficit of the general
government down to below 3 percent of GDP in 2005. However, it is clear that achievement
of this target hinges crucially on sustaining the strong GDP growth of recent years. More
importantly, it is also clear that these measures are insufficient to achieve a sustainable fiscal
position over the medium term. With the fiscal audit now completed, the authorities are
therefore focusing on carefully elaborated, longer-term reforms, including privatization and
health care reform, to contain costs and raise revenue. They are fully aware of the need to
eventually tackle the pension problem, but have decided to give priority to structural reforms
with a more immediate payoff in terms of both expenditure reduction and growth.
The medium term fiscal strategy needs to be supported by reforms on both the expenditure
and revenue sides, and by improvements in budgetary management. To this effect, my
authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund on tax administration and
public expenditure management to help improve tax compliance and the efficiency of public
spending. They are in the process of considering the recommendations of the recent miniROSC mission (summarized in Box 4) and look forward to the full fiscal ROSC scheduled
for later this year.
Growth prospects are good but uncertain
As discussed in the staff report, Greece’s above-potential growth in recent years was boosted
by temporary factors, including Olympics spending, lax fiscal policy, and rapid credit growth
following interest rate convergence and Euro adoption in 2001. The authorities share with
staff the view that sustaining this growth momentum will be a challenging task. Nevertheless,
they are considerably more optimistic than staff regarding growth prospects, with key
differences relating to investment and the external sector. In particular:
1. The authorities expect private investment to take up much of the slack generated by the
end of Olympics spending. They expect a rebound in business investment in 2005-07 to be
supported by lower corporate taxes, new investment incentives, and an improvement in the
business climate through cuts in red tape and streamlined business regulation. Legislation on
Private-Public Partnerships under preparation also is expected to help promote private
investment in infrastructure, while efforts are under way to improve the absorption of EU
funds.
2. The erosion of international competitiveness is an issue of concern to the authorities.
Balassa-Samuelson effects do not fully account for the positive inflation differential between
Greece and the Euro area, as is evident from the growing current account deficit and loss of
market shares. Nevertheless, the successful completion of the Olympic games is expected to
boost tourism revenues, projected in the SGP to grow by 7.5 percent in real terms annually in
2005-07. Shipping revenues, which were very strong in recent years, also are expected to
boost export receipts. On the import side, investment-related imports are expected to decline
due to the completion of the Olympic games.
3. Based on the above arguments, the SGP projects GDP growth to remain at about 4 percent
a year in 2005-07, with fixed investment growth averaging 5.3 percent over this period. By

-3contrast, staff projects GDP growth to fall to about 3 percent annually in 2005-07, with fixed
investment growth averaging just 1.6 percent during this period (Table 5). The external
sector is expected to have a negligible impact on growth in the SGP, compared with a small
drag on growth in staff projections.
4. The differences in the growth assumptions underlying the two scenarios obviously have an
impact on the respective fiscal projections. Based on unchanged policies, the staff does not
expect the deficit to fall below 3 percent of GDP in 2005-06, while the SGP projects a sub-3
percent deficit in each of these years.
5. The authorities are fully aware of the downside risks to growth, as well as to higher oil
prices and interest rates than currently assumed in the baseline scenario. The SGP thus
includes an alternative scenario where GDP growth falls to 3.3 percent a year in 2005-07.
Under this scenario, the general government deficit remains above 3 percent of GDP in 2005
and only falls below that benchmark in 2006. Admittedly, the Greek and Euro area data flow
has been generally softer in recent weeks, including the disappointing EC economic
sentiment survey for December; at the same time, however, the oil bubble continues to
deflate. In our view, the correct way to read recent leading indicators is to temper, rather than
abandon, optimism about sustained high growth heading into 2005.
Structural reform is essential to sustain growth, reduce deficit
Supply-side reforms to improve efficiency are essential in raising potential growth and
reducing the external imbalance. The government’s structural reform agenda includes
measures to open up markets previously sheltered from competition from new entrants (even
if liberalized on paper, e.g. electricity) and to reduce the state’s involvement in the economy
and the distortion caused by having state-owned firms compete with private firms (e.g. air
transport). In particular, there is significant scope for privatization, deregulation and
restructuring to increase competition and reduce costs in sectors dominated by the public
sector (transport, telecoms, energy, defense, education and health). Reforms in these areas
can help achieve a leaner, more efficient economy and boost private investment.
Labor market reform has been very slow indeed. Steps in the wrong direction have been
taken in the past, including raising the cost of overtime pay in the hope of increasing hiring.
Increased labor participation is the key to increasing potential output (as happened in
Ireland), but also to improving the finances of the pension system. However, amending
employment protection legislation – especially in the public sector – or lowering entry-level
wages to encourage hiring are likely to meet strong resistance from labor unions. Current
reform plans therefore focus on increasing labor market flexibility by expanding part-time
and temporary employment opportunities, and by reducing the high cost of overtime pay
which impacts competitiveness.
The staff paper comparing Greece to Ireland provides a useful road map for future reform
efforts. However, there are powerful obstacles to reform in Greece. The legacy of state
intervention fuels political patronage and contributes to the dominance of interest group
politics. Interest groups include public sector unions opposing privatization on grounds that the

-4needed restructuring would entail a loss of jobs and benefits; and suppliers reaping
monopolistic profits when selling goods and services to the state. Additional impediments to
the implementation of reform are poor public administration, soft budget constraints on public
enterprises and entities, and limited consensus for privatization based on the belief – often
cultivated by special interest groups – that a sell-off in state assets is not in the national
interest. The above factors have constrained reform efforts, as compromises were
often made to preserve social cohesion or appease politically powerful groups. The room for
improvement is significant provided that political capital is wisely used.
The authorities are focusing on financial sector issues
Rapid credit growth following liberalization of consumer credit and interest rate convergence
in the run-up to EMU may tend to increase the banking sector’s risk exposure over time.
While stress tests confirm that Greek banks are adequately protected from market risk, credit
risk may rise further as the ratio of household debt to GDP catches up with the EU average.
As outlined by staff, the Bank of Greece has taken steps to address this concern by raising
specific provisions and capitalization levels. Moreover, comprehensive credit information on
each individual borrower is now available for loans contracted since June 2003.
Banks are currently well capitalized and profitable, and their risk management systems have
improved. However, an upcoming challenge for state-controlled banks is the need to include
large unfunded pension liabilities in their balance sheets under International Accounting
Standards that will enter into force at year-end. While these liabilities will be transferred to
the main pension fund, IKA, by 2008, the terms of this transfer have not been made clear and
it cannot be ruled out that a fiscal cost may be incurred. This issue will be discussed, inter
alia, by the upcoming FSAP mission requested by the authorities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Greece
On February 2, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Greece.1
Background
The several years of strong economic growth continued in 2004, buoyed by supportive
monetary conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance, and the Olympics. Rising incomes and a
falling, though still high, unemployment rate underpinned strong household consumption, while
increased profitability spurred investment spending, especially construction. However,
imbalances have emerged and many longstanding structural impediments persist. Inflation has
been above the euro-area average, eroding international competitiveness and export market
shares. This, and the cyclical divergence with the rest of Europe, has resulted in large current
account deficits and a negative contribution of the external sector to aggregate demand. On the
supply side, a number of impediments have led to poor labor-market performance,
while regulation and weak competitive forces weigh on product markets.
The fiscal position has deteriorated sharply. Following very large data revisions which
significantly raised recorded fiscal deficits for 1997-2003, the general government deficit is
expected to be some 5½ percent of GDP in 2004 and the primary surplus to fall to about zero;
there is a risk of a still worse outcome. The public debt, at about 112 percent of GDP in 2004,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2has fallen little in recent years. The 2005 budget aims for significant fiscal consolidation, with
the deficit falling by 2½ percent of GDP to (under the budget’s growth assumptions) 2.8 percent
of GDP. The end of Olympics spending is an important, and permanent, factor accounting for
1¼ percentage points of the improvement. The budget also contains temporary (tax amnesties
and the collection of arrears) and ad hoc (containment of pension and public-sector wage
increases) measures.
In 2005 and beyond, fundamentals point to slower growth and a gradual easing of inflationary
pressures. Although household consumption is expected to remain strong, the fiscal adjustment
planned for 2005 will dampen domestic demand, including investment, and the erosion of
competitiveness may limit the benefit from any pickup in growth in Europe. The key risks to the
outlook are external: sustained high oil prices and further rises in the value of the euro will
undercut growth, both in Greece and in its major trading partners.
In the long-term, population aging threatens fiscal sustainability. On current estimates, pension
and health-care costs will rise by more than in any other EU country between now and 2040,
while high public debt and the weak budget position leave little room for fiscal maneuver.
Regarding structural policy, the authorities, recognizing that Greece still lags significantly behind
the EU in real per capita income despite the economic boom, have announced substantial
reforms focused on improving product market performance.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that past reforms, notably financial market deregulation, interest rate declines
associated with euro adoption, and, more recently, stimulus from Olympics spending had all
contributed to strong growth of the Greek economy in the past several years. This economic
boom has been reflected in labor-market gains, with rising employment and a decline in the
unemployment rate.
However, Directors also noted that widening economic imbalances threaten future growth
prospects. The public finances have deteriorated sharply—only in part because of the
Olympics—and the high debt-GDP ratio has fallen very little, with recent data revisions
revealing that the fiscal position is much worse than earlier thought. Deteriorating
competitiveness, due to sustained inflation differentials with the rest of the euro area, and strong
domestic demand are reflected in poor export performance and a large current account deficit.
Against this backdrop, Directors agreed that the key priorities for the Greek authorities are a
strong and sustained fiscal consolidation effort along with further improvements in fiscal
transparency, and structural reforms to put in place the conditions for sustained increases in
output and living standards.
Regarding the revisions to the fiscal data, Directors welcomed the initiative by the new
government to launch a fiscal audit immediately upon taking office. They regretted the
significant past understatements of the deficit and public debt. Directors noted that the lack of
accurate data has hindered surveillance and emphasized that complete, timely, and accurate
fiscal data are essential for sound policy making. They supported the ongoing efforts of the
authorities, working with Eurostat, to improve reporting, and the decision to compile financingside fiscal data beginning in 2005. They urged the authorities to implement further reforms to

-3bolster credibility and ensure the integrity of the data. This should include improving the
independence and effectiveness of auditing, ensuring the independence of the statistical
agency, developing a more comprehensive budget, closing special treasury accounts,
and implementing a mid-year budget report. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to
undertake a full assessment of fiscal policy transparency in 2005. All these actions are essential
to preserve the government’s credibility and the confidence of investors, which in turn are
essential for long-term growth.
Directors stressed that the first priority of economic policy is to restore the health of the public
finances. They welcomed the appreciable adjustment aimed for in the 2005 budget, given the
large fiscal deficit, high debt level, and the requirements of the Maastricht treaty. Directors felt,
however, that greater reliance on permanent measures would have been preferable, and many
expressed concern that the deficit targeted in the budget might be difficult to achieve, given the
optimistic growth assumptions. Looking forward, Directors stressed that further durable
adjustment measures will be needed to cut the deficit and reduce the public debt, especially in
view of the large anticipated costs of population aging. They supported the authorities’
intentions to introduce further tax reforms, but stressed that the fiscal costs of such initiatives
would have to be offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. Directors urged the authorities to
make strong and sustained efforts to contain current primary spending growth with a view to
achieving budget balance over the medium term.
Directors agreed that fiscal adjustment will require restraint, prioritization, and strengthened
expenditure management. They pointed in particular to the potential for containing the public
sector wage bill, cutting government loan guarantees, stronger controls on health care, and a
review of defense outlays. Directors urged the authorities to move expeditiously on
implementing proposals to reform the health care sector and public procurement. To reinforce
the process of fiscal adjustment, Directors recommended that the authorities develop an explicit
medium-term budget framework laying out a consistent and realistic set of economic
assumptions, deficit objectives, expenditure ceilings, and specific policy measures.
They supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance on tax administration and
public expenditure management.
Directors noted that population aging poses a key long-term threat to the public finances.
Since pressures are expected to begin to be felt during the next decade, they expressed
disappointment that pension reform is not part of the government’s immediate priorities.
Directors stressed the importance of early pension reforms and urged the authorities, as a
minimum, to begin as soon as possible the public debate needed to develop a social consensus
for change, including by laying out the cost of unduly delaying the reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ actions to ensure a robust banking system, including the
strengthening of the Bank of Greece’s supervisory capacity. Noting the risks from the rapid
increase in private sector credit growth should the economic climate take a turn for the worse,
Directors encouraged the authorities to monitor the situation closely and take prompt corrective
action as needed. In light of weaknesses in the insurance sector, Directors welcomed the
decision to establish an independent insurance supervisor. They looked forward to Greece’s
participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) planned for this year.

-4Directors stressed the need to address structural weaknesses to promote sustained increases
in output and living standards in the years ahead. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to
improve the business climate, including through tax simplification, improved tax administration,
further privatization, and bolstering product market competition, and urged that the relevant
measures be put in place as soon as possible. It will also be important to simplify judicial
procedures, including those related to bankruptcy. Directors supported the authorities’ intention
to continue infrastructure spending, but stressed that public-private partnership arrangements
should be accompanied by a full accounting of explicit and implicit government liabilities,
transparent project selection and evaluation, and appropriate risk transfer to the private-sector
partners.
Directors emphasized that faster progress is needed on labor market reform, and they urged the
authorities to make strong efforts to build the necessary consensus for moving forward in this
area. Enhanced labor market performance should be achieved through easing strict
employment protection measures, extending part-time and temporary employment
opportunities, improving education and training, and ensuring that wage settlements are in line
with productivity and euro area inflation objectives.
