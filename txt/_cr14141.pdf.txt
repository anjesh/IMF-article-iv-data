STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 2, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Colombia’s economic performance has been robust, underpinned by a very
strong policy framework. Last year, real GDP grew by 4.3 percent, with low inflation. The
country has a strong external position; the financial system is sound; and fiscal policy
remains guided by a structural fiscal balance rule. The authorities intend to undertake an
ambitious infrastructure program to be executed through public-private partnerships.
Outlook and risks. Real GDP growth is projected to converge to potential (about
4½ percent) in 2014, with inflation remaining within the 2–4 percent target range. The
medium-term outlook is favorable, but risks are tilted to the downside. Colombia’s
important and growing ties with the global economy expose the economy to external
risks. The most important sources of risk are a decline in oil prices, a deterioration in
global financial conditions, and volatility from the normalization of monetary policy in
the U.S.
Near-term policy mix. The current policy mix is broadly adequate. As the ongoing
economic recovery takes hold, monetary and fiscal policies are expected to shift to a
more neutral stance. Colombia continues to rely on a flexible exchange rate to absorb
external shocks. The authorities are also taking advantage of abundant foreign inflows,
primarily foreign direct investment, to strengthen their international reserve buffer.
Medium-term challenges. Colombia’s key challenge is to sustain strong and inclusive
growth with macroeconomic stability. To this purpose, it will be important to: (i) adhere
to the fiscal consolidation plan, supporting it with revenue mobilization; (ii) address the
infrastructure gap, without increasing fiscal risks; (iii) enhance the social security system
by increasing coverage and improving equity, and containing health care costs;
(iv) address remaining weaknesses in financial sector supervision; and (v) foster financial
inclusion.

COLOMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Colombia has maintained a robust economic performance in recent years. A strong
policy framework—anchored by an inflation-targeting regime, a flexible exchange rate, a structural
fiscal balance rule, and effective financial supervision and regulation—has allowed the authorities to
respond adequately to shocks and pursue effective demand management. As a result, real GDP
grew at a pace of 4 percent and annual inflation averaged 2.7 percent in the last five years. The
authorities have continued to improve the policy framework in recent years, by including a fiscal
sustainability principle in the constitution; introducing a structural fiscal balance rule; overhauling
the oil and mining royalties system; and implementing a comprehensive tax reform that replaced
payroll taxes with a corporate income tax.
2.
The economy has important and growing ties with the global economy. Trade is rising,
driven by commodity exports, and the economy is receiving substantial foreign direct investment. At
the same time, Colombian firms are expanding abroad, primarily across Central and South America.
The corporate sector borrows significant amounts from international banks, and the sovereign and a
number of large firms have fluid access to the international capital markets. The participation of
nonresidents in the domestic equity and government bond markets is rising. As a result, Colombia’s
economy is increasingly sensitive to global economic and financial developments. In June 2013, the
IMF’s Executive Board approved a new two-year Flexible Credit Line (FCL) for SDR 3.87 billion (about
US$6 billion, or 500 percent of quota), which provides Colombia protection against external tail risks.
3.
Colombia will hold presidential elections in late May and the authorities are
negotiating a peace agreement to end the country’s long armed conflict. President Juan
Manuel Santos (in office since 2010) is running for a second term. The next president will be
inaugurated in August. On March 9, 2014, Colombia held congressional elections, in which the ruling
coalition maintained a working majority in Congress, although the opposition increased its
representation. In October 2012, the authorities began peace talks with the main guerrilla group, the
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). As of March 2014, agreement has been reached on
two of the five topics under discussion.
4.
Exchange regime and economic data. Colombia has a floating exchange rate regime (de
jure and de facto). Colombia maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector (see IMF Country Report
13/35 for details). Data provision is adequate for surveillance.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Real GDP growth rebounded strongly in the second half of 2013. After slowing down to
2.9 percent y/y in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013, growth accelerated to
5.2 percent y/y in the second half of 2013, driven by higher public investment and a solid expansion
in private consumption. On the supply side, output growth was broad-based, with strong gains in

4

COLOMBIA

construction and agriculture, with the only exception of manufacturing production, which fell by
1.2 percent. Overall, real GDP growth in 2013 as a whole averaged 4.3 percent, up from 4 percent in
2012. In turn, employment rose strongly, particularly in the formal sector of the economy, and
unemployment declined to 9.7 percent in 2013, the lowest mark in the last decade.
6.
Inflation was subdued. Headline inflation fell to 1.9 percent y/y at end-2013, slightly below
the 2‒4 percent target range, down from 2.4 percent at end-2012. Core inflation was also subdued
at 2.4 percent y/y. A high supply of perishable foods (thanks to favorable weather conditions), stable
fuel prices, and one-off price reductions arising from the implementation of the tax reform
contributed to the benign inflation behavior of last year. As of March 2014, headline inflation rose to
2.5 percent y/y, and core inflation increased to 2.6 percent. Twelve-month inflation expectations
stood at 3 percent, close to the mid-point of the target range.
7.
The current account deficit remained broadly stable. The current account deficit
amounted to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013, up from 3.2 percent in 2012. The trade surplus narrowed
as a result of lower exports, but was almost fully offset by a smaller deficit in the income account.
The current account deficit continued to be financed by sizable surplus in the financial account
(5 percent of GDP), largely driven by inward foreign direct investment (4.4 percent of GDP). Portfolio
inflows by nonresidents remained firm. Colombia maintained fluid access to the international capital
markets, with Ecopetrol and the government issuing long-term bonds in the last quarter of 2013
and early 2014, respectively. The central bank took advantage of the continued surplus in the capital
account to strengthen its international reserves, which rose to US$43.2 billion. The net international
investment position (NIIP) was broadly unchanged at 27 percent of GDP, with a high share of
foreign direct investment (FDI) in total liabilities. The total external debt remained broadly stable at
24 percent of GDP. Both NIIP and external debt are relatively low compared to peer countries and
have remained so for several years.1
8.
The exchange rate depreciated and government bond prices fell after the U.S. Federal
Reserve tapering talk began in May 2013. The exchange rate depreciated by about 7 percent
from May 22, 2013 to April 4, 2014, and foreign exchange market volatility increased (Box 1). Yields
on 10-year domestic government debt initially rose by over 200 basis points (one of the largest
increases among emerging markets), but later recovered some of the losses as markets began to
differentiate between countries with strong economies such as Colombia. As of April 4, 2014, yields
on 10-year domestic government debt had fallen to 130 basis points over the pre-May 22 level.
Spreads on external government debt also increased.
9.
Fiscal performance was in line with the fiscal rule. Staff estimates that the central
government’s fiscal deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP in 2013, in line with the fiscal rule. The combined
public sector balance is estimated to have slipped into a deficit of 1 percent of GDP, from a surplus
of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2012, mainly due to deferred spending by local governments stemming
1

Consultation.”

from a lag in transfers of oil revenues. The public sector debt is estimated at 35.2 percent of GDP at
end-2013.
10.
The banking system remained stable. Financial soundness indicators remained strong,
with low and well-provisioned non-performing loans, strong profitability, and adequate liquidity.
New capital requirements became effective in August 2013, significantly enhancing the quality of
banks’ capital. Growth in credit to private sector slowed to 12 percent y/y at end-2013, from
16 percent at end-2012, and was financed largely through an expansion in domestic deposits.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.

Colombia’s economic outlook is favorable.



Growth is projected to remain robust. With the output gap nearly closed as of end-2013, real
GDP is projected to grow at around potential, estimated at 4½ percent, in 2014 and beyond.
Growth is projected to be driven by the private sector, supported by a steady increase in
investment largely financed by higher domestic savings (Box 2).



Inflation is expected to stay within the (2‒4 percent) target range. In 2014, inflation is
projected to rise gradually, as the temporary factors that held it down in 2013 filter out. Given
well-anchored inflation expectations, inflation is expected to remain well within the target range
throughout the forecast period.



The balance of payments would remain in surplus. The current account deficit is projected to
remain at about 3 percent of GDP in the medium term, with the deficit in the income balance
(resulting from profit remittances and external interest payments) continuing to exceed the
trade surplus. The deficit in the current account is expected to be more than financed by capital
inflows, especially foreign direct investment.



The near-term fiscal outlook is in line with the fiscal rule. The 2014 budget envisages a
central government deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP, down from 2.4 percent in 2013, and in line
with the fiscal rule. The deficit of the combined public sector is projected to decline slightly to
0.9 percent of GDP, from 1 percent in 2013.



The fiscal deficit and public debt are projected to decline over the medium term. Staff
projects the deficit of the central government to decline to 1.9 percent of GDP by 2019,
following the authorities’ fiscal rule, and the combined public sector deficit to reach 0.6 percent
of GDP. As a result, the public sector debt would fall to 29 percent of GDP by 2019, from
35 percent at end-2013.



The financial system is expected to continue deepening. Credit and assets under
management by pension and other investment funds are poised to continue growing as a share
of GDP. The participation of nonresidents in both the local government debt market and the
equity market is also projected to rise, driven by the recent increase in Colombia’s weight in

However, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. As a result of its important
linkages with the rest of the world, the Colombian economy is significantly exposed to external risks.
Furthermore, the risks associated with emerging markets and geopolitical tensions have increased
since the last Article IV consultation. External risks include a sharp decline in commodity prices,
especially oil; a deterioration in global financial conditions, including a surge in global financial
market volatility related to the normalization of financial conditions in the U.S.; and negative growth
shocks in key trading partners. If any of these global shocks materialize, they would slow Colombia’s
growth, reducing export and fiscal revenues, curtailing foreign direct investment, cutting foreign
credit lines, increasing the burden of debt service, and putting pressure on the exchange rate and
local asset prices.


A decline in oil prices would cut export receipts (oil exports account for more than one half of
total exports), reduce fiscal revenues (oil-related revenues amount to about 4½ percent of GDP
and 16 percent of total government revenue), and adversely affect economic activity. It could
also reduce foreign direct investment (since a significant share of it goes to the oil sector), with a
further negative impact on the external accounts. According to staff estimates, a US$10 drop in
the price of oil would reduce exports by about US$3.3 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) and fiscal
revenue by about 0.4 percent of GDP. In addition, a VAR model estimated by staff suggests that
the same shock would cut real GDP growth by ½ of a percentage point on a cumulative basis
after six months after the shock.



A rise in U.S. interest rates could negatively impact Colombia, if not accompanied by a
corresponding increase in U.S. growth (e.g., in the event of an increase in the term premium
driven by a surge in U.S. inflation expectations) or if it led to higher global risk aversion and
capital outflows and weaker growth in emerging markets. In turn, financial volatility in emerging

Since 2011, Chile, Colombia and Peru integrated the operations of their stock markets, creating MILA (“Integrated
Latin American Market”), with the aim of providing companies and investors greater access to each of the three
individual capital markets. MILA has become Latin America’s second largest stock market after Brazil, and could
become the largest if ongoing plans to integrate Mexico’s stock market into MILA materialize.

markets could also trigger dislocations in the domestic capital market and a sharp decline in the
value of domestic financial assets, with negative implications for the real economy (Box 3).


Deterioration in global financial conditions could also reduce external bank credit lines and
portfolio flows, negatively affecting the external accounts and economic activity. Data from the
Bank of International Settlements (BIS) shows that claims of international banks on Colombian
borrowers amounted to US$47 billion (12 percent of GDP) as of September 2013, largely on
account of corporate borrowers. A simulation exercise developed by staff3 suggests that lending
from international banks (including those operating in Colombia) to Colombian borrowers could
decline by up to 6.6 percent of GDP in the event of a sizable shock to the balance sheets of
international banks.



A negative growth shock in key trading partners would reduce the demand for Colombian
exports, weakening economic growth. A multi-country vector autoregressive (VAR) model
estimated by staff suggests that a 1 percentage point slowdown (vis-à-vis baseline projections)
in real GDP growth of China, the Euro area, and the U.S. could reduce real GDP growth in
Colombia by 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively. The exercise also pointed to a
significant adverse growth impact in the event of a slowdown in the growth pace of regional
trade partners, with whom the bulk of Colombia’s manufacturing trade takes place (¶13).

13.
Shocks in the region could also be a source of negative spillovers to Colombia. Shocks
in the region could affect Colombia through trade and financial channels. Colombian exports to
Latin America account for about a quarter of total exports and the bulk of manufacturing exports.
The Latin American trade partners are in turn exposed to shocks to the global economy, in particular
in the U.S. and China. A multi-country VAR model estimated by staff suggests that a combined
1 percentage point slowdown (vis-à-vis baseline projections) in real GDP growth of Colombia’s main
trading partners in the region could reduce Colombia’s real GDP growth by about ½ of a
percentage point. The main risks are comprised of an increase in restrictions to trade with Ecuador
(which has become Colombia’s main market for manufacturing products), an intensification of
economic stress in Venezuela (which despite the significant reduction in trade since 2009 remains an
important market for Colombian goods), and a growth slowdown in Central America (which has
become an important trade partner in recent years). On the financial side, the main sources of risk
are a shock in Central America affecting the balance sheets of Colombian banks (which have
become prominent players in the Central American banking system, ¶35), or possible financial
contagion arising from an increase in investors’ perception of regional risk in response to adverse
political or economic developments in one or more countries of the region.
14.
On the domestic front, the main risks relate to high growth of house prices and
consumer credit, as well as contingent liabilities from public-private partnerships (PPPs).
House prices rose significantly in recent years, fuelled by a robust expansion of income and credit

growth and government subsidies. If prices were to fall, banks’ non-performing loans could increase.
However, the risk is mitigated by low households’ loan-to-value ratios (about 55 percent), fixed
borrowing rates, and a low exposure of banks to mortgage loans. High growth in credit to the
private sector, including consumer loans, has been a concern in recent years (IMF Country Report
13/35), but has been abating (¶32). On the fiscal front, one source of risk is that road concessions or
other infrastructure projects lead to unforeseen public sector liabilities. This risk, however, is
mitigated by a revamped legal framework for PPPs, approved in 2012.
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of risks. Their
forecasts for the main macroeconomic variables are broadly in line with staff’s projections. In
relation to risks, the authorities highlighted Colombia’s exposure to external shocks, expressing
particular concern about the pace and implementation of monetary policy normalization in the U.S.
and its possible effects on global financial markets and economic growth in emerging markets. They
also underlined the risks of a slowdown in China, with possible adverse implications for oil prices,
and agreed with staff that shocks in the region could have a significant impact on Colombia.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize
jointly.

16.
Possible outward spillovers from Colombia are estimated to be limited. The main
channel through which shocks in Colombia could transmit to other countries is through the financial
sector via cross-border bank lending and foreign direct investment links. In the event of a shock in
the Colombian banking system, this channel could be significant for some Central American
countries (in particular El Salvador and Panama), where Colombian banks have gained a significant
share of the market. Shocks in Colombia could also transmit through the trade channel. However,
Colombia’s share in total trade of individual trading partners is modest, suggesting that the
potential for real spillovers to other countries in the region is small.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the appropriate macroeconomic policy stance for 2014; policies to
maintain fiscal, external, and financial sector stability; reforms to enhance the social
security system; and actions to foster inclusive growth.

A. Near-Term Policy Stance
17.
Economic policies supported growth in 2013. Staff and the authorities agreed that the
central bank’s decision to hold the policy interest rate at 3.25 percent from April 2013 to April 2014
was appropriate in light of soft growth during the first half of the year, a negative output gap, and
inflation at or below the lower bound of the target range throughout the year. The reallocation of
central government spending to provide targeted stimulus (e.g., through mortgage interest
subsidies) and the use of royalties for investment spending by sub-national governments also
supported growth. These policies helped economic activity rebound strongly during the second half
of the year.
18.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to move to a more neutral stance for demand
policies as the recovery takes hold. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to adjust the
policy rate as necessary as conditions warrant to keep inflation within the target range.4 They
indicated that fiscal policy would remain guided by the fiscal rule. With the latter mandating a slight
improvement in the central government’s structural balance, the fiscal policy stance is expected to
be broadly neutral in 2014.
19.
The authorities indicated that the flexible exchange rate would continue to serve as a
shock absorber. Staff and the authorities agreed that the flexible exchange rate regime plays an
important role in helping the economy adapt to shifts in global economic and financial conditions.
The authorities noted that, after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its intention to commence
tapering, the exchange rate weakened significantly. At the same time, the central bank continued
acquiring foreign exchange (with the intention of strengthening its international reserve buffer, ¶30),

4

10

though at a slower pace. The authorities noted that the exchange rate adjustment did not lead to
any important effects on balance sheets or inflation.

B. Preserving Fiscal Sustainability
20.
The authorities reaffirmed their strong commitment to fiscal consolidation. Under the
fiscal rule, the central government’s structural deficit is set to decline to 1 percent of GDP by 2022,
from an estimated deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2013. In turn, the combined public sector balance
is projected to shift into a small surplus, from an estimated deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2013. This
improvement in the fiscal balance would allow the public debt-to-GDP ratio to fall to 29 percent of
GDP by 2019 from 35 percent at end-2013. Staff cautioned that the long-term oil price assumed in
computing the structural balance may be too optimistic. If the long-term oil price is lower, reflecting
market projections for a substantial decline over the medium-term, a larger fiscal adjustment would
be required to meet the fiscal rule. The authorities responded that their assumption for oil
production is conservative and the overall oil revenue projection over the medium-term is well
balanced. Staff and the authorities concurred that the fiscal targets are prudent and appropriate on
account of uncertainties related to oil revenues over the medium term, absent large new discoveries
of oil reserves. In addition, the improvement in the non-resource primary balance projected in
Colombia’s medium term fiscal framework (1.9 percentage points of GDP by 2024) will allow a larger
share of Colombia’s natural resource wealth to be transferred to future generations (Box 4).5
21.
Staff noted that achieving the medium-term fiscal consolidation goals would be
challenging. The targeted reduction in the central government’s deficit of 1.4 percentage points of
GDP by 2022 will confront challenges both on the revenue and the expenditure sides. Fiscal
revenues are expected to fall by up to 2.1 percentage points of GDP during the period, stemming
from the planned phasing-out of the financial transactions tax (0.8 percent of GDP), the expiration of
the wealth tax (0.4 percent of GDP), and a projected decline in oil revenues (0.9 percent of GDP). To
attain the fiscal consolidation targets, the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework requires a
significant decline in expenditure. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to seek efficiency gains
in current expenditure. At the same time, it noted that expenditure pressures may arise from
developmental needs (e.g., infrastructure investment), social security, and any possible outlays
related to a peace agreement. The authorities agreed that adhering to the fiscal plan would require
exceptional discipline, but they expressed confidence that the targets would be met given broad
consensus for the fiscal rule.
22.
In this context, revenue mobilization will be key to accommodating expenditure needs
while abiding by the fiscal consolidation path set out by the fiscal rule. Staff noted that noncommodity revenues in Colombia are low by international standards and should be the focus of
mobilization efforts. At the same time, the mission supported the planned elimination of the
financial transactions tax, given its distortionary effects. To enhance revenue, staff encouraged the

authorities to broaden the tax base by lowering exemptions and fighting informality. Other options
could include extending the wealth tax, taxing dividends, or increasing the value added tax rate.
Staff highlighted that particular focus should be given to strengthening tax administration, by
improving information technology, standardizing certification of accountants, and tightening
sanctions for non-compliance. The authorities indicated that they would step up efforts to
strengthen tax administration, including by implementing IMF technical assistance
recommendations.
23.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ infrastructure program. Staff and the authorities agreed
that the infrastructure program is essential for Colombia’s sustained economic development. While
infrastructure investment has been substantial in the past, its efficiency has been subpar, resulting in
an inadequate road infrastructure. In 2013, Colombia ranked 126 out of 144 countries according to
the Global Competitiveness report on the quality of transport infrastructure. The mission
acknowledged that Colombia’s road infrastructure deficit is a drag on competitiveness and growth,
and supported the authorities’ infrastructure program, including the fourth generation of road
concessions (4G). The authorities indicated that the 4G would include projects valued at
COP 47 trillion (about 7 percent of GDP) to be undertaken over the next 7 years through publicprivate partnerships (PPPs) under a revamped legal framework approved in 2012. The authorities
expect the bidding process for the first 9 projects (for COP 11 trillion or about US$5 billion) to be
completed in 2014, with construction set to begin in 2015. To support these projects, the authorities
created a national financial institution, Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional (FDN), in charge of
mobilizing long-term financing to infrastructure, primarily by developing standardized financing
structures suitable for local institutional investors (banks and pension funds). FDN started its
operations with a small initial capital (about US$230 million) provided by the government, and is
expected to receive capital injections by multilateral institutions, such as the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and the Andean Development Corporation. FDN is governed by a 7-member
Executive Board, of which some are independent. The authorities are also planning to create a
development fund with the proceeds of the sale of power company Isagen, which would be used to
support infrastructure investment. Staff welcomed these initiatives.

The authorities are taking actions to
minimize fiscal risks from PPPs. Colombia’s
government has a long history of inviting
private sector participation in infrastructure and
public services. Colombia was the first country
to implement PPPs in the region and is the one
with the largest share of projects financed
through this arrangement. However, past
experience with PPPs in Colombia has pointed
to a high risk of contract renegotiations and the
low effectiveness of contract monitoring. The
authorities indicated that planned outlays for
service and recuperation of costs after projects

COLOMBIA

are completed (to be reflected as investment in the fiscal accounts) would not exceed the fiscal
space available under the fiscal rule and would be limited to 0.4 percent of GDP per year. The
outlays would be incorporated into the overall available capital expenditure envelope in the
medium-term fiscal framework. To minimize any fiscal risks that could come on top of the outlays
committed to the program, the authorities have added precautions by standardizing PPP contracts,
supported by World Bank, IADB and IFC technical assistance. With regards to accounting and
reporting practices, the mission encouraged the authorities to accelerate migration to accrual
accounting under GFSM 2001, so that the budget implications of PPPs are better reflected. The
authorities indicated that the adoption of GFSM 2001 is currently in progress, and that contingent
liabilities would continue to be reported in the medium-term fiscal framework.

C. Enhancing the Social Security System
25.
Colombia’s pension system is fiscally sustainable but characterized by low coverage
and high inequality. The share of the population receiving a pension in Colombia is low, especially
among the poor, due to high informality.

covered. Also, the statutory retirement age, particularly for women, is low. Outlays by the public
pension regime are projected at about 4 percent of GDP in the coming years, but are projected to
decline to 3 percent of GDP by 2050.
26.
The authorities expressed their intent to broaden the coverage of the pension system
and make it more equitable. The mission welcomed the initiative and advised the authorities to
consider creating space for expanded coverage by changing the benefit formula to reduce
replacement rates for new retirees, equalizing retirement ages for men and women, and adjusting
the retirement age in line with increases in life expectancy as part of the reform package. The
implementation of recently-reinforced social security programs, including Beneficios Económicos
Periódicos, Pensión Familiar, and Cotización por Semanas, is expected to foster savings and assist
the population that does not qualify for a pension, without incentivizing informality. Staff also
welcomed the authorities’ intention to extend a non-contributory program for the elderly poor to
cover the full amount of the eligible population (about 2.4 million), which would have a fiscal cost of
0.1 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

COLOMBIA

27.
Colombia’s health system has high coverage, but faces financial challenges. In contrast
to the pension system, Colombia’s health care system has nearly universal coverage, but cost control
has been undermined by the system’s complexity, high administrative costs and constitutional
entitlements that have led to legal claims for expensive treatments. Public health spending, currently
at over 7 percent of GDP, is expected to rise by about 1½ percentage points of GDP over the long
term without any reforms, reflecting income growth, demographics and technological change. The
authorities explained that a new statutory law, approved in June 2013, should reduce legal claims for
expensive treatments, although this legislation is currently under review by the Constitutional Court.
The mission encouraged the authorities to move forward with cost containment measures that can
be implemented within the existing framework, in particular in the area of pharmaceutical prices,
and to make efforts to clear arrears with hospitals.

D. Preserving External Stability
28.
Staff and the authorities concurred that the current account deficit and the real
exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals. According to the CGER external stability
approach and the External Balance Assessment (EBA), the real exchange rate in 2013 was about 8 to
13 percent overvalued, respectively. However, staff estimates that the significant depreciation of the
peso in real effective terms of the last few months has reduced the estimated misalignment. Staff’s
analysis based on the EBA methodology but adjusting for extremely conservative oil reserves
assumptions suggests that the cyclically-adjusted current account deficit in 2013 (2.7 percent of
GDP) was about 1 percent of GDP larger than its norm.6 However, accounting for profit remittances
by foreign companies, which are not well captured in the EBA, would reduce this gap. Overall, the
mission and the authorities agreed that Colombia’s external position is strong, noting that the
financing of the current account deficit largely through foreign direct investment, a relatively more
stable source of financing, mitigates risks.
29.
The exchange rate does not appear to have been an important driver of
manufacturing sector weakness. Manufacturing output fell in the past two years, underperforming
the rest of the economy. Some observers attributed the weak performance of the manufacturing
sector to the real exchange rate appreciation of recent years. Analytical work conducted by staff
based on firm-level data found no strong evidence that the exchange rate has negatively affected
the manufacturing sector, especially given that the real appreciation of the peso vis-à-vis the

6

The EBA methodology estimated the current account norm in 2013 at+3.2 percent of GDP, compared to
‐2.6 percent of GDP in 2012. This pronounced change in the estimated norm was largely due to the introduction of
oil wealth (as measured by proven oil reserves) as a new variable in the model. The estimate relied on a conservative
assumption of Colombia’s oil wealth. However, the Colombian authorities and the oil industry at large (including
foreign multinational companies) share the view that the country’s oil resources are substantially larger than
indicated by the proven reserves measure. This is further supported by a high ratio of potential oil reserves to proven
reserves. In addition, the substantial foreign investment of recent years and the incorporation of new technologies
have allowed the industry to attain a high reserve replacement rate (of about 170 percent for Ecopetrol in the last
5 years), with the trend likely to continue. Using these higher oil wealth assumptions leads to a much lower estimate
of the current account norm.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

currencies of Colombia’s manufacturing trade partners appears to have been more limited than the
overall real appreciation (Box 5).7
30.
International reserves appear adequate for precautionary purposes. Staff and the
authorities concurred that Colombia has an adequate reserve buffer for normal times, though they
might be insufficient to cope with tail risks (Box 6). The current stock of international reserves covers
approximately 7 months of imports and over 100 percent of the short-term external debt
amortizations and the projected current account deficit. Nonetheless, reserves measured relative to
broad money, short-term external debt plus the current account deficit, and months of imports are
still below the ratios prevailing prior to the global financial crisis of 2008–09. The authorities
reiterated their intention to continue strengthening their international reserve position with the aim
of returning to the pre-crisis reserve ratios, which proved to be an important buffer in confronting
that large external shock. Staff and authorities concurred that the opportunity cost of accumulating
reserves increases as they reach higher levels and that a careful cost-benefit-analysis is warranted.
31.
The authorities are increasing their reserve buffers through foreign exchange
purchases during periods of abundant external inflows. The authorities executed this policy by
pre-announcing a minimum reserve accumulation amount (US$3 billion between February and May,
2013, with a minimum daily purchase). At the end of May, the authorities reduced the size of the
reserve accumulation program to US$2.5 billion for June to September, and removed the minimum
daily purchase. After significant depreciation of the peso, the authorities in October further slowed
the pace and set a quarterly reserve accumulation ceiling (as opposed to a floor) of US$1 billion. In
the first quarter of 2014, the authorities maintained the quarterly US$1 billion ceiling, but bought
only US$0.7 billion. Staff agreed that the implementation of the foreign exchange purchase program
has been prudent and did not undermine exchange rate flexibility or the inflation-targeting regime,
as reflected by significant exchange rate variability and well-anchored inflation expectations. In the
past, the authorities have modified the foreign exchange intervention policy as necessary to
preserve the credibility of the inflation-targeting regime, and are committed to continue doing it in
the future.

E. Maintaining Financial Stability
32.
Colombia has a broad financial system, dominated by complex conglomerates. The
total assets of the financial system amounted to COP 963 trillion (143 percent of GDP) as of end2013, with credit institutions (mainly banks) holding 44 percent of the system’s assets or 62 percent
of GDP, followed by trust companies (29 percent of the assets or 40 percent of GDP) and pension
funds (16 percent of the assets or 22 percent of GDP). A small number of domestic conglomerates
own a large share of the system’s assets.

7

See the accompanying 2014 Selected Issues Paper—“Recent Performance of Colombia’s Manufacturing Sector:
Exchange Rate or Structural?”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

COLOMBIA

33.
Financial intermediation continued to deepen, with credit to the private sector
reaching 39.2 percent of GDP in 2013. In response to stronger consumer loan provisioning since
mid-2012, growth in credit to the private sector continued to slow to 12.1 percent at end-2013, from
over 20 percent in mid-2011. At end-2013, the credit portfolio was largely made up of commercial
loans (24 percent of GDP) and consumer loans (11 percent of GDP), while the share of mortgages
(3½ percent of GDP) and microcredit (1 percent of GDP) remained small, albeit growing. The
domestic capital market continued to deepen and expand its product offerings, but remained
dominated by government debt (Box 7).
34.
The financial system appears sound. The financial sector has been stable, supported by
favorable macroeconomic conditions. Financial soundness indicators remain robust (Table 7). In
2013, liquidity ratios were stable, profitability remained high (albeit somewhat lower than in 2012),
and asset quality continued to be strong, with non-performing loans at 2.8 percent of total loans
and high levels of provisions. The system’s risk-weighted capitalization ratio fell to 15 percent as of
February 2014,8 from 18 percent at end-2012, due to the introduction of an improved capital
adequacy standard that focused more on loss-absorbing types of capital. Staff welcomed the
introduction of an improved quality of capital measure.9
35.
While asset quality is strong, the system remains exposed to concentration risk.
Commercial loans to the largest 1,000 borrowers stood at 42 percent of total in 2013, a fifth of
which went to the manufacturing sector, followed by commerce and construction. Concentration of
lending continues to expose banks to corporate credit risk. While regulatory limits to individual
exposure exist, exceptions remain. Staff recommended the authorities to remove exceptions to large
exposure limits and further simplify the number of separate limits in place, and require banks to
hold more capital to reflect concentration risk in line with enhanced supervisory expectations. Staff
and the authorities agreed that fostering financial inclusion (see ¶38, Box 9)10 would contribute to
easing banks’ exposure to concentration risk.
36.
The supervisory framework is broadly effective, though there is scope for further
improvement in some areas. The strength of the supervisory framework relies on a unified
approach to supervision which mitigates the scope for regulatory arbitrage. The SFC exercises
effective oversight of the banking system and is strengthening supervision further to fully
implement a comprehensive risk management framework, including for conglomerates. It enforces a
robust framework for assessment of credit risk and asset classification and provisioning, and ensures
8

The issuance of equity shares by a large bank in March is likely to have boosted the system’s capitalization ratio
further.
9

The new requirements include a higher minimum of 4.5 percent for Tier 1 capital that now excludes newly
generated goodwill; the recognition of voluntary reserves as part of Tier 2 capital up to 10 percent of total regulatory
capital; and a deduction of deferred tax assets and pension liabilities from regulatory capital. See the accompanying
2014 Selected Issues Papers—“Selected Financial Sector Issues.”

COLOMBIA

that banks adopt prudent management of market, liquidity and operational risks. The new capital
regime represents an important step forward from the outgoing capital adequacy rules. IFRS
implementation is on track and is expected to be fully applied by January 2015. The Financial
Superintendence (SFC) received technical assistance from the Toronto Center on supervisory
practice, including risk-based supervision. Staff and the authorities agreed that the SFC should be
provided full supervisory powers over holding companies of financial institutions to broaden the
scope of consolidated prudential requirements and resolution of conglomerates, and that capital
ratios and buffers of banks that are part of financial and mixed groups should reflect their intragroup activities and future risks. This would mitigate the risks on regulated entities from the larger
conglomerate structures they are part of. The authorities were receptive to staff’s advice to consider
implementing stress tests also on tail risks and consulting with the market over proposals in tackling
the too-important-to-fail problem of systemically important banks and conglomerates. Staff and the
authorities agreed that, going forward, it will be important to continue implementing risk-based
supervisory enhancements to enable the supervisor to tailor prudential norms to the risk profile of
institutions (especially systemic banks and conglomerates). Staff reiterated that a key priority
remains enhancing the independence and legal protection of supervisory staff with regard to the
execution of their duties. Authorities agreed and are looking into ways to provide legal protection to
supervisors.
37.
The expansion of the largest financial institutions across the region poses additional
challenges for supervision. The retreat of some international banks from Central America opened
up new opportunities for Colombian banks. Colombia’s largest banking groups expanded rapidly
across the region in recent years, as part of their strategy of market diversification. Operations of
large Colombian bank conglomerates represent over half of banking system assets in El Salvador
and over 20 percent in Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.11 In turn, the acquired assets in Central
America account for about a third of the Colombian parent banks’ assets. A significant share of the
acquisitions was funded through debt issuance, implying some risk for the acquiring entities. Staff
and the authorities concurred that the banks’ efforts to diversify their operations are a welcome
step. At the same time, they agreed that the regional expansion of the Colombian banks brings new
challenges for supervision. Staff advised the authorities to adopt a deeper framework for monitoring
tail risks, including cross-border risks, as part of stress testing and the banks’ capital planning. The
SFC indicated that it has made progress in enhancing cross-border supervision, by participating in
supervisory colleges of Colombian banks’ subsidiaries, signing memorandums of understanding with
host supervisors in Central America, obtaining access to home-host supervisory data, and
conducting on-site visits to Colombian banks’ subsidiaries. In addition, the SFC is currently
participating in a joint study with the Fund of financial interconnectedness in Central America and
among Colombia and Central America.

COLOMBIA

F. Fostering Inclusive Growth
38.
Over the medium term, Colombia’s main challenge will be to foster more inclusive
growth. Despite significant progress in the past decade, Colombia’s poverty, unemployment,
inequality, and informality rates are still elevated (Box 8). At end-2012, Congress approved a
comprehensive tax reform to improve tax progressivity and reduce non-wage labor costs, including
a reduction in payroll and corporate income taxes, simplification of the VAT structure, introduction
of a new tax on corporate profits, and an increase in progressivity of individual income tax. The
reform was a positive step. However, at about 40 percent of total labor costs for average worker,
non-wage labor costs remain high, compounding the effect of the minimum wage on informal
employment. Efforts to address these challenges need to be sustained through structural reforms in
the labor market, the fiscal area, and the financial sector. The mission encouraged the authorities to
explore options for further reducing non-wage costs and contain the pace of growth of the
minimum wage to fight informality.
39.
Progress on financial sector deepening and inclusion is moving forward, albeit slowly.
Investment and growth of firms in the informal sector is more constrained by insufficient finance
than firms in the formal sector. Informal workers also earn and save less than their counterparts in
the formal labor market, have lower access to financial services, and are more likely to find
themselves in a difficult financial situation. Colombia has made important strides in fostering
financial inclusion in recent years including through targeted transfers, subsidized bank accounts
and mortgages, and expansion of physical infrastructure into rural areas. However, there is evidence
that the widespread increase in accounts penetration hides low balances and low usage. The mission
recommended fostering financial inclusion by lowering borrowing constraints and the cost of access
to finance by improving the quality and transparency of public registries on movable property,
promoting mobile banking, and enabling simplified financial licensing for electronic money issuers
to foster competition. Efforts to promote financial literacy and develop products tailored to lowincome households, such as micro insurance, are also key to expanding financial services to the
most vulnerable population.

OTHER ISSUES
40.
Staff has completed the safeguards procedures for Colombia’s 2013 FCL arrangement.
The authorities provided the necessary authorization for staff to communicate directly with Banco de
la República’s external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Colombia. PwC issued an unqualified
audit opinion on Banco de la República’s 2012 financial statements in February 2013. Staff reviewed
the 2012 audit results and discussed these with PwC. No significant safeguards issues emerged from
the conduct of these procedures. The financial statements and audit opinion are published in full on
the bank’s website.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Colombia continued to post a strong economic performance. Economic growth
accelerated in recent quarters, averaging 4.3 percent in 2013. Inflation stood within the target range,
job creation was robust, and unemployment fell to the lowest level in over a decade. The balance of
payments posted a significant surplus, largely driven by strong foreign direct investment, which
financed the current account deficit and strengthened international reserves. The financial system
remained stable.
42.
Economic prospects are favorable. Real GDP is projected to grow at around potential,
estimated at 4½ percent over the forecast period, with inflation remaining within the 2–4 percent
target range. The balance of payments is projected to remain in surplus, financing a broadly stable
current account deficit. The authorities are committed to significant fiscal consolidation, which is
expected to reduce the public debt ratio.
43.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Risks associated with emerging markets
and geopolitical tensions have increased since the last Article IV consultation. Colombia is exposed
to a sharp decline in commodity prices, especially oil, deterioration in global financial conditions,
and negative growth shocks in key trading partners. The normalization of monetary policy in the U.S.
could negatively impact Colombia if not accompanied by a corresponding increase in U.S. growth or
if it led to higher global risk aversion, capital outflows, and weaker growth in emerging markets.
Adverse shocks in China would affect Colombia directly through the trade channel, but most
importantly through indirect channels via a decline in commodity prices and negative effects on
financial markets and global growth. Negative spillovers could also come from the region, in the
event of trade disruptions with neighboring countries, an increase in investor risk perception
towards the region, or shocks affecting the balance sheets of Colombian banks operating in Central
America.
44.
Meeting the medium-term fiscal consolidation goals will require decisive policy action
on the revenue side. The authorities’ plan to reduce the central government’s structural balance as
set out in the fiscal rule is welcome. However, the medium-term fiscal framework envisages attaining
this goal through expenditure reduction, which would be difficult in the case of current expenditure
and undesirable in the case of investment spending. Fiscal consolidation will thus require increased
revenue mobilization. There is scope to increase non-oil revenues, which are low by international
standards, by broadening the tax base and reducing informality. In addition, particular focus should
be given to strengthening tax administration.
45.
Addressing the infrastructure deficit is key. The authorities’ infrastructure program,
including the fourth generation of road concessions to be executed through public-private
partnerships (PPPs), is expected to help address Colombia’s infrastructure deficit. The revamping of
the legal framework for PPPs approved in 2012 and the standardization of contracts are positive
steps and careful monitoring including of creation of contingent liabilities should help to contain
fiscal risks. The creation of a national financial institution specialized in infrastructure financing (FDN)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

COLOMBIA

and the efforts to establish a strong governance structure at the FDN are also positive initiatives that
would help channel resources to infrastructure. Upgrading accounting and reporting practices,
including by accelerating migration to accrual accounting under GFSM 2001, will be important to
appropriately reflect the budget implications of PPPs.
46.
It is important to address contingent fiscal pressures from the pension and health care
systems. The implementation of programs to bring informal workers and the elderly poor into the
social security system is an important step. However, the low coverage of the pension system
remains a source of potential future fiscal pressure. A more comprehensive reform of the pension
system will be required to broaden coverage and increase equity while maintaining the financial
sustainability of the system. In health care, further efforts to contain costs within the current legal
framework will also be important.
47.
The external position of the economy is strong, and international reserves appear
adequate for precautionary purposes. The current account deficit and the real exchange rate are
broadly in line with fundamentals. Moreover, risks to external stability are mitigated by a stable
financing of the current account deficit, largely through foreign direct investment. Most reserve ratio
metrics suggest that Colombia has an adequate reserve buffer for normal times, though reserves
might be insufficient to cope with tail risks. Efforts to further strengthen reserve buffers should
remain consistent with exchange rate flexibility and the inflation-targeting regime. As reserves reach
higher levels, the opportunity cost of accumulating reserves will warrant a careful cost-benefitanalysis.
48.
Financial supervision is broadly effective, though there is scope for improvement in
some areas. Financial soundness indicators are strong. However, supervision of complex financial
conglomerates and mixed conglomerates and exposure to concentration risk continue to pose
challenges. The recent expansion of the largest institutions across the region, primarily in Central
America, will require a deeper framework to monitor and stress-test a wide variety of cross-border
risks. It will also be important to implement the Basel II Pillar 2 supervisory framework, and
strengthen the independence and legal protection of supervisors.
49.
Fostering more inclusive growth remains a key medium-term challenge. Further
reducing poverty, unemployment, inequality, and informality will require structural reforms in the
labor market, and the fiscal and financial sectors. It will be important to further reduce non-wage
costs and contain the growth of the minimum wage to fight informality. Financial inclusion could be
fostered by lowering borrowing constraints, reducing the cost of access to finance, promoting
financial literacy, and developing products tailored to low-income households.
50.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12‒month cycle.
51.
Staff does not recommend approval of the retention of the exchange restriction
arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector, since the authorities have no
plans for its removal.

Box 2. Savings and Investment in Colombia
Colombia benefited from the commodity price boom of the past decade. Driven by higher oil prices,
Colombia’s terms of trade rose by 69 percent since 2004. According to Adler and Magud (2013) 1, the income
windfall associated with such increase in the terms of trade amounted to 5.3 percent of GDP a year on
average between 2004 and 2012.
A significant portion of the commodity windfall was saved. Colombia’s national saving rate rose by
about 4 percentage points of GDP over the past decade to 21 percent of GDP in 2013, driven primarily by
the public sector. According to Adler and Magud (2013), the economy saved about 90 percent of the
commodity windfall, the highest share in the region. This behavior was underpinned by a prudent
macroeconomic policy framework that prevented excess expenditure and promoted fiscal discipline.

The rise in savings helped financed a significant increase in investment. Higher investment was one of
the drivers of Colombia’s strong economic performance of the past decade. Gross investment rose by over
5½ percentage points of GDP over the past decade to over 24 percent of GDP (measured at current prices)
in 2013, driven by the private sector. Measured at constant prices, investment rose even faster, by almost
10 percentage points of GDP, during the same period, reaching 28 percent of GDP in 2013, one of the
highest investment ratios in the region. Investment was undertaken primarily by the private sector, and
directed mainly to oil and mining, electricity, telecommunications, and the financial sector. Public investment
lagged behind, as a result of which Colombia continues facing a significant infrastructure deficit, in particular
in roads.

Box 2. Savings and Investment in Colombia (concluded)
Savings and investment are projected to continue rising over the forecast period. The projected fiscal
consolidation would lead to an increase in the savings ratio, while investment would be driven by continued
strong economic growth prospects and the authorities’ ambitious road infrastructure program, to be
executed through PPPs (¶23).

Box 3. Spillover Effects of the Normalization of Monetary Policy in the U.S.
The normalization of monetary policy in the U.S. will likely affect the Colombian economy through
several channels. As policy normalization proceeds, the rise in U.S. interest rates will push up domestic
interest rates (as already happened with government bond yields since mid-2013), possibly curtailing
consumption, investment and growth. However, stronger U.S. growth, which is expected to drive the pace of
policy normalization, will increase the demand for Colombian exports, supporting growth. The net effect on
the Colombian economy will depend on the relative pace of U.S. rate increases and growth acceleration. At
the same time, Colombia could be affected through the effect of U.S. policy normalization on the rest of the
world. To assess these effects, staff has developed a
Response of Colombian 10-year Government Bond Yields

Staff estimates suggest that changes in U.S.
Treasury yields have a significant impact on
Colombian government bond yields. A vector error
correction model (VECM) shows that a 100 basis point
increase in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields translates into
an increase of 91 to 123 basis points in 10-year TES
yields after six months.


In the first scenario (black line), a faster-than-baseline U.S. recovery leads the Federal Reserve to
withdraw monetary stimulus faster than in the baseline.

In the second scenario (dotted line), in addition to tighter U.S. monetary conditions, financial
conditions are assumed to tighten outside the U.S. as well. In vulnerable emerging market economies,
market interest rates tighten by roughly 25 basis points more than in the U.S. In less vulnerable emerging
markets economies, market interest rates tighten by about ¾ as much as in the U.S. In advanced economies,
market interest rates tighten by about ½ as much as in the U.S.

In the third scenario (gray line), it is assumed that market participants perceive the Federal Reserve
to be less tolerant of inflation overshooting the target rate, and further tighten financial conditions. Market
interest rates rise by roughly an additional 40 basis points in the United States at the peak, 50 basis points in
vulnerable emerging market economies, 20 basis points in less vulnerable emerging market economies, and
10 basis points in other advanced economies.

Colombia’s non-resource primary balance (NRPB) is estimated to be below benchmarks for resourcerich countries. Common benchmarks for the NRPB are those that maintain net public wealth constant as a
percent of non-resource GDP, in real per capita terms, or in real terms.1 The central government’s non-oil
balance for 2013, estimated at -3 percent of GDP, was below the least restrictive of the NRPB benchmarks
(i.e., keeping wealth constant in real terms), even under an assumption of 120 years of natural resource

Achieving the authorities’ required fiscal consolidation plan will be challenging. Such a consolidation is
projected to be achieved primarily through expenditure restraint. Staff has estimated for illustrative purposes
the fiscal effort that would be required to adhere to the MTFF goals under more adverse fiscal scenarios
than assumed in the MTFF. The scenarios considered were a larger decline in oil and mining revenues (of
1.8 percentage points of GDP over the forecast period compared to 0.9 in the MTFF), and constant levels of

increase current savings to establish intergenerational real income parity.

Colombia’s real exchange rate remained
fairly competitive against most major trading
partners of manufacturing goods except for
the U.S. and Mexico. Despite the real
appreciation of the Colombian peso against the
U.S. dollar, the appreciation of the bilateral real
exchange rate since 2008 against most major
trading partners has been fairly modest, with
the exception of Mexico.

Colombia’s manufacturing sector has
performed relatively poorly since 2008. Real
GDP grew, on average, by 4 percent between
2008 and 2013 despite the global financial
turmoil of 2008–09, due to favorable commodity
prices and Colombia’s strong economic policy
framework. At the same time, Colombia’s
manufacturing sector output grew only by
0.1 percent on average. As a result, the share of
manufacturing in percent of real GDP has
declined from 14 percent at the end of 2007 to
11 percent in 2013. The weakness of the
manufacturing sector has raised concerns that
the Colombian peso is overvalued.

real exchange rate appreciation has contributed
positively to manufacturing firms’ profitability. The positive correlation between real appreciation and profit
growth may be caused by the presence of imported intermediate inputs, to the extent that the exportweighted real effective exchange rate used in the analysis is correlated with the real effective exchange rate
for imported intermediate goods. At the same time, the regression results show that export intensive
companies suffered greater losses with real exchange rate appreciation compared to the companies that
exported less.
Structural changes in trade seem to have affected firms’ profit growth. Two structural trade dummies
were included in the regressions in order to capture the effects of the trade disruption with Venezuela and
increased trade competition from China. Both dummies have negative and significant coefficients. In
particular, the profit growth after 2008 was, on average, 12 percent lower for those industries that were
affected by trade disruption with Venezuela. Similarly, the profit growth after 2008 was, on average,
7 percent lower for those industries that faced higher competition from Chinese imports.

Box 6. Colombia’s International Reserve Adequacy
Colombia’s international reserve indicators have improved in recent years after deteriorating during
the global financial crisis. During the global financial crisis, the ratio of reserves relative to broad money,
short-term external debt plus the projected current account deficit, imports, nominal GDP, and the reserve
adequacy metric deteriorated. Recently, these indicators have improved as the authorities took advantage of
strong capital inflows (primarily FDI) to rebuild their international reserve position. Capital inflows mostly in
the form of foreign direct investment have been attracted by Colombia’s strong fundamentals and policy
frameworks and its proven track record of sound macroeconomic policies.

However, the majority of reserve indicators
are still below their pre-crisis levels. The ratio
of reserves to GDP is the only indicator that has
returned to its pre-crisis level. The authorities
consider the pre-crisis reserve ratios as
benchmarks, as these ratios proved invaluable
in coping with the global financial crisis as a
large external shock by maintaining market
confidence and the policy space to adjust to
balance of payments pressures. The authorities’
intention is to restore the reserve indicators to
their pre-crisis levels and ensure that the
nominal level of international reserves continues
to increase in line with the growing size of the
economy and international transactions.

Source: Fund staff calculations.

Overall, Colombia holds a comfortable level of reserves and they appear adequate for precautionary
purposes. Colombia’s reserve indicators as of end-2013 are all above the levels suggested by the “rule of
thumb.” While the rebound in reserves to nominal GDP has remained somewhat muted, the ratio of reserves
to months of imports is more than double the indicative guide of 3-months, and other traditional ratios are
also back to a relatively comfortable level. Reserves to reserve adequacy metric in 2013 stands at
162 percent compared to the range of 100 to 150 percent considered adequate for precautionary purposes.
However, as noted in the Board paper “Assessing Reserve Adequacy—Further Considerations,” the metric
needs to be carefully assessed as it may not appropriately capture vulnerabilities to trade shocks for
countries heavily reliant commodity exports. An adjusted metric in an attempt to address Colombia-specific
BOP vulnerabilities stood at 144 percent and the authorities’ metric at 123 percent in 2013 (see below).
The reserve adequacy metric (RAM) does not appropriately capture Colombia’s specific external
vulnerabilities. Although financial account vulnerabilities are also present, balance of payments
vulnerabilities are primarily concentrated in the current account, especially the vulnerability of export
receipts to a decline in commodity prices.1 An alternative export component specifically for commodity
exporters in the RAM showed marginally higher losses from trade shocks. To that end, “most Executive
Directors endorsed the staff’s suggestions to alter the computation of the reserve adequacy metric for
countries highly dependent on commodity trade” at the Executive Board meeting on “Assessing Reserve
Adequacy—Further Considerations.”
1/ Colombia is a large commodity exporter, having more than 50 percent of total exports related to petroleum products
and about 20 percent related to non-oil commodities (coal, coffee, and nickel). The current account deficit is more than
financed by capital flows, mostly in the form of foreign direct investment.

Box 6. Colombia’s International Reserve Adequacy (concluded)
Colombia’s Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) events used in the RAM do not sufficiently coincide with
episodes of weak commodity prices. “Oil crisis events” (identified as episodes of large declines in oil
prices) and Colombia’s EMP crisis events (taken from the standard RAM analysis) only overlap in September
and October 2008. Differences in the timing of crisis events identified under the two crisis measures lead to
substantially different estimates of export losses (or gains). Colombia’s exports declined in 6 out of 7 oil
crisis years at an average change of ‐10 percent, whereas its
EMP Crisis in Colombia and OIL Crisis Events
(EMP crisis if =1, OIL crisis if =-1)
exports increased in 5 out of 6 EMP crisis years at an
1
average change of +13 percent. This difference implies that
EMP crisis events are somewhat irrelevant in identifying
pressures on Colombia’s current account. Moreover, the
0
average loss of 10 percent is twice as large as the change in
exports at the 10th percentile during EMP events in the
RAM for all countries. Incorporating a higher weight of

The authorities’ RAM estimate, based on the Fund’s
methodology but using only Colombia data (as opposed
to data for a set of emerging markets), suggests that
Colombia is more vulnerable to export losses.2 The
authorities’ RAM also shows that the magnitude of potential
losses from capital account vulnerabilities (i.e. short-term
debt and other portfolio liabilities) are lower than the
average of other countries in the Fund’s RAM, consistent with
the structure of Colombia’s balance of payments. Combining
all vulnerabilities, the authorities’ reserves to RAM stood at
123 percent in 2013, about 40 percent lower than the level
suggested by the Fund’s standard metric.

The reserves might be insufficient to cope with tail risks. The RAM is intended to assess reserves for
precautionary purposes and not for covering tail risks. The RAM measures potential outflows at the
10th percentile of the distribution experienced during EMP events. Furthermore, while cost-benefit analyses
on crisis probability and the fall of consumption suggest that the range of 100 to 150 percent might be
regarded as adequate, “it does not preclude countries from wanting to hold more depending on the
circumstances and their degree of risk aversion.”3

Box 7. Colombia’s Domestic Capital Market
Colombia’s domestic capital market grew significantly in the past decade. Market activity is dominated
by government debt securities (TES), followed by equity issuance, while the non-government fixed income
market is small. The investor base comprises mainly domestic participants, primarily banks, trust companies
and pension funds. The presence of foreign investors is still small, but is rising rapidly, particularly in
government debt.
Colombia has the third largest local currency government bond market in Latin America, after Brazil
and Mexico. Over 70 percent of outstanding TES are at a fixed rate, and about a quarter are linked to
inflation (the UVR index). Maturities go up to 15 years for fixed-rate TES and 20 years for TES UVR. The
average maturity of outstanding TES was 5 years as of end-2013. About 80 percent of TES issuance is
channeled through competitive auctions, held weekly, alternating between fixed rate and UVR bonds each
week. Non-competitive sales of TES comprise pre-arranged placements (“convenidas”) targeted to stateowned companies and mandatory placements (“forzosas”) targeted to public institutions that have to invest
part of their resources in government bonds. Daily turnover in the secondary market is about COP 5 trillion
for fixed rate TES and COP 1 trillion for TES UVR, equivalent to 3½ and 2½ percent of the amount
outstanding, respectively. Liquidity is uneven across the curve, with bid-offer spreads at 1 to 5 basis points.
The equity market is concentrated in a small number of issuers. The main issuers are Ecopetrol, financial
groups and utility companies. Initial public offerings and secondary offerings totaled US$10.3 billion in
2010–13. The market capitalization of the companies listed in the stock exchange (BVC) grew rapidly in
recent years, totaling US$215 billion in 2013 (56 percent of GDP). Ecopetrol accounts for about half and the
financial groups for about 20 percent of the total market capitalization. The average daily trading volume
was US$108 million in 2013.
The corporate bond market is small and dominated by financial institutions. Issues are concentrated in
highly-rated institutions, primarily banks and utility companies. The demand for smaller and lower rated
securities is scarce. Maturities generally go up to 10 years, though some issuers were able to issue at up to
40 years. Most issues are indexed to inflation. Issuance totaled US$22.6 billion in 2010–13 (of which
US$5 billion were issued in 2013).
An incipient derivatives market is developing. There are standardized futures for TES of different
maturities, the stock market index Colcap, some equity issues, and energy contracts. There are also interest
rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. Foreign exchange forwards (non-deliverable forwards or NDFs) trade
mostly over the counter, with an average daily turnover of about US$1 billion. Liquidity is concentrated in
short-term contracts.
The investor base is dominated by locals, but the presence of foreign investors is rising. The investor
base comprises primarily banks, trust funds and pension funds. The participation of foreign investors is
higher in the equity market at about 20 percent of the average market volume in 2013. Foreign investors’
ownership of TES rose to 7 percent of the total amount outstanding at end-2013, up from 3 percent at end2012, fuelled by a reduction in early 2013 from 33 to 14 percent in the withholding tax charged on foreign
investors’ income and capital gains income tax. The authorities intend to raise foreign investors’ participation
in the TES market to 15–20 percent to diversify the investor base.

Informality poses a number of disadvantages to
macroeconomic management. Informal work
contributes to economic activity, but is less accurately
measured, which distorts statistics on actual and
potential GDP, and complicates macroeconomic policy
analysis. Informal work increases tax evasion, reducing
government revenues. The absence of accurate
employment information hinders the effective
targeting of social benefits to the vulnerable
population. In addition, informality is tightly linked to
inequality, although the direction of causality and the
precise channels of impact are less well understood.

Employment

Jan-08

Informal work in Colombia has been declining in
recent years, but remains stubbornly high. In 2010,
the share of persons employed in the informal sector
in total non-agricultural employment was almost
60 percent.1 Fund staff estimates suggest that
informality has been declining in recent years, but still
remains about half of total employment. Statistics on
pension contributions give a similar estimate of the
magnitude of informality, with over 50 percent of
non-retired respondents to the households’ survey
(GEIH) declaring not to have been contributing to the
pension system.

29 percent with a high school degree. Some
17 percent of informal workers reported having tertiary education.
Informal workers are more likely to find themselves in precarious job situations. About 40 percent of
the workers in the survey were interested in changing their job for a variety of physical and psychological
reasons. Almost half of informal respondents perceived their jobs as temporary. Informal sector workers also
earn less, exacerbating inequality. According to the most recent households’ survey, the majority of informal
workers were self-employed, followed by employees in small private sector companies and domestic
workers.2

Informality is distributed across all regions.
The largest number of informal workers resides
and/or works in Bogota (the capital region),
mainly because it employs a large share of the
population. The share of informal workers in total
employment in each region is much more
equally distributed. Yet, some pockets of above
average informality exist: the Cucuta capital
region bordering with Venezuela displays the
highest share of informal workers, followed by
agricultural areas of Monteria and Pasto, and
Cartagena (which has a large share of the poor
population).

Sources: Fund staff estimates.

While skill mismatches may play a role in the high rate of unemployment, very high labor costs are
the main contributor to the large informal sector. In a recent survey, 30 percent of employers in
Colombia reported having difficulty filling vacancies.3 Yet, real increases in the minimum wage outpaced
productivity growth in the 1990s, spurring a movement from the formal to the informal sector. This trend
particularly affected young and old workers, those with lower productivity, and those living in remote areas.4
The minimum wage remains a high relative to average value-added. For example, in mid-2013, the minimum
wage for a 19-year old worker or an apprentice stood at $310 per month, representing about 30 percent of
value-added. In addition, non-wage costs constitute about 40 percent of total labor costs for the average
worker, compounding the effect of the high minimum wage on informal employment. The tax reform of
2012 lowered non-wage compulsory payments by eliminating health, training, and child care contributions,
and may have contributed to reduce informality since mid-2013.

accounts, and less than 10 percent held savings in
a formal financial institution. In contrast, informal finance was widespread, with a relatively larger share of
adults declaring having received a loan from, or having saved through, informal channels.
Financial deepening was also not fully “shared” across enterprises. In 2010, a greater share of small
firms claimed to have been affected by insufficient financing compared to 2006. Firms in the food
industry were particularly affected. Over 50 percent of smaller-sized companies (with less than
20 employees) identified access to finance as a major constraint for their operations in 2010.
Colombia has implemented a number of improvements to reduce the costs of accessing financial
services. Physical infrastructure has increased. Banks have been allowed to provide financial services
through correspondents for social transfers programs since 2006 and over 38,000 correspondents were
registered in 2013. The government has subsidized the opening of accounts for most Familias en Accion
transfers recipients and lowered the financial transaction tax on low account balances. The program of
interest subsidies on new mortgages granted to over 5,000 low income families since 2009 has been
extended into 2014 and will cover up to 5 percentage points of the agreed interest rate for a 7-year period.

3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r ‐ π(1+g) ‐ g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r ‐ π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as ‐g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Implementation of Past Fund Recommendations. The authorities have been receptive to Fund
advice. On the fiscal front, they are implementing Fund recommendations to strengthen revenue
administration. The Fund welcomed the tax reform approved by Congress in late 2012, which
replaced payroll taxes with a corporate income tax, and appears to be having a positive effect in
fostering formal employment. Staff has also supported plans to increase coverage and fairness in the
pension system as well as efforts to contain health care costs, two areas in which the authorities are
currently working. On the financial front, the authorities are working on improving risk-based
supervision and enhancing cross-border supervision, in line with Fund advice. In the area of statistics,
work is underway in the area of national accounts, price indices, and in the adoption of GFSM 2001.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
The current IBRD Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 12‒16 aims to support selectively
Colombia’s National Development Plan. The World Bank Group (WBG) is stepping up efforts to
enhance development impact through selectivity, as a means to provide added value to the country.
The WBG has been carrying out activities for which the Government or the private sector have
expressed explicit need through financial, knowledge, and convening services. Activities are managed
under an enhanced thematic business model approach, aimed at improving the impact of the Bank’s
engagement in Colombia. These activities are combined as a results-focused package of support
grouped under three strategic themes: (a) Expanding Opportunities for Social Prosperity;
(b) Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate Change Resilience; and (c) Inclusive Growth with
Enhanced Productivity. Each of these strategic themes has three areas of results with specified
outcomes. In some cases, outcomes in this CPS cannot solely be attributed to the WBG since activities
are often jointly accomplished with the Government or other partners.
For FY 14‒16 the lending program is expected to be US$870−1,000 million per annum. Actual
delivery of the lending program will depend on Colombia’s performance, IBRD lending capacity,
demand from other borrowers, global economic developments, and disbursement profiles that keep
exposure within the country limits. Trust funds have continued to be an integral part of the Bank’s
engagement with Colombia. As trust fund resources are not predictable for the purpose of the CPS,
the WBG is ensuring that activities financed by trust funds follow the thrust of this strategy in
agreement with the government counterparts.
As of February 2014, Colombia is the 7th largest Bank borrower in terms of IBRD exposure,
with US$7.9 billion debt outstanding, representing about 7 percent of IBRD's total portfolio. In
December 2013, IBRD net commitments stood at US$1.5 billion, of which US$1.2 billion remained
undisbursed. The active portfolio is composed of 18 IBRD and 2 GEF projects. More than 90 percent
of the active IBRD commitment is in Sustainable Development, with the remainder split between
Poverty Reduction (PREM) and Human Development (HD).
IFC committed US$750 million in the last two fiscal years, including participants. Colombia
represents 2.8 percent of IFC’s total outstanding portfolio. IFC's committed portfolio includes
participants from the financial, power and transportation sectors, which account for 87 percent of the
total. Colombia also has a considerable Trust Fund portfolio with US$17.3 million newly committed in
RETF (Recipient Executed Trust Funds) over the period FY13‒FY14 in 46 approved grant requests over
the same period. Four of these grants are managed by IFC.

INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK RELATIONS2
The Bank’s ongoing country strategy with Colombia (2012–2014) identifies the main targets of
engagement in the areas of Transportation, Science, Technology, and Innovation, Trade and
Integration, Access to Financial Services, Education and Vocational Training, Social Protection,
Health, Water Supply and Sanitation, Housing and Urban Development, Risk Management.
These areas are part of a comprehensive vision for the development process of the country, aimed at
creating a “virtuous circle” between the objectives of increased growth, and reducing poverty and
inequality. There are cross-cutting requirements associated with these areas, in order to overcome
conditions of poverty and inequity, which are: (i) targeting actions and resources to a balanced,
multidimensional approach to regional development in relation to public management and
competitiveness, and (ii) recognizing both infrastructure development, and human and social capital
development as necessary factors for greater competitiveness, stronger institutions, and better
governance.
The sovereign guarantee lending envelope under the current Strategy was estimated at
US$852 million per year, which total US$3.4 billion for the years 2012 to 2014. In 2013, the Bank
approved 10 operations for US$1023 million in sovereign guarantee operations.
The Bank portfolio is currently composed of 23 sovereign guarantee operations, totaling
US$1.6 billion, with a disbursed percentage of 23 percent. Operations are concentrated in
competitiveness (70 percent), governance (17 percent) and social development (13 percent). The nonreimbursable technical cooperation portfolio includes 126 operations, with an approved value of
US$95 million. This includes the Multilateral Investment Fund, whose portfolio has 48 operations for
US$48million.
The current portfolio of private sector initiatives (non-sovereign guarantee) in Colombia
consists of 3 loans, totaling US$205 million. The Inter-American Investment Corporation has a
portfolio of US$87 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 31, 2014)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the national
accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial accounts. Annual and
quarterly estimates of GDP by the production and the expenditure approaches use 2005 as the
reference year. GDP compilation conforms to the methodological recommendations of the System of
National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) and some recommendations of the 2008 SNA. The rebasing of
the national accounts’ base year included a methodological change regarding the volume measures
from a fixed-base Laspeyres index to a Laspeyres chain index with 2005 as the reference year. The
main implications of the rebasing are that the 2000 and 2005 series are not comparable and the chain
index is associated with non-additivity of the components. The rebasing also resulted in an upward
revision of the nominal GDP, reflecting improvements in source data. DANE currently compiles a
monthly indicator of economic activity for internal purposes, but has decided to start disseminating it
to the general public during the third quarter of 2014.
DANE is also responsible for price statistics. It currently compiles and disseminates the consumer
price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI). The basket and weights of the CPI were updated
in 2008 according to the latest Income-Expenditure Survey (2006–2007), which resulted in an increase
in the number of products collected. DANE is currently updating the PPI, which is expected to be
available during the third quarter of 2014.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of public revenue,
expenditure, and financing data. The Colombian authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to
adopt the GFSM 2001 framework, enhance inter-institutional coordination, and increase the resources
allocated to compiling government finance statistics. While significant progress has been made, there
is still a need to take additional steps. In the short term, these include: adopting a common list of
public sector entities, and disseminating high-frequency data on a national and international level.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting framework for the public
sector based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards and maintains a financial
management information system containing accounting information of all public sector units. The
MFPC’s Macroeconomic Policy Unit and the GAO developed a bridge table that converts national
accounting classification to the GFSM 2001 framework to compile GFS on accrual and cash bases,
which are reported annually to the IMF’s Statistics Department for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook.

Financial sector statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Financial Superintendence
(FS) and the Superintendence of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund technical
assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data quality, including
interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency.
External Sector Statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics. Quarterly data
have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in 1998. Balance of
payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade zones. Improved
surveys, particularly in the services sector, have enhanced coverage and consistency and financial
account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE, develop a
methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely basis. Although
DANE developed a methodology to estimate unrecorded trade, the BdR does not include these
estimates in the balance of payments statistics. Also, the BdR has been working to identify
government bonds issued abroad and held by residents, but the task has not been completed yet
due to coverage issues. In line with the mission’s recommendations, the BdR reclassified some FDI
equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjusted the related investment income series
accordingly.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics, External
Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
Colombia reports data to the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).

B. Data Standards and Quality
Colombia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A data ROSC was published in October 2006.

C. Reporting to STA (optional)
Colombia reports annual GFS to STA for general government and its subsectors on accrual and cash
bases for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook). Data for the
consolidated general government are only available from 2008 onward after a major revision was
performed in stock data. Currently, no high frequency data are reported for publication in IFS.
However, an action plan currently being implemented by the authorities is aimed to address this
issue. Colombia is also expected to start reporting debt statistics for the IMF-WB Public Sector Debt
Statistics database. The BdR uses the standardized report forms for reporting monetary data for the
central bank (Form 1SR), other depository corporations (Form 2SR), and other financial corporations
(Form 4SR) to STA. The FS reports 11 of the 12 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and 10 of 13
encouraged FSIs for deposit takers on a regular monthly basis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Colombia

On May 19, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Colombia.
Colombia has maintained a robust economic performance in recent years. A strong policy
framework—anchored by an inflation-targeting regime, a flexible exchange rate, a structural
fiscal balance rule, and effective financial supervision and regulation—has allowed the
authorities to respond adequately to shocks and pursue effective demand management. The
authorities have continued to improve the policy framework in recent years, by including a fiscal
sustainability principle in the constitution; introducing a structural fiscal balance rule;
overhauling the oil and mining royalties system; and implementing a comprehensive tax reform
that replaced payroll taxes with a corporate income tax. Amid increased volatility in financial
markets, the Flexible Credit Line arrangement has also allowed Colombia to maintain orderly
financial market conditions by providing a buffer against tail risks.
Real GDP growth rebounded strongly in the second half of 2013. After slowing down to
2.9 percent y/y in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013, growth accelerated to
5.2 percent y/y in the second half of 2013, driven by higher public investment and a solid
expansion in private consumption. Overall, real GDP growth in 2013 as a whole averaged
4.3 percent, up from 4 percent in 2012. Employment also rose strongly, particularly in the formal
sector of the economy, and unemployment declined to 9.7 percent in 2013, the lowest mark in
the last decade. At the same time, inflation was subdued at 1.9 percent y/y at end-2013, slightly
below the 2–4 percent target range.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Monetary and fiscal policies supported growth in 2013. The central bank held the policy interest
rate constant at 3.25 percent between April 2013 and April 2014 in light of soft growth during
the first half of the year and inflation at or below the lower bound of the target range throughout
the year. The reallocation of central government spending to provide targeted stimulus (e.g.,
through mortgage interest subsidies) and the use of royalties for investment spending by subnational governments also supported growth in 2013. In April 2014, the central bank increased
the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent. Going forward, the authorities have
reaffirmed their commitment to adjust the policy rate as necessary as conditions warrant to keep
inflation within the target range, to adhere to fiscal plans consistent with the medium-term fiscal
framework, and to use the flexible exchange rate as a shock absorber.
The banking system remained stable. Financial soundness indicators remained strong, with low
and well-provisioned non-performing loans, strong profitability, and adequate liquidity. New
capital requirements became effective in August 2013, significantly enhancing the quality of
banks’ capital. The financial system is expected to continue deepening, and the participation of
nonresidents in both the local government debt market and the equity market is also projected to
rise in the near term.
Growth is projected to remain robust in 2014 and beyond, although risks are tilted to the
downside. With the output gap nearly closed as of end-2013, real GDP is projected to grow at
around potential (about 4½ percent) in 2014 and beyond, with inflation remaining within the
target range. However, Colombia remains vulnerable to external risks, including: a sharp decline
in commodity prices, especially oil; deterioration in global financial conditions; and volatility
from the normalization of monetary policy in the U.S., especially if not accompanied by a
corresponding increase in U.S. growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the continued strong performance of the Colombian economy,
with faster economic growth, low inflation, robust job creation, particularly in the formal sector
of the economy, and declining unemployment. Nonetheless, while economic prospects are
favorable, risks remain tilted to the downside. The uncertain global outlook, including the
increase in geopolitical and emerging market risks, could present challenges even for strong and
well-managed economies like Colombia. Directors stressed the importance of continued prudent
policies to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability and sustained structural reforms to
promote more inclusive growth.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors commended the authorities’ adherence to the fiscal rule and commitment to mediumterm fiscal consolidation. They noted, however, that meeting the fiscal goals will require greater
revenue mobilization, and called for decisive action to broaden the tax base, reduce informality,
and strengthen tax administration. Adjustments on the expenditure side would also be needed to
improve the efficiency of spending, including by reducing costs from healthcare provision.
Directors considered the authorities’ plans for a comprehensive reform of the pension system to
broaden coverage and increase the equity of the pension system as a step in the right direction.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the external position of the Colombian
economy is strong, with the current account balance and the real exchange rate broadly in line
with fundamentals. They emphasized that continued efforts to enhance productivity is crucial to
raise competitiveness. Directors noted that risks to external stability are mitigated by a stable
source of financing of the current account deficit, an adequate level of international reserves, and
the additional line of defense offered by the Flexible Credit Line arrangement. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the need to weigh the opportunity costs of further
reserves accumulation vis-à-vis the benefits of ensuring sufficient buffers.
Directors noted that the financial system is sound and financial supervision broadly effective.
Nonetheless, they saw room to enhance supervision of complex conglomerates and their
exposure to concentration risk. They also highlighted that the expansion of the largest institutions
across the region will require a deeper framework to monitor and stress-test cross-border risks.
Directors emphasized the need to foster more inclusive growth through structural reform. They
encouraged the authorities to continue to reduce informality by further reducing non-wage costs
and addressing labor market rigidities. They also recommended fostering financial inclusion by
reducing the cost of access to finance and developing products tailored to low-income
households. Directors noted that addressing infrastructure needs is critical to boosting
competitiveness and growth and welcomed the authorities’ infrastructure program.

Statement by Maria Angelica Arbelaez, Alternate Executive Director for Colombia
May 19, 2014
The Colombian authorities are grateful to the mission team for the constructive and
fruitful discussions held in Bogota. They broadly agree with the staff’s assessment and
policy recommendations.
Economic outlook
The Colombian economy has continued to perform well. The growth rate was 4.3 percent
in 2013, and is projected at 4.5 to 5 percent in 2014. Growth has been driven by strong
consumption and investment with construction and agriculture as the leading sectors.
Exports and manufacturing were subdued but started to recover bolstered by both the
exchange rate depreciation and a more dynamic external demand. In the medium term,
the four generation infrastructure project (4G) is estimated to add around 0.7 percentage
points to the potential output, currently at 4.6 percent.
The authorities agree with staff that although the outlook is favorable, as other emerging
markets (EMs) Colombia is also subject to a variety of shocks. One major risk is the
uncertain and potentially disruptive process of monetary policy normalization pursued in
the U.S. So far the “tapering” has produced an adjustment in asset prices throughout the
EMs with diverse effects according to countries’ fundamentals. The next step that
involves raising policy interest rates could be more disruptive, as some past episodes
suggest. Although these changes would come as a result of a stronger US economy and
higher external demand for EMs, adverse shocks through world financial markets could
overwhelm any positive effect stemming from real channels. In addition, Colombia could
be affected by a Chinese slowdown not only directly, through decreases in prices and
quantities of commodity exports, but also indirectly, through a declining export demand
from regional markets that depend significantly on exports to China (e.g. Ecuador, Peru,
Chile etc.)1. Both policy normalization in the U.S. and a slowdown of the Chinese
economy could trigger adverse reactions in other EMs and impact the Colombian
economy via financial contagion. Finally, further deterioration in the Venezuelan
economy (our second partner in manufacturing exports) and/or in other countries in Latin
America could also impact the Colombian economy through different channels.
Colombia’s strong policy framework, that has been its first line of defense, rests on three
pillars: sustainable fiscal policy, a strong financial system, and an inflation targeting
regime with exchange rate flexibility. This framework, well backed by the FCL, has
provided the country with resilience and with the ability to pursue countercyclical policy
responses. Indeed, economic policies supported last year’s growth, while being prudent
and keeping fundamentals strong. In 2013 inflation held in the lower bound of the target
range; fiscal targets were met; the current account deficit remained relatively low and
1

Colombian exports to China accounted for roughly 9 percent of total exports in 2013 and 24 percent of total Colombian exports were
sold in 2013 to countries with significant trade links with China (excluding the US).

2
comfortably financed with FDI inflows; the level of international reserves increased and
continue to be adequate; and the financial sector stayed sound and well capitalized.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
The central bank (Banco de Republica, BR) maintained an expansionary stance to
support the economy while keeping inflation under control. As a response to slow growth
in the first semester of 2013 and the negative output gap, and with the inflation rate in the
lower bound of the target, the authorities have held the policy interest rate at 3.25 percent
since April 2013. However, they began to move to a more neutral interest rate as the
economy started to recover. In a context of inflation converging towards 3 percent, a
more dynamic domestic demand (output gap close to zero) and rising employment, the
BR raised the policy rate by 25 basis points at the end of April 2014. The objective of the
BR is to achieve efficient monetary policy normalization by means of a timely and
gradual adjustment of the policy stance. Delays in the start of this adjustment risked
introducing sharper interest rate movements in the future with adverse effects on output
and employment volatility.
The exchange rate has been the main shock absorber. After the announcement of the
tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the currency depreciated significantly with no
negative consequences for the economy or inflation. Indeed, a credible long-term
inflation target, a subdued exchange rate pass-through and low currency and FX term
mismatches have been both consequences and conditions for the successful operation of
the monetary and FX policy strategy.
The monetary authorities have continued to build-up reserves with the objective of
keeping indicators at adequate levels. International reserves are accumulated through the
program of pre-announced daily purchases in the FX market. The pace of accumulation is
guided by a strategy that takes into account pre-crisis levels of several indicators (that
proved to be an adequate buffer), and the average of levels of those indicators during the
floating period. This strategy indicates the need for continued strengthening of the
country’s external liquidity position. It is worth noting, however, that the pursued level of
international reserves is considered adequate for precautionary purposes but would be
insufficient to cope with tail risks.
The external position continues to be strong and, according to the authorities, there is no
evidence of a statistically significant exchange rate misalignment. In 2013 the current
account deficit stood at 3.4 percent of GDP, similar to that of 2012, and comfortably
financed with capital inflows (5.3 percent of GDP) of which FDI constitutes the largest
fraction. The deficit is mainly associated with high imports in line with economic activity
(related to FDI and to retail and industrial sectors) and high profit remittances from
foreign companies. The authorities estimate that the current account deficit will slightly
narrow in the coming years on account of higher exports.

3
Fiscal policy and stance
A strong framework, both at the central and subnational governments (SNGs), has
supported fiscal consolidation, and helps to anchor fiscal discipline and promote savings2.
In 2013, the fiscal target dictated by the fiscal rule for the central government of
2.4 percent of GDP was met (0.9 percent for the combined public sector) with higher than
envisaged revenues that allowed for higher public investment. The consolidation will
continue gradually in the next years in order to reach a structural deficit of the central
government of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2018 and levels below 1 percent in 2022 onwards—
which in turn will bring down public debt to 26 percent of GDP.
The authorities welcome the selected issues paper on the fiscal rule. The main finding is
that, even in a very adverse scenario (much more pessimistic than that assumed by the
government) the adjustment would be at most 2 to 2.5 percent of GDP. The authorities
are fully aware of the need for an adjustment based on raising revenues rather than
cutting spending, but consider that the magnitude could be smaller as: GDP is expected to
grow at least at the potential level or higher should positive effects on infrastructure
materialize; oil and mining revenues might be larger (government’s assumptions are
rather conservative); and other revenues would become stronger as a result of the
proceeds of the 2012 tax reform as well as envisaged tax administration improvements.
Indeed, efforts in the latter front have been significant: tax revenue almost doubled in
four years (COP 66 trillion in 2010 against 112 trillion in 2014). It is also important to
reiterate that the fiscal rule enjoys broad support among key actors in Colombia and the
government is fully committed to meeting its targets.
Financial sector
The financial sector continues to be sound, with healthy corporate and households
balance sheets, strong credit quality and profitability. The solvency ratio of close to
15 percent is well above the regulatory minimum (9 percent) and, since August 2013, it
complies with the quality of capital required by Basel III. Colombian credit institutions
hold ample liquidity and are required to satisfy a liquidity indicator in line with the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio of Basel III. Liquidity regulation for non-banking institutions is
being evaluated and enacted. Currency and maturity mismatches of financial
intermediaries are closely monitored and regulated.
The recent expansion of Colombian banks in Central America takes advantage of longterm business opportunities and diversifies some risks for financial conglomerates,
although it poses challenges for regulators and the Central Bank. The authorities have
acknowledged this new source of risk, and have undertaken mitigating actions. Firstly,
closer ties with monetary and financial supervision authorities in Central America have

sustainability added as a principle in the Constitution and Royalties Reforms.

4
been established with the purpose of obtaining and sharing more and better information;
secondly, Colombia’s international reserves position has been reinforced.
Medium-term challenges
The Colombian authorities concur with staff on the important challenges ahead, and want
to underscore the progress achieved in deepening inclusive growth and addressing
infrastructure gaps.
Unemployment has continued to decrease, and reached in 2013 a historically low level of
9.6 percent. More importantly, job creation has been mainly in the formal sector
(bolstered by the 2012 tax reform which significantly reduced labor costs) representing
an enormous change in the Colombian labor market. In addition, poverty and extreme
poverty have constantly declined and income inequality has improved. A further
substantial reduction of inequality is envisaged in the next years as result of the full effect
of the 2012 tax reform, whose main purpose was redistributive. In addition, the programs
adopted by the government to broaden pension’s coverage for the population that does
not qualify for a pension as well as to strengthen financial inclusion will also contribute
to reduce inequality. Finally, the government has put in place an ambitious infrastructure
project (four generation) through APPs that is expected to boost competitiveness and
growth.
