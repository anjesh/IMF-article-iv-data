STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 21, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: The economy has slowed markedly due to a confluence of
structural, external and other factors. Recent measures taken by the authorities have
boosted confidence, but the near-term outlook is for a subdued recovery with stillelevated inflation as investment has been significantly hit and supply bottlenecks will
ease only slowly. Risks are on the downside, but stronger structural reform could lead to
better outcomes.
Structural Reform: Building on recent progress is crucial, especially to address supply
constraints in energy and move the pricing of various natural resources toward a market
basis. Progress on taxation, land acquisition, and labor market reform, along with 12th
Plan goals on infrastructure, skills mismatches, and social outcomes, are necessary to
return to a rapid rate of growth and poverty reduction.
Demand-Management Policies: The Finance Minister’s renewed commitment to fiscal
consolidation is welcome, as is the plan to switch to cash transfers, which should
improve expenditure efficiency over the medium term. Sustainable fiscal consolidation
and reorientation of spending toward investment and social sectors, however, will
require tough choices on subsidy reform and an overhaul of taxation. Maintaining policy
interest rates unchanged until inflation is clearly on a downward trend is the best way for
monetary policy to support growth. The floating rupee and continued prudent
liberalization of the capital account will improve resilience to external shocks.
Financial Reforms: Tightening mechanisms to address deteriorating asset quality will
promote healthier banks’ balance sheets, but supporting faster growth and reaching
Basel III targets will also require capital injections in public banks. In addition, addressing
concentration risks, strengthening creditor rights, and supporting capital market
development will lay the groundwork for a stronger recovery.

CONTEXT
1.
After growing strongly before and after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), India’s
economy has slowed substantially. Growth averaging 8½ percent and expanding social programs
lowered the poverty rate by 1.5 percentage points per year in 2004–09, double the rate of the
preceding decade, as shown by the latest quinquennial household survey. Growth returned to this
level for two years after the GFC, but decelerated throughout 2011, slumping to only 5.4 percent in
the first three quarters of 2012.1 Though India’s growth remains among the highest in the world, the
recent slowdown—due to structural factors such as supply constraints and an unsupportive policy
environment, with cyclical and global factors also contributing—is unusual among emerging markets
(EMs) for its still-high inflation. Nevertheless, the 12th Five Year Plan, expected to be published by
end-2012, will likely continue to aspire to growth above 8 percent and to significant improvements in
social indicators.

The economy is in a weaker position than before the GFC, with strictly circumscribed
policy space and greater domestic and external vulnerabilities. Inflation and the fiscal deficit
remain among the highest in EMs. At the same time, the financial positions of banks and corporates,
both strong before 2009, have deteriorated. The current account deficit (CAD) widened to 4.2 percent
of GDP in 2011/12 and other external vulnerability indicators have deteriorated, which led to a sharp
depreciation of the rupee in 2011 and early 2012.
3.
The authorities are keenly aware of the situation and have moved in recent months to
reverse the slowdown and lower vulnerabilities. Measures taken include higher diesel prices and
quantity limits on subsidized LPG, two challenging but essential measures to rein in the fiscal deficit.
The government announced further liberalization of FDI and a plan to restructure the debts and
reduce the losses of state power distribution companies (discoms), and has just announced a Cabinet

The discrepancy between the growth rates derived from the supply side and expenditure side has increased in recent
quarters, complicating the assessment of the economy. Supply side data, which are used in this report, are deemed to
be more reliable.

Committee on Investment (CCI), enabling single-window approval for large projects. The new Finance
Minister (FM) is strongly committed to a medium-term deficit reduction plan. These and other
measures have achieved a remarkable turnaround in market sentiment, but all eyes are on the
government to deliver on its commitments before the national elections due by May 2014.

4.
GDP growth has slowed more than
external factors can explain. Falling infrastructure
and corporate investment led the slowdown, though
exports and private consumption are now also
suffering (Figure 1). Global factors have hurt exports
and weighed on investment, but India’s growth has
slowed by more than the decline in trading partners’
growth would imply. Capital inflows remain resilient
and international financing conditions favorable,
suggesting that so far the financial channel has not
been prominent in the transmission of external
shocks (Figure 2).

5.
Fiscal and monetary policies have neither aggravated nor significantly alleviated the
slowdown. The slow consolidation following the large crisis-period stimulus means that fiscal policy
has not tightened, and this year’s impulse will be around ½ percent of GDP (Figure 3). After remaining
mostly negative since the GFC, the tightening of monetary policy in 2010–11 has increased short-term
real interest rates to levels similar to those seen before the GFC (Figure 4). But with the Reserve Bank
of India’s (RBI) 50 basis point (bp) cut in April 2012, a cash reserve ratio (CRR) now 150 bp lower than
at end-2011, and the depreciation of the rupee, monetary conditions have eased.
6.
Market sentiment has improved, but elevated inflation and twin deficits weigh on
investor confidence. Financial markets rallied following the government’s recent measures, but
market participants are looking for progress on implementation and additional policy actions to
sustain momentum. Also, concerns remain about inflation persistently above the RBI’s objectives,
repeated fiscal slippages, the widening CAD, and a possible credit rating downgrade.2
7.

Several causes of the weaker growth seem to be of a supply-side nature.

India has a BBB- sovereign credit rating. Moody’s has recently reaffirmed a stable outlook, while S&P and Fitch have
a negative outlook.



Rising policy uncertainty. In particular, high profile tax policy decisions announced in the
2012/13 Budget have reduced foreign investors’ interest in India, while the increasing
difficulty of obtaining land use and environmental permits have raised regulatory uncertainty
for infrastructure and other large-scale projects.3



Delayed project approvals and implementation. As a reaction to recent high-profile
governance scandals, project approvals, clearances, and implementation have slowed sharply.



Supply bottlenecks are particularly pronounced in mining and power, with attendant
consequences for the broader economy, especially manufacturing (Box 1).

With investment particularly
hard-hit, potential GDP is likely to be
lower than previously estimated. High
frequency indicators have stabilized, but
new investment project announcements
are sharply down and more projects are
being stalled or shelved. Increasingly,
analysts and policymakers are marking
down India’s growth potential. IMF
estimates are in the 6–7 percent range,
from 7.5 to 8 percent in recent years’
consultations (Box 2). Further, elevated
inflation points to still-binding supply
constraints.

9.
The domestic implications of India’s slower growth could be far-reaching, though
potential international spillovers are likely limited. Scant data on employment notwithstanding,
lower medium-term growth might not generate sufficient jobs to absorb labor market entrants.
Weaker growth also entails a slower reduction in poverty. IMF research suggests that 35 million more
people would remain below the $1.25/day line compared to a scenario in which growth returns to the
2004–09 average (Box 3). On the other hand, India’s imports account for 2.6 percent of global imports,
so direct spillovers to other countries are likely to be contained. Estimates from a three-region Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model suggest a 2.5 percentage point growth slowdown in
India (equal to this year’s projected growth compared to the 8 percent average of 2007–11) is likely to
have a 0.05 percent impact on Euro area growth and 0.03 on the growth of the rest of the world. The
impact, however, is likely to be larger for some low-income countries and the South Asian economies,
especially Nepal. Staff estimate that growth in South Asian economies could decline by about

Observers interpreted these tax measures as bringing certain activities into the tax net that were previously
considered offshore, with some retroactive elements. These measures are currently being reassessed.

Box 1. India’s Energy Sector
India has a substantial electricity deficit. Electricity demand growth has outstripped growth in
energy generation.1 Along with underinvestment in transmission and distribution, this has led to
frequent blackouts, and occasional large blackouts such as the near-nationwide event of July 2012.
Investment in generation capacity has risen by about half since 2006/07, but some of the new plants
have not been commissioned, as securing coal supplies has become increasingly difficult and their
customers, local power utilities (discoms), cannot afford market rates for power. As a result, power
deficits have continued to rise and are

with regulatory delays (mainly

environmental clearances) have
resulted in a widening gap between
coal production and demand. Despite having the world’s fifth-largest coal reserves, India imports
around one-fourth of its coal. Some coal fields are also allocated to specific power plants, but even
in these cases, supplies are often underutilized. In addition, domestic coal prices are fixed by CIL well
below international prices, reducing the profits of generation plants planned on domestic coal, but
which now depend on imports, whose prices have risen to pre-crisis highs.

Electricity distributors are generally loss-making. Discoms, almost all of which are publicly
owned, buy electricity from producers at market prices. But discoms’ tariffs, which need to be
approved by state regulatory bodies, are for the most part below cost-recovery levels even after this
year’s tariff increases, leading to large and long-standing losses. Discoms’ losses also result from
high transmission losses and other inefficiencies.
These distortions have had knock-on effects on the economy. The slowdown in energy and coal
projects has been a key cause of weak infrastructure and corporate investment. Resulting electricity
shortages have lowered production and added to companies’ costs. Delayed or shelved power
projects and discoms’ difficulties—though restructuring of their debts has now begun—have
contributed to deteriorating asset quality at banks.

Slowing growth coupled with elevated inflation
has raised questions about India’s growth story.
Consensus Forecast growth projections for this year
and next have been lowered substantially, while
inflation projections have been raised. Even though
some have attributed this slowdown to global
conditions and demand-side factors, increasingly,
analysts, observers, and policymakers are
questioning India’s potential growth. Only a year
ago, estimates of India’s potential growth were in
the 8–9 percent range, with some forecasting India
overtaking China. JP Morgan has put potential
growth at 6–6.5 percent and other analysts have
also suggested a decline. The RBI, acknowledging
the impact of structural factors, has lowered its
estimate of potential growth to 7 percent from its
earlier 8 percent, and the Prime Minister Economic
Advisory Council estimates a fall of over
1 percentage point in potential growth. However,
the forthcoming 12th Plan is likely to aim at
8 percent growth.

evidence that the current slowdown has an
important structural component. Inflation
continues to be elevated. Surveys indicate that despite declining growth, delivery times have not
improved and work backlogs have risen. Also, binding supply constraints are translating into higher
imports (coal is the most obvious example). As the decline in investment trend growth affects potential
growth with a lag of around eight quarters, unless investment revives soon, GDP growth over the next five
years is likely to be affected. Also, the sharp decline in infrastructure investment is likely to lower
productivity growth in many sectors, keeping potential growth relatively subdued.

Box 3. The Evolution and Outlook for Poverty1
High growth during 2004–09 accelerated
poverty reduction. Compared to the previous
decade, the rate of poverty reduction doubled,
with the share of the population living below
the poverty line falling from 41½ percent in
2003/04 to 32½ percent in 2009/10—more
than during the previous decade.2 As shown by
the most recent quinquennial household survey
by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO),
poverty declined sharply in both rural and
urban areas. Although the average annual rate
of poverty reduction was ½ percentage point
higher in rural areas, the gap between the rural
and urban areas widened with the ratio of rural
to urban average per capita consumption
declining from 0.53 in 2004/05 to 0.49 in
2009/10. Also rural inequality declined
marginally, but urban inequality increased.
The current slowdown in growth, if
protracted, would severely hamper poverty
reduction. Using the long-term estimate of the
growth elasticity of poverty reduction
(proportional change in poverty per unit
growth in GDP per capita) of 0.5, which is lower
than other EMs, the current subdued economic
outlook implies a 30 percent lower reduction in
the poverty headcount ratio by 2015 compared
to a scenario in which growth remains at the
2004–09 average.

75 to 67 percent in recent years, but a shock to
growth or continued high deficits would cause the burden to rise. In addition, public bank
recapitalization and the assumption of discoms’ debts will add to public debt. The Statutory Liquidity
Ratio (SLR) requires banks to hold at least 23 percent of their liabilities in the form of government
securities, moderating interest rates, but a rise in the deficit could crowd out private investment.
11.
Entrenched inflation is constraining the room for monetary policy easing. Despite some
moderation, WPI inflation is still at 7.25 percent and CPI inflation at 9.9 percent.5 After easing in early
2012, momentum, including for core, remains strong. Wage growth is still reported in double digits,
and household inflation expectations have softened, but are still at 11–12 percent. The effects of the
recent fuel and energy price increases and rupee depreciation have not yet been fully felt. High
inertia is likely to keep inflationary pressures strong until the output gap widens sufficiently to ease
them.

C. Weaker Financial Positions of Corporates and Banks
12.
Corporate financial positions have weakened considerably, further dimming the
outlook for investment and heightening vulnerabilities. Profitability, which had recovered after
the GFC, has weakened mainly due to weaker internal and export demand, bottlenecks, slow

implementation of Basel III by 2018, without dilution of government ownership and assuming
20 percent growth in risk weighted assets, could necessitate government capital injections of about
1 percent of GDP.7 In addition, the October 2012 GFSR noted that India, together with other EMs, is in
the late stages of the credit cycle, suggesting NPAs and debt restructurings are likely to continue
rising. And with growth likely to be weaker for a longer period than after 2008/09 and the loan
composition of banks more skewed toward large loans, more restructured advances are likely to slip
into NPAs compared to the historical average of 15 percent.

vulnerabilities. A current account deficit of 3–3.5 percent of GDP is broadly consistent with India’s
relatively high growth and low capital-to-worker ratio. In the medium term, as supply-side constraints are
eased and external demand recovers, the highly diversified and fairly sophisticated nature of Indian
exports should lower the CAD, while the flexible exchange rate should continue to offset inflation
differentials. In the near term, however, the widening of the CAD at a time when growth and investment
are weakening has increased market concerns about external vulnerabilities and led to pressures on the
exchange rate. These concerns are partly related to the steady increase in recent years in debt liabilities in
the overall international investment position (IIP).

17.
Capital flows are shifting toward debt and reserve coverage is falling, but currently
overall external vulnerability remains manageable. Before the GFC, inward FDI more than financed
the CAD, but in 2011/12 covered only half (Figure 6). Debt flows, particularly short-term and in the
form of non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits, have partly compensated, but rising corporate foreign
borrowing, reportedly mostly unhedged, is a concern. The net IIP has deteriorated. While both assets
and liabilities have risen, external debt has increased by 53 percent in the past three years and is

compared to other EMs. Reserves coverage has fallen to 1.6 of the gross financing requirement from
4.3 in 2007 and 6 months of imports from 12 months in 2007, but the IMF composite reserve measure
suggests that India’s reserves remain adequate, taking into account the forward position and other
country-specific circumstances.
Box 4. External Balance Assessment
The External Balance Assessment (EBA) comprises three different methods for assessing the
appropriate current account and exchange rate compared to medium-term fundamentals and
appropriate policies.1

GDP, implying a current account
gap of 0.7 percent of GDP. The cyclically adjusted CAD is much lower than the actual as the
output gap is small relative to the rest of the world’s output gap and the terms-of-trade gap is
large. These results suggest that the real exchange rate is undervalued by 3.5–4.5 percent if the
current account gap is to be closed only through real effective exchange rate (REER)
adjustment.



The second method based on a REER regression derives the deviation of the REER from its
estimated equilibrium level, based on a set of fundamentals. This suggests that India’s REER is
overvalued by around 12 percent.



The third method is the External Sustainability approach, which computes the current account
balance that stabilizes the net foreign asset (NFA) position. According to this approach, India’s
current account norm is -2.3 percent of GDP, which is slightly lower compared to staff’s CAD
projection for 2017 (the outer year of the medium-term horizon when output gaps are
generally assumed to be closed). This is similar to the RBI’s finding that India’s sustainablyfinanced current account deficit is around 2.5 percent of GDP.2 Using this approach, the real
exchange rate is broadly in line with its medium-term equilibrium value.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
18.
Growth is projected at 5.4 percent this year, but should pick up to 6 percent in 2013/14. No
legislative changes are assumed in the baseline, but continued implementation of measures to facilitate
investment and slightly stronger global growth should deliver a modest rebound in the near term and
raise medium-term growth to the upper range of potential estimates. WPI inflation is projected at 7.8
percent by March 2013 and 7.2 percent by March 2014, above the RBI’s comfort zone of 4–4.5
percent, given that supply constraints will ease only gradually. The CAD should narrow marginally this
year to 3.9 percent of GDP, aided by falling gold imports, a weaker rupee, and broadly stable oil
prices. Though the market share of Indian exports has declined in recent quarters, with reduced
domestic constraints, India’s well-diversified and sophisticated exports are expected to pick up and
reduce the CAD over the medium term.
19.
Global risks are on the downside, while recent government action has mitigated
domestic risks (Box 5). According to the October 2012 World Economic Outlook, the probability of
global growth falling below 2 percent has risen to one in six. A major global financial shock would
present serious funding and liquidity risks for India. A sovereign downgrade would severely
complicate the financing of the CAD and debt refinancing. Higher oil prices remain an additional
downside risk, though one linked mainly to geopolitical developments. On the domestic front,
insufficient follow-through on recent reforms would be highly damaging as confidence has just
begun to revive. Failure to ease supply constraints, especially for power, would further weigh down
growth. Resorting to expansionary fiscal policy would exacerbate inflation and worsen the CAD. On
the upside, going beyond announced reforms or legislative progress, especially a comprehensive
subsidy reform, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), or land acquisition, would lead to higher growth
than in the baseline.
20.
The weaker macroeconomic environment magnifies the damage that potential negative
shocks might cause. While presently manageable, India’s CAD and its rising dependence on debt
finance amplify potential damage from a renewed bout of global financial turmoil or insufficient fiscal
consolidation. The scope for lower policy rates and especially wider fiscal deficits to cushion the blow
of a potential shock is small. Likewise, a boost in public banks’ credit, as happened in the aftermath of
the GFC, is inadvisable given the outlook for NPAs. If banks’ and companies’ balance sheets are not
strengthened, they can exert downward drag on the recovery over the medium term.

Authorities’ Views
21.
While supply-side factors might have had some role, the authorities emphasize the role
of cyclical and global factors in the current growth slowdown. They noted that India’s slowdown
is not that different from that experienced by other emerging economies. RBI’s analytical
work suggests that around a third of the slowdown in GDP growth can be accounted for by higher
interest rates, though they note that this is a recent phenomenon and agree that supply-side factors,
too, have played an important role in the recent investment slump. Also, the authorities believe that
long-term productive capacity has been less affected.

22.
The authorities expect a stronger recovery than staff. While the differences for 2012/13
are small, they view staff’s 2013/14 forecast as too cautious, pointing to several initiatives that should
spur investment and lead to higher growth and lower inflation. They remain concerned about the
CAD, due to weak global growth and inelastic demand for oil imports.
23.
The balance of risks has shifted away from the domestic economy and toward the globe.
With the reform momentum gathering pace, downside risks emanating from India have receded, as
has the possibility of a rating downgrade. Continued slow growth in developed economies and the
potential for serious disruptions in the U.S. and euro area are deemed the main risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Structural Policies and Supply Bottlenecks
24.
Addressing structural challenges in the power sector and in natural resources is key.
Almost all discoms have raised tariffs this year, but much more needs to be done to eliminate losses
as tariffs remain on average below cost recovery and inefficiencies high. Infrastructure connecting fuel
sources with power plants is an urgent problem hampering electricity generation. More broadly, the
pricing and allocation of a wide range of natural resources or goods immediately produced from
them such as coal, natural gas, electricity, and fertilizers, are subject to complex mechanisms and
regulations and are highly inefficient.
25.
Ensuring government decisions are expedited and improving governance are important
next steps. The new CCI, by facilitating environmental clearances and streamlining approval
processes, should help fast-track infrastructure projects. Greater policy predictability and uniform
enforcement, and simpler and more transparent administrative procedures are essential to revive
investment. The FM’s commitment to clarify tax provisions that added to policy uncertainty earlier this
year is welcome.
26.
Ensuring more rapid and inclusive growth will require building support for legislative
action. Reforming land acquisition and the GST are the priorities. Easing strict labor regulations will
be difficult, but is key to increase formal sector employment.8 Progress on state-center GST
negotiations and the New Manufacturing Policy are encouraging in this regard. In addition, reforms in
agriculture, improving health and education, and addressing skills mismatches are needed to increase
productivity and make growth more inclusive. These, along with infrastructure, are rightly emphasized
in the 12th Plan.

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities are taking important measures to tackle supply-side problems. Noting
the boost to market confidence, the authorities emphasize that recent measures have sent an
unequivocal signal of their determination to reverse the growth slowdown. Supply-side constraints
will gradually be eased through the many initiatives under way, as well as through the newly created
CCI. With most states having raised energy tariffs this year, discoms’ losses have diminished and their
improved financial health paves the way for resolving the problems of power producers. The
authorities also recognize that market-based pricing and allocation mechanisms would have to play a
bigger role in the area of natural resources.

goals. At around 0.6–0.7 percent a year, the FM’s
planned deficit reduction will be slower than that envisaged in early 2010 by the 13th Finance
Commission, but given slower growth, this is reasonable. The FM’s three percent of GDP mediumterm central government deficit is close to that proposed by the 13th Finance Commission and will
help rebuild credibility by establishing a fiscal anchor which, if public investment rises as envisaged
under the 12th Plan, will approximate a golden rule target. However, reaching this medium-term
target will likely take until 2016. The states’ deficit is likely to remain around 3 percent of GDP.

29.
A focus on sustainable reforms would rebuild confidence more than reaching deficit
targets with one-off measures. The FM has acknowledged that absent serious measures,
consolidation is unlikely, and endorsed the Kelkar Committee’s recommendations on improving tax
administration and disinvestment. However, reforming fuel and fertilizer subsidies should be the
central plank of expenditure rationalization as the Kelkar committee has recommended. With
spending pressures, such as for the National Food Security Bill, likely to rise under the 12th Plan, the
need to reorient expenditure toward socially and economically productive areas is vital.
30.
Raising revenues to pre-crisis levels has so far proved elusive. India’s revenue-to-GDP
ratio has fallen below peers’. The GST would be the most important reform, and would boost growth
through the creation of a single Indian market. While there are encouraging signs of a possible GST
compromise, the needed legislative changes require a qualified majority, and implementation is not

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

feasible even in 2013/14. For this reason, at the end of this fiscal year, if the economy has begun to
recover and no agreement is reached, it would be appropriate to raise excise taxes. Approving a new
Direct Tax Code with streamlined and smaller deductions will also help.
31.
Ensuring that consolidation supports growth and social goals will require
comprehensive subsidy reform. Recent staff analysis underscores that reorienting expenditure away
from untargeted transfers, such as India’s fuel subsidies, and government consumption and toward
targeted transfers and investment can have strong positive effects on growth (Annex II). On fuel
subsidies alone, which are broadly regressive, India currently spends around 2 percent of GDP,
including amounts covered by upstream oil companies (Annex III). Introducing market pricing for fuel
while protecting the poor would also help reduce fiscal vulnerabilities to oil prices and the exchange
rate and lower the CAD. Recognizing the importance of raising spending efficiency, the government
has announced a plan to gradually implement direct cash transfers using India’s impressive Unique
Identification Number (UID), beginning in 2013 in selected districts. As this capability is broadened
and targeting improved, the resulting fiscal space should free resources for investment and
strengthening the social safety net.
32.
Cross-country experience highlights key elements of successful subsidy reform.
Embedding subsidy reform within a comprehensive structural reform agenda aimed at addressing
supply-side inefficiencies and bottlenecks can generate broad public support. Successful subsidy
reforms in Brazil, the Philippines, South Africa, and Turkey were part of broad overhauls of the energy
sector. An effective public information campaign should clearly identify the shortcomings of subsidies
and explicitly link planned increases in priority public spending to savings from subsidy reform.
Subsidies should also be one component of a comprehensive agenda aimed at strengthening the
safety net, including specific mechanisms for compensating the poor.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The government is strongly committed to reaching this year’s 5.3 percent of GDP
modified budget deficit target. Recognizing the overhang from the 2008/09 crisis, they stress that
the political risk taken in raising diesel prices indicates clearly their commitment to fiscal
consolidation. While acknowledging that tax revenues are likely to be affected by the slowing
economy, they believe that this, as well as potential overruns in subsidies, can be countered by
identified savings on Plan spending, stronger tax administration efforts, and innovative disinvestment
modalities, containing this year’s overrun to around ¼ percent of GDP compared to the budget.
34.
The medium-term consolidation plan is also attainable. The FM’s medium-term
consolidation roadmap demonstrates that the government attaches the highest priority to lowering
deficits to bring the economy back on a high growth trajectory. The authorities believe that stronger
growth will buoy tax revenues, allowing fiscal consolidation to be accompanied by a pro-growth and
pro-poor reorientation of spending. On subsidy reform, various pilot schemes are under way to move
toward direct cash transfers and the use of the UID to replace current delivery mechanisms. They
expect that by 2016/17 cash transfers are expected to be in place for key subsidies, which will reduce

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

INDIA

the fuel and fertilizer subsidy bill. The authorities also remain focused on introducing the GST, which
should greatly improve efficiency and support revenues.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
35.
With inflation still high, monetary policy can best support growth by staying the course.
Growth has slowed more than expected and is below even the lowest estimates of potential growth,
with sizable downside risks. Also, as high nominal lending rates are hurting highly leveraged
corporates, there is a strong expectation for the RBI to cut policy rates further to support growth.
However, interest rates do not seem to be a major cause of the investment slowdown, and it is
unlikely that lowering them before other roadblocks are removed would spur investment (Box 6).
Despite some moderation, inflation pressures remain significant, and short-term real interest rates are
barely positive. Inflation inertia is strong, and a disinflation to 5–6 percent, a level not associated with
detrimental effects on growth, would require perseverance with a sustained period of relatively
subdued aggregate demand. 9 Hence, on balance, it is appropriate to keep policy rates at current
levels until the inflation decline is clear and sustainable.

Hence, it would be desirable for the RBI to express

its projections and objectives in terms of the
national CPI as soon as the data allow. Additionally, the RBI could maintain rolling one-year
projections, and, while taking high inertia into account, explain a credible path toward the RBI’s
longer-term goal of 3 percent.

37.
The floating rupee is an important shock absorber. Rupee flexibility has offset inflation
differentials and prevented exchange rate misalignment. Such flexibility would be particularly
important in case of renewed global financial stresses. Going forward, lower inflation and a lower
fiscal deficit would reduce external vulnerabilities, as will easing supply bottlenecks that would reduce
import demand and spur exports. Consideration could also be given to promoting financial
instruments—such as inflation-indexed bonds—to reduce gold demand as an inflation hedge.

In line with previous RBI studies, India Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV consultation (Box 5, IMF Country Report

No. 12/96) found that inflation above 5–6 percent hurts growth.

The recent investment slowdown has
sparked an intense debate in India about
the role of interest rates. Economists
typically argue that real interest rates have
been low, even though nominal rates have
gradually risen after the substantial easing of
2008/09. On the other hand, some
representatives of the business community
maintain that high nominal lending interest
rates have been an important cause of the
investment slump. Not surprisingly, the two
groups argue for different courses of
monetary policy.

cyclical factors impede output price adjustments, sector-specific real interest rates exceed real
interest rates based on aggregate inflation expectations.

Staff analysis suggests that real interest rates explain economy-wide investment activity
better than nominal interest rates.3 The overall fit of the investment equation improves when
real interest rates are included relative to the nominal interest rate specification.

Staff estimate that about one quarter
of the explained slowdown in
investment growth can be attributed to
higher real interest rates. Importantly,
the regression analysis explains over half
of the total investment slowdown
witnessed during this period, but
systematically over-predicts investment in
the past two years, suggesting that other
factors, such as supply bottlenecks, are
also at play. An alternative estimate,
based on a structural VAR, confirms these
findings.

Further opening of FDI and local capital markets is welcome, but certain relaxations of
external commercial borrowing (ECB) can increase external vulnerabilities. Greater FDI
liberalization could increase this more stable funding source. In addition, continuing to raise the
Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) debt quotas contributes to deepening domestic capital markets.
While this may increase domestic interest rate volatility, it provides financing with foreign investors
bearing the FX risk. The authorities have also relaxed several ECB regulations, including for sectors
without natural FX hedges. And the lower withholding tax on rupee corporate bonds is a positive
step, but the framework is still skewed toward ECBs, especially loans. Finally, the flexible rupee has
increased incentives to hedge, but with corporates still reported to have substantial unhedged FX
exposures, some easing of restrictions that have reduced the depth of the onshore FX forwards and
futures markets would be beneficial. In the longer run, inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices
would attract funds from long-term investors, and the requirements for this could be explored.

Authorities’ Views
39.
The RBI emphasizes that inflation and inflation expectations have moderated, but
remains concerned about the level of inflation. The RBI deems that pricing power has diminished,
that much of the inflationary effects of the rupee depreciation have worked through the economy,
and that the pass-through from food and other commodity prices to broader inflation is relatively
weak, making inflation dynamics more favorable going forward. However, the RBI views the
persistence of inflation, which it attributes in part to supply constraints, in the face of weak growth as
a key challenge.
40.
As inflation eases further, the RBI sees an opportunity for monetary policy to be eased.
The RBI sees contrasting forces shaping the inflation outlook. Slower growth and excess capacity in
some sectors are expected to lower inflation, while supply bottlenecks and wage increases could keep
inflation pressures elevated. On balance, the RBI expects inflation to recede after the administrative
price increases to fuel and electricity have fully passed through and has provided guidance for policy
easing in the first quarter of 2013.
41.
The RBI will continue its multiple-indicator approach and does not see an immediate
need for broadening inflation guidance. Communication has recently been shifted toward the CPI,
but the RBI will continue to use its multiple-indicator approach in assessing inflation dynamics and
trends. While acknowledging this complicates effective communication, they note that the short time
series for the CPI makes it as yet inadequate as a headline measure, though its role is expected to
increase over time. Uncertainty about the patterns and magnitude of seasonal effects, such as the
monsoon, complicates both rolling y/y projections and momentum indicators, which can be biased by
miss-estimation of underlying seasonal factors and would undermine the credibility of the RBI.
42.
The authorities are concerned about external vulnerabilities. While they agree that the
current account for the time being can be financed, they deem that with GDP growth at about
7 percent, the sustainable current account is -2.5 percent of GDP. They point to still-high commodity
prices, especially for oil, and strong demand for gold as significant risks to the external outlook. The
authorities note that the RBI’s policy of allowing the rupee to float freely means that reserves are no
longer being accumulated, and that while reserves ratios are therefore falling, they remain adequate
to face sudden stops in capital flows and counter increased exchange rate volatility.
43.
The rupee will continue to float, and further capital account liberalization will be
undertaken cautiously. The RBI remains committed to allowing the rupee to float. The authorities
plan to continue their focus on liberalizing capital inflows with a view to facilitating the financing of
infrastructure and building the corporate bond market while paying attention to prudential aspects.
Similarly, some relaxation of restrictions on FX forwards might be considered, but will depend on the
volatility of the exchange rate.

D. Financial Policies
44.
With credit risks rising, mechanisms for addressing deteriorating asset quality should
be tightened. The RBI is considering the Mahapatra WG’s recommendations, which would constitute
improvement. These, however, would still leave India’s treatment of restructured assets relatively
lenient, as best practices suggest bank portfolios should recognize true asset quality. Restructured
loans should generally be classified as nonperforming upon restructuring, and categorized as
performing only after a period of satisfactory performance. This would likely require greater loss
write-offs and higher provisions. Favored sectors, such as infrastructure, should not receive
preferential treatment. In addition, strengthening the credit culture could reduce the incidence of
NPAs in priority sector lending, which are now responsible for about 50 percent of total public banks’
NPAs. Finally, the FSAP recommended improving the performance and financial strength of public
financial institutions and subjecting them to full supervision and regulation.
45.
Medium-term capital requirements for public banks could be higher than currently
estimated. The table below shows the results from converting 15, 30, and 45 percent of restructured
assets into NPAs, with these assets provisioned at each institution’s current provisioning rate, but at a
minimum of 70 percent. In the 45 percent case, public banks’ average tier 1 capital adequacy ratio
would fall to 7.4 percent, below the 8 percent required for a bank to be considered well-capitalized
under Basel III as of January 2015. The percentage of public sector banks below 8 percent Tier 1
capital would be 90 percent of the total, with 10 percent of public sector banks below the 10 percent
threshold for well-capitalized banks’ Tier 1 and Tier 2 ratio. If capitalization needs for public banks
prove challenging, consideration should be given to reducing the government’s stake.

Reducing concentration risk is necessary to support higher growth and broader access
to credit. Large and related party concentration exposure limits remain inconsistent with
international practices, and resulting high exposures curtail the ability of banks to underwrite new
investment, especially in large projects such as infrastructure (Annex IV). To reduce concentration
risks, advances and commitments to interrelated companies should be appropriately measured and
limited, and these limits enforced. Further development of the corporate bond market, which requires
domestic institutional investors’ greater participation and greater liquidity—most likely from FII
participation—would advance this goal by supporting securitization and providing alternative long-

24

term financing. Further development of infrastructure debt funds should free space on balance
sheets, as would greater take-out financing, and credit enhancements for project financing.
47.
Strengthening creditor rights and the insolvency framework, as proposed by the FSAP,
has become more urgent. Stronger creditor rights would increase lenders’ leverage, providing
creditors with greater certainty of repayment and increasing recoveries, which now average well
below advanced-economy levels. This would also constitute a step toward a better functioning
corporate bond market and distressed asset market. Additional incentives that could facilitate deeper
corporate restructuring as opposed to debt rescheduling and induce the resolution of impaired assets
could be considered.
48.
Over the medium term, other financial sector reforms, especially lowering the SLR, are
important to lower the cost of capital for companies and broaden access to financial services.
The SLR lowers borrowing costs for the government while keeping them high for private companies
(Box 7). As fiscal deficits decline, the SLR should also be gradually reduced, freeing financial
institutions’ funds for loans to companies and households. Lowering the SLR, along with reducing
similar mandates on institutional investors, will also help develop the corporate bond market.
Approval of the Pension Fund Reform and Development Authority Law and modifying insurance
regulations would also encourage the growth of domestic institutional investors and deepen markets
for long-term borrowing.

Authorities’ Views
49.
The authorities agree that balance sheets have worsened, but believe that they do not
represent a systemic risk. Recent RBI stress tests for banks show that even under a scenario in which
30 percent of restructured advances become NPAs, which the authorities view as extreme, bank stress
remains contained and banks sufficiently capitalized. The authorities also underscore banks’ improved
risk management and supervisory authorities’ assiduous monitoring and strict enforcement. The RBI
also notes that from their extensive surveys the leverage of the broad corporate sector has not risen
and the increase in leverage concerns mainly large companies with relatively safe access to finance.
Hence, while the authorities are monitoring developments, they do not see this as an immediate risk.
50.
The regulatory framework for restructured assets continues to be refined. The
authorities have increased provisioning and focused on improved information sharing among banks.
They emphasize that debt restructurings most often follow unforeseen external developments that
have delayed project implementation, and are approved only when the bank determines that the
account become viable after restructuring. Further, loans in sensitive sectors (capital markets
exposure, personal loans, and commercial real estate) cannot be restructured in this way, due to
higher potential risks. The authorities agree, though, that the rising level of NPAs warrants further
provisioning, and note that further recommendations of the Mahapatra WG are under consideration.

The Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) in India entails
large holdings of government securities on
financial institutions’ balance sheets. After being
reduced over time, the SLR currently requires banks to
invest 23 percent of net demand and time liabilities
(NDTL) in government securities (G-Sec). Also, banks
can keep 25 percent of NDTL in G-Sec without marking
to market. In addition, insurance companies and
pension funds have similar but higher requirements.
Based on these restrictions on portfolios, the effective
SLR for the whole economy is around 50 percent of
financial sector liabilities, providing an assured source
of financing for the government.

An estimated DSGE model is used to analyze the SLR
impact on the economy. The model assumes that the
SLR is binding and financial institutions are profitmaximizing. Banks’ holding of G-Sec has exceeded the
mandated SLR requirement because only G-Sec in
excess of SLR can be repoed for liquidity management.
While it is difficult to determine whether the SLR binds
in practice, there are indications that it is binding at
least for some institutions, especially private ones. Even
if banks were to continue holding G-Sec once the SLR is
lowered, they would likely do so at a higher yield.

The SLR is found to lower government borrowing costs,
while increasing those for the private sector. A 10 point
reduction in the effective SLR is likely to lower the borrowing costs for the private sector by around
100 bp, while increasing the borrowing costs for the government by 50 bp over the medium term.
Lower borrowing costs could result in a 5 percent increase in investment over the medium term.
Similarly, in terms of welfare, a 10 point reduction in the effective SLR should improve welfare by
0.2 percent. In addition, the SLR is found to have increased external borrowing. The model suggests
that increased domestic borrowing costs and lowered availability of domestic financing due to the SLR
have encouraged corporates to borrow abroad. Staff’s model suggests that reducing the effective SLR
by 10 percentage points would reduce foreign borrowing by corporate by around 4 percent in the
medium term.

Capital market reform retains its high priority on the reform agenda. The authorities remain
committed to promoting the development of the corporate bond market, facilitating ways to free banks’
balance sheets to enable them to finance new infrastructure projects, and to broadening access to
financial services. They are planning to ease asset allocation norms for insurance companies and pension
funds and allow greater FDI in these sectors. They also expect that the planned infrastructure debt funds,
take-out financing, and the credit enhancement schemes being considered can help lower concentration
and sectoral exposures. The authorities note that the SLR has been lowered this year and that it could be
further recalibrated in accordance with evolving monetary and fiscal conditions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
The near-term outlook is for subdued growth and elevated inflation. Recognizing the
economy’s challenges, the authorities have announced measures to revive growth, and reiterated their
commitments to lowering the fiscal deficit and inflation. Nevertheless, as investment has been
particularly hit and supply constraints will likely be eased only gradually, the recovery is likely to be
muted and inflation and the current account deficit are expected to fall only gradually.
53.
Risks are on the downside, but upside risks have emerged. The uncertain global situation
could present serious challenges to India. At the same time, the macroeconomic environment reduces
the scope for policy response. Ongoing structural reforms present both upside and downside
opportunities: a faster pace of reform could entail higher growth, while insufficient follow-through would
weigh heavily on the outlook.
54.
Delivering on structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, and low inflation are critical for a
sustained recovery. Weak demand is not the main cause of the slowdown and, with little space for
countercyclical action, policy stimulus through fiscal or monetary expansion is inadvisable. Maintaining
reform momentum, delivering durable fiscal adjustment, lowering inflation, and addressing
vulnerabilities will return India to high growth, even against the backdrop of lackluster global growth.
55.
The government has put the reform process in motion, and the next steps should aim at
issues in energy and natural resources. Measures taken have begun to improve the business climate.
Further boosting growth will require addressing shortcomings in the energy sector, such as through full
cost-recovery pricing and greater efficiency of electricity distribution companies and addressing power
plants’ fuel linkages. More broadly, moving the pricing and allocation of natural resources toward a
market basis would improve transparency and efficiency, boosting investment.
56.
Addressing additional structural roadblocks and long-term challenges is also crucial.
The newly created CCI is expected to accelerate approvals for large investment projects. Greater
policy predictability is needed to boost investor confidence. Legislative action such as the Goods and
Services Tax (GST) and an effective land acquisition law are priorities. In addition, easing restrictive
labor laws, as well as measures to support agricultural productivity, improve health and education
outcomes, and address skills mismatches, would contribute to making growth more inclusive.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

INDIA

57.
The government’s fiscal roadmap is welcome, but the quality and sustainability of
consolidation are more important than meeting short-term targets. The pace of consolidation,
particularly given the slowing economy, and the medium-term budget deficit target are appropriate.
Reaching the target will require revenue to rise to pre-crisis levels, through more efficient taxation
and ideally also through the GST. Though recent initiatives tying India’s safety net to the impressive
UID Program are encouraging, reorienting spending toward 12th Plan priorities without endangering
deficit targets requires comprehensive reform to fuel and fertilizer subsidies.
58.
The RBI’s vigilance on inflation will pay dividends for long-term growth. With financial
conditions still relatively easy, it is appropriate to maintain the current level of policy rates until
inflation is clearly on a downward trend. As data improve, shifting projections and guidance to the
new CPI will help anchor expectations, but in the meantime, the RBI should consider providing rolling
one-year ahead inflation projections.
59.
Rupee flexibility and continued gradual opening of the capital account are welcome,
though policies could be optimized to lower external vulnerability. From a medium-term
perspective, India’s external position is broadly in line with fundamentals and desired policies, but the
recent deterioration of the CAD exposes India to sudden stops in capital inflows and calls for policy
tightening, especially of fiscal policy, to reduce overall external vulnerability. Rupee flexibility will remain
important to offset inflation differentials and help absorb external shocks. Continued capital account
opening, particularly if focused on FDI and rupee bonds, would improve the current account deficit
financing mix and deepen domestic capital markets. But relaxation of external commercial borrowing
should be allowed cautiously, especially for sectors without natural FX hedges.
60.
Unless rising financial sector risks, especially concerning asset quality and
concentration, are decisively addressed, banks may be unable to support higher medium-term
growth. Full implementation of the RBI working group’s recommendations on restructured assets is
needed, as well as stricter classification, and higher provisions and loss write-offs without making
exceptions for favored sectors. Consideration should also be given to measures to facilitate deeper
corporate restructuring and to strengthen the insolvency framework. Large and related party
concentration exposure norms should be brought in line with international practices and interrelated
companies and FX exposures keenly monitored. As the FSAP recommended, improving the financial
strength of public banks is particularly important.
61.
Other financial sector reforms are needed to strengthen the financial system’s
contribution to growth. While currently well-capitalized, public banks will likely require substantial
capital injections. In addition, concentration of bank lending and the need to broaden access to credit
point to the need to deepen corporate bond markets. Over the longer term and as the fiscal deficit
falls, the statutory liquidity ratio should also be lowered.
62.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Figure 3. Fiscal Sector Developments
A slow consolidation after the financial crisis has come to a halt. Ensuring stable debt dynamics will
require measures to contain current expenditure and raise revenue.
The budget deficit has been falling only marginally since the
global financial crisis.

Following the rapid crisis-period expansion, the fiscal
stance has been broadly neutral.

Though they have moderated, inflation pressures remain sustained. Monetary conditions have eased.
However, as the output gap is expected to widen due to weak growth, keeping policy rate at current level
is appropriate.
Despite a moderation in late 2011, inflation remains
elevated and sticky...

External corporate funding creates the
potential for feedback loops between corporate
vulnerabilities and external shocks. Corporates rely
on foreign sources for around one-fifth of their financing, including ECB, FDI, and trade credits. Not
only has foreign financing grown, but ECB is also concentrated, with about a sixth of approved
foreign loans going to only 14 large conglomerates. BIS data show that nearly two-thirds of India’s
liabilities to BIS reporting banks are borne by nonbank companies, and these loans are for the most
part cross-border and predominantly short-term. In addition, debt service over the next two years is

2.
During the current slowdown, however,
various indicators of corporate health have
deteriorated, especially leverage. Domestic credit to
corporates continued to rise rapidly during and even
after the GFC, driven by public banks’ loans, especially
for infrastructure projects. In addition, ECB has risen by
48 percent in the past two years. As the equity market
saw little issuance after the GFC and stock price
performance has for long periods been lackluster,
corporate leverage rose. The (capital-weighted) mean
ratio of debt to equity for Indian nonfinancial
companies increased from 40 percent in 2001 to 83
percent in 2011. Indian corporates are now among the
most leveraged among EM peers. Finally, overall
leverage measures disguise substantial differences
across sectors: manufacturing and construction, where
infrastructure and power lending are concentrated,
display significantly higher ratios.

forecast at higher levels than during the GFC, and the maturity profile has steepened. Data
limitations prevent a full-fledged analysis of FX risk borne by corporates and about a fifth of ECBs
are FII holdings of domestic corporate bonds, which are in rupees. However, the RBI estimates that
up to 65 percent of FX borrowing of Indian corporations is unhedged, though this does not take
into account natural hedges.

Credit rating actions have reflected the deterioration in the corporate outlook, as have
market-based indicators of credit risk. Credit rating agencies’ downgrades have exceeded
upgrades and the annual default rate of companies has increased. Default probabilities as estimated
by Moody’s KMV have also begun to rise. Notably, although the KMV default probability for the
median firm remains below the levels reached during the GFC, the probability for the 90th percentile
is at similar levels, pointing to significant stress at the tail of the corporate distribution.

Some important corporate indicators
have deteriorated beyond values experienced
during the GFC. Declining profitability during the
recent slowdown has brought the earnings of
Indian corporations to the same level relative to
equity prices they were at before the GFC,
suggesting risk of stock price declines. The ability
to cover interest payments has also worsened,
with ICRs now generally worse than during the
GFC.

interest rates faced by Indian
corporates—a shock consistent with the rise in Indian short-term rates during the GFC—would also
lead to significant stress. The number of companies with ICRs below one would double. These
companies are generally highly leveraged, and as they would account for almost one-fourth of
corporate sector debt, the exposure of the financial system would be high. Combining this shock
with a 25 percent decline in operating profits –again comparable to the GFC - would raise the share
of debt held by companies with ICR below one to 37 percent. Not only is the share of corporates
with ICR below one greater today than during 2008/09, but the increases in corporate stress in
response to the shocks analyzed above are also greater now, indicating a more vulnerable corporate
universe than four years ago. At the time of the GFC, several companies also reported losses on their
FX exposure. Although data limitations prevent an analysis of an FX shock and complex FX
derivatives are currently less common than before the GFC, reports still indicate a significant share of
unhedged FX exposures, which would exacerbate corporate stress.

ANNEX II. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION IN INDIA:
OPTIONS AND STRATEGIES1
1.
Fiscal consolidation in India remains a key policy priority. The consolidation of the early
2000s under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) has not been repeated,
as weak revenue and ongoing spending pressures have kept deficits high. The decline in public debt
has slowed, and its continued downward trajectory is vulnerable to slower growth. High debt and
deficits constrain space for countercyclical policy and absorption of contingent liabilities. While
borrowing costs are contained via the Statutory Liquidity Ratio and other measures, high deficits can
crowd out investment. Recently, the government has endorsed a medium-term roadmap for deficit
reduction, but with the forthcoming 12th Plan aiming to raise spending for health, infrastructure and
education, expenditure will have to be reoriented within this shrinking envelope.
2.
This study explores options for India’s fiscal consolidation. It uses the micro-founded
DSGE approach of the IMF’s multi-region Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model (see
Berkmen 2011).2 The key features of the model are discussed in Kumhof et al. (2010).3 A threeregion setup is used, namely India, the euro area and the rest of the world. Results are gauged
relative to the steady state, calibrated on India’s medium-term outlook. Government consumption is
the largest component of spending, and consumption taxes are the principal source of revenue.
3.
Three consolidation scenarios are assessed. Each scenario reduces the deficit to the
steady state level in 5 years, the timeframe

This target is illustrative because the relationship between the size of the adjustment and the size of the response is
approximately linear.



Neutral consolidation: The neutral case cuts government consumption by 2 percent of GDP,
scales down untargeted transfers (namely through subsidy reform) by 2 percent of GDP, and
improves consumption tax efficiency by 1 percent of GDP.



Investment-friendly consolidation: The investment-friendly case cuts government
consumption by an additional 1 percent of GDP, raises the consumption tax take by
1 percent of GDP, reorienting the savings towards public investment.



Social- and investment-friendly consolidation: The third case assumes the same pattern of
consolidation as the “investment-friendly consolidation” scenario. However, the 2 percent of
GDP in additional savings from the consolidation measures are applied equally to public
investment and, via transfers to liquidity-constrained individuals, to the social safety net.

4.
Overall, cutting untargeted
transfers is the most growth friendly tool,
while lower investment is the most
damaging. For all instruments a standardized
shock of 1 percent of GDP is assumed. The
multiplier for each year is obtained as the
change in real GDP resulting from the shock.
In year 1, the multipliers for government
consumption and investment are the highest,
1 and 1½ respectively; that is, a 1 percent cut
in government consumption of investment
brings down GDP by an almost equal amount.
Transfers, on the other hand, produce smaller
multipliers of only around 0.2. These results
broadly corroborate recent RBI analytical
work1. The multiplier for the consumption tax
is estimated at 0.4 (Figure 1). However, over
the long run, the dynamics become more
complicated and vary across scenarios.
5.
Reorientation toward investment
spending minimizes short-tem negative
growth effects, while supporting faster
growth later. Under a trajectory where the
deficit falls by 1 percent a year, all three
scenarios lower debt by almost 30 percent of

GDP relative to the steady state over a 10-year horizon (Figure 2). Growth rates fall below the
baseline by less than 1 percent relative to the steady state in the short run as the supply-side
investment response is significantly less than the immediate aggregate demand effect. Under the
neutral case, output does not recover from this shock, as the adverse impacts of government
consumption cuts and consumption tax hikes accumulate. But in the investment-friendly case,
output bounces back after three years, and GDP growth is at almost 3 percent higher than the
steady state in year 10.5 Finally, output recovers more slowly in the social-friendly case, though still
at a faster pace than under the neutral consolidation.
6.
The pace of consolidation is also
important. The growth effect of stopping
consolidation and then having to backload it
later can be large. Compared to a
consolidation which stops and then restarts,
a frontloaded consolidation rapidly
stabilizes the debt ratio. A frontloaded
austerity plan pares debt ratios by an
additional 5 percent of GDP compared to a
uniform consolidation, though at a short-run
output cost of 1½–3 percent of GDP (Figure
3), with output recovering in the medium
term only under the investment-friendly
scenario. On the other hand, delaying
consolidation from Year 2 to Year 5
undermines debt reduction and postpones
the longer-term growth rebound by
two–three years (Figure 4). As before, the
investment and social-based adjustments
attenuate short-term losses and support
stronger longer-run recovery.

enhancing infrastructure, or attracting

productivity shock (specifically a 0.15 percent increase in labor-augmenting productivity for five
years in both tradable and nontradable intermediate goods sectors), debt and growth outcomes are

better than under a baseline without reform.6 Analogously, if productivity is shocked negatively, as
would be the case if reform momentum is reversed, growth is notably lower.
8.
Finally, global conditions
can facilitate or complicate fiscal
adjustment. India is an increasingly
open economy and is affected by
shocks emanating from the rest of the
world. To account for these risks,
upside and downside scenarios in the
global economy are added to fiscal
consolidation. As previously, in all
regions in the model, laboraugmenting productivity is positively
shocked (negatively for the downside
scenario) by 0.15 percent per year for
5 years in all production sectors.
Global conditions have little effect on
the debt path, but growth is stronger
(Figure 6). With high global growth,
short-term output costs do not occur,
but under a global recession, the
negative growth effects in India
associated with consolidation would
be prolonged.

consolidation. First, the potential
long-term benefits of fiscal consolidation are considerable despite the short-term costs.
Rationalizing subsidies and improving revenues will be key to a successful adjustment. Furthermore,
the most growth-friendly consolidation would require reorienting at least part of the savings
towards public investment. Well-targeted social programs for needy households can also help
attenuate the near-term pain from austerity. Policy experiments also show that a consistent deficit
reduction path, anchoring expectations through a credible plan, and pursuing accompanying
structural reforms to improve productivity can all also make consolidation significantly more
growth-friendly.

These effects are cumulative: productivity will be 0.75 percent higher indefinitely in both sectors after the fifth year.

ANNEX III. SUBSIDY REFORM IN INDIA

1

1.
India is a net importer of crude oil, and its oil industry features heavy public
involvement. India is the fourth largest global consumer of fuel products. Consumption of fuel
products increased by around 17 percent between 2006 and 2011, and stagnant domestic crude
production has resulted in increasing crude imports by refineries. The upstream sector (the
extraction of crude oil and natural gas) and downstream sector (refining and the selling of natural
gas and petroleum products) both feature significant state involvement. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)
is the only private sector company present at all levels.


Crude Oil. Two state-owned companies—Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) and
Oil India Ltd (OIL)—account for just over 75 percent of all extracted crude oil, with ONGC
alone accounting for nearly 65 percent. For natural gas, the share of private and jointventure companies has increased substantially in recent years, reaching over half of total
production by 2010.



Refining. The main public sector refining companies are Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOC), Bharat
Petroleum Corp Ltd. (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL). With output refined
by private firms increasing significantly since 2009, refining is now roughly equally divided
between the public and private refineries.



Distribution. To foster competition, in the mid-2000s the government authorized other
upstream and refining companies,2 both public and private, to distribute fuel products to
domestic consumers in competition with the three public sector refining companies (IOC,
BPCL and HPCL). However the largest oil marketing companies (OMCs), IOC, BPCL, and HPCL
still dominate the marketing side, controlling over 80 percent of the market.

2.
Some fuel prices in India are centrally administered, which has resulted in large price
subsidies for these products. Diesel prices are set centrally, with variations for transportation and
tax differences across the country. The prices of kerosene (distributed through the Public
Distribution System) and LPG (distributed through a network of private distributors) are also set
centrally, though in both cases there are some sales to non-eligible persons and businesses at
market rates. With administered prices not keeping pace with higher crude oil prices, these subsidies
have risen in recent years. OMCs are compensated for these losses through annual payments, and
the financing of these losses is shared between upstream oil producers and the central government

The fiscal cost of incomplete pass-through of international price increases has been
high, with underpricing significantly greater for LPG and kerosene than for diesel and
gasoline. Total subsidies rose from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2004/5 to 2.1 percent in 2008/9, and in
2011/12 were over 1.9 percent of GDP. The degree to which regulated fuel prices in India fall below
market prices can be approximated by estimating how much fuel would cost if it were imported.3
The figure below shows market parity and Delhi retail prices for diesel, LPG and kerosene, as well as
the difference between the two. Petrol, liberalized in 2010, is also shown for comparison purposes.
Until the liberalization of petrol in 2010, both diesel and petrol prices tended to move more closely
with market prices than LPG and kerosene, where underpricing has been significantly greater.

Given that India also exports many fuel products, a measure of export parity could also be considered. However
given that India is a net importer of petroleum products, import parity is also appropriate, and in any case, this
approach matches closely how the government of India calculates the underpricing of fuels. The formula used here
incorporates the freight-inclusive cost of comparable products refined in Singapore, adjusts for retailing margins and
for central government taxes as well as New Delhi taxes, and is comparable to the prices published on the website of
the Indian Oil Corporation.

However, with diesel accounting for a larger share of consumption of fuels, total
subsidies for diesel exceed those for LPG and kerosene. Total diesel sales, most of which are for
commercial purposes rather than for household consumption, are almost twice the combined
gasoline, LPG and kerosene sales4. Diesel prices (as of end-October-2012) were 20 percent below
import parity, while LPG and kerosene registered less than half of import parity. Given higher
volumes, diesel thus accounted for slightly more than half of the total estimated subsidy bill.
However, its smaller underpricing means that diesel price hikes, such as those taken in September
2012, have a larger effect on the total subsidy bill than those to LPG and kerosene.

The use of petroleum products differs with income. Poorer Indians use kerosene for
lighting and some for cooking, while richer households use electricity and LPG, respectively: the
share of kerosene in direct fuel consumption by households drops from nearly 90 percent for the
poorest group to just 2 percent for the richest. Expenditure on fuels by high-income Indians is
greatly weighted toward gasoline, which accounts for almost 2/3 of the fuel budget of the top decile
of households. LPG consumption also rises with income, but tapers off among higher-income
groups.

4

Recently, however, the liberalization of gasoline prices has led to increased purchases of diesel-power cars,
changing the balance somewhat.

economy, the average indirect effect on household

manufactured goods, and services. As expenditure
increases, the impact due to higher prices of food
diminishes from 60 percent of the total indirect

while that due to the price of manufactured goods and services increases correspondingly. As
second-round effects take root, the overall cost of living is estimated to increase by between 4.3–4.5
percent, exhibiting a moderately progressive pattern barring at the extremes, most noticeably for
the highest expenditure group.
9.
International experience provides useful lessons for promoting public support for fuel
subsidy reforms. Reform should be preceded by a public information campaign highlighting that
subsidies are fiscally costly, that the benefits are regressive and accrue mostly to higher income
groups, and that they crowd-out higher priority public spending (e.g., on education, health, social
protection, and public infrastructure). A clear reform plan should be developed and communicated
to the public, identifying a clear timeline for eliminating subsidies and key public expenditures that
will be financed by the resulting fiscal space. This plan should also specify measures to mitigate the
adverse impact of price increases on consumers, in particular lower-income households.
10.
Where subsidy reform involves large increases in fuel prices, these should be
implemented gradually to allow consumers to improve their energy efficiency and thus
mitigate the adverse impact of future rounds of price increases. Gradual reform also helps
reduce the impact on inflation. The reform can be sequenced by concentrating initial price increases
on fuel products that are less important for lower income households (e.g., diesel and LPG) and
more gradually increasing the prices of fuels that are more important for lower income households
(e.g., kerosene). This also allows time to strengthen the social safety net to protect households from
price increases, including through better targeting of fuel subsidies. Gradual reform can be achieved
through the adoption of an automatic pricing mechanism that adjusts retail prices according to a
predetermined schedule, but limits the magnitude of any single price increase.
11.
Similar reform strategies were used in a number of countries that have successfully
eliminated fuel subsidies and undertaken broader energy sector reforms. In the late 1990s, to
generate public support, both the Philippines and Turkey undertook extensive public information
campaigns setting out the motivation for energy sector reform, including energy price deregulation.
They both adopted an automatic pricing mechanism prior to the full liberalization of fuel prices in
the late 1990s and early 2000s. Prices were increased gradually over subsequent years and targeted
social safety net programs were scaled up to mitigate the adverse impact on lower income
households. South Africa has consistently applied an automatic pricing mechanism for fuel products
for a number of decades, with the objective of attracting private sector suppliers to the market by
ensuring import costs were fully passed through to consumers thus avoiding the accumulation of
subsidies. Brazil started sequentially deregulating the pricing for key fuel products in the mid-1990s.
Gasoline pricing was deregulated in 1996, LPG in 1998, and diesel in 2001. After the withdrawal of
LPG subsidies in 2001, the government introduced a new targeted LPG subsidy based on giving LPG
vouchers to low-income households. It also introduced a large targeted cash transfer program to
protect households from general price shock.
12.
While recent measures have helped address short-term fiscal pressures, a
comprehensive medium-term reform strategy needs to be developed. Gasoline prices were

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

liberalized in 2010. At the same time the government announced that diesel prices were also
liberalized in principle, yet diesel subsidies persist. However, recent increases in diesel prices have
helped to contain the increase in diesel subsidies and a 20 percent increase in regulated pump
prices would eliminate the subsidy completely. Quantity limits have been imposed for subsidized
LPG consumption starting from September 2012. A more comprehensive medium-term reform
strategy should set out plans for continued decreases in subsidies, their replacement with better
targeted subsidies, and the eventual liberalization of fuel prices.
13.
A medium-term reform plan should be built on recent recommendations for subsidy
reform. The 2011 Nilekani Interim Report of the Task Force on Direct Transfer of Subsidies on
Kerosene, LPG and Fertilizer suggested that replacing subsidies with cash transfers delivered directly
to households could substantially reduce their fiscal cost by eliminating the leakage that exists
under the current system through beneficiaries receiving multiple benefits (duplication) or benefits
for non-existent family members (ghost beneficiaries). Such a reform requires an effective
mechanism for identifying beneficiaries and delivering transfers. In this regard, the ongoing
nationwide rollout of India’s Unique Identification (UID) program, which will result in the biometric
identification of all Indians in the next few years, is extremely promising. The 2012 Kelkar Report of
the Committee on Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation recommended the broad use of UID to
overhaul subsidies, and set out a timeline for the elimination of diesel and LPG subsidies over a
period of three years and the reduction of more politically sensitive kerosene subsidies by one-third
over the same period. A number of pilot subsidy reform programs have started been implemented
in selected districts and the lessons from these pilots should be quickly incorporated into a carefully
planned and communicated reform strategy.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the
exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the
interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to
modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India
maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):
restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;
restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with
two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans
by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.

GROUP
In Bank FY12 (July 1, 2011–June 30, 2012), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$3.18 billion. IFC
committed US$960 million in FY12. The World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Strategy (CAS) for India
for 2009–2012 focuses on helping India to fast-track the development of much-needed
infrastructure and to support the low-income and special category states in achieving higher
standards of living for their people. The strategy envisaged a total proposed IBRD lending program
of US$11.6 billion for the four-year CAS period; in response to the financial crisis, the CAS envelope
was widened by approximately US$3 billion in additional IBRD financing. Midway through the CAS
implementation, the projected IBRD lending was revised upward to US$16 billion. India’s FY12–
14 IDA 16 allocation is SDR 3,348.3 billion (US$5,309 billion equivalent). India is IFC’s second-largest
country exposure in terms of disbursed and outstanding portfolio with commitments totaling
US$4.2 billion for IFC’s own account and US$558 million for the account of participants (as of
October 31, 2012).
In response to the financial crisis as well as increased Government demand for the Bank Group’s
support, the pace of IBRD lending accelerated in FY10–12, bringing India closer to its Single
Borrower Limit (SBL) of US$17.5 billion. To help maintain India’s IBRD net exposure within the SBL
and ensure medium-term sustainability of the India program, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the
central bank) has agreed in principle with the IBRD and the Bank for International Settlements to
purchase up to US$4.3 billion in IBRD Special Private Placement Bonds.
The overarching objective of the current CAS is to scale up the development impact of Bank Group
assistance to help India achieve rapid inclusive growth, sustainable development, and improved
service delivery. It aims to do this while strengthening project implementation, improving the
effectiveness of public spending, and achieving demonstrable results to scale up the impact of
World Bank assistance. The diversity of India calls for a differentiated, tailored approach. In India’s
low-income states and in lagging regions of more advanced states, the focus is on achieving the
MDGs, relying primarily on IDA resources and non-lending technical assistance. In more advanced
states and at the central level, the focus is on strengthening institutions so that they can deal with
emerging middle income challenges, relying on IBRD lending and cutting-edge analytical work. In
the context of WBG India CAS, IFC’s three strategic pillars are inclusive growth, climate change and
regional and global integration. IFC is prioritizing support for the low-income and North East States
in order to better promote inclusive growth.
The new India Country Program Strategy (CPS) for 2013–2016 is currently under preparation. The
overarching objective of the new CPS will be to support India in lifting more people out of poverty,
and ensuring that the new “non-poor” and their future generations have opportunities that would
allow them to prosper. The Bank’s engagement will be guided by the Government’s vision of how

best to use the financing and expertise from multi-lateral institutions to address India’s
development challenges. The program will focus on projects that are transformational, innovative
and/or those that leverage significant resources, both domestic and international sources and the
private sector. The approach allows for the application of selectivity principles across the pipeline of
projects and encourages scaling up efforts to leverage private finance with IBRD investments. IFC
will continue to encourage private sector commercial investment through mobilization, by
collaboration with leading banks and non-banking financial companies. It will support smaller
entities through direct equity or debt investment, provide targeted technical assistance and facilitate
global knowledge sharing. IFC advisory services will continue supporting investment climate reforms
in low-income states, providing sustainable business advisory, improving access to finance and
supporting public-private partnerships.

investment through the use of innovative business and financing modalities; (iii) Strengthening the
results orientation of project design and implementation and emphasizing knowledge solutions; and
(iv) Support for regional cooperation. The CPS has been designed to support Government of India's
efforts in facilitating inclusive growth and speeding up the pace of poverty reduction and social
development as emphasized in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–2012). It has been prepared within
a results-based framework, and aims at significantly strengthening AsDB support for infrastructure
development in the relatively poorer states of India, promoting public private partnerships in
infrastructure, supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation, and encouraging the use of
innovative financing modalities (non-sovereign loans and cofinancing) to enhance the leverage of
AsDB operations.

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for
timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor
market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country
Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices against
the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO)
releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination lag for
quarterly releases of two months. Large revisions to historical series and major discrepancies between
supply and expenditure national accounts complicate analysis: these differences have become larger
in recent quarters. Supply-side data remain of better quality than expenditure-side data. Estimates of
value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they
are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated
by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are
only available on an annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector,
which accounts for a small segment of the labor market.
4.
Price statistics: Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for industrial
workers with a 2001 base year. A revised all-India CPI with new weights was unveiled in early 2011.
Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of
consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and
rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. With the exception of the
industrial workers CPI, the other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI was
also recently revised and has a 2004/05 base year. Data are also subject to frequent and large
revision, usually upward. New RBI price series on residential real estate have helped surveillance in this
area, though geographic coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate are not
available. The RBI has started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps surveillance,
but economy-wide wage data are scant.
5.
External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of
payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM6). Furthermore, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

INDIA

trade prices, volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit
extended for more than 180 days is included in the balance of payments (and the IIP and external
debt data); trade credit is often less than 180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports
to the United States and other developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services
imports published by these same countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis
with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an
original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only
available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian
accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the
BPM6 and these data are disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual
data1. Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal
or institutional authority. India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date
information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and
SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement
on the RBI web site.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide array
of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,
monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started publishing a weighted
average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency. The frequency and quality
of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector
data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Specifically,
under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data
by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector (including other
financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).
Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis
only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has
initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous
paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to STA test
data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been

resulting in substantial differences.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities
in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling
and disseminating the GFS. India reports the budgetary central government cash flow statement
within one month after the reference month and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the
reference quarter. With the agreement of the authorities, STA uses these data to compile a monthly
cash flow statement for publication in the International Financial Statistics, following the GFSM 2001
presentation, with some missing breakdowns, particularly for expenditure. Data on fiscal performance
at the state level are available only at annual frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the
functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is
also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example,
classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and
plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central
government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY), the latest reported data corresponding to 2010. Two years after the reference year, the
Ministry of Finance reports general government data to STA in the GFSM 1986 format, that staff
reworks to the GFSM 2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY (latest reported data correspond to
2008). Data on the general government operations are not internationally comparable as they exclude
data on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security funds.
Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after the
reference year, using the timeliness flexibility option but meets the SDDS specifications for central
government debt and operations.

Consultation with India

ANNEX I. MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Macroeconomic Assumptions. Growth is forecast at 5.4 percent in 2012/13, and should slowly
return to trend in the medium term. The WPI is expected to fall from 7¾ percent at end-2012/13 to
around 5 percent in the medium term. This baseline scenario assumes continued implementation of
structural reforms that do not require legislative approval, and a relatively benign global scenario.
Fiscal Assumptions. The 2012/13 central government budget deficit is expected to reach
5.8 percent of GDP. This corresponds to 5.6 percent under the authorities’ definition. Over the
medium term, this is expected to decline slowly toward 5¼ percent of GDP, while state government
deficits should remain contained at or slightly below 3 percent of GDP.


Tax performance, especially for corporate income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as
ongoing administrative measures continue to be implemented. Base broadening is expected
to continue, but with exemptions from the services tax already quite limited, gains are
expected to be slight. GST is not assumed in this baseline as it requires legislative changes,
including a constitutional amendment.



At the same time, some savings are likely to be found from fertilizer and petroleum subsidies,
and the planned gradual introduction of cash transfers should help rationalize spending
over the medium term.



Other expenditures are expected to remain contained in the medium term, with current
expenditure rising modestly at the central government level and capital expenditure
remaining close to current levels.



Debt is expected to rise over the medium term by around 2 percentage points as public
banks are recapitalized to reach Basel III targets and as some of the debts of electricity
distribution companies are assumed by the government, in line with recent announcements.

A. Sensitivity Analysis
Baseline. India’s still relatively high nominal GDP growth means that its debt-stabilizing primary
balance is -4.7 percent of GDP. With the primary balance currently close to this level and expected
to improve in the medium term, the debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline modestly, at around 1–
1½ percentage points a year. After falling by just over 8 percentage points of GDP from its crisis
peak of 75.4 percent to a provisional 67.3 percent in 2011/12, due to high nominal GDP growth, the
debt to GDP ratio is forecast to fall by 7.2 percentage points by 2017/18, reaching 60 percent.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

Other Scenarios. A one-half standard deviation shock to GDP growth, which effectively would be a
continuation of the current slowdown, would end consolidation, and keep the debt ratio broadly
constant. With the primary deficit now slightly below debt stabilizing levels, a scenario of unchanged
policies would result in a marginal decline in debt over the medium term, while a half-standard
deviation shock to interest rates would not fundamentally alter the level or dynamics of debt.
Further contingent liabilities could arise from losses at public banks or other state-owned companies,
but even a large shock would have mostly a level effect on debt, and under conditions similar to the
baseline, the debt ratio would continue to decline.
Policy Risks. On the upside, better tax buoyancy, a GST and a new Direct Tax Code that improve
efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains, or a strong revival of the economy could return India
to the favorable debt dynamics prevailing before the crisis. On the downside, should diesel prices
again fall below global levels, savings not materialize from fertilizer and other fuel subsidy reforms,
or tax takes not return to pre-crisis levels, then debt dynamics would either stabilize at current levels
or possibly worsen.

1/ General government (Center and States); debt refers to gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on India
January 25, 2013
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic and financial developments
1.
Recent activity data point to a modest recovery. In sequential terms, industrial
production (IP) has grown for two consecutive months since October, but capital goods
production remains weak. PMI data indicate a further improvement in December. Negative
growth in mining and low electricity output growth suggest that supply-side bottlenecks persist.
2.
Headline WPI inflation has moderated, but CPI inflation has risen. In December,
headline and core WPI inflation declined to 7.2 percent y/y and 4.2 percent y/y, respectively.
National CPI inflation, however, accelerated to 10.6 percent y/y due to food and fuel prices.
The decline in WPI may be short-lived, as CPI trends inform inflation expectations and
wages. Market participants expect the RBI to cut rates in its January 29 review.
3.
The 2012Q3 current account deficit widened to 5.4 percent of GDP, but the
financing mix improved. Merchandise exports fell by 12.2 percent y/y and imports by
4.8 percent y/y. Moderate growth in remittances, weaker services, and a rise in net outflows
of investment income contributed to the increase in the current account deficit (CAD).
Though the trade deficit narrowed marginally in December, risks have increased that the
2012/13 CAD could exceed staff projections by ¼–½ percent of GDP. With net capital
inflows rising to US$24 billion in 2012Q3 from US$16 billion in Q2 mainly due to higher
FDI and a turnaround in portfolio flows, the balance of payments recorded a small deficit in
2012 Q3. The authorities have extended interest subsidies for exports until March 2014 and
introduced measures to enhance the flow of credit to the sector.
4.
Banks’ asset quality continued to deteriorate. Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs)
increased to 3.6 percent of total advances in September 2012 from 3.2 percent in June 2012,
while net NPAs increased to 1.7 percent from 1.5 percent in June 2012. Restructured loans
rose to 5.9 percent of loans in September 2012 from 5.4 percent in June 2012, with the public
sector banks continuing to experience the highest degree of deterioration in asset quality.
5.
Recent subsidy measures bode well provided implementation is sustained. On
January 17, 2013, the government increased flexibility in diesel pricing leading oil
companies to raise prices by half a rupee, and announced that bulk users of diesel would no
longer receive the subsidized price. At the same time, the number of cooking fuel cylinders
eligible for subsidized purchase was increased. The net impact for the current year would be
slightly less than 0.1 percent of GDP, but if diesel prices continue to be raised by the same
amount every month, these changes would result in savings of up to ¾ percent of GDP in
2013/14. Additionally, the government has begun implementation of direct cash transfers for

2
some social programs in 20 districts and has announced that it will expand these pilots as
well as the programs covered.
6.
Nevertheless, some overrun of the central government deficit target remains
likely. The budget deficit in the first eight months of 2012/13 reached 4.1 percent of GDP
and remains likely to overrun the government’s 5.3 percent full-year target, despite tightened
expenditure control. On the other hand, data also show that the deficit position of state
governments is better than previously estimated. Finally, the government announced changes
to its rules aimed at preventing tax avoidance, which will delay implementation until 2016
and reduce the impact on most institutional investors, reducing uncertainty.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with India
On January 25, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2013 Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
Although India’s growth remains one of the highest in the world, it has slowed markedly and
inflation remains elevated. The slowdown has been due to structural and supply-side factors,
with cyclical and global factors also contributing. Capital inflows remain resilient suggesting that
the financial channel has not been prominent in the transmission of external shocks. Mainly led
by falling infrastructure and corporate investment, the slowdown has now generalized to exports
and private consumption. The current account deficit widened to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12,
causing the rupee to depreciate sharply before its recent stabilization. The financial positions of
banks and corporates, both strong before 2009, have deteriorated. With policy space strictly
circumscribed because of high fiscal deficit and elevated inflation, the economy is in a weaker
position than before the global financial crisis. In recent months, the authorities have taken
steps to reverse the slowdown, which have led to improved market sentiment.
Growth is projected at about 5½ percent for 2012/13, but should pick up to 6 percent in
2013/14. Continued implementation of measures to facilitate investment and slightly stronger
global growth should deliver a modest rebound in the near term. Inflation is forecasted to remain
above the Reserve Bank of India’s comfort zone given that supply constraints are likely to ease
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
only gradually. The current account deficit should narrow marginally this year to about 4 percent
of GDP, aided by falling gold imports, a weaker rupee, and broadly stable oil prices.
Risks are on the downside, but recent government action has mitigated domestic risks. The
uncertain global situation could present serious challenges to India, especially in case of a
major global financial shock, and the macroeconomic environment limits the scope for policy
response. On the domestic front, insufficient follow-through on recent reforms, in particular
those intended to relieve supply constraints, or resorting to expansionary fiscal policy are key
downside risks. On the upside, going beyond announced reforms or legislative progress would
lead to higher growth and lower vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that India’s growth has slowed markedly due to structural and cyclical
factors, while inflation remains elevated. Directors noted, however, that growth prospects
continue to be strong and welcomed the authorities’ recent measures to address supply
constraints and revive investment activity. Structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, and low
inflation were seen as critical for a sustained recovery and to lower vulnerabilities.
Directors considered that growth risks are on the downside, but recent government action has
mitigated domestic risks. Stressing that the uncertain global situation could present serious
challenges for India, they maintained that the flexible rupee would continue to be an important
buffer, as the scope for countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy is limited.
Directors agreed that with financial conditions still relatively easy, it is advisable to maintain the
current level of policy rates until inflation is clearly on a downward trend. They commended the
RBI’s vigilance on inflation and expected that it will pay dividends for long-term growth. They
suggested that more guidance from the RBI on future projected inflation may be helpful in
anchoring inflation expectations.
Directors welcomed the government’s fiscal roadmap and underscored the importance of the
quality and sustainability of fiscal consolidation. They welcomed the start of implementation of
direct cash transfers using India’s impressive Unique Identification Number. Directors stressed,
however, that rationalizing fuel and fertilizer subsidies is essential to create fiscal space and
make the adjustment more equitable. They supported the reorientation of spending from
untargeted subsidies to infrastructure investment and social spending. They also underscored
the need to raise tax revenues to pre-crisis levels and concurred that the introduction of the
Goods and Services Tax should have priority.
Directors noted that external vulnerability appears to have increased because of the
deterioration in the current account deficit and the composition of its financing. However, they
viewed it as manageable with the support of exchange rate flexibility. They suggested that fiscal
consolidation and lower inflation, combined with addressing supply bottlenecks, would help
strengthen the external position. Directors welcomed the authorities’ moves toward further

3
gradual capital account liberalization and encouraged them to focus on foreign direct investment
(FDI) and rupee bonds, which would improve the financing mix and deepen domestic capital
markets.
Directors noted that strengthening growth and ensuring its inclusiveness would require tackling
structural impediments to investment. They considered that removing obstacles to investment
and addressing issues in energy and natural resources would be vital to boost growth. Directors
suggested that easing restrictive labor laws, improving agricultural productivity, improving health
and education outcomes, and addressing skills mismatches, would make growth more inclusive
and would support formal job creation.
To reduce financial risks, Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten mechanisms to
address deteriorating asset quality, bring concentration exposure norms in line with international
practices, and improve the financial strength of public banks as the 2012 Financial Sector
Assessment Program report recommended. They noted that financial reforms are also needed
to improve access to credit and diversify funding sources, which in turn will require lowering the
statutory liquidity ratio over time as fiscal consolidation progresses.

Statement by Rakesh Mohan, Executive Director for India
and Janak Raj, Senior Advisor
January 25, 2013
1.
We welcome staff’s comprehensive assessment of recent macroeconomic and
financial sector developments in India and the evolving outlook. Our authorities had had
a constructive and candid engagement with the mission. The current slowdown in
domestic growth is a key concern for our authorities. Accordingly, they have taken a
number of measures over the past few months to address various domestic bottlenecks to
revive investment activity and growth impulses in the short run, and to boost the growth
potential over the medium term.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
2.
Staff have attributed the slowdown of the Indian economy mainly to domestic
supply side factors. It needs to be noted, however, that strong global headwinds such as
ongoing tensions in the euro area and the concomitant persistent slowdown in global
growth also had a significant impact on the economy.
3.
In pointing out the role of the domestic supply side factors in India’s current
growth slowdown, staff are reflecting the concerns of our authorities, who have
recognized several constraints that acted as a drag on economic activity recently and had
initiated measures to address them. The thrust of the Mid-Year Economic Review
presented by the Government to the Parliament in December 2012 was on the domestic
constraints that led to a decline in investment activity and slowdown in growth. Some of
the major constraints identified are: bottlenecks in project implementation; shortage of
coal and underutilization of thermal based power generation; delay in regulatory and
environmental clearances; infrastructural bottlenecks; high fiscal deficit; and high
inflation. High inflation also mean high interest rates, which have further impacted
investment activity.
4.
Having recognized these constraints, our authorities have taken measures to
address them by following a two-pronged approach. First, measures were initiated to
remove short-term constraints, which have already improved business confidence.
Second, structural reforms have been pursued to boost the medium-term growth potential
of the economy.
Fiscal Policy
5.
With tax revenues affected by the slowdown in growth, and expenditures
overshooting mainly on account of petroleum subsidies, containing the fiscal deficit in
2012-13 to the budgeted level (5.1 per cent) was proving to be a challenge. Recognizing
the need to contain the fiscal deficit, the authorities constituted a high-powered
committee in August 2012, based on the recommendations of which a fiscal roadmap was
announced in October 2012. Accordingly, our authorities have indicated that the gross

fiscal deficit would be contained at 5.3 per cent in 2012-13 and further brought down to
3.0 per cent by 2016-17. In keeping with this, a number of different measures have been
introduced. The domestic prices of administered petroleum products have been increased
to contain fuel subsidies. The authorities have also raised railway passenger fares to
strengthen the Indian Railways. Earlier, the authorities had announced disinvestment in
some public sector enterprises. The authorities are thus committed to containing the fiscal
deficit at 5.3 per cent for fiscal year 2012-13.
6.
The authorities have also announced a plan to gradually roll out direct cash
transfers using Unique Identification Numbers (UID) beginning 2013 in select districts in
lieu of existing channels, which are largely in kind and subject to leakages. The
authorities expect that by 2016-17, cash transfers will be largely in place for the
disbursement of key subsidies. This is an innovative step and is expected to prove very
effective in avoiding leakages and delays and lead to better targeting of government
programs.
7.
It needs to be recognized that even as the fiscal deficit is a concern, India’s public
debt is on a downward trajectory with the Central Government’s gross debt expected to
fall to 45.5 per cent of GDP during 2012-13.
Inflation
8.
To contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations, the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has pursued an appropriate monetary policy; it raised the policy interest rate
during March 2010 – October 2011. The anti-inflationary monetary policy stance has
had some dampening effect on domestic demand, but that was to be expected. As the
growth slowed down, the RBI reduced the policy rate in April 2012, but has held its
policy rate since then as inflation remained above its comfort level.
Structural Reforms
9.
FDI has been permitted in some new sectors, including the multi-brand retail
sector, while norms have been relaxed in certain existing sectors. To avoid delay in
implementation of large projects, a number of measures have been taken, including the
setting up of a new Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) under the chairmanship of
the Prime Minister. The Committee has been mandated to fast track large infrastructure
projects. Debt funds have been set up to intermediate long-term resources for
infrastructure projects. India has the second largest number of PPP projects in
infrastructure in the world, the thrust on which is to be continued in the Twelfth Five
Year Plan (2012-17). The authorities have recently accepted all the major
recommendations of an Expert Committee on General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR)
for bringing about a greater clarity in the matter of taxation. The implementation of
GAAR has been deferred till 2016. Efforts are also afoot to implement the Goods and
Services Tax (GST) and Direct Tax Code (DTC) as early as possible. These and several
other significant measures will help revert the economy on a high growth trajectory.

Global Factors

Having recognized the role of domestic constraints, it also needs to be underlined
that the uncertain external environment played no less a role. The continued uncertainty
in the global financial markets over the euro area sovereign debt concerns and the
sluggish US recovery have led to anemic global growth and volatility in capital flows.
The Indian economy is now highly integrated with the global economy - in fact, more
integrated than some of the major advanced economies are. Therefore, the uncertain
global macroeconomic situation directly impacts the Indian economy through various
channels. In fact, staff’s own estimates suggest that for every percentage point of lower
global growth, India’s growth is shaved off by 0.5 percentage point. As global growth has
slowed down significantly, it has obviously impacted India’s growth. At the same time,
quantitative easing policies pursued by the major central banks have contributed to
continued upward pressure on international commodity prices, which add to domestic
inflationary pressures.
11.
It also needs to be recognized that the slowdown is not unique to India alone. All
the major economies, which experienced a robust rebound from the crisis of 2008-09,
have witnessed a growth slowdown, although the extent of India’s slowdown is
somewhat higher for reasons outlined above. The growth has also been impacted due to
cyclical factors. The Indian economy was quick to recover from the global financial crisis
as it registered high growth rates of above 8 per cent in the 2009-10 and 2010-11.
However, a cyclical slowdown set in during the second half of 2010-11 (April-March),
again which was common across all the major economies of the world.
Short-term Outlook
12.
The various measures announced by our authorities since September 2012 are
beginning to improve the business sentiment. Various lead indicators suggest that the
slowdown has bottomed out and the economy is headed towards higher growth, going
forward. Reflecting the change in business sentiment, capital market conditions have
improved. As a result, the interest of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) has also
revived, resulting in improved capital flows. Headline inflation has moderated over the
past two months. A significant decline in core inflation has been particularly comforting.
This could possibly facilitate softening of the monetary policy stance, going forward. The
RBI’s Business Expectation Index for the October-December 2012 quarter, PMI for
November and December and improvement in capital market conditions all suggest that
the economy is poised for improved performance. The macroeconomic outlook in the
near future is certainly more positive and the authorities expect that growth will be better
than the staff‘s projections for 2013-14 and beyond.
Medium-term Outlook
13.
Notwithstanding the recent growth slowdown, India’s potential growth still
remains intact as the underlying drivers of growth – high domestic savings, high
investment, the demographic profile, a diversified and strong financial system, well-

functioning financial markets, and, overall, continued macroeconomic and financial
stability – remain in place. Accordingly, long-term productive capacity and potential
have not been much affected. In this regard, staff’s estimates of potential growth seem to
focus on the very near-term growth prospects of the economy and, therefore vary
annually and are sensitive to choice of methodology. However, potential growth is a
medium to longer-term concept that reflects underlying structural trends rather than
cyclical variations and year-to-year shifts and events.
14.
Recent structural reforms introduced by the authorities, and as outlined above,
will help the economy return to its high growth trajectory. Our authorities recognize that
high growth is essential for reducing India’s poverty on a sustained basis. The percentage
of the population below the poverty line declined at the rate of 1.5 percentage points
every year in the period 2004-05 to 2009-10, twice the rate at which it declined in the
previous period 1993-94 to 2004-05. Despite this impressive performance, however, a
large proportion of population is still below the poverty line and our authorities are
determined to bring that down further. Accordingly, as set out in the Draft 12th Five Year
Plan document released recently, the economy is projected to grow at about 8.0 per cent
per year during 2012-17 based on successful policy interventions at multiple leverage
points which will generate virtuous cycles.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15.
Inflation in India has been a cause of significant concern. Unlike several other
emerging market economies, inflation in India has remained high and persistent during
the last three years. Inflation has been driven by all the three major groups, viz., food,
fuel and core. Food inflation has generally been volatile with large swings in the prices of
certain food items such as fruits and vegetables. A major driver of food inflation has been
protein-rich items. This reflects the changing consumption pattern due to rising income
levels as also rising input costs on account of increase in wages. Recently, there has also
been a spurt in cereal prices. As noted above, elevated oil and other international
commodity prices on the back of quantitative easing policies in advanced economies
added to domestic inflationary pressures. However, latest data suggest that inflation has
begun to moderate. More importantly, core inflation has moderated significantly. In view
of stabilizing global oil prices, the inflation dynamic, going forward, is expected to be
more favorable.
16.
While the wholesale price inflation is the headline indicator of inflation, the
Reserve Bank makes use of an array of indicators to assess the underlying inflationary
pressures, including movements in various consumer price indices, GDP deflator and
inflation expectations surveys. However, in the Indian context, there are significant
limitations of relying solely on consumer price indices for the conduct and formulation of
monetary policy in view of the large weight of food items in the consumer price indices,
over which monetary policy has limited direct effect. Moreover, in view of limited data
points, it is not possible to use the new series as a measure of headline inflation. The
authorities, will, therefore, continue to use the new series along with other indicators, as
hitherto. Staff have made a suggestion that the RBI could make rolling one-year

projections of inflation. Uncertainty about the patterns and magnitude of seasonal effects
such as monsoon complicates the generation of rolling projections. Such projections, if
therefore made, could undermine the credibility of the RBI. In this context, it is relevant
to note that, as the Reserve Bank has consistently articulated in its policy statements, the
conduct of monetary policy continues to be conditioned by the need to contain perception
of inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent, in line with the medium-term objective of 3.0
per cent inflation consistent with India’s broader integration into the global economy.
17.
Staff have made a suggestion that the debt limits for FIIs be raised, particularly in
view of recent relaxation in external commercial borrowing (ECB) limits and also on the
ground that FIIs will bear the forex risk. The authorities keep revising these limits
periodically based on several considerations. However, given the wide interest rate
differential between India and the major advanced economies, the authorities exercise
caution while effecting revisions in these limits.
Financial Policies
18.
The financial sector remains well-capitalized and has been contributing to growth
in India. Prudent macroeconomic and financial policies have helped maintain financial
stability in the Indian economy over the past two decades on a consistent basis, including
in the period since 2007 when major advanced economies have seen a high degree of
financial instability. Although NPAs have risen in consonance with the cyclical
slowdown, they are still at a low level. Banks remain adequately capitalized, with overall
capital adequacy at 13.6 per cent. Insofar as the restructured standard advances becoming
NPAs is concerned, it needs to be noted that restructuring is allowed only in those cases
where the account is expected to become viable after restructuring. Restructured
standard advances are only 5.9 per cent of gross advances and historical experience
suggests that only a small fraction of such restructured standard assets become NPAs.
Even in a scenario when 30 per cent of restructured standard assets become NPAs, the
average Tier I ratio at 8.1 per cent remains far above the prescribed level of 6 per cent.
Nevertheless, the authorities have increased provisions for restructured standard
accounts.
19.
India is among the first G20 countries to have developed Basel III compliant
regulations. The authorities are committed to keep all the public sector banks (PSBs)
financially sound and healthy so as to ensure that the growing credit needs of our
economy are adequately met. Full implementation of Basel III by 2018 could necessitate
government cumulative capital injections in the PSBs of about 1 per cent of GDP.
Although the amount looks large, it will be spread over the next six years. In this context,
it may be noted that early this month the authorities decided to infuse capital of the order
of Rs. 125 billion in public sector banks during the year 2012-13 to maintain their Tier-l
CRAR at comfortable level so that they remain compliant with the stricter capital
adequacy norms under Basel III.
20.
Staff favor a lower statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), currently at 23 per cent, on the
ground that it is crowding out private sector investment. At present, however, banks’

actual holding of SLR securities is above the statutory requirement, which would suggest
that the SLR is not crowding out private investment. In this context, it is relevant to note
that, first, the SLR holding of banks has been brought down over time from 38.5 per cent
of net demand and time liabilities of banks in the early 1990s to 23 per cent at present.
Second, the SLR securities are issued by the government at market-determined interest
rates. Third, the holding of high-quality, highly liquid government bonds has
strengthened banks’ balance sheets and helped banks to better cope with financial stress
situations by providing them with greater access to liquidity through a special window in
the RBI. The financial stability enhancing role played by the SLR is thus important. It is,
therefore, intriguing that the staff recommend the reduction in the SLR when it is now
widely recognized that there is a need to boost the liquidity buffers of banks.
Conclusions
21.
India’s growth has slowed down and the Indian economy is facing some
challenges. Having said that, however, recent developments are comforting. Inflation is
beginning to moderate. A significant decline in core inflation is particularly encouraging.
The authorities have initiated measures to reverse the negative sentiment and address
supply side concerns. The authorities are also committed to contain the fiscal deficit.
They have not hesitated to take several politically sensitive measures, including
adjustments in fuel prices. The various lead indicators suggest that the slowdown has
bottomed out and growth prospects from hereon should only be improving. The
improvement in domestic growth will also be contingent on the global economic outlook,
which still remains uncertain and subject to a number of downside risks as indicated in
the January 2013 WEO Update. Notwithstanding the recent slowdown, India’s medium
to long-term growth prospects continue to be strong. Several measures taken by our
authorities will help overcome various supply constraints, encourage fresh investment
and revert the economy to a high growth trajectory.
