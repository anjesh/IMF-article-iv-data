DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Background: The two newly-autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the
Netherlands face substantial challenges. Growth has been low, and unemployment is
high. The current account deficit has widened to worrisome levels, increasing the
vulnerability of the peg to the dollar and stimulating calls for dollarizing or dissolving
the currency union. International reserves however have risen in recent years, and have
been stable in 2011. Major data gaps significantly complicate diagnosis, but available
indicators point to anemic competitiveness. Fiscal spending pressures are considerable.
Challenges: The key challenge is to develop and implement policies to mitigate
external vulnerabilities, entrench fiscal soundness, and advance structural reforms to
enhance competitiveness and growth. Given the scale of the current account deficit,
frontloaded action will be needed to prevent pressures against the peg over the
medium term.
Policy recommendations: Contain credit growth with monetary and macroprudential
measures, including higher reserve requirements and gradual relaxation of the limits on
foreign investment by domestic nonbank financial institutions to reduce the growth of
bank deposits. Tighten fiscal policy primarily through expenditure measures to help
contain the current account deficits. Substantially increase wage and price flexibility,
cut red tape, and shift from direct to indirect taxes. The authorities broadly agreed with
these recommendations, and in several areas policy responses are at an advanced
stage of preparation.

Debt relief was based on 2005 data, and
was intended to reduce interest payments
to 5 percent of fiscal revenues. In addition,
grants were provided for the clearance of
documented government arrears. Thus,
over 2009–10 the overall debt burden of
Curaçao and Sint Maarten (from each
island’s own debt plus its share of the debt
of the Netherlands Antilles central
government) declined by 57 and

Even after eliminating identifiable
temporary factors, such as increases in FDI

current account deficit remains large at
over 15 percent of GDP.



Pronounced weaknesses in export
performance, demand pressures primarily
from rapid bank credit growth, and
inadequate pass-through of recent
increases in international oil and food
prices particularly in 2010, appear to be
the main drivers of the external deficit. The
oil price pass-through has, however,
strengthened since July 2011, with the
domestic-international price gap broadly
eliminated and monthly adjustment to
international price movements.



Data gaps, including on re-exports from
Curaçao to Sint Maarten, potentially bias
estimates of individual island current
account deficits, but available data indicate
that in 2010, while Curaçao’s external
deficit widened to an estimated 31 percent
of GDP, that of Sint Maarten declined to
about 7 percent of GDP.

4.

Major data gaps, related in part to

real GDP. Data on fiscal expenditures for
Sint Maarten are not yet available for 2009–10,
and there are significant gaps in its debt data,
complicating the assessment of fiscal policy.
Moreover, data on the operations of the
Netherlands Antilles central government in
2010 are limited, hampering a proper
assessment of the degree of fiscal tightening
in the currency union in 2011. Fiscal reporting
standards need improvement. And the current
account deficit could possibly be mismeasured
given limitations in the statistical
infrastructure.
5.

Policy coordination is complicated

by fractious relations between the
governments and the central bank, with
rising sentiments against continuing the
currency union. Relations between the central
bank and the Curaçao government have
turned acrimonious, and a recent Dutch
government investigation raised serious
concerns about governance in Curaçao.
Curaçao’s government has expressed a
preference for obtaining full monetary
autonomy. Also, the Sint Maarten government
has instructed the central bank to beef up its
personnel and operations on the island, with a
view to ultimately having their own central
bank. And plans to print the new currency are

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Macro Outlook
12.

Low growth is expected to persist

over 2011–12 (Tables 6–7). In Curaçao,
available indicators suggest that domestic
demand is decelerating in 2011, likely
reflecting declining consumer confidence and
a tighter fiscal stance. However, exports appear
to be growing modestly, led by tourism—with
increased hotel capacity and new flight
connections—and renewed activity in the oil
refinery. In Sint Maarten, continued declines in

stayover tourism have offset the strong
rebound in cruise tourism. In this context, GDP
is expected to be broadly flat in both countries
in 2011, and to grow by ¾ percent and
½ percent in Curaçao and Sint Maarten,
respectively, in 2012, well below WEO
projections for the Caribbean region.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Nominal
expenditure-side national accounts data have not been published since 2006, and there are no data on
deflators or real GDP. Data on fiscal expenditures for Sint Maarten are not yet available for 2009–10, and
there are significant gaps in its debt data, complicating the assessment of fiscal policy. Moreover, data on
the operations of the Netherlands Antilles central government in 2010 are limited, hampering a proper
assessment of the degree of fiscal tightening in the currency union in 2011. Fiscal reporting standards
need improvement. And the current account deficit could possibly be mismeasured given limitations in
the statistical infrastructure.
National accounts: Data are compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The CBS has published
expenditure side national accounts data only up to 2006, though production-side data are available
through 2009. Preliminary unpublished expenditure-side estimates for 2007–09 are available for Curaçao
but not for Sint Maarten. Detailed price indices to deflate national accounts aggregates are not available.
The CBS uses the total consumer price index (CPI) to deflate total GDP. This method gives rise to
distortions in the measurement of real growth.
Price statistics: CPI data are compiled and published on a monthly basis, although with some lag for Sint
Maarten.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance in Curaçao provides fiscal data that can broadly
be bridged to the cash framework of the 2001 Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001).
However, the fiscal reporting standards in Sint Maarten are significantly weaker, and improvements are
needed in grouping and consolidating fiscal data according to the GFSM 2001 manual. Final data on fiscal
operations for Sint Maarten are still not available for 2009–10, complicating the assessment of its fiscal
policy.
Monetary statistics: The methodology used by the Central bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten (CBCS) for
compiling monetary statistics is broadly consistent with the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
However, there is some lag in the publication of the data.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments (BOP) statistics are reported on a transactions basis in
accordance with the fifth edition of the BOP Manual. The CBCS reports quarterly BOP data. No data on
intra-currency union flows is available. Monthly data on the official reserve position are published with a
lag of one month. The diversified and changing structure of the offshore sector makes an appropriate
classification of capital account inflows and outflows problematic. Areas requiring improvement include:
a) maturity schedules for private sector external debt, b) more detailed information on individual
financing components, and c) information on intra-union flows
II. Data Standards and Quality
Not a General Data Dissemination System participant.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
No data are currently reported to STA.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
Discussions with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Curaçao and
Sint Maarten
On November 18, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Curaçao
and Sint Maarten,1 on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Background
Following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on October 10, 2010 Curaçao and
Sint Maarten became autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands,
with a currency union and a peg to the U.S. dollar. Alongside, the Dutch government
gave substantial debt relief to both countries, and new fiscal frameworks were installed
to help sustain sound fiscal positions.
Macroeconomic challenges are substantial. In addition to low growth, high
unemployment, and aging, the current account deficit for the currency union has
widened rapidly to 25¾ percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2010. However, a
strong increase in international reserves in recent years, to about five months of imports
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the
Board agrees that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

in 2010, has provided some cushion, and there is no indication currently of pressures
against the guilder. In 2011, international reserves have been broadly stable thus far. A
number of indicators suggest weak competitiveness and moderate real exchange rate
overvaluation, particularly in Curaçao.
The global crisis caused relatively modest contractions in both countries in 2009, and
activity remained anemic in 2010. Curaçao’s GDP is estimated to have contracted by
1¼ percent in 2009, and grown by ½ percent in 2010, while Sint Maarten’s GDP
contracted by 2 percent in 2009, and was flat in 2010. With weaker growth,
unemployment stayed around 10 percent in Curaçao over 2009 and 2010, after steady
declines since 2007, while, in Sint Maarten, it stayed around 12 percent after steadily
declining since 2003. As demand pressure fell in the crisis and commodity prices
declined temporarily, inflation decelerated in 2009 to 1¾ percent in Curaçao and
¾ percent in Sint Maarten. However, driven by renewed oil and food price increases,
inflation started picking up again in 2010 and reached 2¾ and 3¼ percent on average in
Curaçao and Sint Maarten, respectively.
Bank capital and liquidity buffers appear robust, though credit quality has declined. The
risk weighted capital adequacy ratio stood at 18¼ percent in 2010, well above the
regulatory minimum. Bank liquidity buffers also appear sound, with a loan to deposit
ratio of 75 percent and reserves well above regulatory requirements. But the
nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio has increased by 2 percentage points over 2008 and
2010 to 8½ percent. However, loan-loss provisions are also sizeable at close to
70 percent of NPLs, and they rose further in 2010. Banks remain profitable, with a return
on assets above the Caribbean average.
Excluding the impact of debt relief, both island governments run modest fiscal deficits
over 2009–10. Excluding grants received as part of debt relief, Curaçao would have had
fiscal deficits of ¾ percent of GDP in both 2009 and 2010. Fiscal expenditure data for
2009–10 for Sint Maarten are still unavailable, but fiscal deficits of about one percent of
GDP in both 2009 and 2010 are estimated, excluding debt relief grants. As of end-2010
public debt stood at 34½ percent of GDP and 28¼ percent of GDP in Curaçao and Sint
Maarten, respectively. In 2011, both countries are on track with respect to the fiscal
rules, and Curaçao is expected to have an overall balanced budget outturn, while Sint
Maarten is expected to an overall deficit outcome of ½ percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation discussions with the Kingdom of
Netherlands—Curaçao and Sint Maarten, Executive Directors endorsed the staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
Both countries face substantial challenges, requiring sustained adjustment efforts over
the near and medium terms. In addition to low growth, high unemployment, and aging

3
pressures, the current account deficit for the currency union has risen to worrisome
levels. The real exchange rate also appears moderately overvalued, particularly in
Curaçao. Anemic competitiveness, rapid credit growth, and inadequate pass-through of
recent increases in international oil and food prices particularly in 2010, appear to be the
main drivers of the external deficit. While international reserves have risen in recent
years, vulnerabilities are substantial, and strong efforts are needed to reduce the current
account deficit to sustainable levels. If efforts lag, international reserves could come
under pressure over the medium term, requiring a devaluation. Moreover, devaluation
would only yield temporary adjustment unless it is buttressed with policy tightening and
structural measures to improve competitiveness.
A substantial adjustment is needed to bring the underlying current account deficit to
historically sustainable levels over the medium term. This could be facilitated by
measures to restrain credit growth, supported by fiscal consolidation. In addition,
structural reforms to generate wage and price flexibility and improve the business
environment will be needed to realize durable gains in competitiveness. In several areas
policy responses are being prepared, but prompt implementation will be key.
Clarity is needed on dollarization and the future of the currency union to avoid
undermining confidence in the economy and the guilder. The current peg has delivered
credible exchange rate stability and relatively low inflation for a prolonged period. Given
anemic competitiveness, dollarizing without first enhancing wage and price flexibility
risks locking-in protracted low growth, with adverse effects on fiscal sustainability and
employment. Also, dissolving the currency union would fracture the domestic banking
system and raise both banking and supervisory costs, and the credibility of the Central
Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten may not carry over to the successor central banks.
Continued public discussion of these issues and the divergent views of the different
authorities could undermine investor confidence and adversely impact the growth
outlook, and should be avoided.
Monetary and macroprudential tools should be used firmly to aid adjustment by reducing
credit growth below that of nominal GDP. The recent increase in the rate of required
reserves is welcome, but more increases are needed, together with a gradual relaxation
of the limits on foreign investment by domestic nonbank financial institutions and the use
of other macroprudential instruments. Supervisory vigilance should also be intensified
as the tightening, together with the frail near term outlook, could increase strains in the
banking system.
Financial crisis resolution mechanisms should be further strengthened. The authorities
should press ahead with plans to set up a funded deposit guarantee scheme, and
develop clear understandings on the roles of the two governments in the event that
public bailout of a bank is ever contemplated.

4
The new fiscal frameworks appear to be entrenching fiscal soundness. The 2011 fiscal
outturns in both countries are on track with respect to the fiscal rules, and incentives to
address spending pressures related to aging and institutional buildup have been
strengthened. The College Financieel Toezicht (CFT) appears to be providing effective
guidance on fiscal policy, and its assessments are a major input in the setting of budget
parameters and both short and longer term fiscal efforts.
However, significant fiscal tightening is needed over the near to medium term to support
the efforts to reduce the current account deficit. Given the relative size of Curaçao and
data suggesting that it is primarily responsible for the widening of the current account
deficit, the bulk of the adjustment will need to come from Curaçao. The significant
tightening already expected in Curaçao for 2011 is therefore a step in the right direction.
In addition to efforts to contain aging and institutional buildup-related pressures, areas
that could be targeted in this effort include social benefits, goods and services, and
wages. In Sint Maarten, scope for reducing expenditures appears limited, given the
need to fill institutional gaps. However, tax reforms as well as compliance increasing
measures being developed will likely need to be moderately revenue enhancing.
Planned tax reforms will help improve the business environment and competitiveness by
reducing rates on labor and profits and raising indirect taxes. Rebalancing from direct to
indirect taxes would also support productive activity and moderate consumption, thus
contributing to a reduction of the underlying current account deficit. The new legislation
in Curaçao is a commendable start, and the authorities’ plans to go further along the
lines proposed by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department Technical Assistance mission are
in the right direction. For Sint Maarten, the timing of implementation of tax reforms
should be brought forward as much as possible. Given the shared border with the
French side, synchronization of tax policy on both sides would be critical to avoid
arbitrage across borders.
Deep structural reforms are needed to enhance price and wage flexibility and improve
the business environment. With a currency peg, domestic price and wage flexibility is
the primary channel by which the economy adjusts to shocks and sustains
competitiveness. However, structural rigidities are pervasive in both countries
hampering adjustment and limiting growth potentials. Wide-ranging reforms are needed
to substantially enhance labor market flexibility, liberalize the administered price regime,
and sharply reduce administrative red tape.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
