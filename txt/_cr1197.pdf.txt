

Mission: A staff team comprising Messrs. Akitoby (head), Gueye, Ms. Dieterich (all
AFR), and Mr. Belhocine (FAD) visited Libreville November 12–21, 2010.
Mr. Tsouck Ibounde (World Bank) participated in the meetings.

Arrangement for SDR 77.15 million (50 percent of quota) on May 7, 2007. The
Arrangement expired in May 2010, with only the first three reviews completed. Recurrent
fiscal slippages have made it difficult in the past to sustain Fund-supported programs.



Past advice: In concluding the 2008 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
commended the authorities for strengthening economic policies, which, together with a
favorable external environment, helped deliver high non-oil growth, moderate inflation,
and a strong external position. While noting progress made in improving the fiscal
position, they emphasized the need for further fiscal consolidation and structural reforms
to mitigate risks to macroeconomic stability and prepare Gabon’s transition to the post-oil
era.



Exchange Rate Regime: Gabon is a member of the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community (CEMAC). The regional currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the
euro. Gabon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF
Articles of Agreement. However, owing to the imposition of a tax on all wire transfers,
including for making payments and transfers for current international transactions, Gabon
maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section
2 (a) of the Articles of Agreement.



Data provision: Gabon participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS);
data provision is generally adequate for surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Low prices and weak demand for commodities shrank the fiscal and current
account surpluses in 2009 and turned growth moderately negative. Real GDP is forecast to
increase to 5.7 percent in 2010 and remain broadly at that level in 2011, reflecting public
investment and a rebound in mining. Over the long term, dwindling oil reserves will cause a
decline in income and fiscal revenues, unless non-oil GDP growth accelerates. The
government therefore announced a plan to transform Gabon into an emerging economy
through diversification away from oil and promotion of a business friendly environment. It
has embarked on an ambitious public investment program that will deteriorate the near-term
fiscal position.
Challenges: Against the background of the government’s economic agenda, policy
discussions focused on three key challenges: (i) ensuring fiscal sustainability and external
competitiveness because of dwindling oil reserves over the long term, (ii) accelerating
growth to prepare for the post-oil era, and (iii) reforming the financial sector.
Staff views: Sustained fiscal consolidation is vital to long-term growth and fiscal
sustainability as oil production dwindles over the long term. The government’s ambitious
capital budget should be anchored in a credible medium-term fiscal strategy to safeguard
macroeconomic stability even if oil prices decline. Better public financial management is
needed to improve the quality of spending and release resources for growth-enhancing
spending and social outlays. With oil reserves depleting, reforms are critical for promoting
and diversifying private sector non-oil growth. The priorities are to improve the business
climate, build basic infrastructure, and facilitate access to financing for small and mediumsize enterprises (SMEs).
Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment. They are working on
a medium-term framework to bring the deficit down to a sustainable level by reducing capital
spending gradually, reforming public wage and employment policies, and rationalizing
current spending. They emphasized that forceful implementation of public financial
management reforms will help improve spending efficiency. The authorities agreed on the
need to reform the business environment and indicated that a service agreement signed with
the World Bank will help the government identify priority actions. They also emphasized
ongoing initiatives to facilitate SME access to financial services. Key initiatives include
reforming disputes settlement, streamlining procedures for guarantees, and establishing a
corporate balance sheet centralization system.

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Oil production over the last 40 years has transformed Gabon into a middleincome country; but income inequality is high, and noncommodity sectors are stagnant.
Gabon is among the highest per capita
GDP countries in Africa but ranks
below the average of middle-income
countries on human development
indicators. Moreover, government
spending has often been inefficient.
The richest quintile of the population
receives half of national income, yet
one-third live in poverty. Oil revenue,
channeled through government
spending, is a main driver of economic activity, but its volatility and pro-cyclical fiscal
policy have caused boom and bust cycles that have been exacerbated at times by rapidly
rising and downwardly inflexible wages in the context of a fixed exchange rate regime.
2.
Gabon went through a political transition in 2009. Ali Bongo Ondimba, the son of
the late President Omar Bongo Ondimba, won the August 2009 presidential election.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 2011.
3.
The newly elected president’s plans are to transform Gabon into an emerging
economy through diversification away from oil and promotion of a business friendly
environment. Dwindling oil reserves will cause a decline in income and fiscal revenues over
the long term, unless non-oil GDP growth accelerates. Seeking to increase non-oil potential
output, the government has embarked on an ambitious investment plan that will test the
country’s limited administrative capacity.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Performance under the Fund-supported program was mixed. The three-year
Stand-By Arrangement expired in May 2010, with only the first three reviews completed.
Recurrent fiscal slippages have made it difficult to sustain Fund-supported programs. The
non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) increased significantly from 14 percent of non-oil GDP
(NOGDP) in 2009 to about 21 percent of NOGDP in 2010, reflecting higher government
investment and wages.
5.
Gabon is recovering from the global financial crisis. Low prices and weak demand
for commodities shrank the current account and fiscal surpluses in 2009 and turned growth
moderately negative. Real GDP is forecast to increase to about 5.7 percent in 2010, reflecting
increased public investment and a rebound in mining. Average annual inflation is projected
to remain subdued (Table 1).

5
6.
Staff expects the recovery to be sustained, with downside risks from commodity
prices and possible slippages in policy implementation. Economic activity is projected to
remain robust in 2011, supported by mining, wood processing, and public investment.
Inflation is forecast to pick up, mostly driven by higher food and energy prices. The foremost
risk to the economic outlook is a decline in oil and manganese prices, because these
commodities accounted for about 90 percent of total exports of goods and 45 percent of
nominal GDP on average during the last decade. Plans to further increase investment
spending in 2011 would be procyclical and increase the risk of a sudden reversal in policies,
if commodity prices declined. Politically, ongoing episodic strikes for higher wages and
social benefits could intensify ahead of the parliamentary elections.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Against the background of the government’s plan to transform Gabon into an
emerging economy, policy discussions focused on three key themes: (i) ensuring fiscal
sustainability and external competitiveness because of dwindling oil reserves over the long
term, (ii) accelerating growth to prepare for the post-oil era, and (iii) reforming the financial
sector.
A. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability and External Competitiveness
Macrofiscal policies
8.
After the strong increase in spending in 2010, the 2011 draft budget includes a
further acceleration of capital spending, which will worsen the gap with the sustainable
NOPD.1 The increase in capital spending would be partly offset by a decline in current
spending (in percent of NOGDP). In particular, goods and services expenses are projected to
rise only in line with inflation, because their 2010 increase already incorporated higher costs
for preparing the investment program. Despite additional hiring in health, education, and
police and military personnel, wages are also projected to decline because the government
plans no nominal wage increase. This would lead to an NOPD of 22.5 percent of NOGDP in
2011 compared to 21.1 percent in 2010. Risks of public spending overruns could develop
before the 2011 elections (Table 2).
9.
In the medium term, a decline in capital spending is expected to lower the NOPD
because the government considers the investment program a temporary measure to
address pressing infrastructure bottlenecks. The authorities are working on a mediumterm framework with the following measures:


Reducing capital spending during 2012–15 by 6 ½ percent of NOGDP.



Reforming public wage and employment policies. This process will be initiated by
civil service audits, scheduled for 2011.



Rationalizing current spending, in particular, by moderately reducing transfers and
subsidies while making space for increasing maintenance costs from the investment
program.

With such policies, the NOPD would drop by 14 percent of NOGDP by 2015 (see the
authorities’ scenario in the text table). The sustainable NOPD (7½ percent of NOGDP) will

be reached by 2019, assuming the government continues the adjustment at the same pace as
during 2012–15 on average (Box 1).

Staff’s views
11.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation is vital to ensuring fiscal sustainability and
external competitiveness as oil production dwindles over time. Public investment plans
should be embedded in a realistic multiyear investment plan and the related annual budgets
cast within a medium-term fiscal framework consistent with fiscal sustainability and external
competitiveness. Given Gabon’s vulnerability to shocks and capacity constraints, risk
analysis of investment projects and fiscal plans need to be enhanced. With high dependence
on commodity exports (Table 5), fiscal policies should be particularly prudent to ensure
adequate buffers against risks from changes in commodity prices. The government should
consider not further accelerating capital spending in 2011. While the current debt-to-GDP
ratio appears moderate, a fall in oil prices could significantly worsen the debt position, as
shown in the debt sustainability analysis (Table 6, Appendix).
12.
It would be prudent therefore to consolidate the fiscal position faster than under
current policies. Staff identified measures that would achieve an additional adjustment of
the NOPD of 6½ percentage points of NOGDP by 2015, consistent with a sustainable longterm fiscal path. As illustrated by the staff’s adjustment scenario (Text Table), this
adjustment can be achieved by the following key measures:

2

In line with the IMF’s surveillance decision, external sustainability is assessed only at the currency union level
while analysis at the country level focuses on competitiveness and domestic stability.

8


Eliminating unproductive capital spending and anchoring the government’s
ambitious investment plan in a credible medium-term fiscal framework.
By 2015, capital spending should be brought back to historical levels.



Bringing the wage bill down to sustainable levels by pursuing wage and
employment reforms. Staff supports the authorities’ plan to cut annual hiring
by half after 2011.



Allowing the fuel price adjustment mechanism to operate in 2011. This would
help contain fiscal risks from changes in oil prices. Subsidies not well targeted
to benefit the poor should be abolished by 2012.



Reducing tax exemptions gradually. Given the authorities’ favorable approach
to tax exemptions for export processing zones (EPZ), they could consider
reducing non-EPZ related exemptions in the VAT and income tax in line with
the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) recommendations.



Implementing tax administration reforms that have already been initiated, in
line with advice provided by (FAD).

Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of fiscal sustainability and
external competitiveness. They explained the main principles of a medium-term framework,
currently being prepared, to bring the deficit down to a sustainable level by reducing capital
spending gradually in the medium term, pursuing wage and employment reforms, and
rationalizing expenditures on goods and services as well as transfers and subsidies. The
medium-term budgetary framework to be put in place will also take into account fiscal risks.
14.
Ongoing tax and customs administration reforms should strengthen non-oil
revenues, including through better control of tax exemptions. While exemptions related

9
to EPZ would be phased out according to the law, the authorities pointed out the overall
positive impact of EPZ on growth and eventually on fiscal revenue.
Public Financial Management Reform
15.
The authorities have embarked on major reforms of public financial
management (PFM), including the introduction of program budgeting and modern principles
of financial management. They also are setting up a Caisse de Relance 3 to carry funds for
capital projects over into the next budget year. Regarding managing oil wealth, they have
decided to establish a national oil company and to convert the Fund for Future Generations to
a Strategic Sovereign Fund (SSF), which will take equity stakes in foreign and domestic
companies of strategic importance to Gabon. Because the laws establishing these new funds
currently are being drafted, it is not clear whether they will be held at the regional central
bank or outside, which would weaken the central bank’s international reserves.
Staff’s views
16.
PFM needs to be further improved to enhance the quality of spending and free
resources for growth-enhancing spending and social outlays. In line with FAD’s technical
assistance recommendations, staff emphasized that the government’s objective of carrying
over funding for investment projects into the next fiscal year could be achieved without a
Caisse de Relance, which will undermine budget execution, cash management, and
accountability. There is a substantial risk that governance and accountability will suffer by
the establishment of new funds outside the budget. In addition, liquidity management of the
SSF should take into account the fiscal risks arising from fluctuating commodity prices.
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities assured staff that they were taking steps to strengthen PFM. The
texts creating the various new institutions are either in the preparatory phase or pending
adoption. It is their intention to ensure that these institutions are not of an extrabudgetary
nature and that they have strong governance structures.

3

In case investment project implementation is delayed, the Caisse de Relance protects these monies from
spending cuts by setting them aside in a separate fund.

10
Box 1: Real Exchange Rate
Staff’s assessment of Gabon’s fiscal sustainability and the real exchange rate is based on two
4
methodologies that take into account the future depletion of oil resources. Both approaches
suggest that the fiscal and external positions are broadly in line with fundamentals as long as
the authorities implement their intention to lower public spending and the NOPD as outlined in
their adjustment scenario. However, poor export performance and weak structural policies
underline the need to improve competitiveness.

deficit is estimated at around
7½ percent of NOGDP. The current account consistent with this fiscal target determines the current
account norm. If the authorities’ adjustment scenario was implemented, the overvaluation would be
small and well within margins of error. If the fiscal deficit level was maintained at the 2010 level, the
overvaluation would be moderate at close to 10 percent by 2015.
Using the ES-approach in Bems and Carvalho’s (2009)5 inter-temporal optimization model gives a
current account norm that is somewhat smaller than in the PIH model. Consequently, the degree of
overvaluation is lower.
Gabon’s export performance suggests there is room for improving competitiveness in the noncommodity sectors. Non-commodity exports growth between 2000 and 2008 has been lagging
behind SSA‘s (3.3 percent compared with 14.2 percent). At the same time, the country’s market share
in world good exports dropped from 0.03 percent in the 1980s to 0.01 percent in 2000–06.
Structural factors have been a constraint to competitiveness. According to the World Bank’s 2010
Doing Business indicators, Gabon ranked poorly among other upper-middle-income countries with
only Venezuela having lower scores. Among 46 SSA countries, Gabon ranked 27th. Another obstacle
to private sector development is the high wage level and a rigid labor market.

1

The results in both models depend heavily on how oil wealth is distributed between generations. For this
exercise, oil wealth is distributed using a constant annuity relative to GDP, which leads to a comparably
conservative current account norm.

quality. While poor infrastructure has
impeded growth, other structural factors, such as a poor business environment and high
wages have been the most binding constraints on growth. The poor quality of health and
education services, which was also pointed out by civil society representatives, has kept labor
productivity low and explains the limited progress in achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (Table 7).
Staff’s views
19.

The following reforms are critical to sustaining non-oil growth:



Refocus public investment on key infrastructure that will help relieve major supply
bottlenecks (e.g., electricity, trade-enabling roads, dam, and ports). The authorities
should seek World Bank technical assistance to strengthen the appraisal, selection,
and monitoring of investment projects and the budgeting of operation and
maintenance costs. Over the medium term, private public partnerships could
complement public investment.



Complement the ambitious infrastructure program by equally important reforms in
health and education, which would strengthen labor productivity, generate
employment, and alleviate poverty over time.



Improve the business climate by strengthening governance, enhancing the one-stop
window for investors, and streamlining administrative procedures.



Increase labor market flexibility by reforming labor laws and refraining from
government-mandated wage increases in the private sector. Also, public sector wage
increases should be moderated to avoid spillover effects on the private sector.

12
Authorities’ views
20.
To refocus public investment on key infrastructure, five economic development
centers have been identified with specific potential in the sectors considered essential
for diversifying the economy. The selection of infrastructure to be built will be guided by
the need to boost and link the five development centers. These centers therefore will be
equipped with high-quality transport, energy, and communications infrastructure.
21.
The authorities have taken several measures to strengthen public investment
management. A national agency for major public works was set up, entrusted with the
planning, management, and implementation of large public infrastructure projects. The
American engineering corporation, Bechtel, is providing the agency with technical expertise.
A service agreement was signed with the World Bank to enhance national capacities in this
area.
22.
Improvements in health and education are essential to alleviating poverty and to
improving labor productivity. The budget envisages hiring new staff for these sectors in
2010 and 2011 and building new classrooms and several clinics.
23.
Reforms to enhance the business environment for private sector promotion
include


Abolishing burdensome regulations involving lengthy procedures, based on
the analysis of the World Bank’s Doing Business. A service agreement that
will help the government identify the necessary measures to enhance the
business environment was signed with the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) in November 2010.



Easing the tax burden on businesses. Tax incentives will continue to play an
important role in this strategy. However, the government emphasized that
regular assessments of their effectiveness will be built into the strategy.
C. Reforming the Financial Sector

24.
Gabon’s financial sector has made little headway since the 2006 Central African

Program (FSAP). Access to financial services is 65

countries. In particular, given the limited role of microfinance institutions, it is difficult for
most SMEs to obtain credit (Table 3 and 4).
The government still retains a sizeable role in the financial sector. It controls two
out of the nine banks and holds significant shares in most of the others. Seeking to facilitate
access to financial services and reduce financing costs, the authorities have recently decided
to set up a new financial institution, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC).
25.

Staff’s views
26.
Staff emphasized the need to improve the institutional environment, rather than
creating specialized and government-sponsored financial institutions like the CDC.
Institutional reforms should focus on (i) improving the operations of land and commercial
registries, (ii) streamlining procedures for recording and enforcing guarantees, and
(iii) strengthening creditor rights enforcement by enhancing governance of the relevant
courts.
27.
To improve SME and private household access to financial services, staff
reiterated the need to create credit history centers on SMEs and encouraged the authorities to
move ahead quickly with the implementation of the new microfinance strategy.
Authorities’ views
28.
Institutional reforms to enhance credit infrastructure are ongoing. These include
improved mechanisms and procedures to settle loan contract disputes, streamlined
procedures for the realization of guarantees to obtain loans, and creation of a corporate
balance sheet centralization system at the central bank that provides commercial banks access
to companies’ balance sheets.
29.
Efforts are also underway to facilitate SME access to financial services. Notably,
the authorities intend to subscribe to the capital of the African Guarantee and Economic Cooperation Fund, which guarantees bank loans to SMEs. Work is ongoing to finalize the
microfinance development strategy to expand access to credit, while limiting operational and
security risks. Finally, reforms are under way to streamline financing instruments through the
restructuring of several public agencies currently involved in SME and housing financing.
D. Other Issues
30.

Other issues were also addressed in the discussions:



Trade policy. Consistent with its free market trade policy, the government plans to
streamline the work of several government agencies involved in export and
investment promotion. The establishment of the competition authority, expected to
become operational shortly, will ensure that the free play of competition is not
hampered by illicit price fixing arrangements, mainly in the retail market.

14


Noncompliance with Article VIII. In 2008, the authorities introduced a tax on wire
transfers, which is not consistent with the requirements under Article VIII. They
assured staff that they are working to resolve this issue. Because the funds generated
by this tax contribute to financing the health insurance fund, reforming this tax is
politically sensitive.



Data quality. While data provision is generally adequate for surveillance, staff
analysis was hampered by shortcomings in balance of payments statistics; timeliness
of fiscal, monetary, and financial sector data; and lack of high-frequency indicators
for economic activity (Informational Annex, Supplement II). With technical
assistance from the IMF and other donors, the authorities are continuing efforts to
strengthen economic and financial data.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

31.
After being hit hard by the global economic crisis, Gabon has recovered quickly.
Near-term growth is projected to rise, supported by public investment and a rebound in
mining, while inflation would remain subdued. The foremost risk to the economic outlook
stems from a significant decline in oil and manganese prices.
32.
As oil reserves dwindle over the long term, sustained fiscal consolidation is vital
to long-term growth, fiscal sustainability, and external competitiveness. The
government’s ambitious capital budget should be anchored in a realistic multiyear investment
plan and a credible medium-term fiscal strategy to safeguard macroeconomic stability.
Annual budgets need to be linked to longer-term policies and to making progress toward
fiscal sustainability.
33.
Good governance and accountability are critical for ensuring the efficient use of
public resources and obtaining the long-term growth dividend from ambitious public
investment plans. The new emphasis on PFM reforms is rightly placed, because better
public financial management is needed to improve the quality of spending and release
resources for growth-enhancing spending and social outlays. Accelerating reforms to refocus
public investment on key infrastructure and social projects and to strengthen the appraisal,
selection, and monitoring of projects is crucial for ensuring that oil resources are not
squandered. Stringent mechanisms should also be in place to ensure transparency and
accountability in the management of oil wealth.
34.
The real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals
if the authorities implement their intention to lower public investment spending and the
NOPD after 2011. If the NOPD is maintained at the 2010 level, the real exchange rate
would appear overvalued. Looking at the performance of the non-oil sector, there is
evidence that structural factors are a significant constraint on external competitiveness.

15
35.
Competiveness-enhancing reforms should be accelerated to promote and
diversify private sector non-oil growth. The priorities are to improve the business climate,
build basic infrastructure and enhance health and education services.
36.
Limited access to financial services is a severe obstacle to private sector
development. Priority should be given to improving the institutional and regulatory
environment, in particular for SMEs.
37.
The data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance. However,
improvements are needed in balance of payments statistics and timeliness of fiscal, monetary,
and financial sector data.
38.
Gabon maintains a tax on wire transfers, which is inconsistent with its
obligations under Article VIII. Staff does not recommend approval.
39.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix: I Assessing Debt Sustainability
External debt sustainability
Debt level and structure. Gabon’s external debt amounted to US$2.1 billion (18.8 percent
of GDP) as of end-2009 (Table A1). Bilateral debt accounted for 45 percent while bonds
issued in 2007 made up 41 percent. The remaining debt is owed to multilateral institutions.
Baseline scenario. Under the baseline scenario, we assume that the medium-term non-oil
primary fiscal deficit would decline from 21.1 percent of NOGDP in 2010 to 14 percent in
2015. Real non-oil GDP growth increases steadily from -0.5 percent in 2009 to about
6.1 percent in 2010 and then declines gradually to 3.2 percent in 2015. Gabonese interest
rates closely follow projected world interest rates. International oil and other commodity
prices reflect World Economic Outlook projections through 2015. Under this scenario, the
debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to decline to 11.7 percent of GDP by 2015, reflecting the
debt-reducing effects of primary surpluses, economic growth, and low interest payments.
Shocks. The risks to this outlook are substantial. While the impact of changes in interest
rates, non-oil growth, and the depreciation shock are benign, the current account shock
proxied by the oil price shock would reverse the downward trend of the debt-to-GDP ratio,
reaching 37.4 percent by 2015.


A permanent increase in the real interest rate of 90 basis points (one half standard
deviation from its past distribution) relative to the baseline would lead to an increase
of the debt-to-GDP ratio to 13.4 percent (Figure A1, panel 2).



A permanent decrease of non-oil GDP of around 1 percentage point (one half
standard deviation from its past distribution) would increase the debt to 14.8 percent
of GDP (Figure A1, panel 3).



A permanent oil price decrease of around 13 dollars per barrel (one half standard
deviation from its past distribution) would lead to a substantial increase in the debtto-GDP ratio to 37 percent (Figure A1, panel 4).



A combination of the former three shocks (a quarter standard deviation from their
past distribution) would lead to an increase in the debt to 24 percent of GDP
(Figure A1, panel 5).



A real deprecation shock of 30 percent would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio by
5 percentage points and stabilize it at around 19 percent by 2015 (Figure A1, panel 6).

Fiscal debt sustainability
The analysis covers only central government debt, because limited information is available
beyond the central government. The findings mirror the external debt sustainability analysis:
The scenarios based on historical averages and the standard stress tests confirm the declining
and benign profile of debt for the forecast period. The projections under the historical
scenarios differ from the baseline in two respects: a higher average annual GDP growth of
0.6 percent and a lower primary surplus of 4.2 percent. Under the baseline scenario, the
public sector debt ratio would decline gradually and stabilize at 14.4 percent of GDP in 2015.
Even under standard stress tests, the projected level of public debt would remain well below
40-60 percent of GDP, the range that is often deemed too high for an emerging market.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GABON
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Informational Annex
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Dhaneshwar Ghura
February 2, 2011



Relations with the Fund. Gabon has been a member of the International
Monetary Fund since 1963. CEMAC member countries accepted the obligations
of Article VIII in June/July 1996. The three-year SBA for about US$118 million
expired in May 2010, with only the first three reviews completed. Recurrent fiscal
slippages made it difficult to sustain the Fund-supported program.



Relations with the World Bank. The World Bank signed a $10 million service
agreement with the government which covers sectoral assistance as well as a
comprehensive growth analysis and public financial management reform.



Exchange rate regime: Gabon is a member of the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community (CEMAC). The common currency, the CFA franc, is
pegged at the fixed rate of 655.957 CFA franc per euro. Gabon’s tax on wire
transfers constitutes a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions subject to approval under Article VIII, Section
2 (a) of the Articles of Agreement.



Statistical Issues. Gabon has subscribed to the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). While data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, staff
analysis was affected by the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, the poor
quality of balance of payments data, and the limited information on labor cost and
productivity.

IX. Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on
July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment indicate that implementation of previous

4
safeguards recommendations on financial reporting, internal audit, and internal control has
been limited, and that the changing risk profile of the BEAC foreign exchange holdings
requires further actions to strengthen safeguards at the BEAC. Subsequent to revelation of
Paris office fraud, a series of initial measures and longer term safeguard measures were
agreed between IMF and BEAC in order to continue with country programs. In December
2009, BEAC adopted an action plan with the aim of reforming its own governance and
strengthening key safeguards. While implementation of the 2009 action plan is still in
progress, BEAC adopted additional measures to address the weaknesses highlighted by the
first special audit.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Gabon is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
The common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of CFAF
655.957= €1. Gabon does not have a separate currency.
Like other members of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC),
Gabon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2.3 and 2.4 of the IMF Articles
of Agreement. Gabon levies a tax on all wire transfers, including for the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions, which gives rise to an exchange
restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement.
XI. Article IV Consultations:
(a) Gabon was on a 24-month Article IV consultation cycle while the Stand-By Arrangement
was on track and has since been moved to a 12-month cycle.
(b) The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation with Gabon on
July 28, 2008.
XII. FSAP Participation:
A national module for Gabon of the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) was completed in 2002 and discussed by the Executive Board in
March 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/98). A regional FSAP module for the CEMAC was
completed in 2006 and discussed by the Executive Board in 2006 (IMF Country Report
No. 06/321).

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(Updated as of December 9, 2010)
1.
Gabon is one of Africa’s few IBRD countries. The Bank is working closely with the
IMF team to support structural measures, particularly for PFM reform and the development
of natural resources.
The Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
The Board of Directors approved the last Gabon Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) on
May 24, 2005, and discussed a CAS progress report on January 17, 2008. Discussions are
currently underway with the new Government on its priorities for WB support under a new
CAS (existing CAS ended June 2009). Possible areas of future cooperation would include
energy, telecommunications, and urban development. A US$75 million road transport
operation is scheduled to go to the Board in 2011. Additional new lending operations will be
determined based on Government priorities.
2.
In August 2010, a three year US$10 million Reimbursable Technical Assistance
Agreement (RTA) was signed to assist the authorities to update their PRSP. The activities
focus on public financial management, assessing potential sources of growth in non-oil
activities, and an update of the country’s poverty profile.
3.
As of September 2010, there were five active World Bank financed projects in
Gabon, with a commitment value of approximately US$51 million. Each operation
emphasizes improving transparency and efficiency in the use of public resources and
improving the environment for participation of the private sector. Projects include:


Two IBRD-funded operations: a Natural Resources Management Development Policy
Loan approved in November 2005 (US$15 million) and Public Investment Program
for Local Infrastructure Development approved in March 2006 (US$25 million);



A GEF-funded capacity building project for natural resource management
(US$10 million); and



Two trust fund operations: an IDF grant for building capacity for managing large
infrastructure projects (US$420,000) and a Forest Carbon Partnership Facility
Readiness Grant (US$200,000).

4.
Currently, the IFC has an exposure of US$32.5 million in oil, gas, electricity, and
telecommunications and the World Bank Group’s Foreign Investment Advisory Services
(FIAS) completed a diagnostic study of the investment climate in late 2004. The IFC is
currently negotiating a Service Agreement to improve the business climate. A US$61 million
MIGA guarantee for rehabilitation and modernization of a professional training institute was
approved by the Board in May 2005. This project is MIGA’s first in the education sector.
IMF–World Bank Collaboration

7
IMF and World Bank staff collaborate closely in supporting reforms to foster economic
diversification and in coordinating their policy advice to the Gabonese authorities. In view of
the ambitious structural measures envisaged under the government’s program, successful
implementation of the reform program will require substantial technical assistance by the
World Bank Group, as spelled out in the three-year service agreement. This includes the
areas of business climate improvements, effective and efficient public resources management
(including MTEF), poverty reduction policies, nonrenewable resource management, and
identification and development of sources of growth in the non-oil sector.
IMF–World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas where there is no direct IMF involvement
5.
The Bank supported completion of the Government’s poverty reduction strategy has
helped the Government to design its first national statistical development strategy and
provides continued support for strengthening statistical capacity and assisting the NSO
(National Statistical Office). In summer 2005 the Bank provided financial and technical
assistance for household surveys using a Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) to
update social indicators to be monitored annually. The results of the CWIQ household survey
were used in finalizing the GPRSP.
6.
The Bank provided support to develop statistical capacity in Gabon through a
recipient-executed (Ministry of Plan) statistical capacity building grant from the Statistical
Capacity Building Program in the amount of US$399,850. Implementation took place from
September 2007 to June 2010. The objective of the grant was to support the government in
the development of a national strategy for the development of statistics.
7.
In the context of the RTA, a poverty study will be carried out as well as analytical
work on sources and constraints to growth, economic and export diversification as well as
competitiveness.
Areas where the World Bank leads and its analysis guides IMF activity
8.
In November 2005, the Bank Board approved a US$15 million Natural Resources
Management Development Policy Loan (DPL) that covers the forest, environment, fisheries,
mining, and oil sectors. This operation aims at improving the efficiency of natural resources
management, accelerating poverty reduction, protecting the environment, and reducing the
country’s oil dependence. In the oil sector, it will support implementation of the EITI. In
March 2006, the Board also approved a US$10 million grant from the Global Environment
Facility for Gabon’s national parks. It focuses on improving transparency, law enforcement,
and removing policy distortions and on helping the authorities implement reforms and
empower civil society organizations and local communities to manage natural resources. The
project is expected to broaden the number of beneficiaries and raise social and environmental

8
standards in the forestry, fishing, and mining sectors, and thus help the government to
diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on oil.
9.
In June 2004 the Bank completed a US$5 million Pilot Community Infrastructure
Development Project (Learning and Innovation Loan) designed to test new methods for
building community-based infrastructure and supporting local contractors. The goal was to
improve living conditions in certain poor urban neighborhoods in a sustainable way and with
substantial community participation. The project also aimed at building local capacity to
undertake a larger program of community-based public works. The initiative was successful,
and the Bank on March 14, 2006, approved a US$25 million loan to (i) increase the access of
people living in low-income settlements to basic services; and (ii) sustain the access of local
SMEs to civil works and public construction contracts. The project is likely to increase the
access of the poor to infrastructure and services, build up SMEs, and improve the quality of
public works through increased transparency and efficient procurement and contract
management.
10.
Possible new projects include a US$35 million rural electrification project. In
electricity, the Government has now expressed interest in collaborating in (i) rural and periurban electrification, (ii) energy efficiency, (iii) institutional capacity building including
climate change and (iv) potential structural investments. Options also include the provision
of Additional Financing to continue the Local Infrastructure Development Project which
closes in December 2011.
11.
Within the context of the RTA, sectoral analytical work is planned to be carried out in
the areas of agriculture and livestock, the financial sector, fisheries, timber, information and
communication technologies and tourism. This analytical work would include technical
assistance for each stage of the development of the respective sector, from market analysis
and pre-evaluation of investments necessary for the development of the respective industry to
technical assistance for the implementation of an action plan.
12.
The Bank, through SEGOM (formerly COCPO), has provided support to the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Gabon (“how-to” guidance), including
initial technical support to assist the Government, industry, and civil society understand the
key features of EITI and its benefits in terms of broader governance in the management of
natural resources.
Areas of shared responsibility
13.
Strengthening public financial management. The Bank and the Fund will provide
coordinated TA on strengthening PFM. Proposed areas of support include:
-

Serving as the framework for the PFM TA planned by the two institutions, FAD
undertook a comprehensive PFM diagnostic mission in July 2010. This will be
followed by more detailed diagnostic work.

9
-

Expenditure Management: The Bank will provide TA around the development of
a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Support will include work to
(i) refine the priority action plan of the PRSP; (ii) strengthen systems for the
development of the macroeconomic and budgetary framework and sectoral
MTEFs; and (iii) revise the circular for the budget preparation and the assessment
of the integrated system in place for programming and monitoring. Work will be
closely coordinated with the Fund, which will use the MTEF as an instrument to
link fiscal policies with the overall macroeconomic framework.

-

Debt Management: Based on a debt management performance assessment (which
could commence immediately after a request is received from the government),
the Bank will provide TA for the development of a debt strategy, the
establishment of a debt office, and the provision of training and support in the
implementation of the reform plan.

-

Public investment management: Based on a diagnostic of the current system, the
Bank proposes TA to support the development of a new framework for public
investment management, its implementation, and training.

14.
Strengthening tax policies. The Fund received a request for TA on tax policy
development, including corporate income and natural resource taxation. The Bank’s service
contract also includes tax policy issues as part of investment advisory services which are a
component of its growth diagnostic. To ensure close coordination, the Bank will consult with
FAD on all tax policy missions that may be planned. This could take the form of sharing
mission briefs and undertaking bilateral exchanges. On natural resource taxation, FAD will
focus on providing core tax policy advice while the Bank focuses on long-term sector and
capacity building support (see below).
15.
Strengthening the financial sector. The Fund has funding from the Japanese
government for a project to strengthen regional financial agencies in the CEMAC region.
This will be closely coordinated with the Bank’s program on financial sector TA to ensure
complementarity.
16.
Improving natural resource management. The Fund will provide TA on natural
resource (mining) taxation/tax policy. The Bank will undertake sector-specific analysis
linked to the government’s agenda of economic growth and diversification, providing TA in
the areas of mining, forestry and fisheries.
17.
Extractive industries. The Bank will provide TA in the areas of: (i) the establishment
of a national oil company; (ii) the mapping of main mining sites to be developed; (iii) the
preparation of a new/revised mining code; and (iv) the preparation of a new/revised hydropower code.

10
18.
Areas where the Fund takes the lead and its analysis guides Bank-supported programs
are in the dialogue on fiscal matters, which sets the envelope for public expenditures. The
IMF leads the dialogue on policies to contain certain public expenditures, such as those
regarding the public wage bill and definition of the ceiling for public investment. In these
areas, the Bank ensures that its own policy advice is consistent with IMF recommendations.
The IMF is also monitoring implementation of trade liberalization measures being taken at
the CEMAC (regional) level. This supplements a significant program of Bank work to
support regional integration among CEMAC countries. These measures should improve the
business climate and will complement work by the Bank (in conjunction with the IFC) to
facilitate investment.
19.
Areas where there is no direct World Bank involvement relate to the dialogue on
monetary policy, interest rates, the exchange rate, the balance of payments, and related
statistical and measurement issues.

11
ANNEX III. GABON: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Staff’s analysis is affected by shortcomings in the accuracy, reliability and adequacy of
periodicity and timeliness for certain data, as well as consistency between datasets. The
statistical producing agencies do not have sufficient access to source data and lack an
institutional framework in which to share information and coordinate compilation efforts.
2.
Gabon participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) but has not
updated the metadata or plans for improvement since 2002. Except for consumer prices, the
authorities do not report any real sector or government finance statistics (GFS) to STA for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) or for electronic dissemination.
Detailed economic and financial statistics, including long historical time series, are published
in the Tendances de l’Économie, issued twice a year by the General Directorate of Statistics
and Economic Studies (DGSEE) of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, Industry, and Tourism.
More recent sectoral developments are described in detail in the Tableau de Bord de
l'Économie, issued quarterly by the Ministry of the Economy.
National accounts
3.
Central AFRITAC (AFC) is working with authorities to incorporate the System of
National Accounts 1993 methodological recommendations, particularly in the valuation of
sectoral value added at basic prices. Coverage of developments in oil and other key export
sectors is based on a range of indicators that may not fully capture the profits these sectors
generate. Despite recent improvements in collecting and processing oil sector statistics, there
are still significant inconsistencies between national accounts and balance of payments
statistics. In addition, more frequent household surveys are required to improve the quality
and quantity of data on income distribution and consumption. Two 2008 AFC missions have
provided technical assistance on the treatment of statistics and fiscal statements (SFS), and
the implementation of Access software for the SFS compilation. Efforts are needed to
establish a more consistent database. The processing of the SFS of 2007 for the compilation
of the national accounts of the same year is planned to be finalized by end-2008.
Employment and unemployment
4.

Data on unemployment and the total labor force are not systematically available.

Prices
5.
In 2007 the authorities began publishing an improved CPI index, which covers the
same basket of goods and services as the CEMAC Harmonized Consumer Price Index
(HCPI) and uses a weighting scheme derived from Gabon’s 2005 household expenditure
survey. However, it only covers the capital city of Libreville.

12
Government finance statistics
6.
A major shortcoming is limited institutional coverage, as social security operations
are not included in the statement of operations of central or general government. Audited
accounts of oil sector operations are generally available annually and sometimes quarterly,
but with a significant reporting lag. Other needed improvements relate, inter alia, to the
recording in the budget accounts of government-owned capital formation financed by oil
companies and the recording of government domestic payment arrears.
Monetary statistics
7.
The Bank of Central African States (BEAC) regularly reports in electronic form
monthly monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for Gabon and other CEMAC
member countries for publication in IFS, but delays occur sometimes in the submission of
data. Institutional coverage of the monetary statistics for Gabon is comprehensive, but
accuracy is affected by cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC member
countries.
8.
The BEAC started in mid-2007 a project to migrate monetary statistics of member
countries of the CEMAC to the methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM). As part of this project, a regional workshop was organized by the BEAC in
December 2007 to finalize the mapping of source data from commercial banks to the MFSM
concepts and framework. STA participated in this workshop to provide guidance and advice.
The BEAC has recently submitted test monetary data for Gabon using the standardized report
forms for the period January 2000–December 2007.
External public debt
9.
There are comprehensive data on the stock of external public debt and its
composition, as well as detailed projections on debt service due. Data are provided, usually
to Fund missions, by the General Directorate of Public Debt and Accounting (Direction
générale de la comptabilité publique) of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, Budget, and
Privatization.
Balance of payments and trade statistics
10.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the national directorate of the BEAC
and the estimates are validated by staff from BEAC headquarters. Data are disseminated with
considerable delay, and the latest available official statistics are for 2006. Since 1995,
compilation of balance of payments statistics has conformed to the Balance of Payments
Manual, 5th edition. Source data are collected through (i) surveys of enterprises by the central
bank (the main source of data); (ii) reports from banks and the postal administration on
foreign exchange transactions of other enterprises, retailers, and private individuals; and
(iii) BEAC reports on banknote movements between Gabon and other BEAC countries.
External trade data are mostly based on estimates, which are not cross-checked with customs

13
data. Data on other items of the current account are not very reliable or accurate due to low
response rates to enterprise surveys, despite partial correction through adjustments. Foreign
direct investment in the financial account is likely to be underestimated owing to insufficient
detail in the oil sector survey. The magnitude and detailed breakdown of private capital
flows, particularly short term, suffer because data are not comprehensive.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 4, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Gabon
On February 18, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Gabon.1
Background
Gabon is recovering from the financial crisis. Low prices and weak demand for commodities
shrank the fiscal and current account surpluses in 2009 and turned growth moderately negative.
Real Gross Domestic Product is estimated to increase to 5.7 percent in 2010 and remain
broadly at that level in 2011, reflecting public investment and a rebound in mining. Average
annual inflation is projected to remain subdued. The non-oil primary deficit will deteriorate
significantly, reflecting the increase in government investment and the fall in non-oil revenues.
Economic activity is projected to remain robust in 2011, supported by mining, wood processing,
and public investment. Inflation is forecast to pick up, mostly driven by higher food and energy
prices. The foremost risk to the economic outlook is a decline in oil and manganese prices,
because these commodities accounted for about 90 percent of total exports of goods and
45 percent of nominal GDP on average during the last decade.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
To improve the quality of spending and release resources for growth-enhancing spending and
social outlays, the government is strengthening public financial management. Reforms to
enhance the business environment for private sector promotion focus on abolishing
burdensome regulations involving lengthy procedures. Also, to facilitate access to financial
services, work is ongoing to finalize the microfinance medium-term strategy.
Looking ahead, the government aims to transform Gabon into an emerging economy through
diversification away from oil and promotion of a business friendly environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed that Gabon is on a path of recovery from the global crisis.
Looking ahead, the key challenge will be preparing the economy for the post-oil period through
economic diversification, increased external competitiveness, and poverty reduction. Directors
stressed the importance of maintaining long-term fiscal sustainability, improving the business
environment, and strengthening the financial sector as key pillars of the authorities’ strategy to
transform Gabon into an emerging economy.
Directors emphasized that, as oil reserves dwindle, sustained fiscal consolidation, while
addressing Gabon’s substantial development needs, is crucial. Annual budgets need to be
linked to longer-term policies and to making progress toward fiscal sustainability. Capital
spending should be anchored in a realistic multiyear investment plan and a credible
medium-term fiscal strategy to safeguard macroeconomic stability. A number of Directors saw
scope in the short term for accelerating fiscal consolidation, while at the same time scaling up
infrastructure and health and education investment. A few other Directors saw merit in a more
gradual adjustment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen public financial management to
improve the quality of spending and release resources for growth-enhancing spending and
social outlays. Reforms to refocus public investment on key infrastructure and social projects
and to strengthen the appraisal, selection, and monitoring of projects are a priority. Directors
also stressed the importance of enhanced transparency and accountability in the management
of resources from the country’s extractive sector, in particular with respect to the new funds
under consideration.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate appears broadly in
line with fundamentals. At the same time, they encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to
enhance external competitiveness. To address the poor performance of the non-oil sector,
structural reforms are needed to improve the business climate, build basic infrastructure,
enhance health and education services, and increase labor market flexibility.
Directors underlined that limited access to financial services remains a serious obstacle to
private sector development. They considered that priority should be given to improving the
institutional and regulatory environment, in particular for small and medium enterprises.

3
Directors advised the authorities to eliminate as soon as possible the tax on wire transfers,
which gives rise to an exchange restriction under Article VIII.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the quality of economic and financial
data, making use of technical assistance from the Fund and donors.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Gabon
February 18, 2011
On behalf of my authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to the Executive Board,
Management, and staff for their continued advice and assistance to Gabon. My authorities
particularly welcome the discussions held with staff during their visits to Gabon in March
and November 2010. My authorities appreciate staff recommendations and inputs in their
economic development plan for the post-oil era.
Recent developments
After turning negative in 2009 due to the global economic crisis, real GDP growth is
estimated at 5.7 percent in 2010 and is projected to remain at the same level in 2011, driven
by the strong public demand and a rebound in the mining sector. Inflation remained low in
2010 but is expected to increase in 2011 owing to higher food and energy prices. The
financial sector weathered the global crisis well and the banking system remains profitable.
The country went through a political transition in 2009, marked by the election of a new
president in August 2009. Upon taking office, the new authorities gave their attention to the
significant long-term challenges facing Gabon, including the achievement of high and
sustained non-oil growth and improving social indicators in a context of dwindling oil
reserves.
To address these challenges, my authorities developed and rolled out an economic
development plan aimed at reducing the country’s dependence on oil through economic
diversification. This plan encompasses a series of institutional and structural reforms
covering a wide range of areas, as well as a vast public investment program aimed at
strengthening basic infrastructure in the country. Its main objectives are to support non-oil
private sector development and improve the quality of life for the Gabonese population.
Fiscal performance and sustainability
In 2009 and 2010, my authorities took strong measures to reduce nonessential expenditures.
In particular, they carried out a census of civil servants to detect and eliminate ghost workers
from the public payroll. In addition, they have significantly reduced the number of high-level
positions in the civil service. Savings from these measures have enabled the authorities to
notably accelerate the hiring of new workers in the health, education and security sectors.
The investment program in 2010 focused on the rehabilitation and development of transport,
energy, and communication infrastructure. In the health and education sectors, new
classrooms are being built and health infrastructure is being upgraded.
Overall, the implementation of the economic program increased total spending by 4.9 percent
of GDP in 2010, which has been accommodated by higher oil revenue (4.5 percent of GDP)
stemming from higher oil production and prices. However, while the overall balance remains
in surplus, the non oil primary deficit (NOPD) widened from 14 percent of non-oil GDP in
2009 to 21.1 percent in 2010.

2

My Gabonese authorities recognize the need to maintain fiscal prudence and sustainability
going forward, in order to preserve macroeconomic stability and the country’s external
competitiveness, and hence achieve their development goals. My authorities fully subscribe
to staff’s recommendations to avoid a procyclical fiscal policy and bring the NOPD down to
a more sustainable level over the medium-term. However, they stress that the level of
expenditures is expected to remain high during the implementation of the public investment
program over the next few years. They are currently preparing a medium-term expenditure
framework which aims to gradually lower the NOPD, notably by reducing gradually capital
spending, pursuing wage and employment reforms, and pursuing the rationalization of
expenditures on goods and services as well as transfers and subsidies.
My authorities also believe that ongoing tax and customs administration reforms and a better
control of tax exemptions will strengthen non-oil revenue over time. They stress that the tax
exemptions already granted in the context of the special economic zone (SEZ) will expire
according to the law. They are of the view that the impact of the SEZ on growth and
eventually on fiscal revenue will outweigh the corresponding tax expenditures. Regarding
specifically the tax on wire transfers, my authorities are working to resolve this issue.
However, reforming this tax is politically sensitive due to the fact that proceeds from this tax
contribute to the financing of the health insurance fund.
In order to strengthen public financial management, my authorities introduced program
budgeting and adopted modern principles of financial management to become effective in
2012, as recommended by Fund TA mission. They are now holding weekly meetings to
monitor investment-related payments, in order to avoid any accumulation of arrears and
strengthen accountability. On the new institutions being created, they will ensure that they
are not of an extra-budgetary nature and that they have strong governance structures.
My authorities intend to pursue a proactive debt policy, consistent with the 2011-2013 debt
strategy adopted with the 2011 budget. In light of the findings of the debt sustainability
analysis, this strategy limits the annual amount of new debt to be contracted by the
government and defines criteria for contracting new loans. The framework for debt
management has been strengthened with the creation of a Directorate General of Debt and
the establishment of a national committee on public debt.
Public Investment Program
The public investment program aims at addressing infrastructure needs in the country. In
particular, the selection of infrastructure projects will be guided by the need to boost and link
the five geographical development centers identified in the development plan as having
specific potential in sectors that are deemed essential for the diversification of the economy.
Consistent with this approach, the SEZ being established will offer developed infrastructure
and various incentives for the timber industry to invest in the local processing of logs and
export of high value-added wood products.

3
In order to strengthen public investment management, a national agency for major public
works was set up, entrusted with the planning, management, and implementation of large
public infrastructure projects. This agency is benefiting from foreign technical expertise. In
addition, a service contract was signed in November 2010 with the World Bank to enhance
national capacities in this area.
Financial Sector Reforms
In the financial sector, my authorities recognize the important role that an efficient credit
system can play in the development of the economy. In this respect, they are undertaking
reforms to strengthen the credit infrastructure. These reforms include improved mechanisms
and procedures to settle loan contract disputes, streamlined procedures for the realization of
guarantees to obtain loans, and creation of a corporate balance sheet centralization system at
the central bank that provides commercial banks access to companies’ balances. Also, they
have streamlined the number of state-owned and sponsored financial institutions involved in
SMEs and housing financing through notably mergers and restructuring, and appointed new
top management teams. Work is also ongoing to finalize the microfinance development
strategy and expand access to credit, while limiting operational and security risks. Going
forward, Gabon intends to subscribe to the capital of the African Guarantee and Economic
Cooperation Fund, which guarantees bank loans to SMEs. My authorities believe that all
these actions will contribute to lower financing costs and increase access to financial services
by SMEs and households.
Other Structural Reforms
Along with building infrastructure and reforming the financial sector, improving the business
environment is a central piece of my authorities’ plan to promote private sector development
and enhance the country’s long-term growth prospects. In this regard, my authorities signed a
service agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in November 2010 to
help the government identify the necessary measures to abolish burdensome regulations
involving lengthy procedures, based on the analysis of the World Bank’s Doing Business.
They also streamlined the number of government agencies involved in export and investment
promotion and set up a competition authority which will ensure that the free play of
competition is not hampered by illicit price-setting arrangements, notably in the retail market.
My authorities are also reforming the oil sector. A national oil company is being created and
the Fund for Future Generations has been converted into a Strategic Sovereign Fund that
will, among other things, enable the government to take equity stakes in companies of
strategic importance for Gabon.
The public administration is also being revamped. Organizational structures of ministerial
departments are being modified and their mandates are being updated.
Money and Exchange Rate

4
Gabon is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
The regional currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro. The membership in the CEMAC
has served the economy well, and monetary policy has been appropriate and prudent. As
noted above, the Gabonese authorities will continue their structural reform efforts to improve
the competitiveness of the economy.
Conclusion
Gabon is facing the significant long-term challenges of achieving high and sustained non-oil
growth and improving social indicators in a context of dwindling oil reserves. To address this
challenge, my authorities have embarked on an economic development plan aimed at
reducing the country’s dependence on oil through economic diversification. Aware of the
existing capacity constraints in the country and in order to ensure a sound, well-sequenced
and cost-efficient implementation of their plan, my authorities have actively sought the
technical expertise of reputable international organizations and corporations, including the
Fund, the World Bank and the IFC. They remain determined to preserve macroeconomic
stability going forward and will adapt their fiscal policy framework accordingly, notably by
developing a medium-term fiscal framework.
