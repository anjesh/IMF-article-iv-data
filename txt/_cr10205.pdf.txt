Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by European Department

Executive Summary
Context: The impact of the global crisis was buffered through the use of previously accumulated fiscal
and monetary policy space. This policy space is now depleted and needs to be rebuilt urgently to mitigate
risks to macroeconomic stability. The task is to recalibrate policies following the authorities’ countercyclical response to the crisis in a setting where domestic vulnerabilities and regional risks remain
substantial.
Outlook: The baseline is for a V-shaped recovery, albeit to a lower potential growth than before the
crisis, with low inflation and external imbalances narrowing. However, downside risks are significant
and elevated budget financing requirements under unchanged policies will crowd out private investment,
thereby undermining potential growth over the medium term.
Policy Discussions: A tighter fiscal stance with improvements in productivity and competitiveness is a
superior adjustment strategy, and consolidation could serve to enhance, rather than damage, growth
prospects. The authorities’ fiscal adjustment strategy is based on over-optimistic revenue and growth
expectations. There was agreement of the benefits of a clear, credible, and monitorable fiscal rule to
safeguard fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy should remain cautious and supervisors remain vigilant,
given heightened regional uncertainty. Improvements in the business environment are critical to harvest
the benefits from closer EU integration.
Albania follows (de facto) a floating exchange rate regime with occasional interventions. Albania
maintains exchange rate restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, but maintains no
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII.
Team: Mr. Bell (head), Ms. Chen, Mr. Steinlein (all EUR), Mr. Christofides (SPR), and Ms. Pereira
(FAD) visited Tirana from February 25 to March 9, 2010 and met with the Prime Minister, the Ministers
of Finance and of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, senior officials of the administration,
parliamentarians, the private sector, and academics. An outreach conference was held on March 4, 2010
with staff presentations on fiscal rules, euroization, market access conditions, and competitiveness.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Albania’s Strengths and Weaknesses at the Onset of the Global Crisis
1.
Before the crisis, Albania enjoyed strong growth with comparatively benign
external vulnerabilities (Figure 1, Table 1). Sustained macroeconomic stability, a simplification
of the tax system, and structural reforms—in the context of subsequent Fund-supported programs
and generally good implementation of past Fund advice—helped boost investment and
productivity. As a result, growth averaged some 6¼ percent during 2005–08, largely based on
advancements in total factor productivity, while inflation was kept in check. Although current
account deficits had crept up over time, they mainly reflected an ambitious public investment
program and transition-driven productivity gains.
2.
At the onset of the crisis, Albania benefited from a flexible monetary policy
framework, sound banks, and substantial foreign exchange reserve buffers, while its
weaknesses were mainly structural and elevated public debt. Inflation expectations were low,
the exchange rate stable, and the financial system entered the crisis well capitalized and
relatively solvent, liquid, and profitable (Figure 2). To a large extent this was due to the Bank of
Albania’s (BoA) early and successful adoption of macroprudential measures that, inter alia,
slowed credit growth and limited the balance sheet effects of unhedged foreign currency lending
(Box 1). External debt was low (17 percent of GDP) and reserves coverage stood above six
months of imports. In addition, the impact of the crisis was mitigated through the limited
importance of the export channel in Albania and its smaller reliance on market financing.
However, total public debt levels were sizable. Other weaknesses were concentrated in the
structural area, especially a comparatively underdeveloped business environment.
3.
Despite Albania’s limited integration into global financial markets, the crisis was
transmitted to its economy via a number of channels. As elsewhere in the region, Albanian
banks witnessed substantial panic deposit withdrawals on the heels of the dislocation in US
financial markets and amplified concerns about the health of the Greek banking system in the fall
of 2008 (text chart). Deposits did not start to recover until the second half of 2009. In
February 2009, pressures mounted on the lek, and only subsided after intervention from the BoA
and substantial new inflows through privatization receipts and a syndicated loan. The recession
in trading partners—particularly Greece and Italy—led to falling exports. Finally, remittances
and nonclassified inflows, while imprecisely measured—are estimated to have fallen drastically.

B. The Crisis Response—Use of Built-Up Policy Buffers
4.
Building on these strengths, the authorities were able to use accumulated policy
space to soften the immediate blow from the crisis, and Albania has performed better than
most other regional and European economies.


Ample liquidity buffers were utilized to meet deposit withdrawals. Throughout, foreign
banks increased exposure, inter alia complying with a BoA ban on distributing
dividends, and continued to extend credit. To further boost confidence, deposit insurance
limits were raised fivefold.



Monetary loosening, initially by quantitative easing in late 2008 via BoA direct liquidity
injections, was followed by interest rate cuts by 50 bps each in January and October
2009. Meanwhile the lek depreciated by a cumulative 14 percent.



Considerable fiscal stimulus was also provided, in part financed from the privatization
of the electricity distribution system. In the first place, automatic stabilizers on the
revenue side were given full play (1 percent of GDP). In addition, social security
contributions were cut and a large infrastructure project was in train. Moreover, there was
a strong fiscal relaxation prior to the mid-2009 elections. Together these created another
1 percent of GDP fiscal impulse.



Growth continued at an estimated 2.8 percent, in contrast to most of Europe that
witnessed declines. Inflation has mostly been in line with the target of 3±1 percent,
though depreciation pass through and higher electricity prices have recently lifted
inflation above 4 percent.

6
Box 1. Albania: A Case of Effective Macro-Prudential Measures
Using powers under the new Banking Act of 2006, the BoA undertook decisive measures to restrain high
credit growth.
To improve credit risk management, stricter requirements were placed on individual banks based on
their: (i) rate of credit growth, and (ii) levels of nonperforming loans. For example,


the BoA imposed higher capital adequacy ratios (12½–13 percent) on two banks than the
minimum of 12 percent;



non-euro denominated foreign currency lending was banned;



the maximum risk weights were raised to 150 percent and banks were required to slow their
credit growth by reducing acceptable levels of customers’ debt service to income ratios to below
25 percent;



maintenance of foreign bank exposure was helped by strong moral suasion, and if needed, by
suspending dividends distribution;



in few cases, managers of banks were also removed or banks were asked to suspend expansion
of branch networks.

The BoA took a proactive approach to increase awareness on loan quality through open forums, meetings
and official letters. This approach included:


requiring prudent loan-to-value ratios;



encouraging tighter internal loan classification rules;



promoting prudence in foreign currency lending; and,



establishing a credit registry (banks submit daily (i) detailed information on the borrower and
terms of all new loans; (ii) information on related persons; and (iii) information on collateral
(banks report the status and internal classification for each loan quarterly). Banks are required to
obtain a credit report from the registry for each new credit. During on-site examinations, BoA
inspectors check the files to assure adherence to this requirement.

C. The Post-Crisis Context—A Depleted Arsenal
5.
Policy space is now exhausted with vulnerabilities up sharply, especially given a
more challenging regional and political environment.


The fiscal position deteriorated significantly and reestablishing control over
expenditure has proved a challenge. In 2009, the fiscal deficit increased to 7.4 percent
of GDP (Table 2). Consequently, public debt shot to close to 60 percent of GDP,
40 percent of it short-term with substantial rollover risks. Moreover, a late-year attempt
at pulling back was not successful and resulted in arrears of 0.5 percent of GDP.



The banking system is only slowly recovering. Slow remonetization, rising NPLs and
only creeping credit growth have lowered profitability significantly (Tables 3 and 4).
Meanwhile, there has been some concern about the financial health of some parent banks.

External imbalances rose. In contrast to the region, imports declined only modestly,

add to these challenges. While the
country made important progress on EU integration, submitting its membership
application in 2009, Albania is exposed to the Mediterranean euro-periphery via
significant trade, remittances, and financial sector links to Greece and Italy. Greek bank
subsidiaries and branches account for one quarter of the banking system and have the
lowest capital and liquidity buffers in the system. Meanwhile, political uncertainty
continues as the opposition has not accepted the outcome of the mid-2009 elections.1

authorities were more optimistic, expecting activity to bounce back more quickly.
7.
Substantial differences of view emerged over medium-term growth prospects. In
contrast to some other regional economies, Albania experienced only mild capital-inflowsupported overheating, thereby limiting the buildup of output gaps. This background comforted
the authorities in their view that pre-crisis growth rates would quickly re-emerge as Albania,
compared to other countries, would see less of a need to recalibrate its growth model. Staff, on
the other hand, saw future potential growth increasingly pulled down by high fiscal financing
requirements.

The baseline inflation outlook remains
benign. Administrative price increases may drive
headline inflation temporarily above the
3±1 percent target band in the near term. However,
underlying inflation is expected to remain under
control, and annual inflation is projected at
3.5 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in the medium
term, benefitting from the well entrenched
credibility of the monetary policy framework (see
background paper).

significantly narrow, though partly through an
undesirable compression of investment. Helped by the recent depreciation of the real exchange
rate, which eliminated the overvaluation depicted in GGER-type analysis, the current account
deficit can narrow from 14 to 13 percent this year, and should decline further over the medium
term to reach a sustainable level. The real exchange rate appears competitive and not to pose a
risk to external stability (Box 2). However, high budget deficits are severely crowding out the
private sector. Owing to the projected increased interest rates from high levels of government
borrowing, private savings are projected to pick up sharply. While companies will partially
compensate for reduced bank financing by own-funding capital expenditure, private investment
will not be able to recover to past levels, thus undermining potential growth. A tighter fiscal
stance with improvements in productivity and competitiveness would be a superior adjustment
strategy, a topic that framed the policy discussions.

Downward risks to the baseline are significant. Both staff and the authorities agreed
that, apart from risks stemming from the external environment, domestic vulnerabilities remain.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The exchange rate does not appear to pose a risk to external stability. While various measures point to
some overvaluation at the end of 2008, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has since moved towards
equilibrium with depreciation of about 10 percent over 2009. However, a large deviation of the current
account from its medium-term norm remains to be corrected. On current policies, the latter correction is
projected to be driven by a substantial crowding out of the private sector.

Real PPP-based exchange rate (Index, Euro Area=100)

A long-run PPP-based assessment of the exchange rate does not suggest disequilibrium. Under this
approach the equilibrium real exchange rate is expected to reflect productivity differentials between
countries. When comparing productivities (approximated by GDP per capita in PPP prices) with their
real exchange rates per PPP dollar, Albania appears in line with other countries—within one standard
deviation from the trend line.

CGER-type analysis suggests the REER moving towards equilibrium in 2009.


The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach, which links the equilibrium exchange
rate to a set of fundamentals, suggests neither under- nor over-valuation at end-2009. This result
is obtained using CEE panel-based regression models estimating a long-run co-integrating
relationship between the REER and fundamentals, such as relative productivity, terms of trade,
and government consumption.



An assessment based on the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach using panel estimates
which incorporate new EU-member states (see WP/08/92) shows that the underlying current
account balance, i.e., stripped of temporary factors, is below the norm at end-2008. However,
the gap is narrowing in the medium term, albeit with the exchange rate remaining somewhat
overvalued (by about 8 percent). Explanatory variables for the current account norm include the
fiscal balance, the oil balance, net foreign assets, old age dependency, FDI, population and
output growth, and a remittances dummy.



The external sustainability (ES) approach indicates that a real depreciation of about 20 percent
would be required to stabilize the NFA to GDP ratio at its estimated end-2008 level.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Rebuilding Fiscal Space and Aligning the Budget with Sustainable Financing
11.
Fiscal consolidation was jointly seen as the key near- and medium-term policy
challenge. There was agreement that after the large fiscal stimulus in 2009, there was no further
scope for countercyclical policy and that the budget now needed to adjust.

Notwithstanding a still fragile economic recovery, fiscal consolidation is a priority. The
government’s large financing requirement and rollover needs threaten not only its chances to
access markets but macroeconomic stability in general. Moreover, the fiscal deficit has begun to

13
crowd out investment and fiscal consolidation could therefore serve to enhance, rather than
damage, growth prospects.
12.
Staff cautioned against using optimistic revenue forecasts as a basis for the
authorities’ strategy. The government has targeted a reduction in the deficit to 3 percent of
GDP over the medium term. However, much of this derives from revenue growth which is not
consistent with staff’s macroeconomic projections. Little progress has been made in adapting the
2010 budget to a more challenging economic environment, and a deficit of 5.2 percent of GDP is
expected.2 Under current policies, this would be followed by deficits in excess of 6 percent
throughout the medium term, pushing debt to close to 70 percent of GDP. The authorities
proposed to link certain expenditures to revenue performance, although they acknowledged that
this tactic had not worked in 2009 (when their attempts to cut contingent expenditures were not
successful despite significant revenue shortfalls).3

This assumes planned significant one-off cuts to the 2010 budget of some 30 billion lek or 2.5 percent of GDP.

In December 2009, attempts to withhold the usual year-end bonus payment to civil servants and pensioners were
not successful, though payments were reduced from the levels in previous years and customary pre-payments of
January salaries were not implemented.

A clear, credible, and monitorable fiscal rule could help safeguard medium-term
fiscal sustainability. Such a rule could put an end to the recent upward drift in deficits.
Moreover, a successful rule could give financial markets greater confidence into the
government’s efforts to cut debt over time, thereby boosting chances for market access. For the
rule to work, it would need to be binding on the authorities. Staff recommended anchoring the
rule to the objective of cutting public debt below 50 percent of GDP by the end of the current
government’s mandate in 2013 (Background paper). Two particular options were discussed.


Expenditure rule: this would be consistent with the authorities’ stated preference for a
small government. Keeping real expenditure constant, or limiting its increases to
2 percent could achieve debt reduction to 50 or 54 percent of GDP, respectively, by 2013.
This rule would preferably be augmented by a mechanism that would trigger lower
spending growth in the event of an unexpected revenue shortfall, while, in contrast,
positive surprises should translate into fiscal savings, reducing the risk of ever exceeding
the debt ceiling. In this way, the rule would allow for substantial play of automatic
stabilizers.



Deficit rule: this rule was favored by the authorities, as it places greater emphasis on
protecting recent gains in tax administration and the overall fiscal balance. However,
staff stressed that these gains notwithstanding, lower post-boom revenue would call into
question the current system of low income tax rates—flat at 10 percent—if the
authorities’ goal was to accommodate higher expenditure growth under a deficit rule.

15
14.
Staff pressed for upfront progress on fiscal consolidation. Targeting a cut in the 2010
deficit to around 3 percent of GDP, would lower the financing requirement, and mark a first step
toward credible public debt reduction. This should allow more credit to go toward private
investment, support the current account adjustment, and possibly improve the terms (and
availability) of market borrowing. To achieve such a target in 2010 requires a considerable share
of one-off measures that would need to be followed up by more structural measures over the
following years. Throughout, such adjustments can take place while protecting the most
vulnerable sections of the population.

3/ In the adjustment scenarion, contingencies would not be spent.



Past tax and contribution cuts should be reconsidered. Staff saw little evidence that
last year’s cut in social security contributions was delivering the expected improved
compliance; on the contrary, it aggravated the pension deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP,
which is high in view of Albania’s fairly young population. Staff advised against a
planned tax amnesty, as it could undermine future tax compliance.



Significant expenditure adjustments could be effected in 2010. The remaining
contingency allowance (0.4 percent of GDP) in the 2010 budget could be reduced. Public
investment should be scaled back from still historically high levels to more financeable
and administratively manageable levels after the completion of the Reshen-Kalimash

16
road. Looking forward, civil service employment levels should be rationalized, while
keeping wages and pensions in check. This could be helped by indexing the latter to only
inflation.
15.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to continue structural fiscal reforms.
Capital expenditure execution remains a challenge. In past years, before the large road project,
spending lagged well behind budgeted amounts (see table) and was only boosted through lateyear reallocations. A fall-back to past implementation problems is likely unless planning and
implementation capacities are significantly enhanced. Regarding tax administration, an effective
compliance strategy is especially urgent, including by addressing the under-reporting of taxable
income by high-wealth individuals and by capturing a greater share of informal economic
activity.

The authorities are seeking to place a Eurobond, to lessen the heavy reliance on shortterm domestic financing, reduce near-term rollover risk and lower crowding out. However,
heightened uncertainty in international markets may have an impact on the size and pricing of
the issue, and the authorities are keeping other options on the table, including a Fund-supported
program.
B.

Conducting Effective Monetary Policy and Preserving Financial Stability

17.
All agreed that the prevailing monetary policy framework—an inflation target
range combined with a flexible exchange rate—is an asset in the current uncertain
environment. It has endowed the economy with considerable resilience, as evidenced by the
limited impact of the energy and food price shock on Albania in 2007–08. Recently the moderate
depreciation eased the adjustment to the global crisis while keeping inflation expectations well
anchored. This is an important achievement especially within the context of still significant
euroization, and its attendant limits on monetary policy (Box 3).

17
Box 3. Euroization and Banking Sector Risks
Euroization increases banking sector risks and requires high capital and reserves buffer. Currency
mismatches could increase solvency risks of the banking sector directly through unfavorable exchange
rate movements or indirectly through credit risks of nonhedged portfolios. The central bank’s lender-oflast-resort facilities may only have limited funding in foreign currencies in case of bank runs, which
could aggravate creditors’ fears and trigger a run. Without any implications on the direction of causality,
empirical analysis on data in some South and Eastern European countries shows that a higher degree of
Euroization is associated with higher default probabilities and higher nonperforming loan levels. These
higher risks reduce the banking sector’s capacity to provide credit by requiring higher capital or reserves.

While lower Euroization would facilitate monetary policy, it cannot be forced and prudential
measures should be adopted to contain the risks. De-euroization policies could involve both marketbased and administrative measures, but should stick to the principle of first maintaining macroeconomic
stability, and in particular low inflation. However, a certain degree of Euroization appears inevitable as
Albania becomes more integrated into the European market, and indeed reflects confidence in the
country’s transition process. To effectively contain the risks, banking supervisors should enhance riskbased supervision by setting high standards for risk management and ensure that banks have adequate
buffers to handle large shocks.

Stress tests suggest that the banking system has sufficient buffers to weather the
expected downturn. The tests assessed key banking system risks:


Credit risk. The regulatory capital of the banking sector would remain above the
minimum required level, with two banks modestly undercapitalized according to Tier 1
leverage.



Liquidity risk. Some banks are vulnerable to reduced credit lines from parents. Reliance
on short-term BoA repo funding has increased to some €270 million in 2009.



Exchange rate risk. The banking sector would remain adequately capitalized with shocks
to the exchange rate due to its small positive foreign exchange positions, and the
associated indirect credit risks are fairly contained.



Interest rate risk. A few banks would become modestly undercapitalized with interest
rate hikes of 5 percent, but the banking sector would remain adequately capitalized.

20
The stress tests suggest that capital cushions, profits and increased provisioning should provide
enough resources to absorb foreseen loan losses. Assuming simultaneous shocks, some
institutions may require new capital, and the relevant banks have agreed to increase capital
accordingly.
20.
The near-term banking sector outlook is stable, but uncertainties loom large. Banks
have been aided by their reliance on funding through their domestic deposit base, which is now
recovering. Many foreign parents have boosted the capital of their subsidiaries. At the same
time, Albanian firms and households are only moderately leveraged compared to South Eastern
European (SEE) peers. Staff noted that strong supervision in the past had enabled banks to draw
on large liquidity and capital buffers to weather the crisis. However, a drawn-out recovery could
further worsen the quality of domestic credit. Moreover, other risks are emerging, and
supervisors need to stay ahead of evolving challenges and risks. Notably, contingency plans that
deal with new tail risks need to be elaborated. The macroprudential toolkit should be accordingly
adapted to address any developing risks to financial stability early on, and thereby lay the
foundation for a sustainable resumption of credit growth. Noting that all banks are again
permitted to distribute profits, it was now also time for banks to move to address non-performing
loans. In particular, they should begin aggressively seizing collateral of nonperforming loans or
seek viable loan restructuring. This would also promote the correction of the real estate market
and facilitate the rebalancing of the economy.
21.
Further development of the nonbank financial sector was seen as essential. The
authorities continue to work with the World Bank to develop the insurance and pension sectors,
which have potential to provide longer-term funds for investment; and staff advised that relevant
legal and regulatory problems in these two sectors should be resolved expeditiously.

An improved business environment is key to harnessing the advantages from
prospective EU integration. There was agreement that the Albanian economy needed to

Obstacles to the effective operation of privatized industries need to be addressed.
Staff encouraged the quick resolution of the regulatory issues regarding the privatized

21
electricity distributor OSSH that could potentially trigger a World Bank Partial Risk
Guarantee (PRG), with adverse effects for the country’s reputation. Furthermore,
increasing payment arrears from the privatized refinery complex (ARMO) threaten the
successful privatization of Albpetrol—and thereby the conclusion of the strategic
privatization program. Staff thus recommended the initiation of legal recovery
proceedings against ARMO.


Establishing a clear property rights system—particularly for land tenure—needs to be
sped up. To bypass this bottleneck, the authorities are planning a number of industrial
zones to attract additional investment, including from abroad.



Enforcing rules. Considerable implementation and enforcement gaps for formal rules as
well as the sizeable informal economy are key—and mutually reinforcing—weaknesses.

Sound macroeconomic statistics are essential for competent policy making and
investor confidence. The national statistical agency INSTAT has made formidable progress
over recent years, for example, by starting to publish quarterly national accounts and
continuously upgrading their quality. However, considerable scope for further improvement
remains. Staff recommended a significant increase of resources and administrative support for
INSTAT and welcomed the intention to subscribe to the IMF Special Data Dissemination
Standard.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
In the face of strong headwinds, the Albanian economy has weathered the global
crisis fairly well so far, in part reflecting policy stimulus. In the budget, the full play of
automatic stabilizers was supplemented by major expenditure increases. Monetary policy
provided timely support, and the exchange rate functioned as a shock absorber. GDP is estimated
to have registered positive growth of 2.8 percent in 2009. Moreover, confidence in the financial
sector has returned, as evidenced by the resumption of deposit growth, while inflation

22
expectations have remained well-contained. Both remittances and exports have begun to recover.
The baseline scenario is for a V-shaped recovery, albeit to a lower post-boom level of potential
growth, with growth in 2010 projected at 2–2½ percent. Underlying inflation is expected to
remain well contained.
25.
However, policy buffers are now exhausted and must be rebuilt. Especially given the
significant downward risks from the challenging external environment and sizeable domestic
vulnerabilities, quick progress must be made to redress internal and external imbalances. With
private sector adjustment already under way, the budget must achieve a significant turnaround to
bring down the current account deficit and make space for credit extension to the private sector.
26.
Fiscal tightening has to be quickly effected. The 2010 fiscal deficit should be cut to
around 3 percent of GDP (from 5.2 percent on unchanged policies) by a combination of one-time
and structural measures on both the revenue and expenditure side. Past tax and contributions cuts
should be reconsidered and a tax amnesty eschewed. All remaining contingency reserves in the
2010 budget should be saved. More fundamentally, and with more lasting impact, public
investment should be scaled back to more financeable and administratively manageable levels
after the completion of the Reshen-Kalimash road. Current spending needs to be revisited with a
view to rightsizing the civil service, and keeping wages and pensions in check, indexing them
only to inflation.
27.
Medium-term fiscal policy should be governed by a credible and monitorable fiscal
rule. Limiting real expenditure increases to below 2 percent could go some way toward
achieving the government’s goal of debt reduction to 50 percent by 2013. This rule would
preferably be augmented by a mechanism that would trigger lower spending growth in the event
of an unexpected revenue shortfall. In contrast, positive surprises should translate into fiscal
savings, reducing the risk of ever exceeding the debt ceiling.
28.
In addition to consolidation, there is also a role for debt management in lowering
fiscal risks. The authorities are appropriately seeking to place a Eurobond. However, heightened
uncertainty in international markets may have an impact on the size and pricing of the issue, and
the authorities are well advised to keep other options on the table, including a Fund-supported
arrangement, if a balance of payments need emerges.
29.
Financial sector supervisors need to continue to stay ahead of evolving challenges
and risks. Past strong supervision has proven its worth in helping banks weather the storm.
However, supervisors need to monitor developments closely and continuously elaborate
contingency plans that deal with tail risks. Banks should help the needed economy-wide
rebalancing and real-estate price correction by executing collateral of nonperforming loans or
seeking viable loan restructurings.
30.
The monetary policy framework and the flexible exchange rate have served the
economy well. Hence, the Bank of Albania should continue with its cautious stance, with a

23
strong focus on anchoring inflation expectations. While interest rate decisions should be
governed by actual and projected inflation developments with respect to the inflation target,
monetary policy makers should remain mindful of financial stability considerations and
macroprudential needs.
31.
Going forward, the Albanian economy needs to broaden its sources of growth and
strengthen competitiveness. This calls for further improvements in the business environment
and in investor protection. Priorities for action include the implementation and enforcement of
formal rules; improving the security of property rights (including for land tenure); and reducing
regulatory uncertainties associated with some past privatizations. Funding sources for new
investment could be boosted by finding new institutional investors, for instance, via accelerated
pension reforms.
32.
Sound macroeconomic statistics are essential for competent policy making and
investor confidence. The national statistical agency INSTAT has made formidable progress
over recent years but will need a significant increase in funding and administrative support. The
intention to subscribe to the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard is commendable.
33.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

In the absence of further policy adjustment, public debt levels may turn unsustainable.
Total public debt has picked up since 2007, practically reaching the Albanian legal limit of
60 percent of GDP in 20092. Taking into account the authorities’ current medium-term spending
plan, staff projects that debt ratios will continue to grow and reach 70 percent of GDP in 2015
(Table A.1). With such a debt path, financing the deficit will be increasingly hard. The average
maturity of domestic debt is still relatively low (as of the beginning of 2010 the duration of the
domestic portfolio was 0.8 years) and the share of concessional lending should decrease in the
coming years as Albania seeks financing in international capital markets.
The medium term target of a debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent is only attainable after
substantial fiscal consolidation. This target—elucidated in the government’s program—will not
be met in the baseline scenario. The following chart illustrates the need for a drastic reduction of
budget deficits in the short run if debt is to converge swiftly to this level.

Stress tests indicate important vulnerabilities (Figure A.1). Public debt dynamics are
particularly vulnerable to a sharp depreciation of the lek and to a lower than projected growth
path (half standard deviation drop). Furthermore, persistently higher primary deficits (by
0.6 percent) due, for example, to a protracted burden of the current social security system, would
bring debt up to almost 74 percent by 2015. In all instances, the prospects of meeting debt targets
would be severely undermined. Finally, following unchanged policies would push up debt above
100 percent of GDP by 2015 as privatization proceeds are now mostly exhausted.

External debt has been on the rise since 2005 but remains sustainable based on current
staff projections. Policies, however, should be mindful of vulnerabilities, particularly given
the risks associated with current account and other shocks. Under the assumptions that
(i) growth will gradually return to its potential level with stabilizing global conditions, and
(ii) borrowing will moderate with FDI inflows strengthening and current account improving,
external debt is projected to peak at 37 percent of GDP in 2012 and then decline to 30 percent of
GDP by 2015 (Table A.2). Stress tests highlight vulnerabilities to the current account, and
combined shocks including real interest, growth and current account balance shocks
(Figure A.2). Under these two shocks external debt is projected to increase to 42 and 37 percent
of GDP by 2015, respectively

VII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of Albania (BoA) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to current
arrangements. The most recent assessment was completed on July 14, 2006 and found that
some weaknesses exist in the central bank's safeguards framework. The main
vulnerabilities identified by the assessment concern the quality of the external audit,
oversight of the external and internal audit functions and the system of internal controls,

3
and certain weaknesses in the controls over the Fund data reporting process. The
assessment recommended measures to alleviate these weaknesses. The authorities have
taken steps to improve the external audit process and staff will monitor the implementation
of the remaining recommendations.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating exchange rate system. Under
the Fund’s de facto exchange rate regime classification, Albania follows a floating
exchange rate regime, with the monetary authorities occasionally intervening in the foreign
exchange market in order to avoid excessive and short term disruptions in the functioning
of the market and to accumulate reserves. Albania’s exchange rate arrangement is free
from exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction
under Article VIII. However, the country still avails itself of the transitional arrangements
under Article XIV and maintains exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit
balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania
became a Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly
nonconvertible currencies. Albania has not imposed new restrictions under Article VIII.
The exchange rate stood at lek 103.31 per U.S. dollar at end-March 2010.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
The conclusion of the 2008 Article IV consultation and the fifth review under the
PRGF/EFF-supported program took place in July 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/267).
X. FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in early 2005. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on August 1, 2005 concurrently with the staff report
for the sixth review of the PRGF-supported program and financing assurances review. An
action plan for implementing the FSAP recommendations has been prepared in
consultation with the IMF. A data module ROSC was published on the Fund’s website in
June 2000. A fiscal ROSC was completed in June 2003. Albania participates in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and a complete set of GDDS metadata for
the external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well as for the socio-demographic
indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment using the Data Quality
Assessment Framework was conducted in March 2006.
XI. Technical Assistance:
The Fund, other multilateral organizations and donors have provided extensive assistance
for institutional development in Albania. The Fund has sent several technical assistance

4
missions to Albania every year since 1991. The extent and focus of Fund TA since FY
2008 is briefly listed below.

III. ALBANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
April 6, 2010
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The main

obstacles are in real sector statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts are compiled from insufficient and poor quality sources. While
technical assistance has been provided on methodological procedures, source data still do not provide
sufficient information to compile reliable estimates on the unobserved economy. In November 2005, the
Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) released major revisions of the national accounts estimates for
1996–2003 and updates for 2004, reflecting methodological improvements.

INSTAT has benefited from technical assistance from the Fund and the European Union, mainly to
address weaknesses in methodology, basic data sources, and coverage of the private sector. STA
provided technical assistance through peripatetic missions in 2008 and 2009. The Labor Force Survey
was incorporated into the estimates of the unobserved economy in the annual national accounts while
attempts were made to use the Household Budget Survey to develop a new benchmark estimate of
private consumption. A new methodology for gross fixed capital formation based on a commodity flow
approach was developed. Quarterly national accounts were compiled during the project and are now
being published. Due to severe resource constraints at INSTAT, the improvement in the national
accounts has been relatively slow.
Price statistics: Compilation generally follows international standards, and the estimation of imputed rent

within the CPI was improved in 2003. In December 2007, INSTAT has updated the CPI weights using
the results of a new national-level HBS conducted during the period October 2006-September 2007. PPI
has been published only quarterly due to financial constraints. The weights were derived from the 1998
annual Structural Business Survey.
Government finance statistics: GFS generally follow the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986.

External donor financed-projects that do not pass through the treasury system represent a weakness in
source data.

8
Monetary statistics: The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology

recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. The depository
corporations survey covers the Bank of Albania (BoA) and all the other deposit-taking institutions
(commercial banks and savings and loans associations (SLAs)). The accounts of the SLAs, with the
exception of loans, are produced on a cash basis, which contrasts with the MFSM’s recommendations of
accrual accounting. Another deviation from the MFSM’s methodology is that the BoA’s and commercial
banks’ holdings of nontradable long-term securities are recorded at book value.
External sector statistics: The Balance of payments data compiled by the BoA are methodologically

sound, although some of the estimates, particularly for international transactions outside the banking
system need to be refined. Problems remain in the areas of service transactions and remittances, and in
the monitoring of financial account transactions, foreign assistance (grants from abroad to regional and
local governments are underreported), and external debt.
A September–October 2007 mission noted strong progress in adopting earlier recommendations but
advised that estimation methods for transactions outside the banking system (mostly remittances and
investment transactions by nonresident Albanians) require further improvement.
The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external government debt (including
commitments of state-owned enterprises). However, there have been some irregularities in the recording
and presentation of external arrears. The collection of data on external grants is not timely, with lags of
several months frequently encountered.
B. Data Standards and Quality

Dissemination System (GDDS).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 12, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Albania
On May 24, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Albania.1
Background
Despite Albania’s limited integration into global markets, the global financial crisis was
transmitted through several channels. As elsewhere in the region, Albanian banks witnessed
substantial deposit withdrawals in the fall of 2008. The recession in trading partners—
particularly Greece and Italy—led to falling exports. Finally, remittances and nonclassified
inflows, while imprecisely measured, are estimated to have fallen drastically.
The authorities were able to use accumulated policy space to soften the immediate blow from
the crisis, and Albania has performed better than other regional and European economies. In
particular, (i) ample liquidity buffers were utilized to meet deposit withdrawals; (ii) monetary
conditions were loosened, initially by quantitative easing via BoA direct liquidity injections,
followed by interest rate cuts; and (iii) considerable fiscal stimulus was also provided. Growth
continued at an estimated 2.8 percent in 2009 and inflation has mostly been in line with the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

target of 3±1 percent, though depreciation pass through and higher electricity prices recently
lifted inflation above 4 percent.
However, policy buffers are now exhausted and need rebuilding. Especially given the
significant risks emanating from the challenging external environment and sizeable domestic
vulnerabilities, quick progress is essential to redress internal and external imbalances. With
private sector adjustment already under way, the budget must achieve a significant turnaround
to bring down the current account deficit and make space for credit extension to the private
sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They observed that Albania’s
previously accumulated fiscal and monetary policy space provided buffers that have helped
soften the impact of the global crisis. Directors noted that the authorities’ decisive actions had
supported the economy and prevented a surge in financial risks. However, policy buffers now
have been depleted and must be rebuilt to safeguard macroeconomic stability, given
significant downside risks from the external environment and domestic vulnerabilities.
Directors generally called for timely and decisive fiscal tightening in 2010 to reduce financing
risks and crowding out of private investment, and help contain external imbalances. They
recommended both one-off and structural revenue and expenditure measures, and advised
saving the remaining contingency reserves in the 2010 budget. They also encouraged the
authorities to pursue civil service reform, keep wages and pensions in check, and strengthen
public investment execution.
Directors emphasized the importance of lowering public debt to sustainable levels in the
medium term and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to cut public debt levels significantly.
In support of this goal, they saw merit in a sound medium-term fiscal policy framework
governed by a credible and monitorable fiscal rule. Directors endorsed the authorities’ efforts
to diversify financing sources, while recommending that the authorities keep all options on the
table, especially in light of current heightened uncertainty in international markets.
Directors commended the authorities’ early and successful adoption of macroprudential
measures. They stressed the need for continued vigilant supervision in face of worsening
domestic credit quality and rising external risks, in particular potential spillover risks related to
recent developments in Greece. Directors also recommended the development of contingency
plans to deal with tail risks, as well as the supervisory and macroprudential toolkit to address
emerging challenges.

3
Directors considered that the monetary policy framework and the flexible exchange rate have
served Albania well by keeping inflation in check and helping the economy weather external
shocks. They encouraged the authorities to continue the cautious monetary stance and focus
on anchoring inflation expectations, while remaining mindful of financial stability considerations
and macroprudential needs.
Directors welcomed progress on structural reforms, while emphasizing the importance of
further improvements in the business environment and investor protection to improve
competitiveness and broaden sources of growth. They recommended tackling obstacles to the
effective operation of privatized industries, establishing a clear property rights system,
strengthening rule enforcement, and addressing weaknesses in economic statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Sources: Albanian authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ GDP data for 2007–08 are from the official national accounts.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Albania
May 24, 2010
1.
This paper briefly summarizes recent developments since the issuance of SM/10/100.
The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Official figures suggest a sharper than expected fall in GDP in the fourth
quarter of last year. However, the figures also indicate that GDP in earlier quarters could
have been higher than assumed. On balance, staff believe that the growth estimate in
SM/10/100 of 2.8 percent for 2009 remains valid. Nevertheless, if confirmed, the sharp
downturn in the fourth quarter could imply a more significant negative carry-over effect into
2010, so that the growth projection of 2.3 percent could be revised down.
3.
Consumer price inflation has fallen back into the 3±1 percent target range.
Inflation was 3.9 percent in March, and 3.5 percent in April 2010. The decline was mainly
owing to dropping food price inflation. These developments are broadly in line with the
profile underlying the staff forecast for average and end-period inflation in 2010.
4.
The first quarter budget deficit was somewhat higher than expected, but staff
believe that the full year projection remains valid. Revenue developments were fully in
line with staff’s projections. Meanwhile expenditure came in some 10 percent higher than
forecast, owing to significant growth in current spending—especially on social insurance
outlays and operations and maintenance—that is expected to be offset by lower capital
spending going forward.
5.
Liquidity in the banking system has continued to improve, driven by deposit
inflows. Following the IMF-EU program with Greece, Greek-owned banks (which had
earlier seen some deposit withdrawals) are now also part of the system-wide deposit growth.
6.
In recent discussions with staff, the authorities have indicated their intention to
effect a mid-year budget tightening. They intend to use the budget review exercise to keep
public debt within the 60 percent of GDP legal ceiling. The authorities also reported their
intention to make progress in introducing a fiscal rule that would be operationalized through
deficit ceilings.

Statement by Mr. Sadun and Mr. Spadafora on Albania
May 24, 2010
On behalf of the Albanian authorities, we thank staff for the well-written and informative
reports, and for the continued close and constructive cooperation with the authorities.
Overview
The global crisis impacted the Albanian economy through lower exports and remittances,
reduced capital inflows, heightened risks in the financial sector, and a moderation of
domestic demand due to higher precautionary saving.
However, Albania has weathered the global crisis better than most other regional and
European economies. Building on a flexible monetary policy framework, low external debt, a
sound banking system, and substantial foreign exchange reserve buffers, the authorities were
able to use the policy space accumulated during years of strong growth (over 6 percent on
average during 2005–08) to mitigate the consequences of a deteriorating external
environment. Monetary conditions were repeatedly eased and a considerable fiscal stimulus
was provided by acting on both the revenues and expenditure side.
The depreciation of the lek (by a cumulative 14 percent) helped mitigate the fall in exports
triggered by the recession in the country’s main trading partners; export performance has
improved significantly since the beginning of 2010. Current account deficits are mainly a
reflection of an ambitious public investment program and transition-driven productivity
gains. About half of these deficits have been financed by net inflows of foreign direct
investments. External debt is low and reserves coverage remains high.
Against this background, growth continued at 3.3 percent in 2009, as recently estimated by
the Albanian Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), and a V-shaped recovery now constitutes the
baseline scenario. The authorities expect activity to bounce back more quickly than staff’s
projections, on account of gains from the large investments and structural reforms undertaken
in the past. Their policies for 2010 aim at preserving macroeconomic stability, consolidating
public finances and advancing structural reforms.
Fiscal Policy
On account of the crisis-induced deterioration in the fiscal position, the authorities concur
with staff that fiscal consolidation represents the key near- and medium-term policy
challenge, given the need to address a sizable public debt and large financing and rollover
requirements. To this end, in the Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework 2011–2013
approved by the Council of Ministers on January 2010, the government has targeted a

2
reduction in the overall deficit from 7.4 percent of GDP in 20091 to 3 percent over the
medium term.
In particular, this will be achieved by targeting an overall deficit not exceeding 4 percent of
GDP in 2010, and of 3 percent during 2011-2013. In line with staff’s view, public investment
has been scaled back from 8.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 5.2 percent. Given the more
challenging environment, the 2010 budget has been strengthen through one-off expenditure
cuts of about 30 billion lek (2.5 percent of GDP). Moreover, in order to preserve the deficit
and debt targets, the budget allows for contingency funds should revenues fall below
projections.
The forthcoming mid-term budget review in the summer will provide an opportunity to
verify that the current fiscal stance is in line with the fiscal objectives, and to ascertain the
need for corrective measures.
To support fiscal consolidation, the authorities intend to adopt a fiscal rule, and currently
favor a deficit rule over an expenditure one. The former places greater emphasis on
protecting recent gains in tax administration and the overall fiscal balance, and is considered
more effective in achieving fiscal consolidation. The authorities are also aware of the need to
continue structural fiscal reforms in order to improve capital expenditure execution and tax
administration.
The authorities are seeking to place a Eurobond to lessen the reliance on short-term domestic
financing, although current conditions in international markets may have an impact on the
timing, size and pricing of the issuance.
While the authorities greatly appreciate the dialogue with the Fund, they considered that
current economic perspectives do not call for a Fund-supported program.
Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector
The prevailing monetary policy framework, an inflation target range combined with a
flexible exchange rate, is serving the country well; it has increased the resilience of the
economy while keeping inflation expectations well anchored. The exchange rate worked as a
shock absorber, both by limiting the impact of the energy and food price shocks of 2007-08,
and subsequently by easing the adjustment to the global crisis.
The financial system entered the crisis well capitalized, relying on a funding model based on
domestic deposits; it is relatively solvent, liquid, and profitable. To a large extent, this is due
to the Bank of Albania’s (BoA) strong supervision, which has enabled banks to build large
liquidity and capital buffers. The BoA also proactively adopted macroprudential measures
that, inter alia, slowed credit growth and limited the balance sheet effects of unhedged
foreign currency lending.

On a cash basis, the deficit was 6.9 percent, of which 2.4 percent was financed through privatization receipts.

As elsewhere in the region, Albanian banks witnessed substantial panic deposit withdrawals
in the face of spillovers from instability of global financial markets, which were compounded
by concerns about the health of the Greek banking system in the fall of 2008. Ample liquidity
buffers were utilized to meet deposit withdrawals. To boost confidence, deposit insurance
limits were raised fivefold, and deposits started to recover from the second half of 2009.
Stress tests assessing key risks suggest that the banking system has sufficient buffers to
weather the expected downturn. Moreover, Albanian firms and households are only
moderately leveraged compared to South Eastern European peers.
These strengths notwithstanding, the authorities remain vigilant. While foreign banks
continued to extend credit during the crisis, the financial health of some parent banks is under
close scrutiny. Given the preponderance of foreign-owned banks, the BoA has long stepped
up cross-border coordination efforts with regional supervisors and parent-bank supervisors.
Structural Reforms
Albania’s light regulation already provides the economy with flexibility, especially in labor
markets, and wage levels are among the lowest in the region. Improving the business
environment is paramount to exploiting in full the benefits associated with the prospective
EU integration. Greater investment is needed to raise productivity and ultimately strengthen
competitiveness and broaden the country’s sources of growth. The authorities are planning a
number of industrial zones to attract additional investment, including from abroad. They
continue to work with the World Bank to develop the insurance and pension sectors, which
have potential to provide longer-term funds for investment.
