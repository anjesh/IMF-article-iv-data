STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 12, 2011

KEY ISSUES:
Outlook: The nascent recovery gathered pace in 2010, but it remains fragile. If recent
policy setbacks were not corrected, growth would decelerate to 5.5 percent in 2011, from
9 percent in 2010; vulnerabilities most likely would intensify, despite a favorable external
environment. Key risks include possible political instability and declines in commodity
prices. The medium-term outlook is clouded by political uncertainties and unclear
prospects for addressing structural bottlenecks. Short- and medium-term growth and
poverty reduction prospects could be significantly improved through implementation of
stronger policies. The authorities are building political consensus for implementing
corrective policies.
Rebuilding fiscal buffers and improving expenditure quality: Despite historically
high commodity prices and large nonconcessional borrowing (4 percent of GDP), a
substantial financing gap is likely to emerge in 2011 because of wage overruns and the
large stock of domestic payment arrears accumulated by the end of 2010. This gap needs
to be eliminated through expenditure measures, while safeguarding spending on pressing
social needs and infrastructure. Over the medium term, it would be prudent to rebuild
fiscal buffers and increase international reserves while commodity prices are high.
Containing financial sector vulnerabilities: The multicurrency system has served
Zimbabwe well. For its medium-term viability, it would be essential to make steadfast
progress in restructuring the financially distressed Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to
which banks are exposed, strengthen and enforce prudential measures aimed at reducing
vulnerabilities in the financial system, and pursue countercyclical fiscal policy.
Implementing key structural reforms: Rising labor costs, the recent announcement of
fast-track indigenization of mining, and structural bottlenecks, including rigid labor
market legislation, lack of security of land tenure, and poor governance in the diamond
sector, continue to impede higher growth. Addressing these structural issues would boost
long-term growth potential.
Resolving external payment arrears: Absent debt relief, Zimbabwe is projected to
remain in debt distress over the long term. A significant strengthening in policies and debt
relief within a comprehensive arrears clearance framework supported by donors are
essential

Staff Recommendations

A significant strengthening of policies

and debt relief are essential for achieving
external sustainability. Debt relief would require
a comprehensive arrears clearance framework
supported by donors. The authorities need to make
further progress in reconciling their debt data with
individual creditors. Adhering to a regular schedule
of payments to the Poverty Reduction and Growth

country’s payment capacity increases will have a
strong positive signaling effect. In the future, it
would be important for the government to seek to
renegotiate terms of the contracted

loan to

increase its concessionality and refrain from
incurring or guaranteeing new nonconcessional
loans to prevent further exacerbation of debt

37.

In light of recent policy setbacks,

moving toward an SMP would require
bringing policies back on track. Before an SMP
stocktaking exercise could begin, the authorities will
need to meet the SMP marker on ghost workers
and make progress on key policy challenges, in
particular by adopting measures to eliminate the
projected fiscal financing gap for 2011 and
strengthen liquidity requirements for banks. The

with this strategy, a newly established debt office
has initiated a debt reconciliation process with
individual creditors which they expect to complete
later in 2011. The authorities intend to build
internal consensus for meeting the SMP marker on
eliminating ghost workers and addressing policy
setbacks. They also agreed to make timely quarterly
payments to the PRGT and increase them over time,
as payment capacity improves.

Appendix I. Zimbabwe: Reserve Adequacy

In Zimbabwe, the reserve coverage of imports was about half month and that of
government expenditures about one month at end-2010. Absent stronger policies and
debt relief, it is unrealistic to expect that Zimbabwe can reach the optimal level of
reserves for fragile states (six to nine months of import cover) in sub-Saharan Africa or a
more traditional benchmark of three months of import coverage over the medium
term. However, the government should seek to increase reserves to at least two
months of government expenditures to ensure the continuity of government operations

The plan to restructure the RBZ’s

solvency and liquidity risks in the banking
system. The restitution of banks’ statutory reserves
and other claims on the RBZ is a priority to reduce
the risk of bank failures. The inability to refund
statutory reserves and other illiquid bank claims
would force the banks to write down these claims
on the RBZ, leading to significant losses and

dollarized financial system with no lender of last
resort facility, no access to contingent foreign credit
lines, and about two-thirds of bank liabilities falling
due within 30 days. 5 As a result, the financial
system is exceedingly prone to potential external
and other shocks that could drain the system’s
liquid assets on short notice (see Risk Assessment
Matrix). Regulators in countries with dollarized
economies generally require a minimum liquidity
ratio of 25 percent or higher. Raising the liquid
asset requirement relative to short-term liabilities to
25 percent and excluding illiquid claims on the RBZ
from the definition of banks’ liquid assets would
make liquidity risk more manageable. Because
many banks are not likely to comply with the higher
liquidity requirements, transitional compliance plans
need to be agreed on. It would also be important to
require that risky banks hold additional liquidity
buffers.

The RBZ needs to enforce minimum

The RBZ’s small lending facility of US$7 million cannot



The RBZ remains in financial distress,
with slow progress in financial
restructuring. At present, it channels
fiscal transfers to cover severance
packages of retrenched staff rather
than cover operating expenses. In the
past, the foreign exchange cover of
banks’ claims has been used to fund
expenses and selective loan servicing.
 Banks are highly exposed to the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). The
frozen claims, including statutory
reserves, amount to $174 million or
about 40 percent of banks’ equity
capital at end-2010.
 The resolution of RBZ claims is likely
to take time, and banks’ auditors may
force a write-off of these claims.
Moreover, authorities may not give
preference to banks’ claims in the
resolution of RBZ liabilities.
 The RTGS account operating at the
RBZ was backed by international
reserves as of end February 2011.
However, the backing could
potentially fall short of 100 percent,
should the RBZ financial situation
worsen.

A number of small banks are
undercapitalized; some are heavily
insolvent. A failure of
undercapitalized banks could ignite a
systemic panic and a run on banks.
A number of banks, including some
systemically important banks, have
liquidity buffers below 20 percent of
short-term liabilities.
Domestic interbank claims may
become illiquid under systemic
liquidity difficulties. As of February
2011, interbank claims were $185.2
million, approximately 1/5 of
prudential liquid assets, excluding
illiquid claims on the RBZ.
Stress test results also indicate the
liquidity risk remains high.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Failure to refund statutory reserves
and resolve other frozen claims of
the banks would force the banks to
write down these claims, leading to
significant losses and
undercapitalization, particularly
among systemically important
banks.
 The deterioration in bank
capitalization could lead to loss of
confidence in the banking system,
resulting in possible bank runs and
contagion with spreading liquidity
problems.
 An inability of the RBZ to return real
time gross settlement (RTGS) funds
to banks may lead to loss of
confidence in the payments system,
discouraging its use and possibly
lead to liquidity problems in banks,
which cannot make payment on
behalf of their customers.
 The loss to the banks of RTGS funds
would also undermine their capital
position, which would tend to
compound the problem of potential
write-downs of other claims on the
RBZ.
High





Liquidity problems in one or a few
banks may lead to contagion to
other banks.
Bank runs may lead otherwise
solvent and liquid banks to
experience large losses, as they
struggle to mobilize less liquid
assets to meet liquidity needs. These
losses could quickly erode the
capital position of still weakly
capitalized banks.
Systemic failure of banks could
occur, because the banking system
has no safety-net of any sorts.

The external position is precarious.
Current account deficits are projected
at double digits over the medium
term, largely financed by volatile
capital flows.
Under the multicurrency system,
balance of payments pressure leads to
an outflow of funds (i.e., nostro
accounts and cash in vaults) from
banks.
The banking system is unlikely to be
able to borrow abroad to resolve
these liquidity issues.

Medium

Medium

Growth is largely driven by mining
and agriculture, both of which are
vulnerable to shocks. Activity in
mining also depends on the
investment climate, which has been
recently adversely affected by the
publication of new indigenization
requirements.
A slowdown in the growth of export
proceeds from mining and agriculture
could contract liquidity in the banking
system, and reduce credit growth,
negatively affecting other sectors of
the economy.
There is a sharp rise in nonperforming
loans (albeit from a low base), despite
favorable economic conditions in the
past two years. A possible sharp
slowdown could further worsen the
asset quality of banks.
While the average NPL ratio remains
low, this could reflect mostly the
immaturity of the loan portfolio, a
possible lack of experience in correctly
assessing loan quality, and potentially
hidden evergreening of mostly shortterm loans. Some individual banks
have NPL ratios well above the
system’s average.

Without a domestic currency or a
lender of last resort, a systemic
liquidity shortage may lead to bank
runs and a general loss of
confidence in the banking system,
further exacerbating the demand
for liquidity.
Faced with a systemic liquidity
shortage, banks are likely to
respond with a sharp curtailment of
credit, which would have a strong
negative impact on economic
activity.

Credit concentration risk is high.
Large firms could be strongly
affected by the economic
slowdown. Downgrading the loan
classification of large debtors could
be expected. An outright default of
their three largest exposures could
drive a significant number of banks,
including some systemically
important banks, to become
undercapitalized.
An increase in nonperforming loans
would impact profitability by
lowering interest income and
requiring loan provisioning.
Weakly capitalized banks would
have difficulty withstanding loan
losses even under a mild shock.
Failure of one or more banks could
lead to a general loss of confidence
in the banking system, with
negative effects on the fragile
macroeconomic situation.

Appendix III. Estimating Zimbabwe’s Net External Wealth

Zimbabwe’s net foreign asset position is negative even when taking into account the
economy’s net present value of mineral wealth. Sound policies, supported by debt
relief, are the only feasible options for Zimbabwe to re-establish external sustainability.

The government can only claim part of

while most of the nation’s liabilities are owed
by the public sector. We estimate that the
government’s net debt position in 2010 is a little
less than 70 percent of GDP under the unchanged
policies scenario and 63 percent of GDP under the
recommended policies scenario. This suggests that
debt relief should be part of any debt resolution
strategy for Zimbabwe.

Appendix IV. Zimbabwe: Tax Reform Measures

Income tax law
Finalize the draft of the new Zimbabwe income tax law (ZITA) in line with IMF technical assistance
advice.
VAT
The VAT system could be strengthened by:


Eliminating the temporary VAT and customs duties exemptions on the 36 basic
commodities.



Abolishing defunct customs and VAT rebates.



Requiring all government purchases to pay customs duties and VAT at customs.

Trade reform
The current tariff structure is excessively complex with more than 17 bands. Over the medium term,
it needs to be streamlined in anticipation of regional trade liberalization.


Adopt a time-bound action plan to simply tariff bands with a view to eventual
harmonization with COMESA external tariffs.



Establish higher domestic excises on: i) beer and soft drinks, ii) tobacco products, and
iii) motor vehicles while reducing the current tariff rates to 40 percent. In principle, these
measures should be revenue neutral.

Financial sector
Repeal transaction taxes on banking and securities transactions.
Subject fee-based financial transactions to VAT.
Replace the current formula for taxing long-term insurance with a revised current year transactions
formula.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Despite recent
improvements in timeliness and coverage, there are serious shortcomings in all major datasets. The
Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) needs to rebuild its capacity and acquire new
equipment. All technical assistance from the Fund was suspended on June 13, 2002, when the
Executive Board issued a declaration of noncooperation regarding Zimbabwe. On May 17, 2010, the
Executive Board lifted the suspension of technical assistance in targeted areas, including assistance
in macroeconomic statistics. ZIMSTAT has conducted some surveys in 2010 to benchmark national
accounts for 2009 and is planning to conduct a new labor force survey and an income,
consumption and expenditure survey in 2011.
National Accounts: The most recent official publication of national accounts data includes
developments in 2009 in U.S. dollars based on on a survey of industrial production, a quarterly
employment survey and a survey of non-profit institutions, all conducted in 2010. ZIMSTAT has also
published preliminary estimates of GDP in U.S. dollars using 2009 as the base year for constant
prices. National accounts are also available in Zimbabwe dollars before 2008 with 1990 as the base
year. The production of national accounts is constrained by both insufficient input data, limited by
low survey response rates, and insufficient processing and other resource capacity. Benchmark data
for industrial production have improved with the 2010 update but the last income, consumption,
and expenditure survey of any reasonable quality was made in 2001 (a survey made in 2007/08
collected data that are distorted due to hyperinflation). At the same time, despite the revision of
the base year to 2009 for GDP, value added for some sectors like agriculture is still based on 1990
weights for individual commodities.
Price statistics: ZIMSTAT published a new consumer price index (CPI) based on prices in U.S.
dollars, with December 2008 as the base, for the first time on March 24, 2009. The index uses 1990
weights for the consumer basket. There are concerns that the CPI does not adequately reflect the
price changes faced by households. A review of the weights, coverage, and outlet and product
selection is planned once the 2010 survey of income, consumption, and expenditure is completed in
2011.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) does not yet compile government
finance statistics in line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. They compile budget
data for the budgetary central government. Reporting of government finance statistics for the
central government has improved significantly over the past two years. The MoF collects data on
revenue and expenditure, which are published on its website on a bi-annual basis, along with
budget statements. There is limited data on government financing. The MoF is in the process of
reconciling its data on external debt, in particular interest payments on principal and arrears, with
external creditors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ZIMBABWE

Monetary statistics: The RBZ produces monthly monetary and financial statistics. The quality of the
data deteriorated substantially up to 2009 because of previous hyperinflation and the transition to
accounting in U.S. dollars, weak accounting practices, and quasi-fiscal activities. The auditors
provided an adverse opinion of the 2008 RBZ financial statement based on two observations: the
hyperinflationary environment in 2008 and failures within the RBZ’s financial reporting systems that
is, RBZ’s inability to account for foreign currency purchases and internal control deficiencies. MCM
and STA technical assistance in 2009 and 2010 and the Article IV missions in 2009 and 2010 made
recommendations on central bank accounting and reporting. Timeliness and coverage of data
reporting improved in 2010, partly as a result of the technical assistance provided. The RBZ has not
published comprehensive monetary statistics since April 2008.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and external debt statistics are subject to a number
of data issues. There is a structural break in trade data in 2010. The source of trade data is the
Exchange Control Department of the RBZ for years prior to 2010, and in 2010 onwards, it is based
on customs data. In 2010, there are very large, unidentified financing flows in the BOP which are
financing imports, but cannot be explained. Labor income and workers’ remittances do not include
estimates of cash and in-kind transfers from Zimbabweans working abroad. Interest payments are
not reconciled with creditors’ records and do not contain accrued interest on overdue financial
obligations. Data on outstanding debt stocks and principal payments are inconsistent with data
received by staff directly from Paris Club and major multilateral creditors. Current and capital
transfers to nongovernmental organizations and to the government are not fully reconciled with
donors’ data. The financial account is incomplete, as it does not record substantial transactions in
assets that are reported by central banks that are members of the Bank for International
Settlements. The RBZ’s initial submission of flows and stocks of gross international reserves and its
net foreign assets position often require substantial adjustments. Exceptional financing does not
fully capture the flow of overdue financial obligations. External sector data are reported to the staff
irregularly with significant delays.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
No data ROSC is available.
System since November 1, 2002.
III. Reporting to STA
Zimbabwe does not report balance of payments statistics to STA for redissemination in the
International Financial Statistics or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. No monetary or
fiscal data are currently reported to STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics, and
annual fiscal data are also not reported for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
National accounts data have not been reported since 2005 and no data are being reported for the
new CPI.

ANALYSIS

Approved By

Prepared by

Mark Plant and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
Marcelo Giugale and Jeffery Lewis (IDA)

The International Monetary Fund
The International Development Association

Based on the external LIC DSA, Zimbabwe is in debt distress. The public DSA suggests that
Zimbabwe’s overall public debt is unsustainable in light of the fiscal policy implementation
and the current size and evolution of the debt stock. The authorities broadly agreed with
these conclusions. Under a country-specific alternative upside scenario, debt burden
indicators would decline faster but the country’s external debt ratios would still remain
above indicative thresholds.

This exercise was guided by the Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/10/16).

percent of GDP over the long term, slightly below

to decline, as Zimbabwe simplifies its tariff

expected to remain broadly unchanged relative to
GDP. On the expenditure side, the baseline

amounting to US$566 million for agricultural equipment,
medical equipment and supplies, and rehabilitation of
water and sewage treatment plants. The terms of these
loans are: i) interest rate of 6 months LIBOR plus 3
percent; ii) down payment of 10 percent; iii)
management fee of 0.375 percent; and iv) commitment
fee of 0.375 percent.

fiscal space for nonwage expenditures, and the
continuation of large financial support for
parastatals. Although the employment costs to
GDP ratio is projected to decline slightly, it would
continue to claim a high ratio of total revenues.
Therefore, both nonwage current expenditure and
public investment would remain constrained over
the medium to long term.

Key Macroeconomic Assumptions: Baseline Scenario

Real GDP is projected to grow by about 4.7
percent in the medium term and 3 percent in the
long term. Growth is projected to decelerate
mainly due to a sharp slowdown in mining, which
would be caused by the recently announced fasttrack indigenization. Slow progress in addressing
structural bottlenecks, including relatively high
public
wage
costs,
poorly
maintained
infrastructure, and a poor business climate, is
expected to pose constraints to higher growth in
other sectors. Inflation would remain contained at
an average of about 5 percent in the medium to
long term.



FDI, portfolio investment, and private sector
borrowing will remain limited in the medium and
long term.



Import growth would gradually decline over the
long term constrained by a slackening in export
growth and limited private capital inflows and lack
of access to non-humanitarian assistance.



On the fiscal sector, a financing gap of about 4.4
percent of GDP is projected in 2011 due to a likely
revenue shortfall and higher-than-budgeted
expenditure, to be covered mostly by further
accumulation of expenditure arrears and cuts in
capital expenditure.

Donor support is assumed to be confined to
humanitarian assistance. It is also assumed that
the end-2010 arrears will remain unresolved and
new projected debt service payments on PPG
external debt will fall into arrears over the entire
projection period.1/ No debt relief is expected
under the baseline scenario.

Zimbabwe is considered as a country with weak
institutions for the purpose of this LIC DSA with a CPIA

(PV) of PPG external debt are as follows: 200 percent of

For debt service indicators, the ratios are 15 percent of

Nevertheless, these ratios would remain elevated,
well above sustainable levels. Debt service, including
arrears, would remain unaffordable due to the large
size of arrears. Results of the most extreme stress
test show that the present value of the public debtto-GDP ratio more than doubles by 2030 (Table 3).8

expenditures, ensures that the implementation of
the indigenization legislation takes into account

could potentially boost growth performance by
about 3 percentage points relative to the baseline
scenario over the medium term. This would allow
debt indicators to decline faster (Tables 5-8 and
Figures 3 and 4). Higher growth would be
supported by a positive response of private
investment in mining and industry to a better
business climate. In addition, a lower wage bill

The most extreme stress test assumes that real GDP
growth is at historical average minus one standard

CONCLUSION
10.

Zimbabwe is likely to remain in debt

distress for the foreseeable future. Achieving
debt sustainability will require a further considerable
strengthening of economic policies and debt relief,
which would necessitate normalization of relations
with the international community. The realization of
contingent liabilities, including related to the RBZ
restructuring, financial sector vulnerabilities, and
SOEs, could make the debt situation even worse.

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability. Data on external debt was estimated based on information from the authorities, Paris Club, WB, and EIB.
External private debt, and public and publicly guaranteed debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Residuals are accounted for by the following factors: (i) portfolio and equity investment, (ii) capital transfers, and (iii) errors and omissions. Exceptional financing consists primarily of the accumulation of arrears.
From 2010 onwards, residuals include contributions to price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief coursed through the central government budget. Except for very small amounts, all grants to Zimbabwe from 2010 onwards are assumed to be off-budget grants.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Public and publicly guaranteed debt and residents' claims on the RBZ denominated in foreign currency. For 2007, excludes local-currency denominated debt of about 1 percent of GDP.
2/ Includes accumulation of arrears. The residuals for 2007-2008 in part reflect RBZ's quasi-fiscal activities. In 2010, the residual in part reflects use of the SDR allocation. Residuals also reflect the difference in coverage between the public debt
stock (PPG) and the flow variables (central government only). State-owned enterprise (SOE) debt is included only if guaranteed by the government.
3/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
4/ Revenues excluding grants.
5/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Memorandum item:
Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/
Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
For real GDP growth, historical period covers only from 2005 onwards due to unavailability of reliable data prior to this period.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
7/ An ellipsis ("…") indicates a negative value, as generated by the standard template. Negative values reflect the fact that debt service excludes arrears and principal on short-term debt,
as well as interest and penalties on arrears in the alternative scenarios and bound tests.

1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability. Data on external debt was estimated based on information from the authorities, Paris Club, WB, and EIB.
2/ External private debt, and public and publicly guaranteed debt.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+g ρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Residuals are accounted for by the following factors: (i) portfolio and equity investment, (ii) capital transfers, and (iii) errors and omissions. Exceptional financing consists primarily of the accumulation of arrears.
From 2010 onwards, residuals include contributions to price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief coursed through the central government budget. Except for very small amounts, all grants to Zimbabwe from 2010 onwards are assumed to be off-budget grants.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Public and publicly guaranteed debt and residents' claims on the RBZ denominated in foreign currency. For 2007, excludes local-currency denominated debt of about 1 percent of GDP.
2/ Includes accumulation of arrears. The residuals for 2007-2008 in part reflect RBZ's quasi-fiscal activities. In 2010, the residual in part reflects use of the SDR allocation. Residuals also reflect the difference in coverage between the public debt
stock (PPG) and the flow variables (central government only). State-owned enterprise (SOE) debt is included only if guaranteed by the government.
3/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
4/ Revenues excluding grants.
5/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
For real GDP growth, historical period covers only from 2005 onwards due to unavailability of reliable data prior to this period.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
7/ An ellipsis ("…") indicates a negative value, as generated by the standard template. Negative values reflect the fact that debt service excludes arrears and principal on short-term
debt, as well as interest and penalties on arrears in the alternative scenarios and bound tests.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 8, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Zimbabwe
On June 1, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe.1
Background
Stronger policies and a favorable external environment supported a nascent economic
recovery during 2009–10. Real GDP growth accelerated from 6 percent in 2009 to
9 percent in 2010, and officially reported 12-month consumer price index (CPI) in U.S.
dollar terms remained contained at 3 percent in December 2010. However, economic
growth started from a low base and was concentrated on primary commodity sectors in
mining and agriculture, both of which are sensitive to exogenous shocks. Structural
impediments weighed heavily on manufacturing and utilities, which used to be the
locomotives of growth and employment creation.
The humanitarian situation further improved in 2010. The burgeoning economic
recovery, good harvest, donor off-budget support (9 percent of GDP), and increased
provision of government services halted the deterioration of human development
indicators.
Despite a favorable external environment, the external position remained precarious in
2010. Historically high commodity prices, the resumption in official diamond trade, a
significant appreciation of the rand, and capital inflows eased somewhat balance of
payments pressures in 2010. However, the current account deficit (23 percent of GDP in
2010) was large and financed in part by short-term capital flows, and the country’s
usable international reserves amounted to 0.4 months of imports at end-2010.
Zimbabwe is in debt distress with a large and unsustainable external debt stock (118
percent of GDP at end-2010), the bulk of which is in arrears (80 percent of GDP at end2010).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

After generating a small cash fiscal surplus in 2009, the central government had a cash
deficit of about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2010. Commendable improvements in tax policy
and administration have helped generate increases in fiscal revenues from 3 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 29 percent in 2010. However, large employment costs (14.2 percent of
GDP or 48 percent of revenues in 2010), the continued financing of weakly supervised
state-owned enterprises and challenges in public financial management undermined the
quality of expenditures and competitiveness.
The financial sector has grown significantly, but its vulnerabilities have recently
increased. The multicurrency system helped jumpstart intermediation with the size of the
banking system surpassing the prehyperinflation levels. With the appointment of a
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governing board in May 2010, the RBZ has
strengthened reporting and accounting and has completed staff downsizing. However,
the RBZ has not published audited financial statements since 2008, its financial
restructuring is at an early stage, and the status of nonperforming liabilities and
severance packages remains unclear. Despite a notable strengthening of
macroeconomic performance, vulnerabilities in the banking system have recently
intensified, in part because of weak enforcement of prudential regulations.
Under the unchanged policies scenario, growth will most likely decelerate in 2011. An
inefficient composition of expenditure, rising vulnerabilities in the financial system, and
the recent announcement of the fast-track indigenization of the mining sector would be a
drag on the recovery and cause growth to decelerate to 5.5 percent. Addressing these
policy challenges in a timely manner could result in better growth outcomes for 2011.
Key downside risks include possible political instability and a fall in commodity prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continuation of Zimbabwe’s economic recovery and
the improvement in humanitarian conditions. However, the recovery remains fragile and
enormous challenges persist. Directors urged the authorities to take advantage of the
favorable external environment and continued technical assistance to strengthen their
macroeconomic framework, start rebuilding international reserves, and implement key
structural reforms.
Directors concurred that the main fiscal challenge is to create space to tackle pressing
social and infrastructure needs and to increase economic resilience to shocks. In the
short term, it is important to return to cash budgeting and implement strong expenditure
measures, including elimination of ghost workers, aimed at closing the likely financing
gap. Over the medium term, generating fiscal surpluses would help raise international
reserves and increase resilience to shocks. To meet these challenges, Directors
highlighted the need for reducing the wage bill relative to revenues, tightening the
budget constraint on state-owned enterprises, and implementing public finance
management reforms.
Directors expressed concern about rising vulnerabilities in the banking system. Priorities
are the restructuring of the financially distressed Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to
which banks are exposed, and strengthening of prudential regulations and their
enforcement to contain liquidity, solvency, and credit risks. These steps will help mitigate

3

financial sector vulnerabilities and ensure the medium-term viability of the multicurrency
system. A number of Directors cautioned against using the SDR allocation for
addressing the claims of downsized RBZ staff.
Directors underscored that improving the business climate is necessary for
strengthening competitiveness and boosting growth potential. They emphasized the
importance of aligning indigenization and empowerment objectives with respect for
property rights. To attract private investment, Directors stressed the need to maintain
the rule of law, ensure security of land tenure, improve governance, particularly in the
diamond sector, and increase the flexibility of the labor market.
Directors noted that Zimbabwe is in debt distress. They welcomed the authorities’
strategy for arrears clearance and re-engagement with the international community.
Directors urged the authorities to refrain from further nonconcessional borrowing and to
seek better terms for recently contracted debt. Achieving external sustainability will also
require a significant strengthening in policies and debt relief within a comprehensive
arrears clearance framework. In this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to make regular quarterly payments to the PRGT and increasing payments
over time as the country’s payment capacity increases.
Directors agreed that a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) would help establish a track
record of sound policies. They encouraged the authorities to continue timely data
reporting and to take concrete steps toward elimination of ghost workers which would
demonstrate their capacity and commitment to implement an SMP. In light of recent
policy challenges, clear progress on closing the fiscal financing gap for 2011 and
addressing liquidity issues in the banking system would also be important to move
toward an SMP. A few Directors considered that an early agreement on an SMP would
support the authorities’ policy efforts.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Majoro on Zimbabwe
June 1, 2011
My Zimbabwean authorities welcome the staff report and are generally agreeable with the
staff analysis. Zimbabwe has come a long way in improving its relations with the Fund and
in implementing policies in line with Fund’s advice in spite of the enormous challenges. The
most critical of these challenges is building political consensus for implementing corrective
policies which has already begun. In this sense, while acknowledging that much still needs
to be done, my authorities feel that the Fund should be more accommodative in handling the
request for a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) which would provide a good environment for
continued implementation of strong policies and the much desired structural reforms. They
will also appreciate Fund’s consideration for a debt relief within a comprehensive arrears
clearance framework supported by donors.
Economic Performance
Compared to the hyperinflation era, economic growth has resumed in Zimbabwe, particularly
during 2009-2010. Real GDP growth increased from 6 percent in 2009 to 9 percent in 2010
due largely to improved policies, a favorable external environment, and sizeable off-budget
donor grants. The growth was driven largely by mining and the agricultural sectors which are
quite vulnerable to external shocks. Nascent as it may look, it is a demonstration that with
good policies occasioned by strong political consensus, macroeconomic outcomes could
improve. The commitment of our authorities to this, particularly in addressing the structural
impediments weighing on manufacturing and utilities, is not in doubt although it may take a
little while. Inflation is still within single digits while the fiscal space has expanded due to
improvements in tax policy and administration. The financial sector is growing but highly
vulnerable while the rapid recovery in primary commodity exports has helped to dampen the
precarious external position.
Outlook
Staff analysis points to the fact that growth in 2011 would decelerate to 5.5 percent if there is
no change in policy stance. However, given the commitment of the authorities to implement
staff recommendations in a timely manner, buoyed by favorable external conditions, the
growth momentum of 2010 might be sustained in 2011. Going forward, growth could be
seriously hampered by lack of clear plans for elections to ensure political stability. In this
regard, speedy conclusion of the current negotiations for an election roadmap is receiving
due attention. We wish to reiterate our authorities’ view that lack of access to concessional
official financing constitute binding constraints to medium-term growth.
Fiscal Policy
The major challenge before my Zimbabwean authorities is creating fiscal space including
rebuilding fiscal buffers and, in particular, generating fiscal surpluses and accumulating
international reserves. This is expected to be achieved through a combination of improved
tax policy and administration as well as better expenditure quality. On the revenue side, some

2
improvements in tax policy and administration in recent years have led to large increases in
fiscal revenue, and the commitment of the authorities to further improvement is underscored
by the request for technical assistance (TA) on revenue and tax reforms for June 2011. The
authorities are also taking steps to improve expenditure quality as recommended by staff,
including through allocation of resources and improvement in public financial management
to reduce the accumulated domestic arrears. Already, a request for TA in public financial
Management (PFM) has been made to the Fund. In all, the authorities are confident that the
revenue targets for 2011 would be met in the absence of deterioration in the political
situation.
Financial Sector
The multi-currency system has served Zimbabwe well since its introduction in February,
2009, and the authorities have indicated intention to announce its extension by end-2011. The
authorities are also committed to addressing the vulnerabilities in the financial system. The
success recorded within the short period the Board of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)
has existed, the remaining challenges notwithstanding, is a good indication. Financial
restructuring of the RBZ has commenced, even though it will take a while to complete. As
indicated in the staff report, the authorities remain highly committed to building internal
consensus on the speedy resolution of financial distress at the RBZ. The RBZ and the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) are looking into other areas of financial sector restructuring raised
by staff, particularly, striking a balance between financial stability concerns and credit
growth resumption, just as the authorities have constantly indicated their readiness to remain
vigilant in monitoring vulnerable institutions.
Structural Reforms
Zimbabwe structural adjustment policies are anchored in the Three Year Macro-Economic
Policy and Budget Framework 2010 – 2012 (STERP II) which is being implemented. In
addition, the authorities are intensifying efforts to address constraints posed by rising labor
costs and structural and governance issues. Empowerment of indigenous Zimbabweans
through indigenization of business remains a key objective of government although
reasonable flexibility is expected in its implementation, particularly in the mining sector. The
authorities also regard improving governance of public enterprises and establishing
transparency in the management of diamond revenues as important steps towards revamping
the economy. To this end, a formal request for TA on anti-money laundering that will, among
others, review the current draft Diamond Revenue Bill, perform diagnostic study of all legal
instruments on precious metals, and examine the framework for SMEs in the mining sector,
has been made to the Fund. While the authorities are favorably disposed to land reform, the
commencement of land audit is being hampered by lack of funds and equipment for which
the assistance of cooperating partners is being sought. Labor market reforms, though
important, requires consensus building within government.

3
External Debt
Zimbabwe is in debt distress. As at end-2010, total external debt outstanding stood at US$8.8
billion (118 Percent of GDP) out of which US$5.95 billion or 67.4 percent are arrears. About
US$1.69 billion (19 percent of total external debt) is obligations to international financial
institutions, IFIs (World Bank, African Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
and the European Investment Bank). The outstanding debt to the Fund is estimated at
US$134 million, and all in arrears. The Zimbabwean authorities paid about US$ 4.05 million
to the Fund in 2010 with commitment to make further scaled up payments over time. My
authorities need help in this regard since, as indicated in the staff report, without debt relief
within a comprehensive arrears clearance framework supported by donors, the external
payment arrears cannot be resolved. Already, the public debt sustainability analysis (DSA),
suggests that Zimbabwe’s overall debt is unsustainable in light of the fiscal policy
implementation and the current size and evolution of the debt stock.
Meanwhile, the Government has approved the Zimbabwe Accelerated Arrears Clearance,
Debt and Development Strategy. This is a program aimed at facilitating re-engagement with
creditors on arrears clearance, new financing and comprehensive debt relief including debt
reconciliation and validation.
Staff Monitored Program (SMP)
My Zimbabwean authorities regard a SMP as very critical to their economic restructuring
and medium-term growth efforts. Of the two markers set by staff for the SMP, the authorities
have met one (timely data reporting), and are committed to meeting the second (eliminating
ghost workers). The concern raised by staff about the sustainability of reform and
stabilization policies due to recent policy setbacks is being addressed. My authorities would
appreciate favorable consideration by the Executive Board for a Staff Monitored Program.
