Discussions: Discussions for the Article IV Consultations and the third review of the threeyear Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement were held in Lilongwe
October 24–November 7, 2006. The staff met with President Bingu wa Mutharika, Minister
of Finance Goodall Gondwe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi Victor Mbewe, and
other senior government officials. The staff also met with donors, private sector
representatives, and civil society organizations. The staff team comprised Mr. McDonald
(head), Mr. Staines, Ms. Teferra (all AFR), Mr. Dalsgaard (FAD), Mr. Tolosa (PDR), and
Mr. Baunsgaard (resident representative).
PRGF arrangement: A PRGF arrangement (SDR 38.2 million, 55 percent of quota) was
approved on August 5, 2005 (Country Report No. 05/285), of which SDR 15.3 million has
been disbursed. Most quantitative end-June 2006 performance criteria were met, but the
authorities request a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion on
government domestic borrowing. Malawi is requesting the fourth disbursement under the
current PRGF arrangement (SDR 6.68 million). The authorities’ program for the second half
of 2006/07 (July–June) is outlined in the attached Supplement to the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
Key policy issues: Medium-term challenges are to enhance growth and improve economic
management capacity. The latter is also essential to deal with a possible scaling-up of aid. In
the short term, the government will need to manage expectations about how much the budget
can deliver in the wake of debt relief delivery.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Now is an opportune juncture for Malawi to advance an ambitious reform agenda to
reduce poverty. The country has made progress in achieving macroeconomic stabilization,
received debt relief, and finalized its second poverty reduction strategy paper, the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). Over the medium term, three key challenges
have to be addressed: raising growth, improving economic management capacity, and
managing a possible scaling up of external aid. Malawi would need a large increase in
external private capital and aid flows to finance its development goals.
A reform program is being developed to address these medium-term challenges,
building on initiatives already included in the PRGF-supported program. To boost
economic growth, the authorities aim to remove major impediments to private sector growth
by easing the cost of doing business, deepening financial intermediation, and improving
public service delivery. The government is strengthening its economic management capacity,
especially in public financial management, external debt management, and the compilation of
national statistics. Steps are being taken to enhance policymaking and implementation at the
Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), the Ministry of Finance, and other key institutions, so that
higher aid can be absorbed more effectively.
Recent macroeconomic performance and policy implementation continues to be
broadly satisfactory. Despite a food crisis, growth has been strong and inflation has eased.
A more flexible exchange rate policy helped the government eliminate private external
payment arrears. The authorities are committed to a flexible exchange rate and the current
real exchange rate is broadly appropriate; competitiveness in key markets shows no sign of
deterioration. Supported by the use of IMF debt relief to reduce domestic debt and additional
program support, domestic debt is projected to fall faster than programmed.
In the wake of debt relief, expectations about how much the budget can deliver will
need to be managed well so that progress on macroeconomic stabilization is not
threatened. The government met most of the indicative targets for end-September 2006, and
tax revenues have been higher than planned. However, unanticipated development spending
on nearly completed projects has jeopardized the end-December 2006 targets on government
spending and domestic borrowing.
Economic prospects are positive, though considerable risks and vulnerabilities remain.
Growth is projected to remain above historical trend and inflation to fall to single figures.
Malawi is, however, subject to recurring food crises as the economy is vulnerable to weatherrelated risks. The economy is also vulnerable to a reversal of recent oil price declines. The
prudent accumulation of external reserves will be essential to mitigate these risks. Finally,
domestic policy implementation could come under strain from delays in expected external
financing and from rising expenditure pressures, which could weaken expenditure control.
The report recommends completion of the third review under the PGRF arrangement.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance
criterion on government domestic borrowing because it reflects essential unplanned
expenditure due to the food crisis.

I. THE SETTING
1.
The Article IV Consultation comes at a critical juncture following Malawi’s
progress on macroeconomic stability, attainment of the HIPC completion point in August
2006, and recent launch of its MGDS, which outlines an ambitious agenda of structural
reform to enhance growth and reduce poverty.1 The Article IV discussions focused on the
key medium-term challenges facing Malawi, which helped to frame the program discussions
for the remainder of 2006/07.
2.
Macroeconomic performance has improved since mid-2004, after several years of
weak policy implementation resulted in anemic growth, spiraling domestic debt, accelerating
inflation, and dwindling external reserves (see text table). Low per capita growth also
reflected recurrent drought and weak governance.2 The government has since improved
policy implementation on a broad front, including areas identified by Executive Directors in
recent Article IV Consultations (Box 1).3

3.
Despite this improvement, policy implementation remains fragile, and debt relief
has raised public expectations of what the budget can deliver. Much remains to be done to
establish sustainable growth and enduring macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic
management, in particular, must be strengthened and, as noted by the Board at the second
review, governance must improve so that Malawi can attract enough donor support to meet
its medium-term objectives.

6
Box 1: Response to Recommendations from Previous Article IV Consultations
In recent Article IV consultations, Executive Directors’ recommendations centered on four themes:
Restore macroeconomic stability. The government made considerable progress in this respect by endJune 2006, reducing nonfood inflation to 13 percent and domestic debt to below 20 percent of GDP.
Strengthen public financial management (PFM). Steps to improve PFM include implementing the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and a centralized payments system in late
2005.
Improve food security. Directors stressed the need to strengthen the agricultural sector. Less progress
has been made in this area, but the government has made the sector the focal point of the MGDS. It is
restructuring the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) and has finalized the
Land Reform Bill. However, government interventions in grain and fertilizer markets have continued to
impede private sector development in this area. Moreover, a recent FAD assessment questioned whether
the fertilizer scheme is adequately targeted. To reduce Malawi’s vulnerability to drought, the government
is working with donors to improve irrigation, expand storage facilities, introduce weather insurance, and
advance agricultural marketing. However, no comprehensive risk management strategy is yet in place.
Moreover, the impact of natural disasters is amplified by policy, such as the ban on grain exports that
constrain regional integration of grain markets.
Restructure public sector enterprises. This is another area where the authorities need to strengthen their
efforts. To improve the quality of service, the government privatized the telecommunications utility and
reorganized the water boards and is rehabilitating existing hydro-power plants. It will soon bring the
Malawi Energy Regulatory Act—which establishes a new regulatory authority—into effect.

4.
The government faces political challenges that risk diverting attention away
from economic reform. It has a minority position in parliament. The opposition recently
invoked constitutional restrictions on members of parliament who have crossed party lines to
support the government. Despite the impasse, the government has so far managed to
minimize the impact on economic management.
II. RECENT MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
5.
Macroeconomic performance in 2005/06 was broadly satisfactory. Real GDP
growth was 5.3 percent; nonfood inflation declined to 13 percent. Overall inflation, which
was above 15 percent, exceeded expectations, mainly because urban food prices were slow to
reflect the bumper harvest in early 2006, and were more susceptible to the exchange rate
depreciation that occurred in the second half of the fiscal year.
6.
Overall fiscal performance in 2005/06 was satisfactory. Because of unanticipated
food security spending and accelerated repayments of domestic arrears, the performance
criterion on government domestic borrowing and the indicative target on discretionary
government spending were both missed. Domestic borrowing was 0.3 percent of GDP, 0.9
percent higher than programmed, but domestic debt still fell below 20 percent of GDP. The

7
underlying surplus (1 percent of GDP) was lower than expected, but the overall deficit
(1 percent of GDP) was better than expected, mainly because of shortfalls in loan-financed
project spending.
7.
Exchange rate management improved in the second half of 2005/06. The RBM
pegged the exchange rate through the second half of 2005, resulting in a shortage of external
reserves and unpaid private external arrears, but instituted a more flexible exchange rate
policy in January 2006. The resulting depreciation helped clear the private external arrears by
the end of July (structural benchmark for end-June). Clearance was held up by a delay in
program support (to the end of June) and by weak foreign exchange inflows following
disruptions to the tobacco auctions in May because of price disagreements. By end-June,
tobacco export receipts for the 2006 marketing season were US$30 million less than in 2005.
Nevertheless, external official reserves reached 1.6 months of imports, comfortably above
target.
8.
Following the February reduction in the LRR, the authorities tightened reserve
money growth to reduce excess liquidity and contain inflationary risks. The mop-up,
however, was incomplete, and the fiscal year ended with a modest monetary overhang—
though broad money stayed on target. As intended, lowering the LRR eased financial
intermediation costs, raising deposit rates and reducing interest rate spreads. Given the lack
of creditworthy projects, the lower LRR also depressed treasury bill yields, which, despite
the mop-up, have remained about 5 percentage points, lower than at the start of 2006.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The Article IV discussions centered on three key medium-term challenges, that
Malawi needs to address in order to improve its economic performance. These include
policies to enhance growth, build institutional capacity, and manage a potential scaling-up of
external financing. These issues helped frame conversations about policies for the rest of
fiscal year 2006/07. There was broad agreement on the challenges ahead and ways to address
them, but some divergence of views on emphasis. There was agreement that, to take
advantage of Malawi’s opportune circumstances, it would be essential to advance an
ambitious structural reform agenda and retain a focus on macroeconomic stabilization. The
agenda would need to address administrative capacity constraints to ensure that measures are
effectively designed and implemented.
A. Enhancing Growth
10.
The government has made enhancing growth, primarily through more private
sector activity and higher exports, its priority in the MGDS (see text figures). The
government’s commitment to sound macroeconomic management has already lowered
inflation and interest rates, paving the way for private sector growth. The MGDS also aims to
promote sectoral growth by improving support services and infrastructure, focusing on

8
agriculture in the medium term (see Box 1), and on developing capacity in other sectors
(such as mining and tourism) in the longer term.4

Following extensive consultations with
the private sector and donors, the government
has identified major impediments to business
activity and aims to finalize a Private Sector
Development Program in early 2007. The
discussions focused on:
•

Competitiveness and the costs of doing
business. Malawi ranked 110 worldwide
and 13 in sub-Saharan Africa in the World
Bank’s 2006 report on the ease of doing
business (see text table). The costs of
dealing with public institutions are
especially onerous, reflecting burdensome
licensing, tax, external trade document, and
procedural requirements. In other areas,
weak property rights (especially for land)
make it difficult to enforce contracts.
Malawi also ranks poorly on the flexibility
of its factor markets. Skilled labor is scarce,
and the costs of dismissing workers are
prohibitive. Similarly, the costs of starting
and closing a business are high.

The government is negotiating a mining concession. The Kayelekera uranium mine is expected to last 11
years, generating about 1,000 tons of uranium and US$90 million in export receipts annually.

9
•

Access to credit (see text table and figures, and Box 2). Financial intermediation is
shallow largely because Malawi’s dominant informal and subsistence sectors keep
income and savings low.5 Entrenched land tenure traditions complicate both property
rights and the use of land as collateral. Weak enforcement of creditor rights and the
absence of information on borrowers make lending risky. The authorities and staff
agreed that further fiscal consolidation is fundamental to crowding in private sector
credit expansion. The authorities emphasized the need to lower Malawi’s high real
lending rates. In this regard, staff supported further reducing the LRR, when such a
move can be accommodated within the monetary framework. Both agreed that
structural measures to lower intermediation costs should focus on strengthening the
regulatory and legislative framework, increasing competition in the banking sector,
and lowering lending risk. To this end, the government has tentatively identified the
key elements of a comprehensive strategy, which could be finalized following the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), expected in mid-2007.

Box 2: Financial Sector Development
Malawi’s financial system lacks depth. Commercial bank
assets in 2005 were only 12 percent of GDP, well below the
average for sub-Saharan Africa, and highly concentrated.
Malawi’s monetization, measured by broad money relative to
GDP, is comparable with the regional average. However,
deposits as a percentage of GDP and bank credit to the private
sector—both measures of financial depth—are low, even by
the already weak regional standards. Large domestic
government borrowing has crowded out lending to the private
sector. Financial intermediation is further discouraged by
negative real deposit interest rates and lending rates that in real
terms were among the highest in the region.

Public enterprise reform (see Boxes 1 and 3). Weak management and government
interference have undercut the efficiency of Malawi’s public utilities. To improve the
quality of service, the government is exploring private sector participation and
strengthening monitoring and corporate governance. Staff urged the government to
clarify the boundaries between utilities’ commercial and government-mandated social
functions and to ensure that the latter are adequately and transparently financed by the
budget.
Box 3: Water and Electricity Utilities

Malawi’s utilities are owned and controlled by the government. They operate on a commercial basis,
but have government-mandated social obligations—rural electrification and ensuring water supplies.
The government funds these social objectives from the budget while paying the utilities a management
fee. The government controls major financial decisions, including borrowing and investment decisions
and also tariffs. Transparency in the financial relations between the government and the utilities from
2000/01 to 2004/05 was poor.
Over this period, tariffs do not appear to have been set on a commercially viable basis to cover needed
capital expenditures as well as operating costs and therefore imposed costs on the utilities that were not
adequately funded by the budget. In addition, collection rates (especially from government) were low
(receivables averaged 6 months over this period). As a result, the utilities accumulated annual losses,
averaging 1.5 percent of GDP, that were largely financed by government lending. Lending was not
fully reflected in the fiscal accounts. By the end of 2004/05, utilities’ debt obligations to the
government reached 5 percent of GDP, posing a potential liability to the budget.

12.
The MGDS emphasizes export growth. This would require the authorities to
maintain a flexible exchange rate, rationalize Malawi’s external trade arrangements, and
diversify the export base.
•

Restrictive exchange rate management has hampered business activity. In recent
reviews, staff concluded that the authorities maintained an exchange restriction (as
evidenced by private external payment arrears) and a multiple currency practice
(MCP) under Article VIII. As the authorities have ceased the informal rationing of
foreign exchange and there is no longer a backlog of arrears on import payments, the
exchange restriction evidenced by these arrears has been eliminated. Staff is
determining whether the official action that gave rise to the MCP has ceased (e.g., the
authorities’ practice of determining an exchange rate, and the use of moral suasion to
use the RBM-determined exchange rate), but notes that the exchange rate spread has
also narrowed significantly—from 12 percent in March 2006 to below 5 percent in

11
January 2007.6 Staff will continue to monitor the situation to ascertain the extent to
which this spread may be attributable to market forces.
•

Following Fund guidelines on de facto classification, Malawi’s exchange system
is characterized as a managed float. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to
a flexible exchange rate and stressed the importance of a competitive real exchange
rate to support their growth strategy. They see the current real exchange rate as
broadly appropriate, but recognize that debt relief could put upward pressure on the
rate. Staff agreed that there are no clear signs of misalignment: the real exchange rate
has remained flat in the last year in the absence of major shocks to the terms of trade,
aid flows or government spending; it is considerably lower than its average in recent
history; and competitiveness in key markets shows no signs of deterioration (see text
figures). A key medium-term objective is to increase external reserve coverage above
3 months of imports to reduce Malawi’s vulnerability to terms-of-trade shocks,
shortfalls in donor disbursements, and recurring crop failure. Accordingly, staff
advised the RBM to use any real appreciation to accumulate external reserves,
monetary conditions permitting.

The trade system remains relatively free of restrictions. The average tariff is 14
percent, with three non-zero tariffs and a maximum of 25 percent. However, the
coverage of excise duty has been extended and there are still numerous quantitative
restrictions. Imports of cement, salt, and flour require licenses, and maize exports are
effectively banned. The authorities are considering ways to rationalize Malawi's
overlapping involvement in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and
the Southern African Development Community, which both plan to become customs
unions by 2010.

The spread is measured as the difference in average of the buy and sell exchange rates offered by commercial
banks and foreign exchange rate bureaus. Over the same period, the spread on buy rates alone fell from about 5
percent to below 2 percent, while the spread on sell rates alone fell from about 18 percent to about 10 percent.

Malawi needs to diversify its exports to address the large deterioration in the
terms of trade over the past decade. Higher international oil prices and declining
prices for key export commodities, especially tobacco, have hurt the economy’s
competitiveness. Also, the erosion of Malawi’s sugar preferences to the EU, which
came into effect in mid-2006, will hurt export earnings.
B. Building Institutional Capacity

13.
Malawi’s improved macroeconomic performance reflects the government’s firm
commitment to pursue strong measures. Deepening this performance will require
strengthening the government’s economic management capacity and overall economic
governance. The discussions covered ways to improve the government’s capacity to identify
and assess policy challenges; to formulate, implement, and manage economic decisionmaking; and to monitor and evaluate performance. Discussions focused on improving public
financial management (PFM), building debt and aid management capacity, and strengthening
statistical capacity (Box 1).
•

To improve PFM, the government recently prepared a comprehensive three-year
action plan in collaboration with donors that includes measures to improve budget
preparation, planning, and execution. The plan also calls for improved fiscal
monitoring and reporting, both internally and externally (including to parliament);
enhanced audit capacity; stronger local governments; and more effective
policymaking tools and covers measures for planning, mobilizing, and allocating
resources to Malawi’s development strategies.

•

As noted in the HIPC completion point document, weak external debt
management has contributed to Malawi’s high debt burden.7 The authorities
agreed on the need for a comprehensive strategy that would encompass guidelines on
acceptable loan terms to encourage borrowing only on concessional terms and
feasibility studies for new project loans. The strategy would cover public sector
enterprises and build capacity to develop debt sustainability analyses. Given
Malawi’s high domestic debt burden, staff also encouraged the authorities to
strengthen their capacity to manage domestic debt.

•

Coordination with donors has been strengthened by the Common Approach to
Budget Support framework and the strengthening of the Debt and Aid Unit within the

7

“Malawi—Debt Relief at the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative Completion Point and Under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative,” August 2006, Country Report No. 06/420. The debt sustainability analysis
concluded that, following debt relief, Malawi’s external debt burden indicators would fall to levels significantly
lower than the average for low-income countries and were projected to remain well below the HIPC
sustainability threshold. This projection assumed that government maintains prudent fiscal policies, implements
measures to insulate the economy from the debilitating impact of periodic droughts and keeps new borrowing to
modest levels and on concessional terms.

13
Ministry of Finance. Staff urged stronger coordination among the government
departments that manage and implement the development budget.
C. Scaling Up External Financing
14.
Malawi requires a significant scaling up of external financing flows—official aid
and private capital—to meet its medium-term objectives and to finance the higher private and
public expenditures needed for the MGDS.
15.
Reaching the HIPC completion point and accessing relief under the MDRI will
likely have only a modest impact on official aid flows. Net official aid to Malawi has
already increased significantly since 2000 and, on the basis of current commitments, is
projected to average 24 percent of GDP over the next four fiscal years, about the same as in
2005 (see text table). Aid is also subject to considerable uncertainty. Absent scaling-up, aid
flows are unlikely to be adequate to support the proposed range of activities under the MGDS
(see text table).

1/ The government and donors have prepared cost estimates stated in
2005/06 prices. These have been converted to current prices and stated
as a share of GDP using medium-term projections under the PRGFsupported program.

Several key donors are preparing medium-term plans. The World Bank expects to
approve a new four-year Country Assistance Strategy in early 2007, which could
provide US$340 million, substantially more than previously anticipated.8 The EU is
preparing its next six-year European Development Fund plan, starting in 2007/08,
which will tentatively provide €350 million, as previously envisaged, with scope for
additional aid, depending on performance. Beyond the near term, Malawi could also
receive Millennium Challenge Corporation funds from the United States, though
these are still too uncertain to incorporate into the framework.

IDA allocations under the new Country Assistance Strategy were expected to be reduced to offset relief
under the MDRI. However, because of the topping-up of HIPC assistance (which was not incorporated
into the program), IDA’s contribution to MDRI-related relief is smaller, reducing the offsetting cut in IDA
allocations.

14
•

The discussions focused on managing higher aid flows to promote growth while
maintaining macroeconomic stability. In particular, the authorities must balance calls
for the immediate use of resources with efforts to increase Malawi’s low external
reserve coverage. Staff also raised a concern, shared by donors, that resources on
infrastructure and social priorities be used effectively. In this regard, the government
and the World Bank are undertaking a public expenditure review. In addition, the
government could make more effective and timely use of the annual performance
reviews of the MGDS.

•

About a third of net official aid currently passes to nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs). Donors will likely continue directly funding NGOs, placing
resources where they can be used most effectively. Rerouting part of this aid through
the budget will therefore require improved administrative capacity to ensure that
resources are used efficiently.

16.
Private sector growth will also require higher private capital flows to the private
sector. Malawi’s stronger macroeconomic environment (including its lower external debt
burden) and reforms to strengthen business competitiveness could help attract more foreign
direct investment and portfolio flows. Foreign portfolio investors have already expressed
interest in investing in government domestic debt markets.
•

Staff noted that, while investor interest is welcome, Malawi could face significant
challenges in adjusting to volatile portfolio flows. Liberalization of capital market
transactions should thus proceed slowly until Malawi has a stable macroeconomic
environment, stronger financial institutions, better regulation by the RBM, established
financial instruments, and deeper financial markets to manage capital flow surges.
The authorities will postpone further consideration of liberalization until after the
FSAP.

17.
Larger capital inflows will also require Malawi to strengthen its anti–money
laundering capacities. The authorities are implementing the 2004 recommendations of the
Eastern and Southern African Anti–Money Laundering Group. An important first step was
parliament’s approval of long-outstanding anti-money laundering legislation in July 2006.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
18.
The key medium-term objective is to consolidate macroeconomic stability—
reducing domestic debt and inflation—to lay the foundation for higher growth and
poverty reduction. The framework assumes that existing good policies in Malawi are
maintained. Further, it is expected that Malawi will implement key elements of the structural
reform agenda identified in the policy discussions. Many of these will be included under the

15
current PRGF-supported program (see below). The framework is also cautiously based on
current information concerning aid commitments.

Output growth is assumed to average 5.5 percent over the near term, before
settling at 4.5 percent. While projected near-term growth is high by both historical
and regional standards, there is scope for output to recover from the prolonged period
of poor performance. Moreover, gross investment is expected to rise to 20 percent of
GDP over the medium-term from only 13 percent over the past decade. Despite the
higher growth, per capita growth will remain well below the level needed to meet the
MDGs. In addition, Malawi’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, especially weatherrelated, makes it important to build external reserves to insulate economic activity.

•

Further consolidation of domestic debt to below 10 percent of GDP is still the
key medium-term fiscal objective, as this would free resources for the private
sector. Malawi’s total public sector resource requirements, including for the MGDS,
need to be clearly articulated and expenditures prioritized according to projected
resource flows. In this regard, staff cautioned that Malawi may not have enough
absorptive capacity to accommodate the large increase in development spending,
though the authorities felt this would not be a major concern. The government also
thought that civil service salaries might continue to be misaligned, especially
compared to the private sector (Box 4).9

•

The strategy could provide significant fiscal space for priority spending over the
next four fiscal years compared with the last eight—though much of the expansion
has already occurred (text table). Additional resources will mostly stem from higher
net aid inflows, including debt relief (8.4 percent of GDP each year), and lower
domestic interest costs (1.8 percent of GDP each year, rising to 4 percent of GDP
from the rate three years ago). The bulk of these fiscal savings will be used to finance

9

Malawi’s wage policy is discussed in a Selected Issues Paper accompanying this staff report.

16
higher development spending and repay domestic debt. But with appropriate
prioritization, average pro-poor spending could be, on average, 5 percent of GDP
higher than in the past eight years.

Box 4: Malawi Civil Service Wage Policy
Weak payroll management has undermined budget implementation in recent years and
remains a major concern. To help improve payroll management, the government has compiled
a database of civil service employees, prepared a detailed schedule of wage adjustments for
2005/06, and is compiling monthly reports on payroll execution.
The government payroll has increased substantially relative to GDP since the late 1990s,
mainly reflecting rising salaries, suggesting containment of future wage growth will be
important. As a share of GDP, civil service compensation in Malawi is now in line with other
countries’ in the region. Moreover, a detailed comparison by grade with government
employees in other countries, with private sector compensation, and with income levels in
Malawi in general, also failed to reveal any major misalignment in civil service compensation.
In designing future wage adjustments, the challenge will be to contain the overall payroll at
current levels relative to GDP. However, the government will need to make difficult decisions
about priorities within this overall envelope. Future wage adjustments will also need to ensure
sufficient compensation at the lowest employee grades to cover the cost of living. The
government will have to balance the need to contain growth in the age bill while at the same
time providing adequate incentives for the civil service and strengthening economic
management capacity.
The program ceiling on the wage bill allows for additional hiring and spending on wages in
the health sector.

•

The government affirmed its commitment to the monetary framework, anchored
by a reserve money target and geared to price stability. The authorities recognized
that only policies that contain inflation and reduce domestic debt will bring about
sustainably lower interest rates. The authorities acknowledged that any interest rate
reductions will need to be modest and measured, and they are prepared to raise rates
if the inflation target comes under threat. The RBM is committed to a flexible
exchange rate policy, consistent with the monetary framework, and supported by the
government’s commitment to prudent fiscal policies.

V. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2006/07
19.
The government’s key macroeconomic objectives for 2006/07 are largely the
same as those discussed at the second review. A bumper harvest will support a rebound in
real GDP growth to 7 percent. Prospects for falling inflation remain positive, but the target
has been increased to 8 percent because of delayed declines in urban food prices.
20.
The government met most of the indicative targets for end-September 2006.
Expenditures were broadly as allocated, and tax revenues were significantly higher than
planned. Tax revenues continued the strong performance begun in the last quarter of
2005/06, reflecting the economic recovery and continued improvements in tax
administration. An administrative delay in budget support (about US$28 million) squeezed
the monetary program, as the shortfall was only partially covered by a program adjustor. As a
result, both the targets on net foreign assets and on net domestic assets at the RBM went
unmet, though reserve money was as programmed. The delayed budget support was received
in early October.
21.
Program performance at end-December 2006 is expected to be favorable. The
monetary targets on net foreign assets and net domestic assets at the RBM are expected to be
met by a comfortable margin because of accelerated disbursements in donor program
support. However, the targets on government spending and domestic borrowing may come
under pressure owing to faster domestically financed development expenditure (notably on
roads) and spending on fertilizer.

18
A. Adjustment to Fiscal Plans
22.
Since Malawi reached the HIPC completion point, the IMF has provided the
country with 2.6 percent of its GDP (US$60 million or MK 8.4 billion) in debt relief.10
These resources were originally intended to be transferred from the RBM to the budget on a
flow basis according to the former schedule of debt service payments to the IMF; MK3.7
billion will still be transferred in 2006/07 on this basis. The remainder will be transferred to
the government this fiscal year and will be used to reduce domestic debt held by the RBM by
1.4 percent of GDP beyond the programmed domestic debt reduction. Staff supported this
revision as it will not alter expenditures substantially, though the budget should benefit from
lower domestic interest costs.
23.
Overall projections of debt service payments are in line with the budget.
However, there is the possibility that additional debt relief from the topping-up of HIPC
assistance could be delivered this fiscal year. Paris Club creditors agreed to write off all precutoff debt in October 2006, and the African Development Bank approved HIPC completion
point assistance in November.
24.
Additional resources are expected to provide scope to expand expenditure. The
strong tax revenue performance of the first fiscal quarter is projected to continue but will
likely be partially offset by weaker nontax domestic revenues. Moreover, the World Bank is
expected to provide an additional US$20 million in program support, though this will be
partially offset by reduced projections in program support from other donors. The
government has committed these extra resources to additional spending on maize, wages, and
development projects (mainly water supply). While staff is of the view that these additional
expenditures can be accommodated, given the increases in resources and relative
macroeconomic stability, it urged the authorities to safeguard the quality of development
spending.
25.
The government has changed its food security operations. In addition to using the
unexpectedly large harvest to purchase more maize for the Strategic Grain Reserve, the
government has authorized the ADMARC to finance its maize purchases for commercial
resale through off-budget borrowing. Fertilizer purchases will also be accelerated to ensure
timely delivery to farmers.
26.
The wage bill in 2006/07 has been increased by 0.1 percent of GDP starting in the
third fiscal quarter, reflecting additional hiring in the social sectors and assumed increases in
compensation for the judiciary and the National Assembly. The actual increase in salaries to

received. “Malawi—Satisfactory Assurances for the Disbursement of the Fund’s Share of Topping-Up
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” December 2006.

19
the National Assembly will depend on the recommendation of the Public Service
Remuneration Board.
27.
Spending on civil service pensions has been consistent with the new pension
formula adopted in July 2006 to protect the scheme’s long-term viability. Under the formula,
the pension bill is projected to be 1.5 percent of GDP in 2006/07 (versus 1.2 percent of GDP
in 2005/06). It should stay below 2 percent of GDP in the medium term.
28.
The outlook for the fiscal year is positive, but risky. Domestic debt is expected to
fall to 14.8 percent of GDP, 1.7 percent lower than programmed. Excluding repayments
using funds saved through IMF debt relief, domestic debt would be 16.3 percent of GDP,
broadly in line with the budget objective. The increased spending will reduce the underlying
surplus to 0.6 percent of GDP (compared with the 1.0 percent of GDP envisaged earlier).
However, the adjustment program with the World Bank has yet to be finalized, so that the
timing of the World Bank’s support remains uncertain and may be delayed until the next
fiscal year. As these resources have already been committed, such a delay could push the
fiscal-year domestic borrowing target out of reach. As a contingency, much of the increased
expenditures are planned for the fourth fiscal quarter and will be postponed to 2007/08
should external support be delayed.
B. Reducing Inflation and Restoring External Reserves
29.
Monetary policy remains geared to reducing inflation. Reserve money growth will
be reduced to offset the unanticipated monetary overhang at the end of June 2006. In recent
months, commercial bank lending to the private sector has responded to the lower LRR and
the resulting lower treasury bill yields. Indeed, by the end of September 2006, such lending
had increased 28 percent from a year ago.
30.
Inflation has dropped sharply in recent months to about 10 percent at endDecember 2006, following declines in both food and nonfood inflation. A moderation in
world oil prices, the strong agricultural crop, a projected deceleration in reserve money
growth, and continued stability in the exchange rate are expected to lower inflation below 10
percent by mid-2007. Declining inflation provides scope for interest rate reductions, and the
authorities reduced the bank rate from 25 percent to 20 percent in mid-November 2006,
prompting further declines in treasury bill rates and similar declines in commercial bank
lending as well as deposit rates. A more measured reduction in interest rates would have been
preferable, given the risk that inflationary expectations may not have been curbed. However,
in staff’s judgment, the reduction in rates is unlikely to result in a major liquidity expansion
given the low level of private sector credit and high intermediation costs.
31.
Net foreign assets at the RBM have increased steeply because of IMF debt relief.
However, gross official reserves are still low as a result of the food crisis and pressures on
the foreign exchange market earlier in fiscal year 2006, despite the recovery of tobacco

20
export receipts. The stability of the exchange rate, if continued, will provide opportunities to
build reserves to about 1.7 months of imports by the end of the fiscal year.
C. Structural Measures
32.
Building on the MGDS, the government has proposed structural measures for
inclusion under the PRGF-supported program during the remainder of 2006/07. The
government is giving a high priority to enhancing growth.
•

To ease the cost of doing business, the government plans to introduce a single
business permit and a simplified business licensing fee structure that would, among
other things, treat resident and nonresident investors equally. It will establish the
Malawi Investment and Trade Centre to provide the private sector with one-stop
services. The government will also start a review of selected commercial laws.

•

The key elements of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen financial
intermediation tentatively include enhancing financial stability, strengthening
creditor rights, increasing the availability of information in credit markets, and
reducing intermediation costs. Specific measures include passage of the Land Reform
Bill, revision of the RBM Act to give the RBM greater autonomy, legislation to
govern the microfinance sector (structural benchmark for end-June 2007), and the
introduction of commercial courts.

•

With respect to public sector enterprises, the government will continue to improve
their efficiency and financial performance by introducing clear lines of
accountability, allowing them greater operational and financial autonomy, and
introducing new procedures to ensure that government departments pay their utility
bills (see below). As a first step toward improving transparency and better monitoring
the fiscal risks, the government will compile quarterly financial reports for major
public sector enterprises and publish their audited annual financial statements
(structural benchmark for end-March 2007).

33.

The government is also emphasizing economic management capacity.

•

On the basis of the PFM action plan (structural benchmark for end-October 2006),
the government will continue phasing-in the IFMIS and will strengthen budget
comprehensiveness, internal controls and reconciliation in budget execution, and
audited financial reports. The government will also centralize the payment of utility
bills of all central government entities to prevent future utility arrears (performance
criterion for end-March 2007) and will strengthen control of the wage bill by
compiling monthly reports of payroll execution (structural benchmark for end-March
2007).

21
•

As a first step toward a comprehensive external debt management strategy, the
government will draft and issue guidelines for the entire public sector to ensure that
new borrowing is sufficiently concessional and accumulated within sustainable levels
(structural benchmark for end-June 2007). Staff suggested that these borrowing
guidelines aim for a grant element of at least 54 percent (the average since the HIPC
decision point) and that the government establish indicative limits on the annual rate
of external debt accumulation for the public sector as a whole.

•

To improve statistical reporting the government expects to complete revisions to
the national accounts and the balance of payments; it will also rebase the consumer
price index by mid-2007.

34.

Structural reforms in other areas are also under way.

•

The new travel policy, focusing on accountability and transparency, is expected to
be issued shortly (structural benchmark for end-September 2006). It aims to reduce
government travel spending from 5½ to 3 percent of total expenditure.

•

Retail petroleum product pricing and taxation arrangements are being reviewed
to ensure timely pass-through of world oil prices, while smoothing the impact of
sudden and large oil price shocks. Although the current mechanism calls for an
automatic retail price adjustment of petroleum products, adjustments have become
increasingly discretionary in recent years, with the oil import price used in the pricing
formula kept artificially low as international oil prices rose, resulting in importer
losses and foregone tax revenues. Returning to an automatic pricing mechanism and
implementing specific duties rather than ad valorem taxes would mitigate the impact
of oil price increases on retail prices.11

•

The government is tackling the fiscal risks arising from extrabudgetary
operations and has requested technical assistance from the World Bank in this area.
The Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) is being liquidated, and its assets are
being sold to settle outstanding liabilities to the Development Bank of Southern
Africa, the European Investment Bank, and other creditors. The recent appointment of
new management at the Malawi Rural Development Fund (MARDEF) and the
completion of an external audit in December should strengthen the accountability
framework and promote more regular reporting on performance.

11

Petroleum prices in Malawi are broadly in line with those in neighboring countries: at the end of 2005,
the gasoline per liter was US$1.02 in Malawi, US$1.22 in Zambia, US$0.98 in Uganda, and US$0.92 in
South Africa.

22
D. Program Risks
35.
Malawi remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including recurrent food crises,
higher world oil prices, and lower export prices. Drought would also affect hydro-electricity
generation, which supplies most of Malawi’s power generation. Besides continued
implementation of strong policies, efforts to raise external reserves could mitigate such risks.
36.
The fiscal risks identified in the recent review of the PRGF-supported program,
including potential wage bill overruns, persist. With the HIPC completion point now past,
the government will need to guard against unrealistic expectations about budget
expenditures. The government’s budgetary expenditure plans to spend resources that may not
be disbursed on a timely basis during this fiscal year, pose challenges for monetary
management. The government will need to monitor potential liabilities from the MDC,
MARDEF, and other institutions. The decision to allow ADMARC to borrow commercially
also poses fiscal risks.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Malawi is at an opportune juncture given its progress toward macroeconomic
stabilization, the delivery of debt relief, and the launch of the MGDS. To make serious
inroads into reducing poverty, Malawi must now advance an ambitious agenda of structural
reforms. In doing so, the government must stay focused on macroeconomic stability while
warding off unrealistic budget expectations because of debt relief.
38.
Macroeconomic performance in 2005/06 was broadly satisfactory, despite the
food crisis. Real GDP growth was strong, and the domestic debt/GDP ratio and non-food
inflation both fell. Malawi met most of the quantitative targets for end-June 2006, and
exchange rate management improved substantially. However, the performance criterion on
government domestic borrowing and the indicative target on discretionary government
spending were missed. As this was largely due to the food crisis, staff supports the
authorities’ request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion.
39.
Prospects for 2006/07 are favorable, but public spending pressures need to be
contained. A bumper harvest will support a rebound in GDP growth, and, although urban
food prices are declining more slowly than expected, inflation should stay in the single digits.
The fiscal outlook is positive, but risky. Supported by the use of IMF debt relief to reduce
domestic debt and additional planned program support from the World Bank, domestic debt
is now projected to decline by almost 2 percentage points of GDP more than programmed.
Fiscal performance through the first quarter of 2006/07 has been strong, but expenditure
pressures have been building, jeopardizing the end-December 2006 targets on discretionary
spending and domestic borrowing. Much will depend on the government’s efforts to contain
funding releases in the final months of 2006.

23
40.
The program faces other risks. Food security remains a problem, as Malawi is
vulnerable to weather-related shocks. In addition, Malawi faces the risk of a reversal of
recent oil price declines. There is also a risk that external financing (e.g., from the World
Bank) may be delayed until 2007/08. The government, therefore, must build external
reserves and maintain strict expenditure controls.
41.
There is an urgent need to improve Malawi’s growth. Staff commends the
authorities on their agenda for lowering the cost of doing business, enhancing access to
credit, and improving public service delivery, and welcomes their continued commitment to
improving economic management capacity, especially in public financial management.
Delays in implementing reforms should be avoided to keep poverty reduction goals on track.
42.
Higher aid and private capital flows are critical to meeting Malawi’s
development objectives. Absorbing these flows while maintaining macroeconomic stability
will be a challenge. The government must also balance calls to use these resources
immediately with the need to increase Malawi’s low external reserve coverage. Public
spending on infrastructure and social priorities also need to be effective and efficient; in this
regard, staff urged the authorities to complete the public expenditure review being
undertaken with the World Bank. Further, the government should conduct more timely
annual performance reviews of the MDGS and incorporate its findings into the budget.
43.
The authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate is welcome. Staff agrees
with the authorities that the current real exchange rate is broadly appropriate. There are no
clear signs of misalignment, as the real exchange rate has stabilized after a significant
depreciation, and competitiveness in key markets shows no signs of deterioration.
44.
On the basis of performance through end-June 2006 and in the first half of
2006/07, and the authorities’ continued commitment to program implementation, staff
recommends completion of the third review under the PRGF arrangement.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation take place within 24
months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

The implications of MDRI were incorporated before the DSA was completed and may therefore differ from the figures presented in the HIPC completion point document.
For 2002-03, relief was provided through grants in yen. From 2004 onward, debt will be written off and recorded under debt relief.
In previous staff reports, the delivery of debt relief by Paris Club creditors was presented as exceptional financing. Following the completion point, the delivery of Paris
Club debt relief through a stock operation is now reflected through a reduction in projections of amortization owing and a corresponding reduction in exceptional financing.

APPENDIX I
November 14, 2006

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato y Figaredo
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:

1.
The government of Malawi requests the completion of the third review and the fourth
disbursement under the PRGF arrangement in the amount of SDR6.68 million. In this
connection, the Government also requests the IMF Executive Board to grant a waiver for the
nonobservance of the quantitative performance criterion relating to central government
domestic borrowing for end-June 2006. The fifth disbursement will be subject to the fourth
review expected to be completed in May 2007. The sixth disbursement will be subject to the
fifth review to be completed in November 2007.
2.
The second review of the economic program supported by Malawi’s arrangement
with the Fund under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was completed on
August 30, 2006. At that time, Malawi also reached the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative and became eligible for relief under the MDRI. In the attached Supplement to the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding, we review performance in implementing the program in the fiscal year
2005/06 and the first quarter of 2006/07, and update the macroeconomic framework and
policy measures for 2006/07 as a whole. The Government of Malawi believes that
implementation of the PRGF-supported program through end-June 2006 was satisfactory.
3.
The Government of Malawi remains strongly committed to implementing the
economic program supported by the PRGF arrangement. The program outlined in the
attached MEFP presents quantitative performance and indicative targets through to the end of
June 2007. We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the supplementary MEFP,
in accordance with the agreed IMF’s policies on such consultation.

39
4.
The Government of Malawi authorizes the IMF to make this letter, the attached
supplementary MEFP, and the IMF staff report available to the public, including through the
IMF internet website.

Sincerely yours,

/s/
Goodall E. Gondwe, M.P.
Minister of Finance

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
SUPPLEMENT TO THE MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI
December 20, 2006
1.
The current memorandum supplements the policies presented in our
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of July 2005 (Country
Report No. 05/285), February 2006 (Country Report No. 06/94) and August 2006
(Country Report No. 06/445). This memorandum covers macroeconomic performance for
FY2005/06, updates policies for FY2006/07, and outlines our structural reform agenda.
2.
We welcome the IMF Executive Board’s recognition of Malawi’s continued
satisfactory performance under the PRGF arrangement during its discussion of the
second review in August 2006. We also welcome the recognition by the Executive Boards of
the IMF and the World Bank that Malawi met the conditions to reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative and to receive relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.
3.
Malawi is at an important juncture. We have made good progress in restoring
macroeconomic stability, have received significant debt relief, and have recently launched
the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). This provides Malawi with an
opportunity to advance an ambitious agenda of structural reform to enhance growth. At the
same time, we remain committed to sound macroeconomic policies and recognize that
deepening our performance in this area will require strengthening economic management
capacity.
I. UPDATE OF 2005/06
4.
Despite the severe challenges faced during 2005/06, we met most of the program
targets for end-June 2006. Largely because of unanticipated spending on food security, we
exceeded the program targets on government domestic borrowing and discretionary
government spending.
5.
Overall macroeconomic performance during 2005/06 was broadly as anticipated.
Real GDP growth was 5.3 percent, and non-food inflation fell below 13 percent. However,
overall inflation remained above 15 percent, exceeding our expectations, mainly because
urban food prices were slow to reflect the bumper harvest and were more susceptible to the
exchange rate depreciation.
6.
Domestic borrowing, our key fiscal target, was 0.3 percent of GDP, about 0.9
percentage points higher than programmed, but domestic debt nevertheless fell below
20 percent of GDP. Scaled-up food security operations, higher logistical costs related to the
purchase and distribution of maize and fertilizer, and accelerated repayment of domestic

41
arrears accounted for most of the overrun. The third-quarter overrun in the wage bill was
corrected in the fourth quarter, and for the fiscal year as a whole was comfortably within the
program target.
7.
Pressures on the foreign exchange market eased during the second half of
2005/06. In January 2006, we adopted a more flexible exchange rate policy and the resulting
depreciation—over 12 percent by early June—helped clear the backlog of external private
payment arrears by the end of July. Clearance of the backlog by end-June 2006 was delayed
by weak foreign exchange inflows following the disruptions to the tobacco auctions in May.
8.
Following the reduction in the liquidity reserve ratio (LRR) in February 2006,
we also tightened reserve money growth to reduce excess liquidity and contain inflationary
risks. By the end of June, we eliminated most of the excess liquidity, but not all of it as
intended, so that the year ended with a modest monetary overhang. Nevertheless, broad
money growth stayed largely in line with targets. As intended, lowering the LRR has eased
financial intermediation costs, raising deposit rates and marginally reducing interest rate
spreads. It also triggered lower yields on treasury bills, which have remained about 5
percentage points lower than at the start of the year.
II. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN 2006/07
9.
The government’s key macroeconomic objectives for 2006/07 are largely
unchanged from those agreed under the program. Final crop estimates have confirmed a
bumper harvest that is larger than anticipated and which will support a rebound in real GDP
growth above 8 percent in 2006 and to 6 percent in 2007. We have revised the fiscal year
outlook for overall inflation modestly upwards to about 8 percent because of a slower than
expected decline in non-food inflation.
10.
Preliminary data indicate that we met most of the indicative targets for endSeptember 2006. However, the monetary program came under pressure. Although reserve
money was on target, we missed the target on net foreign assets of the RBM, mainly because
of unexpected administrative delays in budget support (equaling about US$28 million),
which was only partially covered by a program adjustor. As a result, we also missed the
target on net domestic assets. The budget support was received in early October and we now
expect to meet the monetary as well as other targets for end-December.
A. Consolidating Debt Reduction
11.
We are committed to implementing the budget approved by Parliament in
August 2006. Preliminary data indicate that budget performance during the first quarter of
2006/07 was stronger than envisaged. Expenditures were broadly within budget, but
domestic tax revenues were substantially higher than projected. The strength in tax revenues
continues the strong performance in the last quarter of 2005/06 and reflects the rebound in
economic activity and continued improvements in tax administration.

42
12.
Projections of debt service payments net of debt relief remain broadly as
anticipated in the budget. However, there is the possibility of additional debt relief during
this fiscal year, as a result of topping up of HIPC debt assistance at the HIPC completion
point. We welcome the decision by Paris Club creditors to provide 100 percent debt relief on
pre-cutoff debt. We will approach these and other bilateral and multilateral creditors to
conclude bilateral agreements on debt relief. The debt relief from the IMF under the MDRI
was received by the RBM in September and November 2006. As envisaged, a portion will be
transferred to the budget on a flow basis according to the former schedule of debt service
payments to the IMF. In addition, the remainder will now also be transferred to the
government this fiscal year and used to pay down domestic debt.
13.
We have revised our food security operations since the budget was approved.
The unexpected size of the harvest has provided us with the opportunity to increase our
maize purchases to replenish the Strategic Grain Reserve, at an additional cost to the budget
of about MK 0.8 billion. Part of these stocks have already been released to the World Food
Program to provide humanitarian relief in areas hit by drought. In addition, to develop the
capacity of the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation to function as a
commercial entity, we have authorized it to finance its maize purchases for commercial
resale through off-budget domestic commercial borrowing. We are accelerating fertilizer
operations to ensure timely delivery during the crop cycle.
14.
The government payroll in 2006/07 is projected to be about 0.1 percent of GDP
larger than budgeted. This is due to additional hiring, primarily in health and education, as
well as additional compensation for the judiciary and the National Assembly, pending the
recommendation of the Public Service Remuneration Board. These changes will be
implemented in the second half of 2006/07.
15.
We plan to securitize a portion of the stock of domestic arrears into government
bonds with a maturity of 1 to 3 years. We expect to initiate discussions with creditors and
complete the securitization by end-June 2007.
16.
The outlook for the fiscal year as a whole remains positive. We expect the strong
revenue performance of the first quarter to continue. Furthermore, the World Bank is
planning to provide US$20 million in additional program support in the second half of the
fiscal year. This will more than offset additional spending of about MK1.6 billion during the
second half of the fiscal year. Domestic debt, excluding any securitization of domestic
arrears, is now projected to fall to 14.8 percent of GDP, about 2 percentage points lower than
programmed.
B. Reducing Inflation and Restoring External Reserves
17.
Monetary policy remains anchored by a reserve money growth target and
geared to reducing inflation. By end-September 2006, the RBM had mopped up the excess
liquidity generated by the reduction in the LRR and had brought reserve money back on

43
track. Because of the unanticipated monetary overhang at the end of June, we will constrain
reserve money growth to ensure that the money stock target for the end of June 2007 is met.
In recent months, commercial bank lending to the private sector has responded to the
reduction in the LRR, lower T-bill yields, and lower banking sector financing of the budget.
By the end of September, private sector credit had increased 28 percent over a year before on
a seasonally adjusted basis.
18.
Overall 12-month inflation has dropped sharply since June to 11.6 percent at the
end of September 2006. Inflation nevertheless remains stronger than we had projected so
that we have revised our outlook for the fiscal year upwards. Even so, the strong agricultural
crop, the moderation in world oil prices, and a projected deceleration in reserve money
growth are expected to push inflation below 10 percent. Lower inflation, if sustained,
provides the basis for lower interest rates, but any reductions will be modest and measured
and we will be prepared to raise interest rates if the inflation target comes under threat.
19.
We are committed to a flexible exchange rate policy consistent with the
monetary framework and Malawi’s low level of external reserves. Net foreign assets
increased steeply in September 2006, as a result of IMF debt relief under the MDRI.
However, gross official reserves remained low as a result of the food crisis, the disruption to
the tobacco market, and pressures on the foreign exchange market earlier this year. Restoring
our import coverage remains an important priority. The stability of the exchange rate and
modest appreciation since reaching the HIPC completion point will, if continued, provide
opportunities to build reserves. We now expect gross official reserves to rise to about 1.7
months of imports at the end of the fiscal year, up from 1.5 months at the end of June 2006.
III. STRUCTURAL MEASURES
20.
The MGDS provides the basis for the government to advance an ambitious
medium-term agenda of structural reform. Within the context of the PRGF-supported
program, we will focus our efforts on measures to enhance growth and to strengthen our
economic management capacity.
A. Enhancing Growth
21.
The MGDS emphasizes the need to improve Malawi’s weak record on output
growth by improving the environment for private sector activity. Following
consultations with the private sector and donors, we have identified five major impediments
to growth: the perception of macroeconomic instability, inadequate access to credit,
unreliable supply of power, the high costs of doing business, and the lack of skilled labor.
We have made significant strides in restoring macroeconomic stability. To address the
remaining concerns, we will, among other measures, aim to finalize a Private Sector
Development Program in early 2007, whose implementation will be supported by the World
Bank.

44
22.
Malawi ranks low on the ease of doing business and the private sector has cited the
administrative costs of dealing with public institutions as a significant burden—especially
with respect to obtaining licenses, cross-border trade, and closing businesses. We have
initiated steps to identify and implement measures to streamline procedures in these areas
(such as consolidating business licenses) during this fiscal year. To further facilitate doing
business, we are reviewing selected commercial laws in the current fiscal year.
23.
Improving access to credit is a key objective. Continued fiscal consolidation is
fundamental to this objective, as it will permit a further reduction in the government’s
domestic borrowing. In addition, we are developing a comprehensive strategy to strengthen
financial intermediation, which will be refined after the Financial Sector Assessment
Program is conducted in mid-2007. Key elements of this strategy include enhancing financial
stability, strengthening creditor rights, increasing the availability of information in credit
markets, and reducing intermediation costs. In addition, passage of the Land Reform Bill will
increase access to collateral-based lending in the rural sector. We are also revising the RBM
Act to strengthen banking supervision and, as part of a SADC initiative, to give the RBM
greater autonomy. We are considering legislation to govern the microfinance sector in order
to expand access to the financial sector for the rural poor (structural benchmark for end-June
2007). We have taken preliminary steps to introduce commercial courts to facilitate the
resolution of commercial disputes and foster a credit culture.
24.
Improving the performance of Malawi’s public sector enterprises is also key to
growth. We will continue to take steps to improve their efficiency and financial performance
by introducing clear lines of accountability for responsible ministers, the Board of Directors,
and chief executives and by allowing these enterprises greater operational and financial
autonomy and introducing better practices. As a first step toward better monitoring the fiscal
risks, we will compile quarterly financial reports for the major public sector enterprises,
including the utilities and ADMARC, and publish their audited annual financial statements
(structural benchmark for end-March 2007).
B. Building Economic Management Capacity
25.
The progress in macroeconomic management since mid-2004 has, in large part,
relied on the government taking essential steps to address an unstable macroeconomic
environment. Deepening this performance will now depend on strengthening our economic
management capacity.
26.
We have developed an action plan to strengthen public financial management
(structural benchmark for end-October 2006). On the basis of this action plan, we will
continue the phase-in of the IFMIS and will strengthen budget comprehensiveness, internal
controls and reconciliation in budget execution, and audited financial reports. We will make
use of the IFMIS to ensure that the utility bills of all central government entities are paid on a
timely basis (performance criterion for end-March 2007). In other areas, we will strengthen

45
our control of the wage bill by compiling monthly reports of payroll execution (structural
benchmark for end-March 2007)
27.
An external debt management strategy is needed to ensure that Malawi does not
return to debt distress. A comprehensive strategy will take time to put in place. As a first
step, we will develop and issue guidelines for the entire public sector to ensure that new
borrowing is sufficiently concessional and accumulated within sustainable levels (structural
benchmark for end-June 2007).
28.
Weaknesses in statistical reporting capacity impede economic management. We
are revising the national accounts and the balance of payments (with Fund technical
assistance) and expect to complete these revisions by the end of the fiscal year. We will also
strengthen the compilation of the consumer price index and aim to complete the revision of
the weights using the 2004 Integrated Household Survey by end-June 2007. We are also
improving data collection on project inflows, albeit not all donors are fully engaged.
29.
In other areas, the new travel policy focuses on accountability and transparency
(structural benchmark for end-September 2006). A circular implementing the new policy
will be issued shortly in the new year. Key elements of the policy include tighter procedures
for travel authorization, enhanced ex-post monitoring, audit and validation of travel claims.
Daily subsistence allowances have been streamlined. The new policy aims to reduce
government travel spending from about 5½ percent of total expenditure to about 3 percent.
30.
International oil prices have increased significantly in recent years and are likely
to remain high into the foreseeable future. This development represents a challenge to
which we will need to adapt. The government is therefore reviewing the pricing and taxation
arrangements for oil products. We are discussing options with industry participants to ensure
the timely pass-through of changes in world oil prices, while smoothing the impact of sudden
and large oil price shocks.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
MALAWI: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the definitions for the quantitative and structural targets
under which Malawi’s performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
arrangement will be assessed. Monitoring procedures and reporting requirements are also
specified.
2.
Coverage: The central government includes all units of government that exercise
authority over the entire economic territory. However, in contrast to the System of National
Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)
standards, nonprofit institutions that are controlled and financed by the central government
are excluded for the purposes of this memorandum. The accounts of the monetary authorities
include those of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) and the central government’s holdings
of international reserves. Monetary aggregates under the program are based on the three-bank
monetary survey.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Floor on Net Foreign Assets of the Monetary Authorities
3.
Definition of net foreign assets (NFA) of the monetary authorities: NFA of the
monetary authorities are defined as the difference between gross foreign assets and liabilities.
NFA will be valued in U.S. dollars, and monetary gold will be valued at the fixed RBM
accounting rate. The counterpart entry to the central government’s international reserve
assets will be classified as a negative entry under “net credit to central government”.
4.
Gross foreign assets of the monetary authorities, or reserve assets are defined in the
International Reserve and Foreign Currency Liquidity Guidelines for a Data Template
(Guidelines). This concept includes the following: (1) monetary gold holdings of the RBM;
(2) holdings of SDRs; (3) the reserve position in the IMF; (4) central government (treasury)
holdings with crown agents; and, (5) holdings of convertible, liquid, and unpledged claims on
non-residents, such as deposits abroad, and foreign securities. Excluded are any foreign
currency claims on residents, capital subscriptions in international institutions, assets in
nonconvertible currencies, and gross reserves that are in any way encumbered or pledged,
including, but not limited to, reserve assets used as collateral or guarantee for third-party
external liabilities. It also excludes transfers of foreign currency claims to the monetary
authorities by other institutional units in Malawi just prior to reporting dates with
accompanying reversals of such transfers soon after those dates (Guidelines, Chapter 2).
5.
Gross foreign liabilities of the monetary authorities are defined as the sum of the
following: (1) outstanding liabilities of the RBM to the IMF; and, (2) all short-term foreign

49
currency liabilities of the RBM to non-residents with an original maturity of up to, and
including, one year.
6.
Adjustment clause on net foreign assets—balance of payments support: The floor
on NFA of the monetary authorities will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount
by which the cumulative receipts from the balance of payments support are greater (less) than
the program baseline (see Table 1). The downward adjustment will be capped at US$10
million.
7.
Definition of balance of payments support: Balance of payments support includes
all grants and foreign financing that is not linked to additional budgetary expenditure.
Excluded from this definition is external project financing to fund particular activities,
including food security funding from the European Union and usage of the Tokyo-Mitsubishi
account, and loan financing from the IMF. Balance of payments support is measured as the
cumulative flow from June 30, 2005.
8.
Adjustment clause on net foreign assets—debt service payments: The floor on
NFA of the monetary authorities will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full cumulative
amount by which debt service payments to the World Bank and the ADB falls short of
(exceed) the program baseline (Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from June
30, 2006.
B. Ceiling on the Net Domestic Assets of the Reserve Bank of Malawi
9.
Definition of net domestic assets (NDA) of the RBM: NDA of the RBM is defined
as reserve money minus net foreign assets valued at the program exchange rate of MK139
per US$1. Reserve money consists of currency issued by the RBM and balances of
commercial banks accounts with the RBM. It includes required reserves held for Malawi
kwacha deposits and any other domestic currency reservable liabilities and other demand and
time deposits held with the RBM.
10.
Adjustment clause on net domestic assets—balance of payments support: The
ceiling on NDA of the RBM will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full amount by
which the cumulative flow of receipts from balance of payments support is greater (less) than
the program baseline. The upward adjustment will be capped at US$10 million. Balance of
payments support will be converted to Malawi kwacha using the program exchange rate (see
para. 7 for the definition of balance of payments support).
11.
Adjustment clause on net domestic assets—liquidity reserve requirement: The
ceiling on NDA of the RBM will be adjusted downward for a decrease in the reserve
requirement ratio, and the ceiling will be adjusted upward for an increase in the ratio. The
adjuster will be calculated as follows: (one minus the percentage of reserve assets held at the
discount houses) multiplied by (the program baseline required reserve ratio minus the new

50
required reserve ratio) multiplied by (the amount of reservable deposit liabilities in
commercial banks as at the end of the quarter prior to the change in regulation).
12.
Adjustment clause on net domestic assets—debt service payments: The ceiling on
NDA of the RBM will be adjusted downwards (upwards) by the full cumulative amount by
which debt service payments to the World Bank and the ADB falls short of (exceed) the
program baseline (Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from June 30, 2006.
Debt service payments will be converted to Malawi kwacha using the program exchange rate.
C. Ceiling on Central Government’s Domestic Borrowing
13.
Definition of central government’s domestic borrowing (CGDB): CGDB is
computed as the sum of (i) net borrowing from the RBM (including ways and means
advances, loans, holdings of local registered stocks, and holdings of treasury bills minus
deposits), (ii) net borrowing from commercial banks (including advances, holdings of local
registered stocks and holdings of treasury bills minus deposits), (iii) net borrowing from
nonbanks (including holding of local registered stocks, holdings of treasury bills, and
supplier credits minus government deposits held at the Malawi Savings Bank), and
(iv) holdings of promissory notes. The treasury bills and local registered stocks are valued at
cost rather than face value. Excluded are promissory notes issued to cover RBM’s
operational losses in 2002 and 2003. The ceiling is measured as the cumulative flow from
June 30, 2005.
14.
Definition of June 2004 domestic arrears: June 2005 domestic arrears consist of all
domestic arrears for which the obligation to pay was established on or before June 30, 2004.
15.
Definition of domestic arrears: Domestic arrears are overdue payment obligations
by central government other than external payment arrears (see section I.E.), including on
wages and salaries, pensions, transfers, domestic interest, goods and services, obligations
arising from court cases, legally established compensation claims, and payments to the
Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) for tax refunds. Payments on wages and salaries,
pensions, transfers, court established obligations, and compensations are in arrears when they
remain unpaid for more than 30 days beyond their due date. Domestic interest payments are
in arrears when the payment is not made on the due date. Payments for goods and services
are deemed to be in arrears if they have not been made within 30 days of the date of invoice,
or—if a grace period has been agreed—within the contractually agreed grace period.
16.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—balance of payments support: The ceiling on
CGDB will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full amount by which the cumulative
receipts from balance of payments support is greater (less) than the program baseline (see
para. 7 for the definition of balance of payments support). The upward adjustment will be
capped at US$10 million.

51
17.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—securitization of arrears: The ceiling on CGDB
will be adjusted upward by the full amount by which pre-2005 domestic arrears are
securitized.
18.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—cash payment of arrears: The ceiling on CGDB
will be adjusted downward by the full amount by which payments for verified pre-2005
domestic arrears are less than the program baseline. Only payments that are charged against
the Accountant General vote, and reported by the Accountant General will be recognized as
payments for pre-2005 domestic arrears.
19.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—maize revenue: The ceiling on CGDB will be
adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount by which the cumulative receipts from the
sale of commercial maize through ADMARC and deposited in the RBM maize account is
less (greater) than the program baseline (see Table 2).
20.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—donor pool account for the health SWAp: The
ceiling on CGDB will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full amount by which the
change (in kwacha) of the stock in the U.S. dollar denominated donor pool account for the
health SWAp at the RBM is larger (smaller) than the change (in kwacha) of the stock in that
account in the program baseline (Table 2). The change in stock is measured relative to the
stock as of June 30, 2005. Stocks in the account are stated with a positive sign.
21.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—National Aids Commission (NAC) accounts: The
ceiling on CGDB will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full amount by which the
change (in kwacha) of the stock in the accounts of the NAC held in the Malawi banking
system is larger (smaller) than the change (in kwacha) of the stock in those accounts in the
program baseline (Table 2). The stock of the NAC accounts will be determined on the basis
of the quarterly financial reports of the NAC. The change in stock is measured relative to the
stock as of June 30, 2005. Stocks in the accounts are stated with a positive sign.
22.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—transfer of IMF debt relief from the RBM: The
ceiling on net CGDB will be adjusted downwards (upwards) by the full amount by which the
full cumulative amount of debt relief provided by the IMF under the HIPC Initiative and the
MDRI at the HIPC completion point and transferred by the RBM to the Government of
Malawi exceeds (falls short of) the program baseline (Table 1). The cumulative amount will
be measured from June 30, 2006.
23.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—debt service payments: The ceiling on net CGDB
will be adjusted downwards (upwards) by the full cumulative amount by which debt service
payments to the World Bank and the ADB falls short of (exceed) the program baseline
(Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from June 30, 2006.

52
D. Ceiling on Central Government Wages and Salaries
24.
Definition of central government wages and salaries: Central government wages
and salaries include all payments that are classified as personnel emoluments in government
budgets and accounts, including payments on arrears of personnel emoluments and
allowances. The ceiling is measured as a cumulative flow from June 30, 2005.
25.
Adjustment clause on central government wages and salaries—donor-funded
wages and salaries in the health sector: The ceiling on central government wages and
salaries will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount of donor-funded
supplementary wages and salaries for the health sector that is greater (less) than the program
baseline (Table 2).
E. Ceiling on External Payments Arrears
26.
Definition of external payment arrears: External payment arrears consist of
external debt-service obligations (principal and interest) that have not been paid at the time
they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements, except on external debt subject to
rescheduling or restructuring. A continuous performance criterion applies on the
nonaccumulation of external payment arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by
the central government, the RBM, or other agencies on behalf of the central government or
the RBM.
F. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt
27.
Definition of nonconcessional external debt: The definition of debt, for the purpose
of the limit, is set out in Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140) of August 3, 1979, and
as amended by Decisions No. 11096-(95/100), October 25, 1995; and 12274-(00/85)
August 24, 2000. For program purposes, a short- and medium- and long-term debt is
nonconcessional if it includes a grant element less than 35 percent, as indicated in Decision
No. 11248-(96/38), April 15, 1996. The ceiling on nonconcessional debt applies to the
contracting and guaranteeing by the central government, the RBM, or other agencies on
behalf of the central government or the RBM on debt with nonresidents. The ceiling applies
to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
The ceiling is measured cumulatively from June 30, 2005.
28.
less.

Short-term debt: outstanding stock of debt with an original maturity of one year or

29.
Medium- and long-term dent: outstanding stock of debt with a maturity of more than
one year.
30.
Excluded from the limit is the use of Fund resources, and any kwacha-denominated
treasury bill and local registered stock holdings by nonresidents. Excluded from the limit are

53
also (i) debts classified as international reserve liabilities of the RBM; (ii) new debt issued to
restructure, refinance, or repay existing debt up to the amount actually used for the abovementioned purposes; (iii) normal import financing; and (iv) arrangements to pay over time
obligations arising from judicial awards to external creditors. A financing arrangement for
imports is considered to be “normal” when the credit is self-liquidating.
II.

QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Ceiling on Reserve Money

31.
Definition of reserve money: Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency
issued by the RBM and balances of commercial bank accounts with the RBM. It includes
required reserves held for kwacha deposits, other domestic currency liabilities, and other
demand and time deposits held with the RBM.
B. Ceiling on Central Government Discretionary Expenditures
32.
Definition of central government discretionary expenditures: These are defined as
all expenditures excluding (i) wages and salaries, (ii) interest payments, and (iii) foreignfinanced development expenditures (development Part I expenditures) which are related to
specific projects. Central government discretionary expenditures include statutory (i.e.,
nonvoted) expenditures for pensions and gratuities, and compensation and refunds; but
exclude tax refunds (which are treated as a negative revenue). Central government
discretionary expenditures also include other recurrent expenditures (ORT), domestically
financed development expenditures (development Part II expenditures), and net lending (if
any). Included in this definition are also recurrent expenditures and development Part II
expenditures for which cash financing is or was made available by donors. Included in
particular are all maize purchases for the Strategic Grain Reserve, purchases financed from
the Japan debt relief account, and expenditures in the health sector financed from the donor
pool account in the RBM for the health SWAp. The ceiling is measured as a cumulative flow
from June 30, 2005.
33.
Adjustment clause on central government discretionary expenditures—donorfunded central government discretionary expenditures in the health sector. The ceiling
on central government discretionary expenditures will be adjusted upward (downward) by
the full amount of donor-funded central government discretionary health sector
expenditures that is greater (less) than the program baseline (Table 2). In respect of resources
made available through the U.S. dollar-denominated donor pool account for the health SWAp
at the RBM (donor pool account), donor-funded central government discretionary
expenditures in the health sector will be deemed to have been made according to the
calculation: ‘outflows from the donor pool account to finance expenditures, expressed in
Malawi kwacha’ less ‘donor financed supplementary wages in the health sector’.

54
III.

STRUCTURAL PRIOR ACTIONS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
A. Measures Agreed Before the Third Review

34.
Travel Policy: The Ministry of Finance will develop and implement (by issuing a
circular) a travel policy that will aim to ensure accountability and control for all expenditure
on travel.
35.
PFM action plan: The Ministry of Finance will develop an action plan that
prioritizes reforms, describes existing donor support, and identifies remaining areas of need
for technical assistance in the area of public financial management.
B. Measures Agreed During the Third Review
36.
Payroll: The Ministry of Finance will produce monthly reports on the execution of
the payroll. The report will include information on the establishment, total number of
employees, entries, exits, and promotions for the central government. The report will be
produced within two weeks of the end of the month.
37.
IFMIS: The Ministry of Finance will develop a mechanism within IFMIS for
payment on a monthly basis of the utility bills of all central government entities (water,
electricity, telephones). The mechanism will be managed by the accountant general.
Implementation will be assessed by the delivery of centralized IFMIS payment receipts.
38.
Public Sector Enterprises: The Ministry of Finance will compile quarterly financial
reports of the key public sector enterprises and will publish their audited annual financial
statements. The public enterprises covered include ESCOM, the five Water Boards,
ADMARC, Air Malawi, the Malawi Postal Corporation, and the Malawi Housing
Corporation.
39.
Microfinance sector: The government will submit legislation to Cabinet governing
the microfinance sector in Malawi. The legislation will establish the capital requirements of
the microfinance institutions and provide a regulatory framework for accepting deposits and
make loans. It will also provide reporting requirements to the RBM by these institutions and
will establish the prudential norms under which these institutions will operate.
40.
External debt management guidelines: The Ministry of Finance will develop and
issue external debt management guidelines for the public sector (central government and
public sector enterprises). The document will provide guidance on the level of
concessionality at which new loans are to be contracted and the level of new borrowing. It
will also outline procedures for contracting new loans through the Ministry of Finance, the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance for assessing the terms of the loan—including its
concessionality—and the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Planning and

55
Development in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance for evaluating the costs and
benefits of the project or the use for which the loan is intended.
IV.

REPORTING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS IN THE FISCAL ACCOUNTS

41.
Operations of the National Aids Commission (NAC). Financial operations of the
NAC are included in the fiscal accounts according the NAC’s financial reports. Expenditures
are typically classified as development Part I expenditures. Government ministries and
departments that execute projects financed by NAC report these activities to NAC for
inclusion in the NAC’s financial reports.
42.
Donor pool funded expenditures in support of the Health SWAp. The
Government of Malawi has embarked on the implementation of an integrated program of
service delivery in the health sector, the health sector wide approach (Health SWAp). In
support of the Health SWAp some donors are pooling resources (the donor pool), and release
these resources through normal government procedures (i.e. recurrent budget or development
Part II budget) to the health sector. In order to manage the inflows of donor resources a U.S.
dollar-denominated account has been set up at the RBM that holds donor pool resources until
expenditures need to be financed. Donor funded expenditures for the Health SWAp from the
pooled resources will be deemed to have been made in the amount of outflows from the
donor pool account to finance expenditures (i.e., typically either to Malawi government No. 1
account in Malawi kwacha, or to pay directly for imports by the health sector). The
attribution of donor financed expenditures to personnel emoluments, other recurrent
transactions, and development Part II expenditures is made on the basis of cash flow
projections and established donor commitments to finance specific expenditures (e.g.,
supplementary wages and salaries for professional health cadres). Typically, expenditures for
other recurrent transaction are estimated as the residual of outflows less expenditures for
wages and salaries less expenditures for development Part II.
V.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

43.
Monitoring of the program requires that the information listed in the tables shown
below be reported to the IMF within the timeframe indicated in the table. The new data
requirement for a list of the backlog of import applications for foreign exchange will include
data by bank, and amounts separated by the following three categories: imports not yet
delivered, imports delivered but within the grace period, and imports delivered but outside of
the grace period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MALAWI
2006 Article IV Consultation and Third Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement
Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and Request for Waiver of
Nonobservance of Performance Criterion—Informational Annex
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Robert Corker and Michael Hadjimichael
February 2, 2007

Discussions: Discussions for the Article IV Consultations and the third review of the
three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement were held in
Lilongwe October 24–November 7, 2006. The staff met with President Bingu wa
Mutharika, Minister of Finance Goodall Gondwe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of
Malawi Victor Mbewe, and other senior government officials. The staff also met with
donors, private sector representatives, and civil society organizations. The staff team
comprised Mr. McDonald (head), Mr. Staines, Ms. Teferra (all AFR), Mr. Dalsgaard
(FAD), Mr. Tolosa (PDR), and Mr. Baunsgaard (resident representative).
PRGF arrangement: A PRGF arrangement (SDR 38.2 million, 55 percent of quota)
was approved on August 5, 2005 (Country Report 05/285), of which SDR 15.3 million
has been disbursed. Most quantitative end-June 2006 performance criteria were met, but
the authorities request a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion on
government domestic borrowing. Malawi is requesting the fourth disbursement under
the current PRGF arrangement (SDR 6.68 million). The authorities’ program for the
second half of 2006/07 (July–June) is outlined in the attached Supplement to the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
Key policy issues: Medium-term challenges are to enhance growth and improve
economic management capacity. The latter is also essential to deal with a possible
scaling-up of aid. In the short term, the government will need to manage expectations
about how much the budget can deliver in the wake of debt relief delivery.

assessments completed in 2001 and 2003. The 2006 assessment found that although the
RBM had taken steps to strengthen its operations, new vulnerabilities had emerged in
governance and financial reporting. Recommendations to mitigate the identified
weaknesses included: (i) reconstitution of the RBM board of directors, which was
dissolved in August 2005, and the subsequent reestablishment of an audit committee;
(ii) expansion of explanatory notes in the financial statements to include advances to the
government and a letter of credit financial commitments; and (iii) strengthening of the
central bank law provisions on the appointment and dismissal of board members.

MALAWI: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Contact person: Ms. Yisgedullish Amde, Tel. 202 473 2203
A. World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
1.
The Malawi CAS was approved by the Bank’s board on May 14, 2003. The gray
cover report (Report # 25906 MAI) proposed the World Bank’s strategy for Malawi for the
next three years (FY04–06), and aims to help the government to address urgent development
issues.
2.
This current CAS program is organized under three pillars: i) strengthening economic
management; ii) establishing a platform for growth; and iii) improving service delivery and
strengthening the safety net. Two ongoing projects (Financial Management Transparency and
Accountability and Privatization and Utility Reform2), and a Structural Adjustment Credit
(Fiscal Management and Accelerating Growth Project3) aim to assist Malawi in attaining the
objectives under pillar one. In addition, in response to the drought-induced emergency in
early 2005, an Emergency Recovery Grant was approved in September 2005 to support the
restoration of assets and production. To support the objectives of pillar two, the ongoing
Community Based Land Reform; Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods Road Maintenance, and
Rehabilitation; and Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Projects, well as the just-approved
Rural Infrastructure Services Project are under the base case. The World Bank also supports
Malawi’s participation in the Southern Africa Power Market Project, which contributes to the
achievement of pillar two. Core Bank interventions under pillar three include the HIV/AIDS
(MAP) Project, Third Malawi Social Action Fund Project; Secondary Education Project
(since closed in December 2005), and two new Projects, Education Sector Support Project,
and Health Sector Program with a sector-wide approach (the first SWAp in Malawi,
supplemented by a Malaria Booster Project in July 2006). Finally, Malawi also benefits from
the Bank-funded Regional Trade Facilitation Project, which contributes to poverty alleviation
through private-sector-led growth by improving access to financing for productive
transactions and cross-border trade.
3.
A new CAS will be presented to the Board on February 16, 2007 and outlines a
program of Assistance covering FY07-10 in support of implementation of the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). The Bank’s proposed assistance program is

2

request.
3

The Fiscal Management and Accelerating Growth Project was closed on June 30, 2006.

8

focused on identified MGDS priorities of agriculture and food security, infrastructure
development, combating HIV/AIDS, and governance and public sector management.
B. Financial Relations with the World Bank Group
4.
The World Bank has been active in Malawi since 1966. Total lending and grants to
Malawi from the World Bank as of January 2007 is US$2,720 million, of which
US$2,525 million has been disbursed. As of December 2007, there were 10 active projects in
Malawi with a net commitment of US$322 million and an undisbursed balance of US$170
million. Sectoral breakdown is as follows: Social Sectors at 48%, Agriculture at 22 percent,
Energy, Infrastructure, and Private Sector Transport at 22 percent, and Macro and multisectoral activities at 8%.
5.
IFC has one company in its portfolio in Malawi, National Insurance Company
(NICO) for a meager US$0.523 million in equity. Future focus will be on expanded IFC
assistance for the private sector, especially in manufacturing, mining, and tourism, areas that
Malawi has chosen as targets to reduce its dependence on agriculture.
C. Areas in Which the Bank Leads
Education and Health
6.
The Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project (US$35 million in grants) was approved in FY04.
The project supports efforts by the Government of Malawi to reduce HIV transmission and
mitigate the impact of the disease throughout Malawian society, thus also fighting the
poverty AIDS brings to families and societies. A major study of Malawi’s HIV/AIDS
problem revealed 10 important constraints that the project, scheduled to begin in 2004 and
run through 2008, will address through a range of activities, including capacity building in
public, private, and civil society organizations; educational work for prevention; and
increased support for AIDS orphans. Many of Malawi’s other development partners are also
active in this effort, pooling their funds to support this critical effort.
7.
The Health Sector Support Project for Malawi (the first project with a Sector Wide
Approach in Malawi), approved in December 2004, aims to improve the effectiveness,
efficiency, and equity of Malawi’s essential health care delivery system. The project (with
US$15 million in grants, and a supplementary Malaria Booster project of US$5 million to
strengthen the Bank’s response to Malaria, approved in July 2006), has the following three
components: Component 1. Increasing access to quality essential health services by making
the already-defined Essential Health Package (EHP) accessible to all, especially to the
poorest and most vulnerable populations, including those living in rural districts. Component
2. Increasing the number of staff available through the continuation of the six-year
emergency training plan, a concerted recruitment campaign, the financing and filling of

9

current vacancies, the use of volunteers and contractual staff, and other stop-gap staffing
strategies. Component 3. Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of both the health
system and the referral network to support EHP delivery. The supplementary Malaria
Booster project will focus on monitoring and evaluation.
8.
The Education Sector Support Project for Malawi (with US$32.2 million in grants),
approved in May 2005, provides immediate financing to support the education sector in
Malawi. The project has the following six components: Component 1. Complementing
government and donors' efforts to improve quality and expand teacher development and
training at all levels. Component 2. Improving the conditions of learning at selected
secondary schools staffed with trained teachers or newly trained teachers. Component 3.
Providing a School Health and Nutrition package to all primary schools that will include:
distribution of vitamin A and iron-folic acid to school children under 10-years-old, deworming, treatment of malaria and fever, and the promotion of good health and nutrition
practices. Component 4. Supplying basic learning materials directly to schools while
strengthening the participation of communities in school management. Component 5. The
project’s Capacity Building and Policy Development will cover: (i) national education policy
consolidation and capacity building; and (ii) support for the implementation of the
government’s decentralization policy in education. Component 6. Supporting the physical
implementation and management of fiduciary and procurement issues.
Social Protection and Community Development
9.
The Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) is a long-term, wide-ranging povertyreduction project that supports decentralization and community capacity building. The
project aims to empower individuals, households, communities, and their development
partners in the implementation of measures that can assist them in better managing the risks
associated with health, education, sanitation, water, transportation, energy and food
insecurity, and to provide support to critically vulnerable populations through a variety of
sustainable interventions. The current Project, MASAF III (US$60 million, of which US$27
million is in the form of an IDA grant) was approved in FY03. The project encourages
communities to develop social safety nets for their most vulnerable members (such as skills
training for AIDS orphans), facilitates delivery of the most needed social services, and
stimulates communities to save and invest.
Infrastructure
10.
The Integrated Infrastructure Services Project, which primarily supports rural energy
and transport needs, was approved on June 27, 2006. In addition, Water (FY07) and
Infrastructure (FY08) projects are in the pipeline. Another infrastructure project, The Road
Maintenance Project (US$30 million) was approved in FY99 and closed on June 2006 after a
successful run.

10

Private Sector
11.
Parastatal reform continues to be an urgent need in Malawi. In the past few years,
progress has been made with Bank assistance through the Privatization and Utility Reform
Project (PURP, US$28.9 million, approved in FY00). PURP aims to improve the quality of
and access to economic and physical infrastructure, especially telecommunications, water,
and power, by promoting greater private-sector involvement. .PURP was restructured to
address slow implementation issues, respond to new challenges facing the government,
incorporate lessons learned, and improve the program’s effectiveness.
12.
Malawi also participates in the Regional Trade Facilitation Project, which principally
aims to contribute to poverty alleviation through private-sector-led growth in participating
countries by improving access to financing for productive transactions and cross-border
trade. The project brings together a group of countries by setting up a credible insurance
mechanism against losses caused by political risks. The governments of these countries
would agree to be the ultimate risk takers in the insurance mechanism, thus creating a strong
disincentive to bring claims. The private market currently does not offer this type of
insurance, particularly for medium-term transactions (over one year). The project will thus
widen the scope for private sector activity by extending the maturities at which credit is
available. It will also create a more stable business environment by extending consistent and
predictable coverage. Finally, through better risk management, the project will lower the risk
premium.
Agriculture
13.
A Community-Based Rural Land Development Project (US$27 million) was
approved by the Board in April 2004. Based on positive community-level experience gained
through the MASAF projects, and in partnership with the Government and UK’s
Development agency, DFID, this project will acquire idle land and transfer it to small
farmers, thus enabling such farmers to feed their families and try to grow surpluses for
commercial sale. It is urgent that Malawi move toward a more equitable distribution of land
that will provide food security for small farmers. The recently closed Structural Adjustment
Credit, FIMAG, also supported agricultural policy reforms (see further details in paragraph
19).
14.
An Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods, and Agriculture project (US$40 million), approved
in November 2005, aims to complement other activities on the ground. The overarching
development objective of the proposed project is to raise the agricultural productivity and net
incomes of poor rural households in target districts by providing an integrated package of
support, including irrigation, agricultural/ irrigation advisory services, marketing and postharvest assets and services, and capacity building.

11

Environment
15.
Direct Bank involvement in the environment sector is currently limited to the Mulanje
Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project (US$7 million), which was approved in FY01.
The Project aims to raise awareness about conservation needs, strengthen the capacity of the
Forest Department and of local communities to carry out conservation measures, and
encourage more local community participation in managing the forest reserve. In addition,
especially within the framework of MASAF, the project promotes environmentally sound
community development initiatives and funds community resource management projects.
Poverty Monitoring
16.
The Bank has provided support with the poverty monitoring tasks identified in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as requiring technical assistance. Through the
PRSP Trust Fund, the Bank assisted the government (and specifically, the National Statistical
Office) in conducting the Second Integrated Household Survey, including design, collection,
processing, and dissemination of data covering not only household characteristics, but also
community level indicators. Following completion of the survey in 2005, a Poverty and
Vulnerability Assessment providing in-depth analysis of the new household data has been
prepare in 2006 jointly by the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development, the National
Statistical Office, and the World Bank.
D. Areas in Which the Bank and the Fund Share the Lead
Poverty Reduction Strategy
17.
The Government of Malawi finalized its first PRSP in April 2002. Following the
initial three years of implementation (which have been documented in the government’s
Annual Progress Reports) in 2006 the government carried out a comprehensive review of the
lessons learned in its implementation. Using the findings of the comprehensive review and
the information presented in the Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment, the government has
prepared its second PRSP (the “Malawi Growth and Development Strategy”) in Fall 2006. A
joint IDA-IMF staff assessment was presented to the Boards of the IMF and the Bank in
January 2007, and the Boards have subsequently endorsed the strategy. The IMF and the
Bank staffs maintained a collaborative relationship in supporting the government in the
process.
Debt Sustainability and Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative
18.
Staff of the IMF and the Bank prepared “Malawi: Completion Point Document for the
Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative,” which was presented to the
Boards of the World Bank and the IMF in August 2006. Malawi’s debt sustainability

12

outlook after HIPC assistance deteriorated substantially since the decision point as a result of
a fundamental change in Malawi’s economic circumstances due to exogenous factors.
Therefore, the Boards approved the provision of topping-up assistance at the completion
point consistent with the guidelines under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. In addition, upon
approval of the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, Malawi qualified for
additional debt relief from IDA, the IMF and the AfDF under the MDRI.
Budgetary Planning, Revenues Administration, and Public Expenditure Reforms
19.
The Bank’s assistance in improving public expenditure management has been
channeled mainly through its structural adjustment credits. The most recent one, the Fiscal
Management and Accelerating Growth (FIMAG, US$50 million) credit, which closed in
June 2006, focused on four areas: (i) strengthening public expenditure management, (ii)
privatizing state-owned enterprises, (iii) supporting small-holder agriculture and land reform,
and (iv) addressing HIV/AIDS.
20.
The Financial Management, Transparency, and Accountability Project (FIMTAP,
US$24 million, FY03) is also assisting the government with improving financial
management systems and increasing transparency. The main objective of the project is to
improve civil service and public expenditure management for better allocation and utilization
of public resources.
Civil Service and Wage Reform
21.
Following the World Bank–financed study on the review of civil service and wage
policy issues, the government has begun implementing the recommendations of the study at
the end of 2004, including streamlining the system of allowances, consolidating such
allowances in the base for personal income tax, rationalizing salary grades, and moving
towards a unified salary structure. These reforms are also supported under the IMF Staff
Monitored Program.
Emergency Assistance
22.
In addition to technical assistance and the reallocation of existing uncommitted funds
as appropriate, an Emergency Recovery Project was approved in September 2005 and closed
in December 2006. This project supported the restoration of assets and production following
the drought-induced emergency in early 2005 and thus supported the core growth strategy of
the macroeconomic program adopted by the new administration in May 2004. This
emergency grant provided funds to allow critical private sector imports that support the
restoration of assets, investment, and production to take place with minimal disruption to the
economy.

13

E. Areas in Which the Fund Leads
Macroeconomic Stability, Fiscal Policy, and Monetary Policy

Malawi is confronted with a number of macroeconomic challenges, including a
history of repeated fiscal slippages and unpredictable monetary policies, a rapidly rising level
of domestic debt, and a persistently high level of real interest rates. The Fund will work with
the authorities to master these challenges, both through financial support and technical
assistance.

MALAWI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The economic statistics show serious deficiencies that have affected program
monitoring. The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (data
ROSC), published February 17, 2005, found that, while the legal and institutional framework
for the production of macroeconomic statistics was broadly adequate, there were
shortcomings in the scope, accuracy, and reliability of data as well as scope for strengthening
the provisions of the Statistics Act. There is a need to formally assign the responsibility for
the compilation of government finance statistics to the Ministry of Finance, and
responsibility for the compilation of monetary statistics to the Reserve Bank of Malawi. The
authorities are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of economic and
financial data through participation in the GDDS. As one of fifteen countries participating in
the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African
Countries, Malawi has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework for the development of
national statistical systems. Malawi’s metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since December 2002. The Anglophone
Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)) aims
to assist participating countries to meet GDDS recommended statistical practices and to
improve the metadata. Since the original posting, the metadata of the fiscal sector and the
socio-demographic data for health and education were updated in March 2004, and those for
other sectors, in February 2005.
F. Real Sector Statistics
2.
Real sector statistics covering the national accounts, prices, and trade statistics need
substantial improvements. Only a limited set of source data is available, and quality and
timeliness should be improved. The National Statistics Office (NSO) needs additional
resources to meet, in particular, the required quality standard of national accounts. A longterm technical assistance program (2004-07) on national accounts is being provided under a
project by Statistics Norway.
National accounts
3.
The NSO is responsible for compiling the national accounts data. However, while the
final estimates are comprehensive,4 the source data underpinning these estimates are
inadequate, due to gaps in coverage, especially for medium- and small-scale establishments,
4

Covering GDP from the production side at constant prices, GDP by expenditure at current prices, gross
national income and its components, national disposable income and use of disposable income, and the capital
and financial accounts.

16

and informal sector activities. Use is not made of relevant surveys and financial statements to
prepare estimates of changes in inventories and household final consumption expenditures.
Statistical techniques for compilation are deficient, and processes to assess and validate
source, intermediate, and final data are generally limited. The framework used is largely
based on the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA) which is in need of updating to the
1993 SNA. The constant price estimates are mainly derived using an index of industrial
production (IIP) with 1984 weights, based on production data of 50 large-scale firms, and
the consumer price index. There is a recognized need to both update the weights of the IIP
and develop a producer price index to improve the constant price series. The national
accounts are published in Malawi’s Statistical Yearbook and Quarterly Statistical Bulletin
with a significant lag.
Prices
4.
A consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis. The CPI is based on the
1997/98 household survey, and data are collected on a monthly basis by regional price
collectors. The effectiveness of the index could be improved by using the geometric mean as
the elementary aggregate index formula and by applying systematic, comprehensive, and
consistent approaches to the quality adjustment of product prices.
Trade
5.
Preliminary estimates of trade are now available with a lag of two to three months.
Trade data are received electronically from six major ports. The adjustment of imports from
c.i.f. to f.o.b. prices is not appropriate and there is no reconciliation with neighboring
countries.
G. Government Finance Statistics
6.
Malawi reports some fiscal data on a cash basis to AFR. Although administrative
records are kept on a manual basis, the systems are designed to provide adequate
information. However, there are serious quality problems, including data inconsistencies, that
complicate program monitoring:
•

While tax revenue data are received in a timely fashion, it is not always possible to
reconcile them with deposits in the Malawi Government (MG) Account No. 1.

•

Nontax revenue collected by line ministries is not properly accounted for in the
fiscal reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance. It also includes capital revenue.

•

Data on recurrent expenditure suffer from serious shortcomings partly related to
insufficient bank reconciliation at the level of line ministries (between spending

17

records and financing information). The fiscal reports prepared by the Ministry of
Finance show spending based on funding data (from the Credit Ceiling Authority).
Line ministries subsequently submit spending reports to the Ministry of Finance
based on recorded expenditure. At times there are sizable discrepancies between these
two sources of data for both wages and other recurrent transactions—to some extent
reflecting the widespread practice of reallocation across budget lines.
•

Domestically-financed development expenditure is based on funding released to
line ministries, and data on externally-funded expenditure are based on reported
project grants and loans. Owing to differences in timing and financing modalities
(e.g., some donors require prefinancing of expenditure before reimbursement), there
are substantial differences between the flow of expenditure and corresponding
financing data. Thus, there are substantial errors in the reporting of capital spending.
Also, many donor projects are still not incorporated in the budget, and hence the
corresponding expenditure is not captured. Some externally funded development
expenditures are likely recurrent and, reported capital expenditure could be
overstated.

•

Data on expenditure arrears are likely incomplete, as reporting from the
Commitment Control System appears to be only partial, and ministry level data are
not consistent from report to report. Previously unknown arrears have repeatedly been
cleared through the “special activities” vote, thus calling into question the accuracy of
arrears data and the data on clearances.

•

The budget classification and chart of accounts may be adequate for some
administrative, economic, functional and program classifications. An output-oriented
activities-based budget classification (ABB) is used for the presentation of the budget.
However, pro-poor expenditures that have been protected in line with the PRSP are
only identified in the ABB classification. As no bridge table exists to map the ABB
classification into the program classification used for expenditure reporting and
accounting, pro-poor expenditures cannot be monitored.

•

Financing estimates are based on monetary and debt data, rather than on government
records of financing. Reporting on treasury bills directly issued to the RBM at times
has been slow.

7.
The authorities have received significant technical assistance from the Fund and other
donors to strengthen expenditure monitoring and reporting, accounting, and statistical
reporting, but results have lagged. The government has pledged to strengthen public financial
management and fiscal reporting, and renewed efforts are being made to establish a work
plan, including effectively utilizing donor technical assistance.

18

8.
Malawi does not report government finance data for inclusion in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International Financial Statistics (IFS). A STA
mission visited Lilongwe in August 2005 to review progress on major issues raised during
previous missions. The mission reiterated the importance of continued efforts to implement
an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), to improve the coverage
and sectorization of government financial operations and to correctly classify transactions
according to international guidelines. Although the mission assisted the authorities with the
compilation of annual fiscal data for 2003/04 in accordance with the GFSY Questionnaire,
such data were not reported for inclusion in the publication. The mission proposed, and
discussed with the authorities, a migration plan and timetable to adopt the GFSM 2001
methodology.
H. Monetary and Financial Statistics
9.
The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
to STA on a regular basis, however, the latest data available are for September 2006.
10.
The MFS mission that took place in April-May 2004 noted that significant progress
was achieved in implementing the recommendations made by the MFS mission conducted in
August-September 2002. One of the most notable achievements was the improved coverage
of the monthly monetary survey that now accounts for more than 90 percent of the banking
sector. On the other hand, the mission also noted that some important recommendations were
yet to be implemented, such as the sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification
of financial instruments to ensure that the MFS of the RBM adhere fully to the methodology
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
11.
Concurrently, the mission completed the development of an integrated database that
would be used by the RBM, STA, and AFR for publication and operational needs. The
mission also discussed the standardized forms (SRF) that are being adopted by all countries
for reporting monetary data to STA. The authorities submitted the SRF test data; however,
there has not been further progress after STA provided comments on these test data in
October 2005.
I. External Sector Statistics
12.
Concepts and definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in
broad conformity with the guidelines presented in the fourth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM4). The NSO has made progress in the transition to the methodology
of BPM5. The most recent data reported to STA for publication in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook pertains to 2002. The authorities have advised that updated information

19

will be provided following implementation of several improvements to existing methodology
and data sources. Mainly as a result of the liberalization of exchange controls, the
compilation of data relies on surveys as the source of information for major components in
the balance of payments, such as services, direct investment flows, and other financial
transactions of the private sector. Data from primary sources (surveys and/or International
Transaction Reporting System reports) are supplemented with information from secondary
data sources, such as foreign trade statistics collected by the MRA through customs
declarations, debt statistics from the MOF, net foreign assets from the RBM, and information
on grants collected from main donors.

MALAWI: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE
(AS OF JANUARY 11, 2007)

20

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 14, 2007
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report. These
developments do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
On February 12, the Malawian authorities advised staff about changes to the planned
supplementary budget that deviated in some important respects from the understandings
reached with staff and reflected in the revised program being proposed to the Board. In
staff’s view, these deviations warranted a postponement of the Board discussion to allow
staff to better understand the policies underlying the supplementary budget and to
recommend revisions to ensure that the program remains on track. A supplementary budget,
consistent with these understandings was submitted to Parliament on February 19.
The supplementary budget increases spending by about MK6 billion beyond the
expansion already proposed under the revised program. In roughly equal measure, it allows
for additional spending on foreign-financed development spending, the fertilizer subsidy
program and on generic goods and services. In the latter category, the government has
increased its contribution to health spending, partially meeting an earlier commitment made
to donors, and has increased funding for spending on utilities and rents to avoid the
accumulation of domestic arrears. As a result, the government will miss the end-June 2007
spending target under the proposed revised program in the staff report.
In other respects, the supplementary budget is consistent with the revised program. In
particular, the additional spending will be fully financed by higher foreign project financing,
tax revenue projections that have been increased to reflect the strong performance in the
second fiscal quarter, additional revenues from a revision to the fuel pricing formula
implemented in February 2007, receipts from the sale of excess fertilizer to a commercial
bank under a repurchase agreement, and savings from postponing local elections. As a result,
domestic debt repayments in 2006/07 will be consistent with the proposed revised program.
In other areas:
The Reserve Bank of Malawi reduced the liquidity reserve requirement in February
2007. This follows the reduction last February and again aims at reducing the costs of
financial intermediation. To constrain monetary growth and ward off inflationary pressures,
and as required under the program, the RBM has agreed to mop up the excess liquidity
caused by this measure.
The overall macroeconomic outlook remains positive. First round crop estimates were
recently released that suggest another bumper harvest in 2007 and which, once confirmed by
subsequent crop reports, will warrant an upward revision to the output growth projections.
12-month inflation fell below 10 percent in January 2007, benefiting from the bumper
harvest of 2006, the stability of the exchange rate and the continued moderation in
international oil prices.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 14, 2007

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under the Three-Year PRGF Arrangement
for Malawi, Approves US$10 Million Disbursement, and Grants Waiver of Nonobservance
of a Performance Criterion
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the third review of
Malawi's economic performance under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the release of SDR 6.7 million
(about US$10 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 22.0 million
(about US$33 million). The Board also granted Malawi’s request for a waiver of nonobservance
of the performance criterion on government domestic borrowing.
The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on August 5, 2005 (see Press Release
No. 05/188), for a total amount of SDR 38.2 million (about US$57.4 million) to support the
government's economic program for 2005-2007.
After the Executive Board discussion on Malawi, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Malawian authorities are to be commended for the satisfactory performance of the
economy under the PRGF-supported program, which is especially notable given the severe food
crisis experienced during 2005/06. Increased public spending on food security helped to avert a
humanitarian crisis.
“Monetary policy has been restrained and has helped to reduce inflation. Management of the
exchange rate system has improved significantly. It will be important for the authorities to
maintain their commitment to a flexible exchange rate policy to prevent a return to private
arrears on import payments and to protect Malawi’s relatively low international reserve cover.
“The program objectives for the remainder of 2006/07 are realistic. The bumper harvest should
support a rebound in output growth. The authorities’ continued commitment to reducing the
domestic debt burden will be critical for long-term fiscal sustainability and to free resources for
private sector development. The authorities will need to manage rising expectations regarding
public spending following the delivery of substantial debt relief under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in order to keep the
fiscal position sound.

“Malawi is at an opportune juncture given its progress toward macroeconomic stabilization, the
delivery of debt relief, and the launch of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS)—the new poverty reduction strategy. To make serious inroads in reducing poverty,
Malawi must now implement an ambitious agenda of structural reforms, while staying focused
on securing macroeconomic stability. The authorities have appropriately made enhancing growth
and reducing the costs of doing business the focus of the MGDS. To meet its development goals,
Malawi will need the continued support of the international community,” Mr. Kato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a PRSP. This is
intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive
framework to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of
0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Malawi
and Joseph L. Masawe, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 14, 2007

On behalf of the Malawian authorities, I take this opportunity to welcome the Board’s
discussion on the 2006 Article IV review of Malawi and third review of Malawi’s three year
PRGF arrangement with the Fund. The authorities appreciate the Fund Board’s support and
the continued engagement with the Fund management and staff in economic policy
management. They welcome the Executive Board’s recognition of the commitment of the
authorities in implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and achieving good
performance under the PRGF arrangement, and extend their sincere gratitude to the IMF
Board for approving debt relief to Malawi under the HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives. I would also like to thank management and staff for their expeditious rescheduling
of the Board discussion subsequent to the satisfactory resolution of the issue for the
postponement. I would hope that this exemplary action would set a precedent for other
similar circumstances.
The Malawian authorities remain fully committed to the economic program supported by the
PRGF arrangement and believe that the policies set forth in the memorandum of economic
and financial policies (MEFP) are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program.
Nevertheless, they stand ready to take any additional measures that may deem necessary in
the course of implementing the program. My authorities request the completion of the third
review of the economic program supported by the PRGF arrangement and a waiver of nonobservance of a performance criterion related to central government borrowing for end June
2006. The authorities have taken note of staff’s comments and recommendations in the
reports and will take all necessary measures to implement them.
Recent Economic Developments
It is noteworthy that over the past three years, government efforts have been directed towards
restoring macroeconomic stability, strengthening public financial management, improving
food security and restructuring public sector enterprises to improve the quality of service.
This policy focus has been built on previous Article IV consultations and recommendations
by the Executive Board. Over the period, real GDP growth rose from a four year average of
only 1.4 percent recorded between 1999/2000 and 2003/04 to an average of 4.4 percent
recorded between 2004/05 and 2005/06. Over the same period, end of period inflation
declined from 18.1 percent to 15.5 percent. During 2005/06, real GDP grew by 5.3 percent,
but inflation remained high at around 15 percent, despite a bumper crop. The high level of
inflation reflected the slow decline in urban food prices, mainly due to the depreciation of the
Malawi Kwacha.

2
On the fiscal front, performance during 2005/06 remained satisfactory, but the performance
criterion on government domestic borrowing was not achieved due to unanticipated food
security spending and accelerated payments to clear domestic arrears. As a result, despite the
higher than projected borrowing, domestic debt still fell below 20 percent as projected under
the program.
Monetary policy remained well focused with the floating exchange rate policy being
maintained. Consequently, over the period, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) continued to
direct its intervention in the foreign exchange market towards smoothing short term
overshooting of the exchange rate. During the second half of 2005/06, the Kwacha
depreciating by12 percent, helping the RMB clear the backlog of import payments by the end
of July 2006. Clearance of the backlog was programmed for end June 2006, but could not be
achieved, due to lower than projected foreign exchange inflows caused by disruptions in
tobacco exports.
During the period, the RBM also continued to implement measures to improve financial
intermediation. In February 2006, the RBM reduced the liquidity ratio to reduce the cost of
borrowing and stimulate credit growth to the private sector. The reduction in the liquidity
ratio triggered lower yields on treasury bills while deposit rates edged upwards, reducing
considerably, the wide spread between lending and deposit rates. On the other hand however,
this measure caused a temporary liquidity pressure in the economy, compelling the RBM to
step up liquidity mop-up operations. Despite the efforts, the year closed with a slight
monetary overhang, but with broad money growth remaining within programmed levels.
Despite the recent policy improvements and the resulting achievements, my authorities
recognize that medium term challenges remain. My authorities have included in the PRGF
supported program some medium term policy initiatives, which are basically directed
towards higher growth through the removal of major impediments to private sector growth,
deepening financial intermediation and improving the efficiency of public service delivery.
Policies for 2006/07
During 2006/07, the government will continue to pursue policies agreed under the program.
The main focus will continue to be macroeconomic stabilization and a carefully sequenced
structural reform agenda, which will seek to address administrative capacity constraints.
Within the context of the PRGF supported program, the government will primarily focus on
measures to promote growth and improve overall economic management.
In order to promote growth, the government will take measures to enhance the role of the
private sector in the economy as stated in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS). In a broader context, the measures will aim at addressing the impediments to
growth, which have already been identified as macroeconomic instability, inadequate access
to credit, unreliable sources of power, high cost of doing business and the lack of skilled

3
labor. Over the near term, my authorities expect that output growth will reach 5.5 percent,
driven mainly by a rise in gross investment.
Fiscal Policy
During the remaining period of 2006/07, the authorities will continue implementing the
budget as approved by the parliament in August 2006. My authorities will take the advantage
of the increasing level of economic activity coupled with improvements in tax administration
to step up revenue collection. So far, the performance of the budget has been satisfactory.
Reliable information shows that by the end of the first quarter, domestic revenue collection
was higher than projected, while expenditures were within programmed levels. It was with
the intention of investing the anticipated revenue surplus for development that the authorities
drafted a larger supplemental budget than programmed. The authorities have now, in light of
discussion with staff, submitted a revised supplemental budget which is being discussed in
parliament.
Over the medium term, my authorities will take measures to further consolidate domestic
debt and free resources to the private sector. The objective is to attain a reduction of domestic
debt to around 10 percent of GDP. This is also expected to provide more fiscal space for
poverty related spending. My authorities express their sincere appreciation to the Paris Club
for providing 100 percent debt cancellation to Malawi and also to the international
community for the relief under the MDRI. My authorities will ensure that the savings as well
as additional resources arising form these initiatives will be properly incorporated in the
budget for pro-poor spending. The government has developed an action plan to strengthen
public financial management, which will facilitate the phasing in of IFMIS and strengthen
budget management. On the other hand, as a first step, my authorities will develop and issue
guidelines for new borrowing to all ministries that will emphasize concessional and
sustainable borrowing.
Monetary Policy
My authorities will, through the RBM, continue to implement prudent monetary policy,
geared towards reducing inflation. The recent lowering of the liquidity ratio has provided
positive results in the cost of borrowing and consequent increase in credit to the private
sector. Overall annual rate of inflation has dropped significantly to only 11.6 percent in
September 2006. Although still higher than projected, the declining inflation is expected to
provide additional scope for interest rate reductions and higher returns on investment.
Malawi remains committed to a flexible exchange rate regime which is consistent with the
current monetary policy framework and the authorities’ objective of building reserves. My
authorities recognize that Malawi remains vulnerable to external shocks, especially due
unreliable weather conditions, and will therefore strengthen its external reserves position to
insulate the economy from adverse effects arising from such shocks.

4
Structural Measures
The government will continue to implement measures directed towards promoting growth as
set out in the MGDS. My authorities will, over the coming fiscal year, finalize a Private
Sector Development Program. In this connection, efforts will be stepped to ensure that
administrative costs of dealing with public institutions, which have imposed significant
burden on investors, thereby labeling Malawi as a country with high costs of doing business,
are minimized. My authorities are restructuring the Agricultural Development and Marketing
Corporation (ADMARC) to make more efficient and financially sound and have finalized the
Land Reform Bill to facilitate enhanced credit growth to the private sector.
My authorities are committed to measures aimed at deepening the financial sector. A
comprehensive strategy to strengthen financial intermediation through improved supervisory
capacity, enhanced creditor rights and development of a creditor information system will be
completed soon. The government will also initiate a revision of the RBM Act in line with the
SADC initiative, to provide for more independence and accountability. Given that the
majority of the Malawian population is small scale borrowers, the government will step up
measures to develop microfinance institutions, which will spearhead the expansion of credit
to the rural poor.
My authorities recognize that an efficient public sector is vital to growth. In this regard,
measures to improve the efficiency and financial viability of public institutions will be
stepped up, especially through the introduction of more accountability.
Finally, I would like to assure you that my authorities will continue to take measures aimed
at strengthening Malawi’s statistical base, given the importance of reliable data to economic
management. They are currently reviewing the national accounts and balance of payments
statistics with the assistance of the Fund and also intend to take measures to strengthen the
compilation of consumer price index.
Conclusion
The Malawian authorities remain committed to measures agreed with the Fund under the
PRGF supported economic program. During the review period the implementation of the
program has been in line with the objectives and targets, despite that the economy remains
vulnerable to exogenous shocks. GDP has remained fairly impressive and inflation has
continued to decline.
Going forward, my authorities will continue to take measures to ensure the success of the
program. Reducing poverty remains the major objective of government’s medium term
policy, and hence the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy will continue
to be supportive to the structural reform agenda, while ensuring that revenue is enhanced and
expenditure is streamlined. The authorities will ensure that inflation is further brought down

5
and the financial system is more supportive to economic activity and resilient to shocks. In
this connection, measures to strengthen and deepen financial markets will continue to be
implemented.
We look forward to the authorities reaching agreement with Malawi’s other bilateral
creditors for debt relief similar to Paris Club terms, so that the benefits of the HIPC initiative
are fully realized. My authorities trust that they will continue to enjoy the support and
encouragement of the Fund in this endeavor. On the basis of the good performance during the
period under review and the strong measures to be implemented during the remaining period
of the fiscal year, my authorities request the completion of the third review under PRGF
arrangement.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Malawi
On March 14, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Malawi.1
Background
Malawi is at a critical juncture following its progress on macroeconomic stability,
attainment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in August
2006, and the recent launch of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy, which
outlines an ambitious agenda of structural reform to enhance growth and reduce
poverty.
The Article IV discussions focused on the three key challenges facing Malawi over the
medium term, which frame macroeconomic policy over the near term. The three
challenges that need to be addressed include raising growth rates, improving economic
management capacity, and managing a possible scaling up of external aid. Malawi also
needs a large increase in external private capital and aid flows to finance its mediumterm development goals.
Malawi’s macroeconomic performance has improved for the past two years. This
follows a prolonged period of weak policy implementation, aggravated by drought and
deteriorating terms of trade that resulted in anemic growth, a domestic debt spiral,
accelerating inflation, and dwindling external reserves. Over the previous five years,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Malawi experienced per capita output growth that was on average negative. By the end
of the fiscal year 2003/04, domestic debt had reached almost 25 percent of GDP and
domestic interest costs consumed almost a quarter of the budget. Official external
reserves had fallen below one month of imports.
In 2005/06, Malawi continued to make progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic
environment and economic policy implementation was broadly satisfactory. Real GDP
growth reached 5.3 percent, while overall inflation was around 15 percent. Overall fiscal
performance was satisfactory given the food crisis. Domestic borrowing was larger than
programmed, largely because of unanticipated food security spending and accelerated
repayments of domestic arrears, but domestic debt still fell below 20 percent of GDP.
The Reserve Bank of Malawi pegged the exchange rate through the second half of
2005, resulting in a shortage of external reserves and unpaid private external arrears,
but instituted a more flexible exchange rate policy in January 2006. The resulting
depreciation helped clear the private external arrears by the end of July, despite weak
foreign exchange inflows following the May disruptions to the tobacco auctions.
Following the February reduction in the liquidity reserve ratio, the authorities tightened
reserve money growth to reduce excess liquidity and contain inflationary risks. The
mop-up, however, was incomplete, and the fiscal year ended with a modest monetary
overhang—though broad money stayed on target. As intended, lowering the reserve
ratio eased financial intermediation costs, raising deposit rates and reducing interest
rate spreads.
The government’s keyeconomic objectives for 2006/07 are largely the same as those
presented in the budget. A bumper harvest will support a rebound in real GDP growth to
7 percent, prospects for inflation falling below 10 percent remain positive, and official
external reserves are expected to rise to 1.7 months of imports. Macroeconomic
performance in the first fiscal quarter of 2006/07 was broadly satisfactory, though a
delay in donor budget support put the monetary program under pressure. The
government has adjusted its fiscal program for 2006/07. IMF debt relief under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative will now be used to reduce domestic debt this year,
though this should not affect planned expenditures substantially. The government has
increased planned expenditures on maize purchases, wages and development projects,
because of an increase in projected tax revenues and budget support.
The key medium-term macroeconomic objective is to consolidate macroeconomic
stability—reducing domestic debt and inflation—to lay the foundation for higher growth
and poverty reduction. The outlook assumes that the economy becomes less prone to
external shocks and that the costs of doing business decline. It is cautiously based on
current information concerning aid commitments. Output growth could be high because
of the scope for catch-up from recent years and prospects of increased investment.
Further reduction of domestic debt to below 10 percent of GDP is the key fiscal
objective, as this would free resources for the private sector. Higher aid flows and lower
domestic interest costs would also allow higher priority spending.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Malawi’s satisfactory macroeconomic performance
under its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility-supported program, notwithstanding
the pressures arising from the food crisis of 2005/06, which was eased by additional
spending on food security. The economic prospects for 2006/07 are favorable, and the
recent bumper harvest should support a rebound in growth and a reduction in inflation.
Nevertheless, Malawi’s economy remains vulnerable to weather-related shocks,
dependence on external budget support, and volatile world oil prices. Directors
encouraged the authorities to maintain fiscal discipline and strengthen the level of
external reserves to provide a cushion against shocks, while protecting pro-poor
spending.
Directors considered that the delivery of debt relief and the launch of the Malawi Growth
and Development Strategy (MGDS) position Malawi well to make faster progress
toward macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. At the same time, rising
expectations of spending on infrastructure and social priorities stemming from the
granting of debt relief need to be contained, and measures taken to ensure that all
public spending is efficient and effective. In that connection, Directors urged the
authorities to complete the public expenditure review being undertaken with the World
Bank, and incorporate the findings of annual performance reviews of the MGDS into the
budget. They also called for a reduction in the domestic debt burden, which will help
promote long-term fiscal sustainability, lower interest costs to the budget, and make
room for larger poverty-reducing, health care, and education spending.
Directors observed that higher aid and private capital flows will be critical to meeting
Malawi’s development objectives, but that absorbing these flows while maintaining
prudent monetary and fiscal policies will be a challenge. Against that background, an
appropriate balance needs to be struck between using these resources immediately
and setting some aside as reserves until they can be used efficiently. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to improving governance and economic
management capacity, especially public financial management.
Directors welcomed the improvement in the management of the exchange rate system,
and the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime. The current level of
the real exchange rate appears to be broadly appropriate.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen financial intermediation,
which is a prerequisite for private sector growth. Improving the regulatory framework,
better protecting creditor rights, and encouraging greater competition in the financial
sector should be important elements of the authorities’ strategy in this regard. Directors
looked forward to the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program to
be completed later in the year.

4

Directors supported the authorities’ medium-term emphasis on improving Malawi’s
growth potential while maintaining macroeconomic stability. At the same time, an
ambitious agenda of structural reforms needs to be implemented rapidly if serious
inroads are to be made in reducing poverty. In this vein, the cost of doing business
needs to be lowered, access to credit enhanced, and the delivery of public services
improved.
